Full text:   I write about economics for a living. Part of my job is to look into the maw of economic data, financial market indicators, anecdotal reports from businesses and whatever else I can get my hands on, and turn it all into a crisp, clear narrative about the United States and global economies.
But right now I'm stuck. I have no idea how the United States economy is doing. And the closer I look at the data, the more contradictory it looks.
A strong case could be made that it is in its most vulnerable spot in years, at risk of a new recession amid a global slowdown. The market for many types of risky bonds is in disarray, and "the dangers facing the global economy are more severe than at any time since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008," the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers wrote recently.
There is also a strong case that the United States economy is robust enough to withstand whatever challenges might arise from overseas, and that the evidence of a slowdown is scattered and overstated. Fewer people have filed for unemployment insurance in recent weekly readings, for example, than any time since 1973.
I've tried several times in the last few weeks to convince myself that one of those stories is correct, but just can't decide between them. And because The New York Times is not fond of headlines that include the "shruggie" emoticon (for the uninitiated, that would be ¯\_([KATAKANA LETTER TU])_/¯), I have held off writing anything.
Why am I telling you all this? Because sometimes the most accurate portrayal of a situation revolves around uncertainty -- and because we journalists aren't always honest about that. This is my effort to be a little more honest.
Rather than picking an analytical case and pretending to be more certain than I am, I want to walk readers through the conflicting evidence. Below, I do so in the form of the debate that has been playing out within my own head -- and, very likely, around conference tables at every economic research group and central bank you can think of.
It sure feels as if we're on the verge of something bad. The expansion is six years old, making it already the fourth-longest since World War II. If the economy does soften, the Federal Reserve is out of ammunition to do much of anything about it. This feels a little like late 2000, when there were signs the economy was losing momentum even though growth was still technically positive. Then in 2001 there was a mild recession.
Whoa, not so fast. Back then there was a huge correction in the stock market and downturn in business investment that caused the recession. What are the sectors that you see correcting in 2015 or 2016 that put the economy at that much risk?
Emerging markets, especially China? They've had years of huge capital inflows, in no small part because of Fed policies, that papered over longer-term problems. Now the capital is flowing in the other direction, and the correction is looking to be vicious.
Sure, but why would that cause anything more than modest ripples for the United States economy? Total exports to China were $124 billion last year, about 0.7 percent of United States G.D.P. And I know you're going to mention financial linkages, but it's not as if American banks are sitting on a ton of Chinese government debt. Even if things get worse in emerging markets, isn't this more like 1998, when an emerging markets crisis enveloped East Asia and Russia? As a reminder, the United States economy grew 4.7 percent in 1999, faster than in the preceding 15 years.
Yeah, but there's no doubt that the financial markets, including in the United States, have been flashing warning signs since this summer.
Sure, markets have been jumpy lately. But when you step back and take a bit of a long view, is it really anything to sweat about? The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was actually up very slightly for the year at Monday's close (up 0.6 percent, to be precise). Long-term Treasury bond rates have fallen a good bit since the summer but are still higher than they were back in the spring, meaning that the bond market isn't exactly panicking.
Maybe Wall Street is just whining because after five years in which asset prices soared much more than the real economy, markets are taking a breather while the rest of the economy catches up?
Maybe, but there are some cracks showing in the data on the real economy too. The last couple of jobs reports have been really bad! This month the data on retail sales and surveys of businesses have shown the same kind of softness. Maybe the economy is like Wile E. Coyote running off the cliff, and as soon as we look down we'll see it was all a mirage and fall.
Come on, that's not how the economy works.
For the economy to fall into recession, something has to cause it. A financial crisis that freezes up the credit system, tight monetary policy intended to fend off inflation, a collapse in the stock market, something. Recessions don't just happen for no particular reason.
It's true that the economy is starting to feel an impact of the strong dollar (resulting in weaker exports) and cheaper oil (which means less oil and gas exploration). But we've seen soft patches like this many times before. For example, job growth has been really weak the last couple of months, but it was about equally weak in June and July of 2013, and nobody even remembers that soft patch.
And if you look at the broadest measures of the economy, there's not much sign of a downturn at all. For example, over the first nine months of 2015, United States gross domestic product rose at about a 2 percent annual rate, including a 1.5 percent third-quarter pace reported Thursday, broadly similar to the last several years. This could just be a case where people are freaked out by the market moves and are straining to discern a downshift in the economy that isn't really there.
Yeah, but look at all the anxiety we're hearing this earnings season. Big, stalwart companies like Caterpillar and Walmart have downgraded their forecasts. Surely those are the canaries in the recessionary coal mine.
There you go with the clichés again. When you look a little more closely at some of these disappointing forecasts, what they're really telling us about the state of the economy is far more ambiguous.
Take Caterpillar. Yes, it slashed its revenue forecast for 2015 and said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the next three years. But the major reason is the downturn in mining and energy exploration because of cheaper oil and other commodities. Obviously, it's too bad for those people who will lose their jobs, but the flip side is cheaper gasoline and other fuels for American consumers, which is an economic boost.
The story out of Walmart is even more promising for the economy. Sure, the company's stock dropped 10 percent in a single day two weeks ago as it downgraded its earnings projections. But look at why it downgraded those projections -- because it is investing more to upgrade its stores, and paying its workers more, both of which will weigh on profits.
We've had years in which the problem in the economy has been companies that won't invest and workers who aren't getting pay raises. Walmart's earnings are suffering because of the opposite! That's good news for the economy, even if it's bad news for Walmart shareholders.
O.K., Pollyanna, anything out there that does make you nervous?
Oh, sure. The drop in stock prices and rise in borrowing costs for riskier companies means that capital is more expensive, and the dollar keeps strengthening on currency markets that will keep holding things back. And if I'm wrong about any of this, the economy really does lack the shock absorbers right now that would help it: The Fed's most effective tools are pretty well spent, and there's no way a Republican Congress would even consider fiscal stimulus.
So I get being nervous, but this doesn't feel like a moment when there are huge imbalances sitting out there due for a correction.
I hope you're right. But if the 2008 crisis taught us anything, it's that trouble can spread in ways that are hard to predict, even if you think you know what's going on.
Yeah, but what happened in 2008 was a once-a-century kind of storm. If you always think that the big one is imminent, most of the time you'll turn out to be wrong.

Full text:   Appearances can be deceiving.
Even as the economy decelerated last quarter, mostly because of more cautious stockpiling by companies as economic turmoil overseas intensified, the American consumer kept right on spending. And most American businesses, in making their longer-term investment decisions, weren't far behind.
While the overall rate of growth was a decidedly lackluster 1.5 percent last quarter, according to the Commerce Department report on Thursday, spending by consumers on goods like furniture and services like health care and insurance advanced at more than twice that pace.
"The good news is that the important engine of personal consumption remains strong," said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "The headline data was slightly disappointing, but the persistent strength of personal consumption bodes well for a continued modest expansion in the U.S. economy."
The tempo of growth over the summer, which was in line with analysts' expectations, represented a marked drop from the 3.9 percent pace of expansion in the spring.
But the downshift was mostly the result of slower inventory accumulation as businesses let stockpiles of goods in warehouses and on store shelves unwind rather than making big additions as they did in the first half of 2015. Nonfarm inventories increased at half the rate they did in the second quarter, a reduction that shaved 1.44 percentage points off the overall figure for growth in the third quarter.
Business activity presented a mixed picture -- investment in equipment and intellectual property rose, but spending on structures fell, a trend experts attributed to cutbacks in the energy industry in response to the sharp decline in oil prices over the last 12 months.
In addition to buoyant consumer activity, residential investment was also healthy, a sign that the housing market, after a long period of suffering, is now providing the economy with a fresh tailwind. Government spending also provided a small kick to growth.
Stocks traded slightly lower, but bond yields ticked up, indicating that traders are once again leaning toward the view that the Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark interest rate in December.
"Outside of the inventory correction, this was a solid report," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. "It bolsters the case that we will see a bounceback in growth," he added, noting that his bank expecting a growth rate in the current quarter of about 2.5 percent.
In terms of the drag from stockpiles, "companies scaled back their expectations," Mr. Anderson said, but looking ahead to the final quarter this year, inventories "should diminish as a headwind."
Inflation also remained tame, according to the Commerce Department. The index for core consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent last quarter, well below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve.
"The combination of strong demand growth and low inflation leaves the prospect of a December rate hike in close balance," said Ryan Wang, economist at HSBC. "We see the chances as slightly better than 50 percent."
In a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the government reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 to 260,000 last week, less than expected. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which can be more reliable than the week-to-week snapshot, fell to its lowest level since 1973 and suggested that hiring should be fairly strong.
The pluses and minuses buried in the fine print of Thursday's reports on economic output and hiring highlight the contradictions that economists, Federal Reserve policy makers and ordinary consumers all have to contend with after more than six years of tepid economic growth.
Some industries -- technology, health care, finance -- are enjoying conditions that echo the booming 1990s or the housing bubble of a decade ago.
Things could not be more different, however, in areas of the economy that depend on commodity prices, like the oil and gas industry, which has been cutting jobs, reflecting a downturn in energy prices. Manufacturers that service those industries, like steel makers, have also felt a chill.
Echoing this pattern, economic conditions are best on the coasts, led by places like New York, Boston, the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Silicon Valley and the Seattle area, while broad areas of the once-thriving midsection of the country are now struggling.
"We've got a lot of folks moving into the Bay Area getting jobs, and you see the growing pains that come with that, like traffic and housing affordability," Mr. Anderson, the economist at Bank of the West, said. "The incubator is the tech sector, but it's broader-based than that."
At the same time, he said, "the decline in energy and commodities is having a detrimental effect on growth from Texas north to Minnesota."
Thursday's report is the first of three estimates the government will make, and the numbers are bound to be revised upward or downward as more data comes in.
Fed officials are still trying to determine when economic conditions will justify a long-anticipated increase in short-term interest rates, which the central bank has held near zero for nearly seven years.
On Wednesday, as expected, the Fed left rates unchanged. But officials signaled that an increase could come when they meet in mid-December, especially if economic growth and employment pick up in the fourth quarter. The Labor Department will issue two monthly reports on the job market before that meeting, with the first, for October, to be released on Nov. 6.
For the current quarter, experts are anticipating that the economy will bounce back as the drag from slower inventory-building fades. The consensus view today is for gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, to advance at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent, a little better than the overall performance of the economy since the Great Recession ended.
"The Q3 G.D.P. report was soft with respect to the headline figure, but the underlying domestic demand data was in line with the pace seen in recent quarters," said Omair Sharif, rates strategist at SG Americas Securities. "On balance, this report probably does little to change the Fed's perception that the economy continues to advance at a 'moderate' pace."

Abstract: Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted to raise rates, as he did in September. The case for raising rates hinges in part on the Fed's forecast that the economy will continue to add jobs at a healthy pace and that inflation will begin to rise more quickly. [...]some analysts argue that maintaining near-zero interest rates is now doing more harm than good by encouraging businesses to invest in things like share buybacks to lift their stock price, rather than long-term investments in equipment and developing new products.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve wants to make sure that investors understand that it could raise its benchmark interest rate in December; it just is not ready to make any promises yet.
The Fed said on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it would keep rates near zero for now, as expected, but it added an unusually explicit statement that it would consider raising rates at its final meeting of the year in mid-December.
Fed officials are struggling to decide whether the economy can tolerate higher interest rates, as growth continues to wobble along rather than power ahead on a clear upward path.
Some risks to the economy have diminished in recent weeks: Global markets have regained a measure of equanimity, and Washington has averted another fiscal policy showdown. But there are signs that domestic growth has weakened, including a slower pace of job creation.
"Everything will come down to the incoming data between now and mid-December," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said on Wednesday after the Fed revealed its latest thinking.
The Fed's message appeared to make an impression on investors who had written off the chances of a December liftoff. The yield on two-year Treasuries, which is closely tied to interest rate expectations, rose to 0.707 percent Wednesday from 0.617 percent Tuesday.
Equity indexes dropped sharply after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. but then made up the lost ground and then some. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.18 percent to 2,090.35 on the day.
The odds of a December rate increase, derived from asset prices, rose from about 1 in 3 before the meeting to about 1 in 2 by the end of the day. But some investors remained skeptical that the Fed would act, noting that it has been reliably overconfident in its economic forecasts.
"The Fed wants us to believe that it did not go in June and September, when the economy had a stronger pulse than it does now, but it is really seriously considering December," the French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. "We don't believe Chair Yellen will go along with this in the end," it continued, referring to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
The Fed's decision to delay liftoff until at least mid-December means that short-term rates will remain near zero for a seventh full year. By keeping rates so low, the Fed is encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, which it hopes will translate into faster economic growth. Raising rates, conversely, is likely to weigh on growth by increasing the cost of borrowing.
Wednesday's decision was supported by nine of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted to raise rates, as he did in September.
The looming question now is whether the Fed will raise rates at its final meeting of the year, scheduled for Dec. 15 and 16.
Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have predicted for years -- and reiterated in recent weeks -- that they expected to start raising rates in 2015.
A number of Fed officials have described the decision not to raise rates in September as a close call. Eight of the 12 regional reserve banks voted last month to increase a secondary but symbolic policy rate. And the Fed's statement highlighted the December meeting.
"In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the committee will assess progress -- both realized and expected -- toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation," the statement said. The previous Fed policy statement did not include the words "at its next meeting."
The case for raising rates hinges in part on the Fed's forecast that the economy will continue to add jobs at a healthy pace and that inflation will begin to rise more quickly. Moreover, some analysts argue that maintaining near-zero interest rates is now doing more harm than good by encouraging businesses to invest in things like share buybacks to lift their stock price, rather than long-term investments in equipment and developing new products.
Fed officials also want to raise rates slowly, to minimize economic disruptions, and starting early could help.
The rebound in financial markets after a rocky late summer has removed one obstacle from the Fed's path. In the statement issued after its previous meeting in September, the Fed said global economic and financial developments might restrain domestic growth. That language was stripped from the new statement, leaving only an acknowledgment the Fed "is monitoring global economic and financial developments."
But the Fed indicated that it was a little more worried about the domestic economy. The statement said "economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace," forgoing the present tense -- "is expanding" -- that it used in September. And the Fed specifically said that job growth, a primary focus, had weakened in recent months, although the statement added that officials expect a rebound.
"In short, Fed officials are specifically highlighting the potential for tightening as soon as the December meeting," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "They seem less worried about global headwinds but the slowing in payrolls in the last two reports has got their attention."
Inflation, however, remains weak, and Ms. Yellen is facing opposition from a small but significant minority of Fed officials -- including three of the 10 voting members of the policy committee -- who say the Fed should not move until it sees clear evidence of inflationary pressures. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, emphasized the importance of global forces in a recent speech.
"We should not take the continued strength of domestic demand growth for granted," Ms. Brainard said. "Although the outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing on net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad appear tilted to the downside."
Liberal economists and activists -- including some former Obama administration officials -- also continue to warn that raising rates in December would be a mistake because millions of Americans are still looking for jobs and there are no signs that inflation poses a threat.
New economic data in the coming weeks could determine relatively quickly whether December remains a plausible option. The government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of third-quarter growth on Thursday, followed next week by an even more important indicator, the estimate of October job growth. The Fed policy-making committee will also have the Labor Department's report on the November job market before it meets again.

Abstract: "A number of the recessions that have occurred in the past have been in situations where we have tightened too rapidly and slowed down the economy much more than we expected," Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview earlier this month.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials, wrapping up a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, are still thinking about raising the Fed's benchmark interest rate in 2015, in part because they see strategic advantages in moving earlier than necessary.
The Fed is widely expected to announce that it will continue for now to hold its benchmark rate near zero. The case for liftoff has weakened since the summer. The rest of the world is struggling and there are worrying signs of slower domestic growth.
But Fed officials are unlikely to rule out an increase at their final meeting of the year, in December, in part because they are still waiting to see whether economic growth weakened in recent months, and in part because they want to start raising rates early so they can raise them slowly.
"An advantage to beginning a little bit earlier is that we might have a more gradual path of rate increases," the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told Congress this summer. She explained that moving slowly was prudent, while moving more quickly might be disruptive.
Early does not necessarily mean December. Analysts and investors increasingly are betting the Fed will not move until next year. Economists, including several former Obama administration appointees, say the Fed should not move this year, and a small but significant minority of Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they, too, are not yet ready to start raising interest rates.
Early does mean, however, that the Fed eventually plans to curtail its stimulus campaign even if the economy might still benefit from a little more help. By holding rates near zero since December 2008, the Fed has encouraged borrowing and risk-taking, stimulating economic activity that has helped to increase job growth. Raising rates will begin to weigh on the pace of growth.
Monetary policy makers and academics have long debated the value of moving early and slowly.
Central banks, including the Fed, typically raise and lower rates in small steps, at regular intervals, over long periods of time. The Fed, for example, raised rates by exactly 0.25 percentage point at each of its scheduled meetings from June 2004 to June 2006.
The result is that monetary policy often changes more slowly than economic conditions, particularly during periods of turbulence, opening a gap between the actual level of interest rates and the level recommended by economic theories and policy rules.
Some economists have argued that the Fed could have constrained financial speculation by raising rates more quickly during the last decade, perhaps limiting the scope of the 2008 crisis. Similarly, the Fed has been criticized for cutting rates too slowly during the crisis. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, said in his recent memoir that the Fed sometimes should have moved more quickly.
Policy makers often cite uncertainty as the most obvious justification for these lags.
"A number of the recessions that have occurred in the past have been in situations where we have tightened too rapidly and slowed down the economy much more than we expected," Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview earlier this month. "I'm a little more concerned than maybe some academics that we have enough certainty about how the economy works or how monetary policy works that we can move in large increments and be confident that we won't end up slowing down the economy much more than we expected."
Policy makers also have an aversion to disrupting financial markets. Fed officials cited market volatility as a reason they decided not to raise rates in September.
Mr. Rosengren noted that academic models tend to assume markets adjust rationally and smoothly to changes in Fed policy. History tells a different story, and Mr. Rosengren said there was particular reason for caution in raising rates from near zero for the first time since December 2008.
"Particularly after being at the zero lower bound for a long time, I think moving in large discrete amounts would be a risky strategy," Mr. Rosengren said.
Other academics argue the Fed should cultivate a higher tolerance for market volatility. Jeremy Stein, a Harvard economist and former Fed governor, wrote in a June paper that moving slowly to maintain market calm was often ineffective because investors assume that the central bank eventually will need to compensate by raising rates more quickly. "Society would be better off appointing a central banker who cares less about the bond market," he wrote.
Central bankers also like to move slowly because they prize predictability. The Fed, like other central banks, increasingly has focused on managing expectations about the evolution of interest rates, because those expectations shape borrowing and investment decisions. People do not just care about the level of rates right now; they also care where rates are likely to be next year.
And moving slowly reduces the chances the Fed would need to reverse course abruptly. The focus on the longer term also lets the Fed exert significant influence on economic conditions without adjusting current rates sharply, by shifting expectations about future rates.
"What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-term interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public," Ms. Yellen said in September.
Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University economist and a former Fed governor, has sat on both sides of the divide between academics and practitioners of monetary policy. He said there was theoretically a clear case for the Fed to wait until tangible signs of inflationary pressure emerge. Practically, however, he said the Fed might need to raise rates before then, at least once, just to demonstrate to investors that it is willing and able to do so.
"From a pure monetary policy viewpoint, it's completely reasonable for the Fed to keep rates at zero and not move for a long time," he said. "But one of the problems that Janet faces is that people in the markets think that she's very dovish and that she won't do the hard things she needs to when inflation goes up. So there's a perception issue that the Fed will never pull the trigger." He added, however, that he saw little reason to do it in December.
Mr. Mishkin said the Fed should abandon its earlier predictions and wait. "If they did move by the end of this year," he said, "it's an indication that they really are focused on dates rather than data."

Abstract: The budget agreement reached by congressional leaders and the White House this week will prevent a sharp increase in Medicare premiums for more than 15 million older Americans and a deep cut in Social Security benefits for nine million disabled workers, but it will not alter the long-term financial outlook for either program, lawmakers and budget experts said Tuesday.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The budget agreement reached by congressional leaders and the White House this week will prevent a sharp increase in Medicare premiums for more than 15 million older Americans and a deep cut in Social Security benefits for nine million disabled workers, but it will not alter the long-term financial outlook for either program, lawmakers and budget experts said Tuesday.
AARP, a lobby for older Americans, praised the agreement on Tuesday, though it said the legislation "will not provide a long-term solution to the funding challenge facing the Social Security disability insurance trust fund."
Without action by Congress, some Medicare beneficiaries were facing an increase of more than 50 percent in their standard monthly premiums, to about $159, from the current amount of a little less than $105.
Instead, if the budget agreement is approved by Congress, the basic Medicare premium would rise in January to $120 a month for about 30 percent of beneficiaries. The annual deductible, now $147, would increase to about $167 for all beneficiaries, rather than the $223 projected under current law.
About 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will not see any increase in their Medicare premiums next year because of a provision of federal law that links premiums to Social Security benefits, which will be frozen in 2016 after a year of unusually low inflation -- a byproduct of plummeting gasoline prices. For the third time in 40 years, Social Security will not provide a cost-of-living adjustment in benefits next year.
To make up for the fact that most Medicare beneficiaries will not pay higher premiums next year, the Treasury will provide an infusion of general revenue to Part B of Medicare, which covers doctors' services, outpatient hospital services and some home health care.
To repay the loan from the Treasury, Medicare beneficiaries will have to pay $3 a month more in premiums over about five years, until 2021.
"This is a creative solution to smooth out increases in Medicare premiums and deductibles without having a major impact on seniors in any given year," said Patricia H. Neuman, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization.
"It helps soften the blow for seniors who would otherwise have seen unprecedented increases in premiums and deductibles," Ms. Neuman said. "They will still have increases, but much smaller than seniors would have seen without this deal."
The big increases in premiums under current law would have hit certain high-income people, beneficiaries who are new to Medicare in 2016 and those who do not receive Social Security checks. Under existing law, states would have borne much of the cost because they help pay premiums for low-income people eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.
The budget agreement also provides relief to nine million workers and more than 1.7 million children who receive Social Security disability benefits.
The trustees of Social Security, including three cabinet secretaries, said in July that the disability trust fund would be depleted in the last quarter of 2016. After that, they said, benefits would automatically be cut by 19 percent because revenue, from payroll taxes, would cover only 81 percent of scheduled benefits.
The budget agreement averts that cut by temporarily reallocating Social Security payroll tax revenue from the trust fund for retired workers -- $124 billion over three years -- to the trust fund that pays disability benefits. The reallocation would not change the overall payroll tax rate but would allow Social Security to pay the full amount of disability benefits until 2022.
The bipartisan bill includes several provisions intended to reduce fraud in Social Security programs. For example, it would define a new felony, conspiracy to commit Social Security fraud, punishable by up to five years in prison and fines up to $250,000.
The bill would also require that initial decisions on disability claims include reviews by a medical doctor or a psychologist. Such experts do not always participate now.
Speaker John A. Boehner said the package was "the first significant reform to Social Security since 1983 and would result in $168 billion in long-term savings." The estimated savings accumulate over 75 years.
Nancy J. Altman, the president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group that favors expansion of the program, said: "On a number of occasions in the past, Congress has reallocated money between the disability and old-age trust funds as a routine part of its responsibility, without attaching strings to the legislation. But this time, Republicans refused to pass a clean reallocation and insisted on changes in the disability insurance program."
The budget agreement would save $9 billion over 10 years by limiting what hospitals can charge Medicare for the services of doctors whose practices they purchase in the future. In recent years, many hospitals have bought physicians' practices and then billed Medicare at the higher rates allowed for hospital outpatient clinics.
The bill would also require manufacturers of generic drugs to provide deeper discounts to Medicaid if the prices of such drugs increase faster than inflation.

Abstract: Last year, he put forth an "opportunity grant," a block grant to replace just about everything else the federal government provides lower-income people -- not just the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, but also food stamps, housing assistance and energy aid -- into one dollop of money. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it has lost more than a third of its buying power.

Full text:   Arizona, where I was born, in July became the first state to cut poor families' access to welfare assistance to a maximum of 12 months over a lifetime. That's a fifth of the time allowed under federal law, and means that 5,000 more people will lose their benefits by next June.
This is only the latest tightening of the screws in Arizona. Last year, about 29,000 poor families received benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, 16,000 fewer than in 2005. In 2009, in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Depression of the 1930s, benefits were cut by 20 percent.
And if Paul Ryan, the Republican lawmaker from Wisconsin who is expected to become speaker of the House, has his way, poor people in many other states can expect similar treatment in the years ahead.
A bit of history is necessary to understand how we reached this point. Two decades ago, when the Clinton administration agreed with a Republican-controlled Congress to "end welfare as we know it," Washington replaced the poor's entitlement to aid from the federal government with a fixed block grant to states.
The states were given great flexibility about how to spend the money and a powerful incentive not to give it to the needy. And for all the initial enthusiasm for the idea, welfare reform has fallen far short of the claims of its supporters.
Nonetheless, the block grant approach has emerged as the central plank of the Republican strategy to confront America's intractable poverty. The party's main presidential candidates have woven poverty and inequality into their campaign speeches. Nearly all of them are expected to show up in January at the Republican poverty summit meeting in Columbia, S.C., organized by Mr. Ryan, who has laid out detailed plans to overhaul what remains of the American social safety net.
Mr. Ryan has proposed to turn Medicaid into a block grant to the states. Last year, he put forth an "opportunity grant," a block grant to replace just about everything else the federal government provides lower-income people -- not just the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, known as TANF, but also food stamps, housing assistance and energy aid -- into one dollop of money. The main exceptions would be Social Security and the earned-income tax credit.
For all the talk about creating opportunity for the poor, and how ill-served they are by the current mix of government programs, it's hard to view these plans as anything but a bald effort to save money.
But don't just take my word for it. Take it instead from Peter Germanis, one of the White House advisers who help write President Ronald Reagan's welfare reform proposal of 1986, called "Up From Dependency." He has been affiliated with the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, both conservative advocacy and research organizations in Washington.
Over the summer, Mr. Germanis published a startling confession. Writing "as a citizen and in my capacity as a conservative welfare expert," he apologized for whatever role he may have had in the welfare reform enacted in 1996.
"To the extent that anything I ever wrote contributed to the creation of TANF or any block grant, I am sorry," he wrote. "As I hope to demonstrate in this paper, a block grant for a safety net program is bad public policy."
And he does. Among the easier charges to make against the Needy Families block grant is that it was not meant to adjust for inflation. It was $16.5 billion two decades ago; it is $16.5 billion today. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it has lost more than a third of its buying power.
What's more, states were given both incentives and tools to redeploy the money to other priorities. Notably, they could get around the requirement to meet job participation benchmarks simply by reducing the caseloads of beneficiaries -- almost a direct instruction to bump people off.
"States did not uphold their end of the bargain," said Ron Haskins, an expert on welfare who worked for more than a decade for House Republicans. "So why do something like this again?"
Arizona is a prime example of what has happened in states where Republicans rule. By now, only about nine out of every 100 poor families benefit from the cash welfare program, down from 55 percent two decades ago. This has nothing to do with the program's objective of helping poor adults with children escape the stigma of welfare and get a job, still the best antipoverty tool there is. Arizona simply needed the money for something else.
Specifically, as noted in a report by researchers at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute for Public Policy, the state, facing a huge jump in the number of neglected children put in foster care, needed more money to "plug state budget gaps and to fund child protection, foster care and adoption services." Rather than ask state taxpayers to help fill the gap, lawmakers took it from the pockets of poor people.
On average, states use only about a half of their funds under the TANF program to fund its core objectives: Provide the poor with cash aid or child care, or help connect them to jobs.
Ending the poor's entitlement to government aid is counted as a success because it has reduced the rolls of people on welfare. But that is not the same as helping the poor get a job, overcome dependency and climb out of poverty. Welfare was essentially made irrelevant to the lives of the poor. It is meager yet increasingly difficult to get.
Today only 26 percent of families with children in poverty receive welfare cash assistance. This is down from 68 percent two decades ago.
And it's not as though there are no more poor people in America. In 2012, one out of five households receiving food stamps reported no other source of income. Millions more scrape by on modest assistance and low-paying jobs. But by making the poor almost exclusively the responsibility of the states, our national politicians can claim the problem has been solved.
This is what's most worrying about the block grant strategy to address the bane of poverty: It allows the assistance to wither while poverty survives.

Full text:   IF Ben S. Bernanke were to write a sequel to his recently published memoir, "The Courage to Act," he might well want to call it "The Courage Not to Act."
For that's what the Federal Reserve needs at its rate-setting meeting today and at least some of those to follow -- the fortitude to resist the mounting pressure to raise interest rates from their near-zero level.
To a significant clutch of Fed policy makers and the perennial chorus of inflation worriers have been added new voices, ranging from emerging-market countries feeling "Fed fatigue" as their currencies gyrate with each round of speculation to leading businessmen to presidential hopefuls like Donald J. Trump.
"She should raise rates," the property mogul Barry Sternlicht said recently on "Bloomberg Go," referring to the current Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. "Absolutely she should raise rates and return the markets to some semblance of normalcy."
Happily, two central bank governors -- Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo -- have begun publicly tugging in the opposite direction, positing that continuing weakness in many economic indicators argues against higher rates.
I stand with Ms. Brainard and Mr. Tarullo: The Fed should step back from its implicit commitment to raise rates this year and hold firm until there is clear evidence of inflationary conditions.
That's not the current picture. Inflation, as measured by the central bank's preferred index, has been falling. It is now at 0.3 percent. Measures of expected future price increases have been similarly sliding, to about 1.5 percent, meaningfully below the Fed's 2 percent target.
Perhaps most worrisome, even though our most recent recession officially ended in June 2009, wages, after adjusting for inflation, have yet to rise significantly, in part because of slack in the labor market. Without higher incomes, our current tepid rate of economic expansion won't accelerate.
Currently the economy is expanding at just over a 2 percent rate with little reason to expect improvement. Important sectors, from business investment to retail sales, are anemic.
The Fed is projecting a jump in the growth rate, but the central bank is often wrong in its economic forecasts, anticipating faster growth, more inflation and, consequently, higher interest rates, than have actually come to pass.
Now, the financial markets are again questioning the Fed's judgment and are expecting later and smaller interest rate increases than the Fed is suggesting are likely. It's time for the central bank to recognize the slow-growth reality, as important voices like former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers have urged.
The other arguments in favor of beginning to raise rates are equally weak. Bizarrely, some say rates should be increased now so they can be decreased later in the event of renewed economic weakness. That's like not eating when you're hungry so you can eat at another time.
Should the economy once again sag, the Fed still has tools at its disposal, such as renewing its bond buying. And other policy makers could legislate tax cuts or spending increases.
Indeed, in a better world, we would not even be relying so heavily on the central bank to stimulate our lagging economy; a more expansionary fiscal policy would also be playing a part.
But short-term budget-cutting fever in Washington has reduced the deficit by cutting exactly the wrong things, like education, infrastructure, and research and development.
More balanced economic policies would also help address another criticism of low interest rates: their propensity to increase income inequality by inflating the value of stocks and other assets that are disproportionately owned by the wealthy.
To conservatives, rising asset prices signal greater chances of another meltdown, similar to what occurred in the mid-2000s. But the stock market is down 3 percent since its peak in May. And housing prices have yet to return to pre-crisis levels.
Let's also not forget that this crowd has been consistently wrong. Back in November 2010, 24 leading conservative economists, financiers and academics decried the Fed's asset buying as risking "currency debasement and inflation" while not promoting employment.
With 11.4 million new jobs, and no inflation in sight, perhaps we can agree that the Fed's full-throated efforts to stimulate the economy were a constructive contributor to our recovery.
For nearly seven years, members of the Federal Open Market Committee have dutifully gathered every six weeks or so, pondered bits and bytes of economic data and decided not to change interest rates.
Until the evidence indicating a need to begin raising rates becomes compelling, I'm hoping that the inaction faction prevails over the action faction.

Abstract: With Mr. Boehner's backing, the House moved with rare bipartisanship -- employing an even rarer legislative maneuver -- toward resolving another issue on the speaker's final to-do list: reauthorization of the 81-year-old Export-Import Bank, the government's lender of last resort for American exporters.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. WASHINGTON -- After five years of bitter clashes, Republican congressional leaders and President Obama on Monday night appeared to settle their last budget fight by reaching a tentative deal that would modestly increase spending over the next two years, cut some social programs, and raise the federal borrowing limit.
The accord, which must be approved by the House and the Senate, would avert a potentially cataclysmic default on the government's debt and dispenses with perhaps the most divisive issue in the capital just before Speaker John A. Boehner is expected to turn over his gavel to Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
Shortly before midnight, House Republicans posted the text of the 144-page bill, which was labeled a "discussion draft" but appeared to reflect the tentative agreement as described by congressional aides throughout the day.
The agreement would raise spending by $80 billion over two years, not including a $32 billion increase included in an emergency war fund. Those increases would be offset by cuts in spending on Medicare and Social Security disability benefits, as well as savings or revenue from an array of other programs, including selling oil from the nation's strategic petroleum reserves. The Medicare savings would come from cuts in payments to doctors and other health care providers.
The $80 billion increase amounts to little more than 1 percent per year of the nearly $4 trillion annual federal budget, but carries the politically charged significance of breaking through agreed-upon spending caps that Republicans had praised as a rare display of responsible cost-control and Democrats criticized as a wrongheaded drag on economic growth.
Nonetheless, the deal would represent a major breakthrough after years of gridlock in Congress, especially on fiscal issues, as each side compromised on core issues. It frees Mr. Obama from budget battles as he looks to secure his legacy in the remainder of his second term, and gives clean starts to Mr. Ryan as speaker and to Republicans trying to persuade voters that they can be an effective governing majority.
For Mr. Boehner, the deal would deliver on his pledge to clean up "the barn" by dispensing of potential crises in a way that he hoped would silence critics who said he overpromised and underdelivered. Mr. Boehner was repeatedly caught in spending fights between hard-line conservatives in his own party and a White House eager to blame Republicans for any impasse, such as the government shutdown in 2013.
With Mr. Boehner's backing, the House moved with rare bipartisanship -- employing an even rarer legislative maneuver -- toward resolving another issue on the speaker's final to-do list: reauthorization of the 81-year-old Export-Import Bank, the government's lender of last resort for American exporters. The House voted, 246 to 177, to wrest a bill that would revive the bank's charter from a hostile committee chairman and set it up for House passage on Tuesday.
About a fourth of Republicans joined all Democrats who were present in support of advancing the bill over the opposition of deep-pocketed conservative groups and the House Financial Services Committee's chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas.
Opponents say the bank amounts to corporate welfare. Supporters argue that it promotes job creation by assisting export industries and earns money for the Treasury in the process. The bank has not been able to conduct new business since its charter lapsed in June.
The Senate approved a similar measure as part of a transportation bill that still must be negotiated with the House, and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, opposes taking up the new bank measure. But House passage of the bill would strengthen proponents in the negotiations over the transportation measure.
An official briefed on the terms of the spending agreement said the deal fulfilled all of Mr. Boehner's goals in the talks by securing long-term changes in social programs, offsetting spending increases with corresponding cuts or savings; increasing military spending; achieving a net reduction in the deficit; and locking in an agreement on spending for the 2017 fiscal year.
Democrats, too, said they had achieved their goals, particularly lifting the prior spending caps and by assuring roughly equal increases to military and nonmilitary programs.
The Treasury Department had said that the government would default on its debt if the statutory borrowing limit was not raised by Nov. 3. And a temporary spending measure, which kept the government from shutting down at the start of October, will run out on Dec. 11.
The tentative agreement reached Monday night would solve each of those problems. It would keep the government financed through Sept. 30, 2017, well after Mr. Obama leaves office. And, the debt limit would be raised -- technically suspended, allowing the Treasury to borrow whatever it needs -- until March 2017.
And while the annual spending caps would be raised for two years, the 10-year spending caps enacted in 2011 would remain in place. Those caps will frame spending negotiations between Mr. Obama's successor and leaders of the next Congress.
Rank-and-file House Republicans, in particular, have been resistant to authorizing an increase in the debt limit without some accompanying adjustments to mandatory federal spending programs. They have voiced opposition even as financial experts warned of the potentially devastating economic consequences of a default, and noted that raising the limit merely covers previous expenses and does not authorize any new spending.
Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that he would not negotiate over raising the debt limit and Republican congressional leaders have generally acknowledged that they would be forced to increase the government's borrowing authority one way or another.
Critics of the deal, who said Mr. Boehner was pushing through one last measure negotiated solely by the leadership, quickly began venting their anger on Twitter using the hashtag #zombiebudget.
Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, who is a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, had posted his annoyance earlier in the day, saying, "It's another 'govern by crisis' deal that doesn't reflect the will of the House but rather the will of the speaker."
Mr. Boehner, who announced his resignation last month after years of being hounded by hard-line lawmakers on his party's right, had said he hoped to clear the way for his successor by dispensing with some tough issues. But talks seemed to falter after the majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, abandoned his bid for speaker, and House Republicans wrestled with the question of who would lead their deeply fractured conference.
That question was resolved last week when Mr. Ryan, the powerful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and one of his party's leading voices on fiscal matters, announced that he would seek the speakership provided his colleagues rallied behind him. They did.
Mr. Ryan is set to be chosen as the Republican nominee for speaker on Wednesday and formally installed during a vote on the House floor on Thursday.
An accord to lift the debt ceiling and settle the spending impasse before then would free Mr. Ryan to begin his speakership without a pending crisis, and potentially empower him to pursue some of the bold ideas he has put forward previously on tax and budget policy that helped catapult him to prominence and led to his being chosen as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2012.
Mr. Ryan played a crucial role in the last major spending deal, which he brokered along with Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.
The current negotiations were largely conducted at the staff level, involving senior aides to Mr. Boehner, Mr. McConnell, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, as well as White House staff members.
While the four Congressional leaders and Mr. Obama never met face-to-face in this round, aides said that there were frequent phone calls among the individual leaders as talks developed. Mr. Boehner's resignation, announced on Sept. 25, lent additional urgency to the talks, as it became clear that negotiations could prove far more difficult once a new speaker was in place.
Aides said that the Social Security Disability Insurance program would be amended, in part to tighten and standardize eligibility requirements that now vary by state. That change was projected to save the government $5 billion.
In addition, the accord calls for eliminating a provision of the Affordable Care Act, not yet in force, that would require businesses with more than 200 employees to automatically enroll their workers for health insurance.
The emerging deal would also reallocate funds among Social Security program trust funds to ensure solvency of the disability insurance program. Such reallocations have occurred regularly over the decades but Republicans had opposed any new reallocation without changes to reduce costs of the program.
The prospective agreement would also prevent expected increases in out-of-pocket costs for millions of Medicare Part B beneficiaries. The increases would have been caused by the rare absence of a cost-of-living increase in Social Security for some beneficiaries, because of unusually low inflation.
Mr. Obama and Democratic leaders had insisted that any increases in military spending be matched with equal increases in spending on nonmilitary programs. The deal under consideration appears to meet that goal, as Republicans had previously agreed to increases in military spending.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Japan's economy has contracted so many times in the last few years that the meaning of recession has started to blur. If an economy is shrinking almost as often as it is growing, what does any single downturn say about its health?
Now Japan appears to be faltering again.
After a decline in the second quarter, there are signs that output may have slipped again in the third, driven down in part by a slowing Chinese economy. Economists expect any recession to be short and shallow, but the deeper lesson looks more troubling: Nearly three years after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gained office on a pledge to end economic stagnation, a decisive break with the past still appears far off.
"The potential growth rate is close to zero, so any small shock can put the economy into recession," said Masamichi Adachi, the chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase. "Growth expectations are anemic."
As a result, some economists are betting that the Bank of Japan, which has been pumping vast amounts of money into the economy by buying up government debt, will pull the trigger on more stimulus at its next board meeting on Friday.
The central bank's aggressive intervention has been central to Mr. Abe's policies, widely known as Abenomics. But events have conspired to blunt its impact.
Last year, it was an ill-timed sales tax increase, which rattled Japanese consumers and dissuaded them from spending. Lately it has been the deceleration in China, whose factories have been important buyers of Japanese-made machinery.
But the more fundamental problem, many specialists say, is that Japan's economy simply doesn't grow much in the first place.
Baseline growth is essentially zero. Gross domestic product is the same size it was in the mid-1990s, in part because the work force is shrinking. So where a faster-moving economy might simply lose momentum in response to headwinds, Japan's goes into reverse.
So far, Mr. Abe's policies have done little to change the dynamic.
"Overseas investors appear increasingly disillusioned with Abenomics," Naohiko Baba, chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs, said last week after a series of meetings with clients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in Asia.
Foreign investors' enthusiasm for Abenomics was a central force in driving up Japanese stock prices, one of the few clear-cut successes of Mr. Abe's economic program. Although the rally has lost steam in the last few months along with other global markets, the Nikkei 225 is still about twice the level it was when Mr. Abe took office at the end of 2012.
Other parts of the economy look weaker. One of Abenomics' central objectives, to generate a strong and sustained rise in consumer prices, "remains very elusive," Mr. Baba said, as do its goals of raising workers' incomes and dismantling regulatory hurdles to business.
Taken together, improvements in these areas were supposed to bolster the economy's metabolism and increase its underlying potential to grow.
The central bank has played an outsize role in the effort. Under its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, it has pursued a "quantitative easing" strategy similar to that introduced by the Federal Reserve after the global financial meltdown seven years ago.
But the Fed has cut back its bond-buying program in response to a recovering American economy, and it is now considering whether to raise its benchmark interest rate from close to zero. A move by the Japanese central bank would go in the opposite direction -- toward even looser monetary policy.
The Bank of Japan's meeting this week will coincide with a twice-yearly update of board members' forecasts for growth and inflation, which are likely to show increased pessimism. Mr. Kuroda timed his last blast of stimulus with the same October review last year, catching the markets by surprise. Stocks in Japan and around the world jumped.
Mr. Kuroda has been doing his best to lower expectations, insisting that the bank's current monetary settings are sufficient. Inflation has been held back by falling oil prices, he says, but the underlying direction of prices and wages is upward.
"I think the current policy, so-called qualitative and quantitative easing, has been working, having the intended impact on the economy," he said in an interview with CNBC on Oct. 11, at a meeting of global central bankers in Lima.
Mr. Kuroda misdirected markets with similar talk before his unexpected move last year. But he may face greater constraints to action this time around. Stimulus measures by the central bank tend to drag down the value of the yen. That is good for multinational companies that earn revenue abroad, but it risks angering Japan's trading partners, as well as Japanese consumers and small businesses, whose buying power declines with the currency.
This month, Japan and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, including the United States, reached a hard-won agreement on a sprawling trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Mr. Abe says the increased trade and investment flows it promises to generate are crucial to raising Japan's long-run growth rate. But the pact is subject to approval by each country's legislature, including the United States Congress, where some members have accused Japan of unfairly suppressing the value of the yen to gain a competitive advantage.
"Foreign exchange policy is very tricky with T.P.P. in the balance," said Mr. Adachi of JPMorgan, who used to work at the Japanese central bank and understands the political sensitivities that can shape its nominally independent decisions. "Ordinary households don't want to see a weaker yen, either," he added, noting that the government faces an election for the upper house of Parliament next year.
Mr. Abe's economic team, normally a cheerleader for bolder central bank action, has also been unusually circumspect. "The Bank of Japan may not ease policy further any time soon," Finance Minister Taro Aso said in a recent interview with the public broadcaster NHK.
Mr. Abe has continued to make ambitious promises. Last month, he set a goal of increasing Japan's nominal economic output to 600 trillion yen by 2020 or soon after -- an increase of about 20 percent from the current level. He gave little indication of how an economy that has not grown in two decades could expand by a fifth in just a few years.
Audacious pronouncements have been a hallmark of Abenomics from the start -- part of what Mr. Kuroda has described as an effort to dispel Japan's "deflationary mind-set." But after three mostly lackluster years, its architects' credibility is being questioned by many, including their natural supporters in the business elite.
"I believe ¥600 trillion is an outrageous figure," Yoshimitsu Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said after Mr. Abe announced his goal. "I see it as merely a political message."

Abstract: If you simply look at the unemployment rate in the United States versus the Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices for every year since 1958, there is nearly no statistical relationship at all, just a jumble of dots.

Full text:   Next week, when Federal Reserve officials meet to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years, one question will be front and center: How much faith should be placed in a line on a graph first drawn by a New Zealand economist nearly six decades ago, based on data on wages and employment in Britain dating to the 1860s?
That would be the Phillips curve, one of the most important concepts in macroeconomics. It shows how inflation changes when unemployment changes and vice versa. The intuition is simple: When joblessness is low, employers have to pay ever higher wages to attract workers, which feeds through into higher prices more broadly. And inflation is particularly prone to rise when the unemployment rate falls below the "natural rate" at which pretty much everybody who wants a job either has one or can find one quickly.
As the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, put it in a 2007 speech, the Phillips curve "is a core component of every realistic macroeconomic model."
Except it doesn't work. Or at least, it hasn't worked very well in the last few decades in the United States. And it has proved particularly problematic to try to use that historical relationship to predict where inflation is going.
That is why a longstanding academic debate is now at the core of the Fed's policy debate. Ms. Yellen and many of her Fed colleagues have indicated that they think they should raise interest rates this year, in part because the Phillips curve suggests there will be excessive inflation if they don't. The unemployment rate was 5.1 percent in September, just a smidgen above the 4.9 percent that Fed leaders believe is the appropriate jobless rate in the longer run.
In other words, if you believe in the traditional Phillips curve, inflation should be taking off any day now.
But this month, two Fed governors, Lael Brainard and Daniel K. Tarullo, argued against a rate move. Ms. Brainard said that the Phillips curve relationship was "at best, very weak at the moment." Mr. Tarullo said that it was "probably wise not to be counting so much on past correlations, things like the Phillips curve, which haven't been working effectively for 10 years now."
It's only a slight exaggeration to say that the Fed's rate decision this year will be based on whether its leaders really believe that the Phillips curve is useful in describing how the economy works in 2015.
The idea of the Phillips curve has been under attack almost since William Phillips, the aforementioned New Zealander, wrote his 1958 paper "The Relation Between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957."
The most crude versions of the Phillips curve have indeed, in recent decades at least, been nearly useless. Any attempt to estimate it requires a researcher to decide what measure of employment to use, what measure of inflation and what time lags to assume, among other choices. So there are nearly as many versions of the Phillips curve as there are researchers who study it.
If you simply look at the unemployment rate in the United States versus the Consumer Price Index, excluding volatile food and energy prices for every year since 1958, there is nearly no statistical relationship at all, just a jumble of dots. (A best-fit line actually points the wrong direction, correlating higher unemployment with higher inflation, albeit very weakly.)
If you take only subsets of that period, the relationship looks stronger. For example, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis shows a fairly clear (negative) correlation between unemployment and inflation from 1977 to 1990, but suggests that relationship basically disappeared in the 1990s and was barely evident in the first decade of the 2000s. But in some ways an ever shifting curve raises more questions than it answers.
After all, if the relationship between unemployment and inflation is constantly shifting, for reasons that are impossible to predict, it isn't a particularly useful tool for deciding what policy should be today.
That said, a generation or two of economists have been working to understand what those simplistic versions of the Phillips curve get wrong, and have created more complex versions that incorporate more variables and might prove useful at predictions.
In particular, after the combination of high inflation and high unemployment of the 1970s -- a condition that would be impossible in a world in which the Phillips curve worked perfectly -- scholars began adding inflation expectations to their models to help explain the paradox.
Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, has his own version that he argues explains inflation levels throughout recent decades. But it is hardly simple. Its prediction for inflation relies not just on joblessness but also on measures of productivity growth, shifts in food and energy prices and overall inflation over the six preceding years.
In other words, just knowing the unemployment rate may tell you very little about what inflation will be. But if you add a few more variables, you can do a better job at predictions.
"If you do it right, the Phillips curve relationship has been very stable over the last 40 years," Mr. Gordon said. "It's the old ocean liner analogy -- it takes a long time to turn an ocean liner, and it takes a long time for the inflation rate to respond to high unemployment or low unemployment."
An important implication of Mr. Gordon's model is that much of the inflation rate in 2016 or even 2020 is decided by economic shifts that have already happened (recent productivity levels, for example) or by factors that policy makers have little control over (like what happens to oil prices).
His model predicts that if unemployment levels keep falling the way they have recently, inflation won't reach the Fed's 2 percent target until 2020. Mr. Gordon doubts that whether the central bank raises interest rates this week or in December or six months from now will make much difference to that outcome.
In a way, the debate over how much faith the Fed puts in the Phillips curve shows the broader dilemma of economic policy. For all the researchers over the decades and centuries who have tried to understand how the economy really works and to predict its course with precision, our ability to know where the economy is heading next year is no better than the ability of weather forecasters to predict whether it will rain three weeks from today. The United States economy is, after all, determined largely by the endlessly complicated interactions of 320 million people producing $17 trillion worth of stuff, which even relatively complex models can't keep up with.
There's a difference, though, between economic forecasting and weather forecasting. People don't have any short-term influence over the weather, but central banks and other economic policy makers do have influence over the short-term course of the economy. So for all its faults, the Phillips curve -- particularly its more sophisticated varieties -- may be the best tool that Janet Yellen and company have to work with.

Full text:   GRANITE CITY, Ill. -- A thousand miles south of this gritty steel town on the Mississippi River, West Texas oil rigs have shuddered to a halt. Seven hundred miles north, mines in the Iron Range of Minnesota have been stilled.
The drilling rigs, with their deep underground pipes, once consumed much of the steel that Granite City's blast furnaces could produce, while the mines supplied the raw material.
So now, more than 2,000 workers at the mammoth United States Steel plant not far from St. Louis are waiting to see if they will be next. This month, the company warned them it might be forced to idle the plant. Layoffs could begin around Christmas.
Granite City may be waiting, but a chill in economic activity is already evident across a broad swath of the nation's heartland stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border, as prices of commodities sink.
Whether it is roustabouts and other oil field workers in Texas and North Dakota, miners in Minnesota, farmers in Iowa, or heavy equipment makers and sellers in Illinois, the reason for the fear is the same: a sudden plunge in demand for commodities.
"Everybody is scared to death, and we're anticipating the worst," said Mike McCabe, 53, a second-generation steelworker who has spent nearly two decades working in the furnace where molten iron and scrap metal are transformed into steel. "They pay us to make pipe. That's what we do. But the rumor is that the order book is terrible."
The fall in prices for a variety of products, including crude oil, iron ore and agricultural crops like corn and soybeans is reminiscent of the collapse of the technology boom in 2000 or the bursting of the housing bubble nearly a decade ago. And behind the pain and anxiety are headwinds blowing from China and other emerging markets, where growth is slowing and demand for the raw materials that drive the global economy has dried up.
Even as the American economy continues to plow ahead, nerves are increasingly on edge. Investors and banks that lent eagerly to energy and mining giants when prices were high are worried about whether they will be repaid if prices stay low. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said in late September it would cut up to 10,000 jobs, a casualty of falling demand for its trademark yellow bulldozers and excavators.
A few days after Caterpillar's decision, Alcoa announced it would split in two to help cope with the slide in aluminum prices. DuPont, which has been under pressure to perform a similar breakup because of weak chemical prices, said in early October that its chief executive was stepping down and that it would cut costs more aggressively.
In Texas, energy companies and other natural resource businesses have eliminated 25,000 jobs this year. Sparsely populated North Dakota, where fortunes soared with the shale oil fracking boom, has lost more than 10,000 jobs, with some of its hastily built new housing now empty.
For the farm belt, which largely sidestepped the damage wreaked by the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the economic turnabout has been especially sharp. The Agriculture Department forecasts that farm income, adjusted for inflation, will fall 54 percent from where it was two years ago -- the third-lowest level since the 1980s. Corn, the most valuable crop in the country, has fallen to $3.78 a bushel from $7.50 three years ago.
"I think a lot of farmers are starting to realize that these price levels may not be temporary," said Nathan Kauffman, the Omaha branch executive with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.
Still, for all the rising fears across the nation's midsection, the end of the long boom in commodities cuts both ways. Unlike the housing bust, which benefited no one but a few prescient short-sellers, the price collapse has a countervailing positive impact for consumers and some other businesses.
The 37 percent drop in gasoline prices since the summer of 2014 is the equivalent of a $100 billion tax cut, providing much-needed relief while wages remain stuck. Food prices, too, have declined, with chicken costing 8 percent less than a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Milk is cheaper, and prices of goods from abroad, like coffee, are down.
Airlines are rejoicing at lower prices for fuel, which makes up 40 percent of their costs. For the first time in years, airlines can buy new planes, invest in new facilities and give bonuses to employees, while paying dividends to shareholders. With gasoline prices low, automakers are raking in healthy profits from selling shiny new pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.
"There are winners and there are losers," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research firm that tracks the economy. "But there is no question that there are pockets of real pain out there."
Years of Plenty
Commodity producers are used to regular booms and busts, but the so-called supercycle driven by China's once insatiable appetite for raw materials has been extraordinary by any standard. Edward L. Morse, Citigroup's global head of commodities research, likens China's boom to the three decades after World War II when Europe was rebuilt, or the Gilded Age industrialization of the United States in the half-century after the Civil War.
"The last 20 years have been mind-boggling," Mr. Morse said. "Between 1993 and 2013, China built 200 cities of a million people or more. This was incredibly intensive in terms of steel and copper and other commodities."
Vast amounts of money were invested globally to increase commodity production, whether it meant digging for iron and aluminum ores in Brazil and Australia or developing once untappable sources of shale oil and natural gas in the United States. In the first decade of the 21st century, Mr. Morse said, spending on energy exploration and drilling rose sevenfold.
"There was a bunching up of capital spending across the planet," he added. "It was an incredible marshaling of resources to find and get new anything. And like those infrastructure booms in the past, it is coming to an end."
And from South America to South Africa and beyond, the cooling in China adds up to an economic freeze. The double whammy of lower exports to China and falling commodity prices has pummeled the Brazilian economy, the world's seventh largest; its currency has fallen by roughly one-third against the dollar this year.
Closer to home, in Assumption, Ill., and in tiny farm towns like it across the Midwest, the lean years have arrived. But as in the biblical Book of Genesis, seven fat years preceded them.
For all the economic suffering elsewhere, the farm sector came through the Great Recession largely unscathed. Harvests were bountiful, prices for corn and soybeans were buoyant, and low interest rates made it easy to borrow and buy land or new equipment.
"My people weren't exposed," said Tom Sloan, chief executive of Sloan Implement, a major dealer of John Deere tractors, combines and other farm equipment with 20 stores in Illinois and Wisconsin. "All my friends were saying how tough things were, but farmers had zero."
Farmers like Terry Albrecht, who grows corn and soybeans on the same 600-acre plot in Staunton, Ill., that his father and grandfather once tilled, used the windfall from high prices to upgrade his grain truck and other equipment. In July, he took a break from the farm and went to Hawaii for two weeks with his wife and daughter.
He admits it may be a while before he can take that kind of trip again. "At these prices, I wouldn't be spending that kind of money," Mr. Albrecht said. "You take the opportunity when it arises."
As was the case with other commodities, overseas demand pushed crop prices steadily higher, especially as consumers in emerging markets began emulating Western eating habits.
Wheat exports from the United States to China in 2014 were four times what they were in 2011, while prices doubled before dropping more recently. Beijing prohibits the import of American beef, but exports to Hong Kong have surged, and the meat is smuggled into mainland China.
As crop prices have dived, so have sales of new John Deere machines in the territory Mr. Sloan serves. New equipment purchases are down about 30 percent from a year ago, he said, with the used tractors and combines he normally takes as trade-ins now filling nearly all of the five-acre lot at his company's headquarters in Assumption.
"Farmers made so much money they all bought new equipment," he said. "Now the supply of used equipment is astronomical."
And just as Mr. Sloan's sales are down, so is overall business at John Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill., a three-hour drive from Assumption. The company has laid off roughly 1,500 workers in the last year, and earnings were down 40 percent last quarter.
Mr. Sloan takes the long view -- the company was founded by his grandfather in 1931. "We are in a cyclical business," he said. "The good times lasted longer than we thought, and we probably have a couple of years of lean times ahead."
Now that the boom has ended, bankruptcies in the agricultural sector may tick up, but no one is predicting a replay of the 1980s when many farmers and rural banks went under. The biggest differences this time, they say, are overall low debt levels and historically cheap borrowing costs.
But banking regulators and others are closely watching a steady rise in short-term agricultural operating loans over the last year.
"At $3.50 a bushel, if your land is paid off, you're probably making a little bit of taxable income," said David Miller, the director of research and commodity services for the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation. If you're renting land at $300 an acre, he said, "you're probably losing money."
'It Hurts Big Time'
Northeast of the factories and bleak industrial vistas in Granite City, the landscape in Madison County, Ill., quickly turns to rolling, amber-colored farmland. And for farmers in the area, the Hamel Coop Grain Company in rural Hamel is a place to sell or store their harvest, and a hangout to trade gossip and talk business.
And these days, the conversations inevitably turn to prices, which are displayed on a whiteboard that Amy Rogier, the general manager, updates every afternoon with the latest figures from the Chicago Board of Trade.
Two years ago, soybeans fetched more than $15 a bushel. The co-op is offering $8.90 now. Corn was $6.93 a bushel in 2012. It now trades at $3.78.
"None of them are happy with the prices," said Ms. Rogier, who grew up on a farm in the area, which her father and brother still run. The co-op offers lower-priced seed, and she says farmers are using less fertilizer, to accommodate tighter budgets.
As he delivered 600 bushels of soybeans for sale this month, John Vieth made no bones about the pain he is feeling. He said he would have preferred to store the beans in the hope of getting a higher price in a few months but needed the money now to pay bills that could not wait.
"It hurts, it hurts big time," Mr. Vieth said after the crop was unloaded from his Navistar International truck. "Equipment is so dang expensive. Everything is up but our prices."
As the season wraps up, the speed of the drop in what farmers are now getting for their harvest means big-ticket purchases are being delayed.
"Instead of a new tractor, I can make do with a used one," said Kenny Grotefendt, as he watched his just-harvested corn being loaded into one of the co-op's towering silos. "I'll be 66 on Oct. 24 and my wife wants me to retire. But I was born on a farm, and it gets in your blood. I'll farm till I'm 70 and then enjoy life."
Cheap Oil's Hidden Cost
Like the used farm equipment sitting on the lot at Mr. Sloan's dealerships, the first thing a visitor sees around the Granite City steelworks is mound after mound of coal. This is what's known in the steel industry as coke -- carbonized coal that is used to melt iron ore and refine it into hardened steel.
With only one of Granite City's blast furnaces operating, the plant is running at about half of its normal capacity of 2.8 million tons of steel a year. Companywide, United States Steel is using 58 percent of its production capacity, which means lots of coke has no place to go.
Some of the steel produced in Granite City is used in construction and for machinery and other equipment, but the largest single share is earmarked for what is known in the industry as O.C.T.G., or Oil Country Tubular Goods.
From early 2011 to mid-2014, when oil mostly traded from $90 to $110 a barrel, Granite City shipped coil after coil of steel to the United States Steel plant in Lone Star, Tex., where it was turned into the tubes that line new oil wells and other so-called down-hole products.
Crude oil's abrupt drop to $40 to $50 a barrel for most of 2015 has forced the industry to decommission more than half its rigs. In mid-October, 595 oil rigs were in operation, compared with 1,590 a year ago.
But there is a hidden overhang in the market. To keep their leases, many operators are drilling wells without completing them. That means that as soon as prices revive a bit, production may bubble up again, forcing prices back down.
As a result, the financial consequences for banks and other lenders to the energy industry are growing -- and the pressure will only mount if oil remains in the $45 range.
Loans that not so long ago seemed safe now appear riskier: The collateral underpinning many of the loans held by banks is gas and oil reserves. As the price of oil has fallen, so has the value of the commodity guaranteeing the loan.
Banks have started to set aside money to cover bad loans made to energy companies.
For the last four quarters, the Texas bank Comerica has increased the reserves it has set aside for bad loans to energy and energy-related companies, which total around $3.8 billion, roughly 8 percent of total loans held by the bank. In mid-October, Comerica reported that it had nearly doubled to $1.1 billion the pool of energy loans it classifies as "criticized," meaning the bank has concerns about the borrowers' financial condition.
Even as they cope with the drop in demand from the oil patch, American steel makers are being pummeled by a flood of imported steel from foreign producers, especially South Korea.
United States Steel has filed a trade case against Korean steel makers, claiming they are dumping steel at less than half of what it costs to make it. By the time the case is resolved, however, the furnaces in Granite City may already be cold.
"There is typically about four months' inventory of O.C.T.G. out there," said Douglas R. Matthews, senior vice president for North American flat-rolled operations at United States Steel. "Right now it's 10 to 12 months, and high levels of Korean steel are still coming in."
But the flip side of the commodity cycle is that some previous losers are now riding high.
The surge in commodity prices drove a transformation in the airline industry, for example, as high fuel prices prodded carriers to merge, reduce capacity and park planes that were not economical to fly.
Today, with their biggest cost down substantially, the airline industry is reporting historic levels of profitability.
That roller coaster effect will eventually play out within the commodities sector itself. With prices depressed, so is capital spending aimed at finding new deposits of oil or extracting minerals from new mines. Eventually, supply will adjust to better fit demand, setting the stage for prices to stabilize and, over time, recover.
Some signs indicate that the commodity bust is hitting bottom. But many analysts predict that oil prices, in particular, will stay low for an unusually long period, as the industry slowly works off a huge glut of supplies and inventories.
Much as that might cheer many American consumers, in Granite City and towns like it up and down the middle of the country, that prospect brings little joy.
"It's hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that what's good at the pump is bad for me," said Jason Chism, president of Local 50 of the United Steelworkers in Granite City. "But I'm not happy. We're laying guys off, and the steel industry is in the tank."
Neither is Mr. McCabe, the second-generation steelworker, who is preparing for the worst. Not long ago, he asked a real estate agent to visit his home in Gillespie, Ill., and give him an estimate on the property. "If the plant is idled, I'd sell everything and start over," he said. "I have a good credit rating, and I don't want to lose that. I could get a job for $10 to $15 an hour."
That is a lot less than the roughly $25 an hour he makes at United States Steel, but Mr. McCabe knows the business has changed since his father and uncle worked in the blast furnace decades ago.
"It's good money when we're making steel," he added, sitting for an interview in the century-old local union hall known as the Labor Temple. "But our pay has already been cut as production has gone down, and we're constantly dipping into savings. What can we do about it? Nothing."

Full text:   HONG KONG -- As China confronts a persistent slowdown in growth, its government moved to pump more money into the economy using stimulus measures that could create other challenges for the country.
Chinese officials on Friday mostly followed a well-worn playbook, putting in effect a number of measures designed to help lower corporate borrowing costs. The central bank cut interest rates for the sixth time in less than a year, and it freed up banks to lend more money for the fourth time since November.
The government also took a step toward easing the pressures for consumers, by removing a cap on the interest rates that banks can pay for deposits. The decision, part of a broader effort to liberalize the banking system and make it more efficient, may help increase household incomes, a critical piece of the economic puzzle.
The scramble reflects the economic struggles facing China. Official data released on Monday showed that China's growth slipped to 6.9 percent in the third quarter, the weakest quarterly expansion since 2009, in the depths of the financial crisis.
Inflation, too, has been weak. Like Europe and Japan, China is dealing with disinflation in producer prices and weak increases in consumer prices. Such an environment can cause companies to cut investment and consumers to refrain from spending, pulling down the overall economy.
While China's economy is hardly falling off a cliff, the spate of actions in recent months suggests that the troubles are mounting. And analysts indicated that more stimulus may be necessary.
The moves "intensify concerns that the measures taken so far have had limited traction in supporting growth and that more drastic measures might be required in the coming months," said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, who used to head the China division of the International Monetary Fund.
China is joining a lineup of central banks seeking to prop up economic growth by easing monetary policy, even as the United States Federal Reserve considers an interest-rate increase.
On Thursday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said he was ready to add monetary stimulus, possibly including rate cuts, as early as December, depending on the shape of Europe's economy. As its output declines, Japan could be forced to ramp up its aggressive bond-buying campaign known as quantitative easing.
In China, the collection of policy measures could set off other economic troubles, complicating the country's response to slowing growth.
On Friday, the People's Bank of China said it would cut the one-year lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.35 percent, effective Saturday. The benchmark deposit rate would be lowered by the same amount, to 1.5 percent.
By making loans cheaper, China is hoping to encourage companies to spend and invest. But the extra loans could foster more construction of apartment buildings, office towers and shopping malls. China is already struggling to cope with a real estate glut and a mountain of debt.
"The reliance on monetary policy could also hurt the goal of rebalancing the economy by reducing the reliance on credit-fueled investment growth to boost overall growth," Mr. Prasad said.
China's reliance on increasing the money circulating through the economy, which is already more than the amount in the United States, could also further weaken the Chinese currency and prompt additional outflows. The currency, the renminbi, has been a particular point of concern ever since a surprise devaluation in August sent a wave of volatility through global stock markets.
The renminbi, tightly managed by the government, has remained largely stable in the two months since the devaluation. But financial outflows have increased as local and foreign investors seek to move money offshore over fears of further devaluations and the generally weaker outlook for China's growth.
To help ensure stability, China's central bank paired its rate cut on Friday with a 0.5 percentage point reduction to the so-called reserve requirement ratio. The ratio stipulates how much cash commercial banks must set aside instead of lending. The cut was necessary to "maintain reasonably ample liquidity in the banking system," the central bank said in a statement.
In tandem with the cuts, the central bank said it would no longer set a ceiling on the rates that banks may pay depositors.
Since last year, China had been making incremental steps toward deregulating interest rates, which included a nationwide plan that began earlier this year to insure bank deposits. Allowing banks to compete for deposits by paying higher interest offers a better deal for customers, who in China tend to keep a relatively high proportion of their money in ordinary savings accounts.
The central bank noted on Friday that the timing of the move was advantageous. At the moment, the broad pressure on rates in China is downward. That decreases the risk that banks might become too aggressive in offering ever-increasing interest payments -- a situation that, in the United States, served as an impetus for the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.

Abstract: The impasse dates to 2012, when Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Argentina could not service the debt it restructured in the years after its 2001 default if it did not pay the litigating holdout creditors, in full, at the same time. Even facing the judgment of a United States federal court, Argentina issued dollar-denominated bonds this year under local law, but it had to pay premium interest rates of 8 to 9 percent.

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- As Argentina prepares for a new president, a glimmer of hope has emerged that a ferocious standoff with American hedge funds may be resolved within months.
On Sunday, Argentines will vote on who will succeed President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The front-runner, Daniel Scioli, has at times shared her taste for fiery populist oratory.
Nonetheless, if elected president, he is expected to quietly seek a compromise with the hedge funds over nearly $100 billion of bonds that Argentina defaulted on in 2001.
"It's very important to close out the holdouts issue," said Gustavo Marangoni, an economic adviser to Mr. Scioli. "It's like a pebble blocking a funnel of investment."
The standoff has kept the country locked out of global lending markets. Mrs. Kirchner has maneuvered to reach the end of her presidency without the need to return to those markets, but a new leader would need access to help rectify Argentina's economy, analysts said.
"Whoever wants to govern Argentina needs a country with access to capital markets," said Federico Thomsen, an economist based in Buenos Aires.
That will mean ending the feud with the hedge funds, often referred to as holdout creditors -- or "vultures," in the words of Mrs. Kirchner's government -- led by a unit of the billionaire Paul E. Singer's firm, Elliott Management.
The impasse dates to 2012, when Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that Argentina could not service the debt it restructured in the years after its 2001 default if it did not pay the litigating holdout creditors, in full, at the same time.
Argentina refused to accept the ruling, earning rebukes from Judge Griesa. Even facing the judgment of a United States federal court, Argentina issued dollar-denominated bonds this year under local law, but it had to pay premium interest rates of 8 to 9 percent. This angered the holdouts, who claim the new debt was marketed internationally and therefore subject to Judge Griesa's ruling.
Mrs. Kirchner, 62, who is not permitted to run for a third consecutive term, has led a crusade against the hedge funds, accusing them of extorting her government.
Polls here suggest that Mr. Scioli could win on Sunday without the need for a runoff. His closest challenger is Mauricio Macri, a former businessman and soccer club president who has traditionally been viewed more favorably by investors. Mr. Macri has said that he would negotiate with the holdouts.
Yet politics colors these positions. Mr. Macri's statements appear to have been intended as just criticisms of the government. In interviews, Mr. Macri's economic advisers said they would let the issue languish and straighten out the economy by addressing other problems.
"I don't think it's life or death for Argentina," said an adviser, referring to resolving debt dispute.
And on the campaign trail, Mr. Scioli, having been endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner, has been nearly as aggressive as the president in calling for a "world without vultures."
Mr. Scioli, a former powerboat racer turned state governor, indicated that he would not improve on the terms agreed to by a majority of bondholders in debt swaps in 2005 and 2010. They received about a 65 percent "haircut" with some deals enhanced by payments pegged to Argentina's growth rate. That is an offer that the hedge funds have already rejected.
"Argentina's proposal is clear," Mr. Scioli, 58, told reporters recently, smoking a cigarillo on the sidelines of a boxing match at a sports club he built next to his home in the Paraná River delta. "We have to see now if they have the willingness to adapt to what Argentina has been offering."
Mr. Scioli's reliance on Mrs. Kirchner "means he cannot address these issues publicly," Nicholas Watson, who analyzes Argentina for Teneo Intelligence, a global advisory firm based in New York, wrote in a note to clients.
But if Mr. Scioli wins the presidency, he is expected to forge his own path, independent of the ideological constraints of Mrs. Kirchner's leftist political movement, known as Kirchnerismo.
"Kirchnerismo is over," said an adviser to Mr. Scioli who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Soon enough, they'll realize."
Mr. Marangoni and Mario Blejer, another adviser, said that Mr. Scioli's government would reinitiate talks that have long been at an impasse.
"I'm in favor of opening negotiations with a very firm stance," Mr. Blejer said in an interview.
A third adviser, Miguel Bein, who could not be reached for comment, said at a conference in May that Argentina might pay up to 70 percent of the roughly $1.7 billion owed to the holdouts, a sum that includes interest.
That may not be enough to satisfy the holdouts, who have asked for nothing less than the full $1.7 billion.
Mr. Scioli is expected to make other changes in economic policy, including reducing monetization of the fiscal deficit to calm inflation, which is estimated at more than 25 percent, and a gradual devaluation of the peso that could help lure foreign investment and boost competitiveness.
These will require tapping global bond markets to bring in dollars, said Jimena Blanco, who monitors Argentina for Verisk Maplecroft, a risk analysis firm in London.
In the short term, the country may also need those dollars to bolster the central bank's reserves, which dropped far below $30 billion this month after the government paid off $5.9 billion of maturing bonds.
Although many economists agree that Argentina should end the dispute with the hedge funds so it can bring in dollars by issuing debt abroad, others offer another argument: that the country can talk but delay a deal until the hedge funds cede ground and, in the meantime, attract big foreign investment or even issue debt.
Another presidential candidate, Sergio Massa, 43, an energetic lawmaker who bolted from Mrs. Kirchner's party in 2013, supports this approach.
Mr. Massa said he would seek to strengthen his negotiating position with the holdouts by first returning to debt markets, using risk mitigation instruments offered by regional development banks to issue bonds at around half the rate investors currently demand.
"Argentina cannot go to Griesa's bench and surrender," Mr. Massa said at a lunch with reporters.
If the government reaches a settlement in the coming months, it could still have trouble raising money if it does not also make repairs to its economy, said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies in New York. She cited Argentina's fiscal deficit, which is estimated at about 7 percent of gross domestic product, and the precariousness of the central bank's reserves.
"Does legal access to the markets mean market demand?" Ms. Morden said. "No. The markets aren't lenders of last resort."

Abstract: Across the advanced world, the modest-size fiscal stimulus programs introduced in 2009 have long since faded away. Since 2010 public investment has been falling as a share of G.D.P. in both Europe and the United States, and it's now well below pre-crisis levels.

Full text:   Canada has a reputation for dullness. Back in the 1980s The New Republic famously declared "Worthwhile Canadian Initiative" the world's most boring headline. Yet when it comes to economic policy the reputation is undeserved: Canada has surprisingly often been the place where the future happens first.
And it's happening again. On Monday, Canadian voters swept the ruling Conservatives out of power, delivering a stunning victory to the center-left Liberals. And while there are many interesting things about the Liberal platform, what strikes me most is its clear rejection of the deficit-obsessed austerity orthodoxy that has dominated political discourse across the Western world. The Liberals ran on a frankly, openly Keynesian vision, and won big.
Before I get into the implications, let's talk about Canada's long history of quiet economic unorthodoxy, especially on currency policy.
In the 1950s, everyone considered it essential to peg their currency to the U.S. dollar, at whatever cost -- everyone except Canada, which let its own dollar fluctuate, and discovered that a floating exchange rate actually worked pretty well. Later, when European nations were scrambling to join the euro -- amid predictions that any country refusing to adopt the common currency would pay a severe price -- Canada showed that it's feasible to keep your own money despite close economic ties to a giant neighbor.
Oh, and Canadians were less caught up than the rest of us in the ideology of bank deregulation. As a result, Canada was spared the worst of the 2008 financial crisis.
Which brings us to the issue of deficits and public investment. Here's what the Liberal Party of Canada platform had to say on the subject: "Interest rates are at historic lows, our current infrastructure is aging rapidly, and our economy is stuck in neutral. Now is the time to invest."
Does that sound reasonable? It should, because it is. We're living in a world awash with savings that the private sector doesn't want to invest, and is eager to lend to governments at very low interest rates. It's obviously a good idea to borrow at those low, low rates, putting those excess savings, not to mention the workers unemployed due to weak demand, to use building things that will improve our future.
Strange to say, however, that hasn't been happening. Across the advanced world, the modest-size fiscal stimulus programs introduced in 2009 have long since faded away. Since 2010 public investment has been falling as a share of G.D.P. in both Europe and the United States, and it's now well below pre-crisis levels. Why?
The answer is that in 2010 elite opinion somehow coalesced around the view that deficits, not high unemployment and weak growth, were the great problem facing policy makers. There was never any evidence for this view; after all, those low interest rates showed that markets weren't at all worried about debt. But never mind -- it was what all the important people were saying, and all that you read in much of the financial press. And few politicians were willing to challenge this orthodoxy.
Most notably, those who should have stood up for public spending suffered a striking failure of nerve. Britain's Labour Party, in particular, essentially accepted Conservative claims that the nation was facing a fiscal crisis, and was reduced to arguing at the margin about what form austerity should take. Even President Obama temporarily began echoing Republican rhetoric about the need to tighten the government's belt.
And having bought into deficit panic, center-left parties found themselves in an extremely weak position. Austerity rhetoric comes naturally to right-wing politicians, who are always arguing that we can't afford to help the poor and unlucky (although somehow we're able to afford tax cuts for the rich.) Center-left politicians who endorse austerity, however, find themselves reduced to arguing that they won't inflict quite as much pain. It's a losing proposition, politically as well as economically.
Now come Justin Trudeau's Liberals, who are finally willing to say what sensible economists (even at places like the International Monetary Fund) have been saying all along. And they weren't punished politically -- on the contrary, they won a stunning victory.
So will the Liberals put their platform into practice? They should. Interest rates remain incredibly low: Canada can borrow for 10 years at only 1½ percent, and its 30-year inflation-protected bonds yield less than 1 percent. Furthermore, Canada is probably facing an extended period of weak private demand, thanks to low oil prices and the likely deflation of a housing bubble.
Let's hope, then, that Mr. Trudeau stays with the program. He has an opportunity to show the world what truly responsible fiscal policy looks like.

Full text:   BEIJING -- President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has crushed political opponents in his country, and democratic challengers and their supporters have faced intimidation, jail and worse.
Mr. Mugabe, whose ZANU-PF party controls the levers of power, has presided over economic policies that have resulted in rampant inflation and poverty. Widely condemned by Western governments, he is considered one of the most uncompromising rulers in Africa.
Now he can claim the honor of being awarded a Confucius Peace Prize, the Chinese answer to the Nobel Peace Prize.
A group based in Hong Kong that says it is the official organizer of the prize has selected Mr. Mugabe as this year's recipient. Among the finalists for the award were Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, President Park Geun-Hye of South Korea and Bill Gates.
The Confucius Peace Prize was first established in late 2010 as a rejoinder to the Nobel Peace Prize that was awarded that year to Liu Xiaobo, a dissident Chinese literary critic who is serving an 11-year prison sentence on a charge of subversion. His wife, Liu Xia, is under house arrest.
The Confucius Peace Prize ceremony is scheduled to be held in December. Organizers say the official Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing will be the venue if Mr. Mugabe, 91, agrees to attend. The prize comes with a financial reward of 500,000 renminbi, or nearly $80,000.
"The 21st-century interpretation of Confucianism is 'universal harmony in the world,' " Qiao Wei, a poet and the president of the judging committee of the peace prize, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. "Mugabe is the founding leader of Zimbabwe and has been trying to stabilize the country's political and economic order ever since the country was first founded. He brought benefit to the people of Zimbabwe."
Mr. Mugabe had his start in politics as a Pan-African nationalist who opposed minority white rule in the former British colony and country then known as Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. The Rhodesian government used brutal tactics to try to suppress nationalist movements, and Mr. Mugabe was imprisoned for more than 10 years, but the country finally achieved full independence from Britain in 1980.
Mr. Mugabe became premier and quickly set up an authoritarian system, including managing security forces that on occasion acted as death squads.
"As the president of Zimbabwe or the chairman of the African Union, he has always been pushing forward the cause of peace in Africa," Mr. Qiao said. "He has been working hard even in his 90s. This shows he has ideals in his heart. He has been trying to support the independence of Africa. He has his 'African Dream.' "
Mr. Qiao noted that the Confucius Peace Prize committee and the Nobel committee had both looked to Africa for candidates this year. The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded this month to the National Dialogue Quartet of Tunisia, a grass-roots pro-democracy group.
Critics in Zimbabwe and elsewhere were swift to condemn the honor given to Mr. Mugabe.
Mr. Qiao said he did not blame Mr. Mugabe for the soaring inflation that has crippled the country's economy.
"Zimbabwe is a relatively small country in southern Africa," he said. "It's normal for the country to experience economic downturns for several or more than a dozen years. Even in many developed countries now, the economy is not 'running' all the time. It also halts or even goes backward."
Last year, the Confucius Peace Prize was awarded to Fidel Castro, the former Cuban leader. In 2011, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia won. The first recipient was Lien Chan, a former party chairman of the Kuomintang in Taiwan. He learned of the prize when journalists called for comment.
The prize has been mired in political battles. The founding committee had tenuous ties to the Chinese Ministry of Culture, but a split in the committee prompted the ministry to try to ban the prize in 2011. A rival group tried to award an alternative honor -- the Confucius World Peace Prize -- but that effort was called off.
Mr. Qiao said he registered his prize's committee in Hong Kong, under the name China International Peace Research Center, and in Beijing, under the name Beijing Heweigui Culture Media Company, to keep the award going after the ministry tried to quash it in 2011.

Full text:   Three United Nations agencies reported Thursday that 3.9 million people in South Sudan, roughly a third of the population, now face "severe food insecurity" because of the mayhem and disruptions caused by that country's nearly two-year-old civil war. A statement issued jointly by the agencies, Unicef, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization, also said that at least 30,000 people in Unity State, in the north-central part of South Sudan, had fallen into the "catastrophe" phase of food insecurity -- the most dire -- and are "living in extreme conditions and are facing starvation and death." Some families, the statement said, are subsisting on one meal a day of fish and water lilies. Despite a number of peace pledges made by the warring sides, fighting has persisted in South Sudan. Serge Tissot, the Food and Agriculture Organization's representative in South Sudan, said in the statement that "livelihoods have been severely affected by high inflation rates, market disruption, conflict-related displacement and loss of livestock and agricultural production."

Abstract: "The stock-market rescue revived questions regarding the leadership's commitment to economic liberalization and whether that is even what the administration means by reform," said Matthew P. Goodman, a senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was an author of a two-year study on economic decision-making in China that was published in March. "The focus on centralizing authority has been a big theme of Xi's, and also this more politicized and nationalist environment that Xi has inaugurated has had very clear effects on the progress of economic reform," said Andrew Batson, the China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial consultancy in Beijing.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- China's bungled stock market bailout was a significant setback to its decades-long efforts to build a modern financial system.
Its currency devaluation shocked global investors and altered the policy calculus at central banks from Hanoi to Washington.
A highly anticipated package of overhauls to sprawling state-owned companies was a crushing rebuke to hopes that China would move to privatize such businesses. Instead of reducing their stakes, the Communist Party said it would increase its control over such companies.
To many global policy makers and investors, China's spate of surprises is driven by the government's need to get the economy back on track.
Growth is slipping. The latest data on Monday showed that the economy grew at 6.9 percent in the third quarter, its lowest level since 2009. And Beijing is scrambling to respond to the pressures.
While President Xi Jinping says the country is committed to financial reform, the resulting measures send the message that China is backpedaling on those efforts. It is a new and shifting landscape that is proving difficult for the rest of the world to navigate.
"People say reform is coming, but you're giving back your reforms," Fraser Howie, a longtime banker in Asia and co-author of "Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China's Extraordinary Rise," said of the recent actions by Chinese authorities.
"That defeats the whole purpose; you either embrace markets or not," he said.
For years, the technocrats who control the levers of China's economy have been heralded as farsighted planners. What they promised, they generally delivered, and any doubts could be dispelled by the nation's torrid economic growth.
But that image has been shattered in recent months, as an expanding cast of agencies and officials regularly roll out ambitious plans with little warning and explanation. In China, some economic decisions are treated like state secrets, forcing global investors and policy makers to adjust quickly.
The People's Bank of China routinely surprises the market with major policy announcements on evenings and weekends. Its counterpart, the United States Federal Reserve, tries to telegraph its moves long in advance.
It is all complicated by the competition and the lack of coordination among the many agencies charged with managing China's economy. The central bank, securities regulator, Finance Ministry and economic planning agency, among others, have different agendas and goals.
The collective result is that it is difficult to discern exactly what is happening in China. From the outside, officials appear to be changing course on long-held reform plans that are broadly considered critical for the health of the economy.
In June, China's chief securities regulator outlined sweeping plans to help turn millions of cash-starved start-up companies into innovative corporate champions by making it easier to raise money and go public. The initiative would "strengthen the vitality of the entire economy," Xiao Gang, the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a financial forum in Shanghai.
With China's stock markets tumbling a week later, he appeared to sacrifice his free-market agenda. Mr. Xiao's agency banned new listings, barred big shareholders from selling and ordered brokerages to buy aggressively.
"The stock-market rescue revived questions regarding the leadership's commitment to economic liberalization and whether that is even what the administration means by reform," said Matthew P. Goodman, a senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who was an author of a two-year study on economic decision-making in China that was published in March. "It is now pretty clear that things are not going according to plan."
The current pressures in China signal a shift from the rosier outlook two years ago, when President Xi introduced a platform of financial overhauls intended to give the market a "decisive" role in the direction of economic growth. At the same time, Mr. Xi has aggressively asserted his primacy in driving China's economic policy and reforms, an area that was traditionally overseen by the prime minister.
"The focus on centralizing authority has been a big theme of Xi's, and also this more politicized and nationalist environment that Xi has inaugurated has had very clear effects on the progress of economic reform," said Andrew Batson, the China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics, a financial consultancy in Beijing.
"That's not necessarily 100 percent negative," Mr. Batson added. "But it's certainly not the universally pro-market reform agenda that some people were expecting."
The confusion over the country's commitment to financial reform has increased volatility far beyond China's borders.
China's central bank has explained the devaluation on Aug. 11 as a one-time adjustment that was meant to make the currency, whose value had been tightly controlled by the government for years, more market-driven. But the suddenness of the move spurred competitive devaluations in Vietnam and Kazakhstan. The tumult even prompted the Fed to hold off raising interest rates at its Sept. 17 meeting.
"I think developments that we saw in financial markets in August in part reflected concerns that there was downside risk to Chinese economic performance, and perhaps concerns about the deftness with which policy makers were addressing those concerns," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, told reporters after that meeting.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the long-serving head of China's central bank, has not commented directly on the devaluation. In a recent essay, he argued that China had made impressive progress in financial overhauls over recent decades, but he also acknowledged that the global financial crisis and other factors had delayed some changes.
"Today the conditions are there to advance reforms for market changes, internationalization and diversification," Mr. Zhou wrote in China Finance magazine. "But in this process, there are some things that require catching up, because there have been planned reforms that, owing to the crisis and other factors, were pigeonholed."
For China, the risk in delaying promised financial overhauls is that longstanding economic issues, like the country's ballooning corporate and government debt problem, might get worse.
State-controlled media reported on Monday that Prime Minister Li Keqiang had met with the leaders of some of China's biggest banks on Friday and issued a broad promise to prop up companies in financial trouble. According to the Beijing Times, Mr. Li declared that China "will not cut or withdraw loans to those companies with difficulties but good market prospects," and will "give necessary capital support to companies undergoing bankruptcies or regrouping."
In October 2014, Lou Jiwei, the finance minister, announced a bold plan to clean up trillions of dollars of local government debts, spending that has traditionally played a major role in China's efforts to stimulate the economy. But policy makers have appeared partly to backtrack, allowing local governments to continue adding new debt through riskier methods like borrowing through unregulated holding companies.
"Relative to the plan announced last year, the pace of reform now is slower," Nicholas Zhu, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service based in Beijing, said of the local government debt efforts. "The reason is because the sharper-than-expected slowdown of economic growth since earlier this year has changed the policy focus more towards stabilization of the economy."
The most recent development to set off doubts about China's commitment to economic reforms came last month, when the government released a much-anticipated policy document on the overhaul of its gigantic state-owned sector.
A few days after the proposal was published, the Communist Party's powerful Central Committee followed up with a document that bluntly ruled out loosening the party's grip on state firms.
Party leadership "can only be strengthened rather than undermined, as state-owned enterprise reforms have entered the deepwater zone," the Central Committee document said, according to a report by Xinhua, China's official news agency.
The party leadership over state firms "is vital in ensuring the socialist direction of their development" and would "enhance their competitiveness and competence," Xinhua added.
Despite signs of stasis on the ground, Chinese officials continue to talk up a pro-reform agenda in public, which adds to the murkiness.
On his visit to the United States last month, Mr. Xi, China's president, repeatedly drove home his commitment to pushing through economic overhauls.
"The key to China's development lies in reform," Mr. Xi said in a speech in Seattle.
"When it comes to the toughest reforms, only those with courage will carry the day," he added. "We have the resolve and the guts to press ahead."

Full text:   Angus Deaton, this year's winner of the Nobel in economic science, was honored for his rigorous and innovative use of data -- including the collection and use of new surveys on individuals' choices and behaviors -- to measure living standards and guide policy.
Reliable data is essential for policy makers. But for years, Congress has cut, frozen or shortchanged the budgets of most of the nation's 13 main statistical agencies.
House Republicans, for example, have been especially scornful of the decennial census, the nation's most important statistical tool, and the related questionnaire, the American Community Survey. They have placed prohibitive constraints on the Census Bureau, including a mandate that it spend no more on the 2020 census than it spent on the 2010 census, despite inflation, population growth and technological change.
Republicans have also proposed making the community survey voluntary -- a move that would diminish the survey's value by condoning nonparticipation, which increases cost and reduces accuracy. Even if the proposals go nowhere, the noise generated by their supporters is enough to persuade some people not to participate.
The census is not the only target. The budget for the Bureau of Labor Statistics has been flat or falling for several years, forcing the agency to end surveys on mass layoffs, international labor comparisons, and employment in alternative energy. It has had to curtail quarterly data collection on employment and wages.
Unless the labor bureau's budget is increased, even the American Time Use Survey -- the only government survey of how Americans spend their time outside work -- may be curtailed or ended. The time-use survey, which was begun in 2003, provides the type of novel data Mr. Deaton used in his research.
The list of cutbacks goes on. Budgets to compile statistics on the economy, energy and health have failed to keep pace with inflation since 2010, while budgets for statistical efforts covering agriculture, crime, education and transportation are lower in real terms now than they were five years ago.
Congress's disdain for federal statistics divorces policy making from empirical evidence. Financing for federal data needs to be increased.

Full text:   United States consumer sentiment rebounded strongly in early October, suggesting that the economic recovery remained on track despite headwinds from a strong dollar and weak global demand that have weighed on the country's industries.
The snapback in sentiment reported on Friday underscored robust domestic demand and offered hope that consumer spending would remain solid enough to support economic growth, which has slowed significantly in recent months.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 92.1 points in early October from a reading of 87.2 in September. The survey's current conditions subindex rose to 106.7 this month from 101.2 in September.
The index at current levels has historically been consistent with roughly a 4 percent annualized rate of consumer spending growth, according to economists.
"This suggests that U.S. household sentiment has turned an important corner, and is a hopeful sign on the outlook for consumer spending activity going forward, given signs of weakness in other parts of the economy," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The rise in sentiment, which probably reflected cheaper gasoline prices, suggested limited impact from recent stock market volatility. Consumers were the most optimistic about their personal financial expectations since 2007.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity. It has been the bright spot in the economy as industry wobbles under the onslaught of slowing global growth and the resurgent dollar, which have eroded demand for goods made in the United States.
The economy is also being weighed down by a reduction in capital investment in the energy industry because of lower oil prices, as well as an effort by businesses to reduce their inventories.
In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial output slipped 0.2 percent on renewed weakness in oil and gas drilling after dipping 0.1 percent in August. Industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter.
"We do not expect the recent slowing to lead to a broader pullback in aggregate growth, as service sector activity remains solid," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Still, the weak industrial production report added to soft trade, retail sales and employment data that have pointed to a significant slowdown in growth after the economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the second quarter.
Third-quarter growth estimates are now around a 1.5 percent rate. Slower growth and low inflation have diminished expectations of an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year.

Full text:   When it comes to paying taxes, most Americans think the wealthy do not pay their fair share.
There is a sharp divide, however, between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to taxing the rich, who provide most of the cash for political campaigns.
All the Republican tax proposals, in fact, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans. Democrats, on the other hand, are prepared to raise taxes at the top, though they have not been very specific about how they would do so.
"Right now, the wealthy pay too little," Hillary Rodham Clinton said at this week's Democratic debate in Las Vegas, "and the middle class pays too much."
But what could a tax-the-rich plan actually achieve? As it turns out, quite a lot, experts say. Given the gains that have flowed to those at the tip of the income pyramid in recent decades, several economists have been making the case that the government could raise large amounts of revenue exclusively from this small group, while still allowing them to take home a majority of their income.
It is "absurd" to argue that most wealth at the top is already highly taxed or that there isn't much more revenue to be had by raising taxes on the 1 percent, says the economist Joseph E. Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel in economic science, who has written extensively about inequality. "The only upside of the concentration of the wealth at the top is that they have more money to pay in taxes," he said.
The top 1 percent on average already pay roughly a third of their incomes to the federal government, according to a Treasury Department analysis that takes into account the entire menu of taxes -- including income tax, payroll taxes that fund Medicare and Social Security, estate and gift taxes, excise and custom duties as well as investors' share of corporate taxes. The tax bite on the top 0.1 percent is a bit higher. Most of those taxpayers insist they are already paying more than enough.
By comparison, the band of taxpayers right below them, in the 95th to 99th percentile, pay on average about $1 out of every $4. Those in the bottom half pay less than $1 out of every $10.
Sidestepping for the moment the messy question of just which taxes would be increased, how much more revenue could be generated by asking the rich to pay a larger share of their income in taxes?
To get the most accurate picture possible, throw in all the scraps of income, from the most obvious (like wages, interest and dividends) to the least (like employer contributions to health plans, overseas earnings and growth in retirement accounts). According to that measure -- used by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution -- the top 1 percent includes about 1.13 million households earning an average income of $2.1 million.
Raising their total tax burden to, say, 40 percent would generate about $157 billion in revenue the first year. Increasing it to 45 percent brings in a whopping $276 billion. Even taking account of state and local taxes, the average household in this group would still take home at least $1 million a year.
If the tax increase were limited to just the 115,000 households in the top 0.1 percent, with an average income of $9.4 million, a 40 percent tax rate would produce $55 billion in extra revenue in its first year.
That would more than cover, for example, the estimated $47 billion cost of eliminating undergraduate tuition at all the country's four-year public colleges and universities, as Senator Bernie Sanders has proposed, or Mrs. Clinton's cheaper plan for a debt-free college degree, with money left over to help fund universal prekindergarten.
A tax rate of 45 percent on this select group raises $109 billion, more than enough to pay for the first year of a new $2,500 child tax credit introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.
Move a rung down the ladder and expand the contribution of those in the 95th to 99th percentile -- who earn on average $405,000. Raising their total tax rate to 30 percent from a quarter of their total yearly income would generate an additional $86 billion. That's enough to cover the cost over eight years of repealing the so-called Cadillac Tax on high-cost health plans, which Senator Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have endorsed.
A 35 percent share produces $176 billion -- roughly the amount that the Federal Highway Administration has estimated is needed each year to improve conditions significantly on major urban highways.
Alternatively, those tax increases could be used to help reduce government borrowing: Some combination of those raises could go a long way toward wiping out this year's estimated federal deficit of $426 billion.
"Most economists today would agree that raising taxes modestly would bring in more revenue" without doing any serious damage to the economy, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. The big question is how much is too much, because at some point, higher tax rates would discourage extra investment and work.
All the Republican candidates share the party's traditional opposition to raising taxes on the wealthy, arguing that it would ruin the economy by sopping up money that would otherwise be used to create jobs. Lowering taxes, they say, will unleash a torrent of economic activity that will in the long run spur growth and revenue.
But most mainstream economists, including some on the conservative side of the divide, concede that even with optimistic projections about growth and spending cuts, the Republican plans would leave a whopping budget gap, requiring more borrowing, not less. Revamping the tax code along these lines would also decrease the share paid by those at the top.
The argument for raising tax rates on the rich tends to focus on the vast gains that this group has enjoyed in recent years compared with everyone else. The top 0.1 percent of American families -- each with net assets greater than $20 million -- own more than 20 percent of the all the household wealth in the country. In the 1970s, that same sliver of the population controlled 7 percent.
That shift is behind Senator Sanders's repeated vow to compel Wall Streeters and others in the Rolex-and-Maserati set to pay more than they do now.
"Let me tell you, Donald Trump and his billionaire friends under my policies are going to pay a hell of a lot more in taxes today -- taxes in the future than they're paying today," he declared in Las Vegas.
Middle-income families make substantially less money than they did 15 years ago, once inflation is taken into account. The economist Thomas Piketty blames, among other things, "the spectacular lowering of top income tax rates" for the sharp rise in inequality.
The lower rate -- generally a maximum of 23.8 percent -- on capital gains, or profits from investments, is particularly problematic, Mr. Piketty argues. Estimates show that nearly 70 percent of capital gains benefits go to the top 1 percent. A recent study by Adam Looney at Brookings and Kevin B. Moore at the Federal Reserve found that "the reduction in the long-term capital gains rate is the primary reason" that the income tax system had become less effective in reducing wealth inequality.
Aided by a phalanx of lawyers and accountants, the rich have become adept at figuring out ways to shift earnings that would normally be taxed at the top 39.6 percent rate on ordinary income into capital gains, said the economist Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, who is researching the link between widening inequality and tactics -- legal and illegal -- used by the wealthy to sidestep taxes.
Shifting earnings from one tax category to another is part of the reason that even the top 0.1 percent pay on average no more than a quarter of their income in federal individual income taxes -- despite that top tax bracket of 39.6 percent, according to a Treasury Department analysis.
"Why give a blank check to all of these guys?" Mr. Stiglitz, the liberal economist, asked. He pointed out that current tax law makes no distinction between, say, investing abroad, speculating in land or building a new factory. A better approach, he said, is to say: "We'll give you generous deductions if you invest in America."
Eliminating the preferential rates on capital and dividends would generate $1.34 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Other breaks that critics say subsidize wealth inequality include one that allows people to avoid capital gains taxes on inherited assets. Getting rid of that adjustment would generate $644 billion over a 10-year period, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Ending the deferral on corporate profits kept overseas -- a boon for the wealthy that Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, calls "the biggest corporate loophole" -- would generate $900 billion over 10 years. (Mr. Trump also supports shutting down that deferral.)
Although an overwhelming proportion of Americans complain that many wealthy people don't pay their fair share in taxes, Democratic voters are more likely to be upset about it than Republicans. According to the Pew Research Center survey, nearly three out of every four Democrats said it bothers them "a lot" compared to 45 percent of Republicans.
Yet the problem that any president -- Democrat or Republican -- is going to face in altering the tax code is getting Congress to agree. Researchers have repeatedly found that a top priority of the wealthy is reducing their tax burden and that they largely prefer, unlike a majority of the general public, to cut spending rather than raise taxes.
Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said maneuvering any tax overhaul "through that gauntlet of special interests is a herculean task."

Full text:   At 81, Sara Moore still occasionally drives five blocks to the grocery store in her 1993 Buick, which her son had painted pink for breast cancer awareness. She is a survivor.
She also survives on a Social Security check of just $984 a month. After rent and cable television, she said her largest expense was food. She hunts for specials, like the 10 frozen Lean Cuisine dinners she recently bought for $10. Fresh fruits and vegetables are a splurge, but she said she skips extras like ice cream.
"I just manage," said Ms. Moore, of Chicago, who was a certified nursing assistant before her cancer was diagnosed in 2001. After all her monthly bills are paid -- she also receives food deliveries from a local pantry -- she has roughly $50 left.
Like Ms. Moore, millions of retirees rely heavily on modest checks from Social Security. The average monthly benefit is $1,337, and about 64 percent of beneficiaries older than 65 receive at least half of their income from the program, according to the Social Security Administration. For nearly half of unmarried beneficiaries, it accounts for a whopping 90 percent of income.
With the race for the 2016 presidential nominations well underway, candidates have begun floating proposals to shore up the program's finances. For years, most of the plans that have been offered to ensure that the self-financing program can support itself have relied largely on cutting benefits.
But now Democrats like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley are trying to reverse the usual conversation, calling for an expansion of the program by requiring higher-income workers to pay more in payroll taxes, the dedicated tax stream that pays for the benefits.
In contrast, most Republicans, adamantly opposed to any tax increases, continue to offer proposals that focus on cutting benefits, in ways that critics say could harm the most vulnerable retirees, while doing little to overcome the system's financial imbalance.
"Americans are living longer," Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is seeking the Republican nomination, said in a campaign speech in April in New Hampshire. "This is something to celebrate but, at the same time, we can't ignore the real effect that has on Social Security."
In the same speech, Mr. Christie called for gradually raising the retirement age for future retirees, a change championed by several other Republican candidates, including former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio. both of Florida.
But not everyone is living longer. Average life expectancies have grown in the last century, but better-paid, better-educated people tend to live longer than people who earn less. And the gap between them has grown over time, a recent report has shown. In fact, life expectancy has declined slightly for lower earners.
"I have never been a fan of raising the retirement age," said Peter Orszag, a former budget director for President Obama, who recently wrote a congressionally mandated report on Social Security for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
"Anyone who is making the argument that we should raise the retirement age because of an increase in the life expectancy -- that argument, I think, is fundamentally misguided and misleading," Mr. Orszag said. "The average is masking quite different patterns depending where you are on the income distribution."
Each year the "full" retirement age is raised translates into a benefit cut of nearly 7 percent for future retirees who are affected. The full retirement age is already scheduled to rise from 66 to 67 -- for people born after 1959 -- which will hold down benefits for that group.
Consider an individual who would receive a full benefit of $2,000 a month at age 67 under current law. She would receive $1,600 a month at age 67 if the full retirement age were raised to 70, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Instead of receiving $2,480 at age 70 under current law, she would have to wait until 70 to get $2,000.
The fact that people are living longer is not the main reason the Social Security Trust Fund is expected to be depleted by 2034, when incoming payroll taxes may only be enough to pay 79 percent of promised benefits. According to the Social Security Administration, the increase in longevity accounts for 20 percent of the program's long-term shortfall.
The most significant issue, according to Stephen C. Goss, the agency's chief actuary, is that fewer workers are paying taxes into the program -- given a lower birthrate -- while more retirees are collecting their checks.
Though presidential candidates from opposing parties have starkly different approaches to closing that gap, most Americans, across the ideological spectrum, are opposed to any further benefit reductions, according to a Pew Research Center poll last year. Over all, more than two-thirds said that benefit cuts should not be an option. And majorities in every group, including nearly 59 percent of "consistently conservative" individuals, agreed.
Aware of the public opposition to cuts in Social Security, Governor Christie has emphasized a feature of his plan that eliminates benefits for the wealthiest Americans, arguing that will help ensure the program's survival for younger workers. But many of his proposals amount to a series of cuts that do little to improve the program's more immediate solvency issues, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute.
"The Christie proposal does nothing to help Social Security's solvency problems before 2034, when current law trust fund balances are projected to be depleted," said Karen Smith, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, who ran the analysis. "His proposal reduces program revenue and does not reduce benefits enough soon enough to make Social Security solvent."
It would help lower costs for future generations, in part by gradually raising the full retirement age by two months a year, beginning in 2022, until it reaches 69. Governor Christie would also gradually increase the early retirement age to 64 from 62, which is when retirees can now begin claiming benefits at a reduced rate. Separately, to encourage older people to work longer, he would eliminate payroll taxes for those over age 62.
His plan also introduces a means test: Future retirees with retirement income of more than $80,000 -- outside of Social Security benefits -- would receive lower benefits on a sliding scale, with benefits phasing out altogether for those with $200,000 or more. Critics, however, say that move would save very little money, while threatening the broad appeal of the program.
"We should worry about turning a program that has gotten its strength from being a program that everyone pays into and gets benefits out of into a welfare program," said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at the National Women's Law Center. Besides, she added, "you can't get much savings out of means-testing Social Security unless you go after the middle class."
Lastly, Governor Christie would slow the growth of beneficiaries' monthly checks, which rise with inflation so that retirees maintain their purchasing power. He would adopt an inflation measure that is projected to rise about 0.3 percentage points slower each year.
But retiree advocates and other specialists, including some conservatives who want to shave benefits, say the change would hurt the most vulnerable retirees, because they would feel a tighter pinch as they aged.
"If we are going to cut Social Security benefits, and I think we should, I want to cut for the younger retirees who can work longer," said Andrew Biggs, resident scholar of the American Enterprise Institute and a former principal deputy commissioner at the Social Security Administration. "Not those who are older and can't."
Senator Sanders's proposal takes the opposite approach; it would increase retirees' monthly checks. His plan, which would make the trust fund solvent through 2065, would raise payroll taxes on higher-earning households. Now, employees owe payroll taxes of 6.2 percent of their income -- their employers pay another 6.2 percent -- up to the current cap of $118,500 in earnings.
At first, the Sanders plan would not apply payroll taxes to earnings between $118,500 and $250,000, but it would apply to earnings above that amount. Since the payroll cap generally rises over time with average wages, the payroll tax would apply to all earned income within about 18 years. He also calls for adding a separate 6.2 percent tax on investment income for single tax filers with income exceeding $200,000 (or $250,000 for married couples filing jointly).
The extra revenue would pay for raising benefits by roughly $65 a month, as well as for a more generous cost-of living adjustment: He would peg benefits to a new measure of inflation where benefits are estimated to rise about 0.2 percentage points more each year than they do now.
"Sanders's proposals for Social Security certainly go in the right direction and are actually quite mainstream since experts are now considering strengthening and expanding the system," said Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist, professor and commissioner for the Bipartisan Policy Center's retirement security initiative, which is studying the effects of changes to the program. "This is certainly not the time to reduce Social Security benefits."
What would it take to simply preserve the program as is? Raising the payroll tax by three percentage points, to 15.4 percent from 12.4 percent -- or 1.5 percentage point for workers and employers -- would shore up the system for the next 75 years, according to Ms. Smith of the Urban Institute. Or immediately eliminating the cap on earnings -- that is, taxing all income above $118,500, as the Medicare levy does -- would close about 88 percent of the shortfall.
For retirees like Ms. Moore who have little savings and no pension, Social Security is the last leg of the retirement stool to lean on. "If I didn't have Social Security," she said, "I would be doing a whole lot worse."

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- After the curtain fell on opening night, José Possi Neto, the director of "Nice Work if You Can Get It," climbed to a rooftop terrace above the Teatro Cetip, high atop the traffic-clogged streets of Brazil's largest and wealthiest city, and pushed his way through 150 or so of the glitterati who had gathered to celebrate the show.
Kissing cheeks and accepting praise from fellow members of the musical theater world, he gushed about the talent of his actors. He raved about the quality of Broadway shows that in recent years have flourished here in translation. Then, when asked about the future outlook for musicals, he balked: "Pessimism," he said in Portuguese, has taken root in Brazil.
A decade of economic vibrancy, starting around the turn of this century, enriched Brazilians, who began to flock to Broadway productions, both in New York and in their country. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities became prime destinations for New York producers looking to get more mileage out of their shows. They attracted new audiences from a population of some 200 million who grew up on the music and theatrics of Carnival and the melodrama of telenovelas.
But there are signs that Brazil's musical theater boom is on the wane as the country slips into a deepening recession that began late last year. Unemployment and inflation are on the rise; the economy is expected to shrink this year; and a massive corruption scandal has shaken public confidence.
"We've suffered a lot," said Fernando Alterio, chief executive of Time for Fun, the largest promoter of Broadway musicals in Brazil and the producer of "Nice Work," which starred Kelli O'Hara and Matthew Broderick (and a long list of Gershwin standards) when it opened in New York in 2012.
Before the recession, producers feverishly licensed musicals, and Brazilian television stars clamored for the prestige of starring in a Broadway import or a Brazilian original. As they have in many corners of the globe, "Beauty and the Beast," "Phantom of the Opera" and "The Lion King" raked in millions south of the Equator, and even Broadway flops like "Chaplin" and "Ghost" found audiences here. And as attendance grew, new theaters rose (including one with 1,200 seats that is to open next month), and others were refurbished.
In New York City, Brazilian tourists are among the fastest-growing segments of Broadway ticket buyers, and the second-largest group of overseas visitors to the city. (The British are first, while Brazilian tourists spent an estimated $2.3 billion last year, according to NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing arm.)
But the recession is chipping away at these gains. Producers in Brazil say ticket sales for musicals there have plummeted 20 to 30 percent across the industry this year. Time for Fun will mount fewer Broadway original productions than planned. Other producers are cutting ticket prices, or costs.
The cast of "The Full Monty," which opened in Rio last week, rehearsed in a donated room of a barren mall. The producer and director, Tadeu Aguiar, reused sets and costumes from his other shows -- although the police uniform stripper costumes were created from scratch. Instead of a salary, the cast was offered a cut of the box office. With no union to protect the actors, and unemployment surpassing 8 percent, "there are a lot of people who will do it for nothing," said one actor, André Dias.
The musical -- about unemployed workers in a depressed economy who turn to stripping for a living -- will resonate in today's Brazil, he predicted: "Every Brazilian is trying to reinvent themselves. We are really living the story on the stage."
As the Brazilian real falls against the dollar --
nearly 40 percent over the last year --
fans of Broadway like Vanessa Bloomfield, a 42-year-old forestry engineer from Rio, are finding it harder to travel to New York.
She expressed regret while standing in line alongside her mother at the waterfront Vivo Rio theater in Rio for the opening night of "Chaplin," a biographical musical about Charlie Chaplin that had a short Broadway run.
On two trips to New York since 2011, Ms. Bloomfield said she saw "Avenue Q," "The Lion King," "Mamma Mia!" and "The Phantom of the Opera" (twice).
"I would go right now, but my mom would have to pay for it," she said. "With the inflation, it's just too expensive."
Still, interviews with over a dozen top musical theater producers in the United States, Europe and Brazil reveal that almost all remain bullish about the theater market in the long term. They argue that unlike theatergoers during the last major recession here, 25 years ago, when musicals were still an oddity, the audience is by now well established.
"Brazil has gone through a roller coaster during the last few years," said Peter O'Keeffe, chief content officer at the Netherlands-based Stage Entertainment, which is currently presenting "Sister Act" in São Paulo.
Unalarmed, Mr. O'Keeffe said this was typical of Latin American markets.
"A country drops off the map for a while and then comes back," he explained. "Brazil is one of the strongest countries in Latin America. It's definitely not a death knell by any means."
American and Brazilian musical theater productions have been staged in Brazil for decades, but ticket sales began to rise after a 2001 production of "Les Miserables" in São Paulo, producers said.
Unlike New York, Brazil is not a place where the box office alone can sustain shows. Sponsors -- usually large companies -- underwrite productions with tax-deductible payments to producers, in exchange for publicity.
With sponsorship money drying up, producers are finding it harder to stage challenging work. Ask Cláudio Botelho, who is dropping plans this year to produce "Sweeney Todd," Stephen Sondheim's dark look at a murderous barber.
Sounding not that different from a New York producer, he said: "What sells now are musical comedies with the thrill of a big star. I wouldn't risk doing a different show, and I definitely wouldn't do a sad show at the moment."
Old-fashioned American musicals, like "Nice Work," can still do well, as long as the task of translating English lyrics into Portuguese is done well, said Miguel Falabella, a producer, translator and television actor who plays the lead role of Jimmy Winter in the São Paulo production.
As for the American locations and themes in "Nice Work," there's no need to tinker.
"A millionaire whose father is going to give him his chair in the Senate, and he's marrying a criminal -- that's so Brazilian," Mr. Falabella said. "The audience loves it."

Full text:   United States consumer prices recorded the biggest drop in eight months in September as the cost of gasoline fell, but a steady pickup in the prices of other goods and services suggested that inflation was poised to rise.
There was good news on the labor market. Other data on Thursday showed new applications for unemployment aid fell back to a 42-year low last week. The very low level of layoffs and gradually firming underlying inflation could keep the door open to an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year.
"Today's reports strengthen our view that the U.S. economy remains on the right track and should help to bolster the Fed's confidence that it is getting ever closer to meeting both of its mandates. We expect the first rate hike in December," said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit.Research.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index fell 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the C.P.I. was unchanged for the first time in four months. It rose 0.2 percent in August.
Stripping out food and energy costs, prices rose last month. The so-called core C.P.I. gained 0.2 percent after ticking up 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the core C.P.I. increased 1.9 percent, the largest gain since July 2014, after advancing 1.8 percent in August.
Expectations of a liftoff in the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate have been dealt a blow by an abrupt slowdown in job growth in the last two months and softening economic activity.
The stumble in job growth, however, is at odds with the very low levels of layoffs. In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 255,000 for the week that ended Oct. 10.
Claims were last at this level in July, which was the lowest since November 1973. Nonfarm payrolls growth in August and September averaged 139,000, the weakest two-month rise since January last year.
The slowdown is puzzling given job openings are at record highs. Some economists say the step-down in hiring is because employers cannot find qualified workers for the open jobs.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to the lowest level since December 1973.
While the inflation and jobless claims data allayed some of the concerns about the economy, manufacturing remains a weak spot. Separate reports showed factory activity in New York State and the mid-Atlantic region contracted further in October.

Abstract: The 60 million people on Social Security will not receive any cost-of-living increase in their benefits in 2016, the government said Thursday, but because of a quirk in federal law, nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries could have record increases in their premiums unless Congress intervenes. With millions of older Americans on fixed incomes facing that one-two punch, the Obama administration is urging Congress to stop -- or at least moderate -- the health insurance premium increases, which could raise the cost for some Medicare beneficiaries by about 50 percent -- the largest increase in the history of Medicare.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The 60 million people on Social Security will not receive any cost-of-living increase in their benefits in 2016, the government said Thursday, but because of a quirk in federal law, nearly one-third of Medicare beneficiaries could have record increases in their premiums unless Congress intervenes.
With millions of older Americans on fixed incomes facing that one-two punch, the Obama administration is urging Congress to stop -- or at least moderate -- the health insurance premium increases, which could raise the cost for some Medicare beneficiaries by about 50 percent -- the largest increase in the history of Medicare. But the leadership crisis in the House of Representatives could prove to be an obstacle.
Social Security has provided automatic cost-of-living adjustments in every year since 1975, with exceptions in 2010 and 2011. But inflation was extremely low in the past 12 months, leading to another benefit freeze, Social Security officials said. Gasoline prices, in particular, have declined sharply, holding down overall prices in the economy.
Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, has put a positive spin on the absence of a cost-of-living adjustment. It results, he said, from a "sharp decline in energy prices that is putting more money in families' pockets" and is contributing to the economic recovery.
Many older Americans do not see it that way. "People can afford to drive to the drugstore because gas prices are lower, but once they get there, they may not be able to afford their prescriptions," said Joshua E. Rosenblum, a spokesman for AARP, a lobbying group for older Americans.
With the greater use of medical services by an aging population, health costs have again begun to climb, driven in part by new technology and expensive prescription drugs. Medicare needs additional money to help pay for Part B of the program, which covers doctors' services, outpatient hospital care and some medications.
About 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will be protected against higher premiums in 2016. Under federal law, Medicare premiums are linked closely to Social Security benefits because most people on Medicare have their premiums deducted from their monthly Social Security checks. To protect older Americans, federal law stipulates that, in most cases, the increase in a person's Medicare premium cannot exceed the increase in the person's Social Security benefit. The purpose of this "hold harmless" provision is to prevent a reduction in Social Security benefits.
But by shielding 70 percent of beneficiaries from premium increases, that same law exposes the other 30 percent to price shocks. Medicare actuaries predicted in July that the standard premium for those beneficiaries would rise next year to $159 a month, from a little less than $105 a month for most beneficiaries, the same as in 2013 and 2014.
The actuaries also predicted an increase in the annual deductible for Part B of Medicare, to $223 next year, from $147 in 2015. Beneficiaries generally must pay the deductible before Medicare begins to pay.
Premiums are supposed to cover about one-fourth of the projected cost of Part B of Medicare, with general revenues accounting for the remainder. If premiums are frozen for 70 percent of beneficiaries, higher overall Medicare costs must be spread across a smaller group of people.
That smaller group, of more than 15 million, includes some high-income Medicare beneficiaries who are already required to pay higher premiums and may be able to afford the price increase. It also includes beneficiaries who are new to Medicare in 2016; those who do not receive Social Security checks; and low-income people eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, whose premiums are paid by state Medicaid programs.
Even some affluent beneficiaries could struggle with the higher costs. For those with incomes of more than $214,000 a year, Medicare actuaries say, premiums next year could exceed $500 a month, up from about $335, if Congress does not change the law. Financially struggling state governments are expressing concern because they are responsible for many low-income beneficiaries. The National Governors Association estimates that the higher premiums will cost states $2.3 billion next year.
In the absence of legislative action, the White House faces a choice between two politically perilous options. It could authorize a big increase in Medicare premiums for those 15 million. Or it could authorize the secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, to take money from Medicare's "contingency reserve," which serves as a cushion in case actual spending is higher than projected. The contingency fund is already lower than the level recommended by Medicare's actuaries.
The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio had been quietly exploring a deal to limit the increase in Medicare premiums.
But with turmoil in Republican leadership ranks, touched off by Mr. Boehner's plan to retire this month, Congress is barely able to function. He has insisted that the cost of legislation to stabilize premiums, estimated at $7.5 billion to $10 billion, be offset by savings elsewhere in the federal budget.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, said any solution should be "fiscally responsible."
Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats sounded an alarm last week and placed the onus on Republicans.
"For the past month," Ms. Pelosi said, "we have been reaching out to the Republicans to say, 'This deadline is racing toward us.' We must act so that we stop the pain that will be inflicted upon our seniors."
Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, said: "This is a disaster for many older Americans. I get panicked phone calls to my office, begging us to act."
Ron Thompson, the president of the Virginia Alliance for Retired Americans, said the higher premiums would put "too much of a burden on seniors."
"Health care costs are going up," Mr. Thompson said, "but the federal government is saying seniors do not need a cost-of-living increase next year."
The Social Security Act specifies a formula for determining the cost-of-living adjustment based on a broad measure of consumer prices for urban wage earners and clerical workers, but older Americans say this measure of inflation does not fully reflect price increases for the goods and services they use. Older Americans typically devote more of their budgets to medical care.
State governments, too, say they cannot absorb the hit.
"The cost of protecting Medicare beneficiaries should be borne by the federal government rather than placed on the backs of states," Dan L. Crippen, the executive director of the governors association, said last week in a letter to congressional leaders.

Signals for Economy in Weak Retail Sales

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Retail sales in the United States barely rose in September, and producer prices recorded their biggest decline in eight months, data released on Wednesday showed.
The weak reports were the latest suggestion that the economy was losing momentum in the face of slowing global growth, a strong dollar, an inventory correction and lower oil prices, which are hampering capital spending in the energy industry. Job growth braked sharply in the last two months.
The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month largely as cheaper gasoline pushed service station receipts down 3.2 percent. Giving the report a weak tone, sales in August were revised downward to show them unchanged instead of rising 0.2 percent.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services slipped 0.1 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in August.
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously said to have advanced 0.4 percent in August.
Last month's weak core sales and the downward revision to August's figure, together with another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories again unchanged in August, prompted JPMorgan to cut its estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product by half a percentage point, to an annual rate of 1 percent.
The economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter. Some economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the soft retail sales report, noting that discretionary spending remained fairly healthy.
Consumers bought more automobiles and furniture and spent more on hobbies, clothing and eating out. Those increases point to underlying strength in domestic demand, which should provide some cushion against softening global growth.
"The overall message is that consumer spending has remained extremely strong," said Harm Bandholz, a chief economist at UniCredit Research.
Sales of electronic goods were soft despite the introduction of Apple's latest iPhone.
A report from the Federal Reserve showed that the economy was expanding modestly from mid-August through early October. It described consumer spending as growing "moderately" during the same period and noted that the strong dollar was hurting manufacturing.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index fell 0.5 percent in September, the largest drop since January, after being unchanged in August.
In the 12 months through September, the index fell 1.1 percent after declining 0.8 percent in August. It was the eighth consecutive 12-month decrease in the index.
Weak inflation is one of the obstacles confronting Fed policy makers, who are contemplating raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since late 2008.
"It is the uncertain course of inflation that could keep the Fed from hiking rates this year," said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.
Top Fed officials are divided on whether to tighten monetary policy, with Daniel K. Tarullo, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, saying on Tuesday that the central bank should not increase rates this year.
The Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, have recently said they support raising rates this year.
"Unfortunately," Mr. Naroff said of the Fed policy makers, "the gang that cannot communicate straight is still sending out as many unclear signals as possible."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Daniel K. Tarullo, a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, said on Tuesday he did not "expect that it would be appropriate" for the Fed to start raising its benchmark rate this year, breaking with the stated position of the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Mr. Tarullo spoke, in an interview with CNBC, less than 24 hours after another Fed governor, Lael Brainard, expressed similar hesitation in a speech Monday afternoon.
The comments by two officials on the Federal Open Market Committee who rarely speak publicly about monetary policy suggested that Ms. Yellen is facing growing internal opposition to the view she expressed last month that it will probably make sense to start raising rates this year to maintain control of inflation.
"Yellen appears to have a revolt on her hands," said Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon who follows the central bank closely. "She now faces the prospect of multiple dissents from the dovish wing of the F.O.M.C. if she insists on pushing through with a rate hike this year. Such a split decision would not enhance the institution's credibility."
Ms. Brainard, a former Obama administration official who joined the Fed in 2014, and Mr. Tarullo, an adviser to Mr. Obama's first presidential campaign before joining the Fed in 2009, both have roots in the world of Democratic economic policy making.
Leading members of that community, including the Harvard economist Lawrence H. Summers, have sharply criticized the Fed's movement toward raising interest rates. Those critics have coalesced around a fairly uniform set of concerns that appear to resonate with Ms. Brainard and Mr. Tarullo.
The differences, however, remain relatively narrow and could be resolved by new rounds of economic data in the coming months. Slower growth could persuade Ms. Yellen -- who also has strong Democratic credentials and was a chief economic adviser to President Bill Clinton -- to wait a little longer. Better news or rising inflation could persuade the skeptics to move more quickly.
Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said that despite the fragmentation of the policy making committee, he expected Ms. Yellen and her right-hand man, Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Fed, to maintain control.
"We still believe the Yellen-Fischer leadership can pull the committee together for a December liftoff, but in the interim the communications may continue to sound inharmonious," he wrote Tuesday.
The Fed has held short-term rates near zero since 2008 to stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. Now, in the sixth year of a slow-but-steady expansion, officials are debating the right moment to start raising rates.
The Fed could stall the economy if it scares borrowers by raising rates too quickly. Waiting too long could also end badly if inflation starts to rise or speculative asset bubbles pop.
In a major speech last month, Ms. Yellen said continued job growth was likely to lead to higher inflation, and the Fed planned to start raising rates this year. She spoke before the government estimated the economy added just 142,000 jobs in September. But in a speech on Sunday, Mr. Fischer said he still expected the Fed to move this year.
The most likely date is the final 2015 meeting of the Fed's policy making committee on Dec. 15 and 16. Fed officials have said they are not likely to act at the committee's Oct. 27 and 28 meeting.
Other officials have lined up in favor of an increase sooner rather than later. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond, Va., Fed, voted to raise rates at the September meeting. James B. Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said Tuesday that it would be "prudent" to start this year.
The Fed said Tuesday, in a scheduled release, that eight of the 12 regional reserve banks had supported a September increase in a secondary but symbolic rate called the discount rate.
Two Fed officials were already on the record as opposing a rate increase this year: Charles L. Evans, the Chicago president, and Narayana Kocherlakota, the Minneapolis president. But regional Fed presidents often take public stands. The Washington-based governors like Mr. Tarullo and Ms. Brainard seldom do.
The unemployment rate is approaching a normal level by historical standards, but by other measures the labor market remains weak. Moreover, the historical pattern that inflation rises as unemployment falls -- a relationship that economists call the Phillips Curve -- has weakened in recent years. Inflation is also being suppressed by other forces, including a strong dollar, low energy prices and what Mr. Tarullo described as a "globally disinflationary environment."
"I don't think anybody knows how much more progress could be made in a noninflationary fashion," he said Tuesday. "My own perspective is that one should watch to see some tangible evidence that inflation would return to target."
He said the Fed could not easily correct its mistake if it moved too soon and growth stalled.
Ms. Brainard would not say when she expected to start raising rates, but she expressed even stronger reservations than Mr. Tarullo that strong job growth was a sufficient reason to do so as long as inflation is quiescent.
"I do not view the improvement in the labor market as a sufficient statistic for judging the outlook for inflation," she said. "A variety of econometric estimates would suggest that the classic Phillips Curve influence of resource utilization on inflation is, at best, very weak at the moment."
Ms. Yellen said in September that if the Fed waited to raise rates and then was forced to increase rates more sharply to control inflation, it "would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession."
Ms. Brainard said she was not overly concerned the Fed might wait too long.
"We have well-tested tools to address such a situation," she said, "and plenty of policy room in which to use them."

Abstract: Energy stocks slumped as the price of oil fell sharply after a report that showed OPEC members are keeping up production even after a big drop in prices over the last year. Most of the advance came after a disappointing jobs report which suggested the Federal Reserve could postpone a long-anticipated interest rate rise for several months.

Full text:   U.S. stocks edged higher Monday on a quiet day for the market ahead of a busy weak for corporate earnings.
EMC climbed after Dell said it would acquire the data storage company for $67 billion. Energy stocks slumped as the price of oil fell sharply after a report that showed OPEC members are keeping up production even after a big drop in prices over the last year.
Investors will be focusing on corporate earnings this week as they try to assess the effect that slowing global growth is having on company profits. Analysts are projecting that earnings contracted more than 5 percent in the third quarter as overseas demand weakened.
JPMorgan Chase, Intel and Johnson & Johnson are among companies that will publish their earnings in coming days.
While the stock market was open Monday, bond trading was closed in observance of the Columbus Day holiday.
"The market is trading in a holiday mode," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. "We could see some hefty gyrations as earnings season moves into full gear."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,017.46. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 47.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,131.86. The Nasdaq climbed 8.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,838.64.
Energy stocks dropped the most among the 10 industry sectors of the S.&P. 500 as the price of crude fell sharply.
Oil dropped as a report showed that OPEC members were keeping up production even after a big drop in prices. Benchmark U.S. crude fell $2.53 to close at $47.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell $2.79 to $49.86 a barrel in London.
The slide in crude prices since last year is having a big impact on corporate earnings.
Over all, earnings are forecast to slide by 5.3 percent, compared with the same period last year. But much of that decline is due to a big slump in energy company profits. Earnings in the energy sector are forecast to slide by 66 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Still, some analysts are confident that the outlook for companies will improve next year, as demand revives overseas and improving consumer confidence boosts the U.S. economy.
"This earnings season will be a confirmation process. Yes, we have low inflation and yes, we are growing very moderately, but fairly dependably," said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "It will be O.K., it won't be great, but I think we can look forward to better earnings growth in 2016."
Gains were also muted as the stock market was coming off its biggest week of the year.
Most of the advance came after a disappointing jobs report which suggested the Federal Reserve could postpone a long-anticipated interest rate rise for several months. That thought was reinforced Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed policy makers were too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.
Low rates can help boost stocks by reducing returns on fixed-income investments such as bonds. They also make it easier for companies to borrow in the bond markets, giving them funds to buy back their own stock.
On Monday, drugmaker Eli Lilly was among the day's biggest losers. The stock dropped after it said it was halting development of evacetrapib, a drug that was intended to treat patients with high-risk heart disease. The stock fell $6.70, or 7.1 percent, to $79.44.
Data storage company EMC was a winner. The stock climbed 51 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $28.37 after Dell said it was acquiring the company in a deal valued at about $67 billion. Since going private in 2013, Dell has been investing in research and development and expanding its software and services business.
In metal trading, gold closed up $8.60 at $1,164.50 an ounce. Silver rose 4.6 cents to $15.86 an ounce and copper was little changed at $2.42 per pound.
The dollar declined to 120.02 yen. The euro rose to $1.1364.
In other futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline fell 7.6 cents to close at $1.341 a gallon; heating oil fell 8.9 cents to close at $1.502 a gallon; and natural gas rose 3.3 cents to close at $2.535 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text:   Nobel in Economics to be Awarded
The last of the 2015 Nobel laureates will be named on Monday when the memorial prize in economics is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The economics prize is different because it was not created by Alfred Nobel; it was established in 1968 by Sweden's central bank.
The winner has usually been an American man, but last year, the committee honored Jean Tirole, a French economist, for his work on effective regulation of imperfect markets. --Binyamin Appelbaum
Big Test for Greece
The new Greek government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will face a major test this week when a barrage of economic reforms and austerity measures demanded by Greece's international creditors will need to be voted on to become law.
Legislation detailing dozens of actions -- from liberalizing the Greek energy market to imposing stricter criteria for the protection of indebted homeowners -- is expected to be submitted to Parliament on Monday; a vote is due by the end of the week.
Approval of the measures is required to unlock a loan installment of 2 billion euros from Greece's third bailout, worth [euro]86 billion, or about $98 billion, that was signed by eurozone finance ministers in August after several months of turbulent negotiations. --Niki Kitsantonis
Big Banks to Report Results
Almost all of the big banks will report their third-quarter financial results this week. JPMorgan Chase will go first Tuesday afternoon -- a deviation from its normal morning earnings announcement. Analysts are expecting that JPMorgan will report lower revenue and profits than it did for the same period last year.
Wall Street banks have warned that their results will be hobbled by difficult trading conditions in recent months, as global economic instability has returned to the fore. The expectation that the Federal Reserve will wait longer before raising interest rates is also crimping the profits that banks are expecting to make from loans. --Nathaniel Popper
Meeting on Tech in Europe
Senior European officials and technology executives will gather in Brussels on Tuesday to address how the region has dealt with a number of issues, including a perception in the United States that Europe has used recent investigations into technology companies like Google and Facebook to give local competitors an advantage. European officials have denied that.
Attendees of the annual meeting will discuss jump-starting investment in Europe's lagging telecom industry, as well as how large American tech companies can operate across the 28-member bloc. --Mark Scott
First Data to Go Public
First Data Corporation, which processes more than 40 percent of electronic payments in the United States, is expected to price its initial public offering on Wednesday in what could be the largest I.P.O. of the year.
Backed by the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, First Data has been marketing 160 million shares for $18 to $20 apiece, indicating an offering size of $3 billion, at the midpoint, and a valuation of $16.7 billion. The stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FDC, will begin trading on Thursday. --Leslie Picker
Data on Consumer Spending
Figures due from the Commerce Department on Wednesday are expected to show that consumer spending increased modestly in September, as strong auto sales offset the effect of lower gasoline prices and weakening spending in other retail categories. Analysts predicted that overall retail sales increased 0.2 percent from the previous month, though that figure could dip into negative territory if auto sales are excluded.
Retailers are looking to the holiday season to bolster a choppy year for sales. Even so, the National Retail Federation, a trade group, said last week that it expected sales in November and December to rise by 3.7 percent, to $630 billion, less than last year's 4.1 percent gain. --Hiroko Tabuchi
Netflix's First Original Feature Film
It's show time this week at Netflix. Its first original feature film, "Beasts of No Nation," about a child soldier in West Africa, is scheduled to make its global debut on Friday on the streaming service and select theaters in the United States. The film kicks off Netflix's foray into original movies. Other projects in the works for Netflix include four Adam Sandler films, the first of which will be available in December. The sequel to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" will be available globally in 2016.
Also this week, Netflix will report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Investors will be looking for updates on the company's aggressive global expansion as well as how it plans to continue to grow in the United States, where its business is more mature. Last week, Netflix increased the price of its most popular plan, which offers two simultaneous streams, by $1, to $9.99, for new customers. Other plans remained unchanged at $7.99 and $11.99. --Emily Steel
C.P.I. Report
On Thursday, the Labor Department will report the data for the Consumer Price Index in September. There have been few signs of inflation lately, and economists expect the overall C.P.I. to fall by 0.2 percent, a decrease driven mostly by lower gasoline prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices will probably show a 0.1 percent rise, which is also considered tame in terms of inflation. --Nelson D. Schwartz
G.E. to Announce Results
More industry, less finance. That has been the story at General Electric for a while now, and analysts expect more of the same when G.E. reports its third-quarter results Friday morning. G.E.'s management has argued that the company deserves more credit from Wall Street for its postfinancial crisis transformation, a shift away from finance and toward its industrial businesses.
The activist investor Nelson Peltz agrees. He announced a friendly $2.5 billion investment last week, which helped increase G.E.'s share price by 10 percent. --Steve Lohr
Consumer Sentiment
On Friday, the University of Michigan will report its preliminary reading on consumer sentiment for the month of October. Economists expect consumer sentiment to move higher from September's level of 87.2, which suffered as Wall Street markets fell and growth overseas slowed.
With stocks recovering somewhat since the beginning of the month, and gas prices falling, consumers may be feeling reassured about the economy's prospects. --Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text:   The Federal Reserve's decision not to raise its target interest rate drew plenty of attention last quarter, but the real news for bond investors was what actually did happen.
Namely, high-quality bonds delivered on their core role as life jacket in residence for diversified portfolios.
When the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12 percent from late July to late August, the $170 billion invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund and exchange-traded fund gained nearly 0.8 percent.
Among actively managed funds, the $98 billon Pimco Total Return bond fund shed less than a half a percent and the $67 billion Metropolitan West Total Return bond fund gained 0.4 percent.
The calm before the storm, you say? After all, the Federal Reserve didn't cancel a rate increase, but for the umpteenth time just pushed it out a bit further.
True, but the timing of the first move is far less important than the magnitude of what comes after. And that's not looking nearly as ominous as what has been predicted by the bond fearmongers for the last seven years.
At a news conference last month, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said that even after the initial increase, policy "will likely remain highly accommodative for quite some time."
The plain-English translation: We want to start moving our target rate from the zero level that has been in place since the financial crisis, but we are in no rush to move it much, or move it fast, given that there's no sign of our economy overheating.
In its latest communiqué the Fed indicated that it did not expect its target interest rate to exceed 2.6 percent before 2018.
"This next cycle of rising rates is going to be far more benign than past cycles," says Ford O'Neil, lead manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Total bond fund (and its E.T.F. clone) and a 25-year bond market vet.
That suggests long-term investors using core bond funds as portfolio diversifiers might benefit from tuning out all the anxiety about the coming rate rise.
Total returns will indeed probably dip into negative territory when rates do begin to rise. Bond fund and E.T.F. total returns are the sum of interest payouts and price changes. When yields rise, prices fall. But the damage should be a bruised elbow, not a trip to the emergency room.
Since 1926, there have been just five periods when intermediate-term Treasury prices fell more than 5 percent -- the average was a 7 percent loss over 11 months -- but losses were recouped in three to seven months, according to Morningstar. Not exactly an eternity if you're a long-term investor.
But it might feel like one along the way. Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, which manages more than $140 billion in United States bond portfolios, including the MetWest Total Return bond fund, says that after seven years of extremely low volatility courtesy of the Federal Reserve's spurring a big borrowing boom -- releveraging, in marketspeak -- he expects volatility to snap back "like a jack-in-the-box" when the bond market begins its march to normalization.
MetWest Total Return shifted to a "risk off" stance 18 months ago, given a dearth of compelling values and the fact that "long releveraging cycles don't go on forever," Mr. Rivelle said. The fund's current average five-year duration, a measure of sensitivity to changes in interest rates, is more conservative than the 5.6 years for the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate bond index. And while up to 20 percent of the fund can be invested in high-yield bonds, it currently has less than 5 percent riding on so-called junk.
Thomas H. Atteberry, manager of FPA New Income, is always worried about risk. For decades the fund has been able to deliver on its two mandates: deliver a positive return over 12 months, and over a five-year stretch generate an annualized return that is at least one percentage point better than inflation. But right now the fund's five-year return is running about a quarter of a percentage point above inflation.
"Job 1 is protection of capital, and you can't do that and generate higher returns, given that risk-free Treasuries are yielding less than inflation," Mr. Atteberry said. Treasuries maturing in fewer than 10 years currently pay less in interest than the inflation rate. FPA New Income's average duration is below 1.5 years.
Research Affiliates, which designs asset allocation and index strategies, expects even core bond funds to outpace inflation by only one percentage point annually over the next 10 years. (Before you groan at that, consider that the firm estimates the S.&P. 500's annualized real return will also be around 1 percent.)
If you want your bond portfolio to have a shot at generating higher payouts, you may need to venture out into riskier fare like junk bonds and emerging-market debt, which tend to suffer big declines when turmoil hits. The International Monetary Fund last month cited growing concern about the liquidity of such bonds, which aren't as easy to trade as Treasuries.
Mutual funds and E.T.F.s own a hefty share of them, and the worry is that if too many investors want to sell their shares the next time the markets hit trouble, the funds could push bonds into a downward spiral, sending prices even lower.
The Loomis Sayles Bond Fund has the leeway to venture far afield from the high-grade United States issues at the heart of core bond funds, in search of higher income and returns.
Over the last 15 years, the fund's 8 percent annualized gain has performed three percentage points better than the average core bond fund. A co-manager, Elaine Stokes, says the fund is currently near its 35 percent maximum allocation in high-yield bonds, a position that grew late last year when the commodity sell-off created better values.
The fund also has a small slug of dividend-paying stocks, convertibles and some foreign government bonds. That generates a current yield of close to 4 percent, nearly double the income payout for core bond funds.
Loomis Sayles sees a potentially valuable silver lining if pockets of the bond market indeed have liquidity problems. When trouble hits, the free-ranging team anticipates it will be able to buy "fundamentally strong credits at significant discounts."
But a seatbelt is required for times when market volatility perks up. Last quarter the fund lost more than 4 percent, as riskier bonds were yanked down in the face of global growth concerns. Similar multisector bond funds lost 2.6 percent on average.
Perhaps the best risk-reward trade-off right now is municipal bonds. Yields are in line with what Treasuries currently pay out, and that's before you factor in the tax break if you're investing in a taxable account.
The 1.8 percent current yield for the high-grade Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt fund is the equivalent of 2.5 percent if your federal tax bracket is 28 percent.
For investors in the 35 percent tax bracket, the effective yield is 2.8 percent. That puts you well ahead of the 2.1 percent yield for the taxable Vanguard Total Bond Market index fund.

Full text:   Ken Ard, South Carolina's former lieutenant governor, has an accent that is the audio equivalent of a chummy slap on the back. Everything he says sounds folksy and congenial. This is true even when he is berating Washington's political establishment, which he does often these days as the host of a morning show on Live 95.3, a talk-radio station in Florence, S.C.
"There is a large part of me that wants to blow it up," he said on air recently. "That's the Donald Trump side. A large part of me says, 'Hey, man, we've got a plutocracy that's bought and sold to special interests. It's crony capitalism.' And here comes this crazy fool that doesn't stand anywhere on any policy other than all over the place. But I believe he'd blow up the building."
By "the building," Mr. Ard means the federal political system, broadly speaking. Though he joked that if Mr. Trump blew up the White House, he'd construct a hotel on the premises and then crow about it: "He'd say, 'That's one of the great addresses of all time, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and I've got a property there.' "
Mr. Ard's co-host, Dave Baker, chuckled. Then Mr. Ard turned more serious.
"What I struggle with is, how bad do I want to blow it up?" he asked. "Or am I willing to do more like a cruise ship and turn it a little bit at a time?"
At the moment, Republican voters seem to favor the more eruptive option. That's one explanation for the popularity of Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson, who are now collectively the choice of about 50 percent of registered Republican voters, according to a variety of national polls. The three candidates are free of the stigma of elective office. If Washington is the problem, goes the thinking, the solution is sure to come from somewhere else.
Anti-establishment fervor has been a recurring theme in American politics for decades. Its catalysts seemed more obvious in the run-up to the two previous presidential elections, when the economy was entering the Great Recession in 2008, or coping with its aftermath in 2012. Economic despair is a potent political force. But we're now a few years into a recovery, the economy is expanding, albeit modestly, and the jobless rate has dropped to 5.1 percent from a peak of 10 percent in 2009. This makes the indignation of voters a little mystifying.
Until you listen to indignant voters. Despite the still nascent recovery, a huge number of people in the middle and lower classes say their wages have not budged in years. For most Americans who are paid by the hour, wages have either fallen or remained flat for more than a decade, according to a report issued by the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-labor think tank based in Washington. The institute called wage stagnation "the country's central economic challenge."
"It tends to be assumed that if we have growth, people's hourly wages will improve," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the institute. "In fact, that has not been the case since 2002, whether you have a college degree or not. And for the most part, this issue has not been confronted by economic policy makers."
On the Democratic side, there have been speeches by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who has spoken about wage stagnation, largely in the context of wealth inequality. But the topic matters to Republicans, too. When asked in a poll to choose one issue that is paramount in deciding their vote, Republicans named the economy and jobs ahead of terrorism, immigration, health care and foreign policy.
But Republican candidates have either ignored the issue or tiptoed around its edges, as Mr. Trump does when he talks about the offshoring of jobs to China and Mexico.
It is an odd mismatch -- flat wages seem to matter a lot to Republican voters, but Republican candidates are all but mum on the subject.
Recently, I visited South Carolina, a reliably red state, to get a better sense of why "anti-politicians" have experienced such a sustained surge in Republican polls. In a week of conversations, I heard much more than just venting about wages. There were lamentations that the United States is headed in the wrong direction, either because of failures by President Obama -- good luck finding fans of his health care reform -- or demographic changes that, in many voters' estimations, are changing the country too quickly. (Even people who said they had no problem with Mexican immigrants worried that the children of these immigrants would eventually tilt elections in favor of Democrats.) There was a lot of talk about dysfunction and stasis in Washington, as well as concerns about the national debt and annual deficits. Others fretted that the United States now plays a diminished role on the world stage.
The mood was pretty glum, and this was before a deluge of rain shut down highways and flooded the state.
Along with social and political grievances, the economy in general and flat wages in particular came up time and again. They are part of a large inventory of issues that may explain the appeal of outsider presidential candidates, if only because they earn political capital from anything that has people roiled, because they had no hand in policies that led to the roiling.
"I think all three are making a pitch, 'I'm not what you're disgusted with,' " said Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard University. "In the G.O.P. base, there is a strong sense that their own party hasn't done what they wanted them to."
The same day that Mr. Ard wondered whether to raze Washington or nudge it in a different direction, he had lunch with two friends at Red Bone Alley, a local restaurant. When the subject of wages came up, Mr. Ard started to reminisce in a way that I had heard more than a few times.
"I remember growing up, a man could work at DuPont, a big plant here in town," he said, "and the wife would teach school, and before you knew it, they had a beach house. They'd send a kid to University of South Carolina. They'd send a kid to Clemson. They weren't up to their eyeballs in debt."
"And somewhere in the past 30 years, we've lost that," he said. "I'm not blaming Republicans. I'm not blaming Democrats. But if you're working at DuPont making 50 grand a year, if you're teaching, making 40 grand a year, you're doing all you can to keep your head above water."
"Donald Trump is talking to that family," he continued. "It's the family that says, 'Man, I don't know what else I can do. I can't get ahead.' I think that there is an undercurrent of anger that is far more severe than most politicians ever imagined it was. That's what Trump has tapped into."
>
A few days after that lunch, Mr. Trump appeared in Columbia, the state capital. The event was billed as a town hall, with questions from voters presented by Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina. A near-capacity crowd filled the Koger Center for the Arts, an auditorium that seats about 2,200 people.
On their way into the event, Ray and Melissa Lewie, a married couple, stopped and explained why they were attending.
"We're here to hear what he has to say," said Mr. Lewie, a broad-shouldered man in his early 50s. "I'm so tired of politicians who just do what's in their best interest, to further their career."
"He's not a professional politician," Ms. Lewie said.
As for optimism about the economy, neither of them felt any.
"You watch the news, and day in, day out, you hear people are getting jobs," Mr. Lewie said. "I drive a truck for a living, and I drive all around the area, and I don't see it. The economy's growing? Not around here, it isn't."
The Lewies agreed to meet me for dinner a few days later with another couple, their longtime friends Carlos and Leah Veldhoven. Mr. Lewie's verdict on the Trump event? "Unimpressed," he said, an opinion shared by his wife. Both found the hour so bereft of particulars that they could hardly take it seriously.
For five years, Mr. Veldhoven and Mr. Lewie were long-haul trucking partners. "We were driving as a team," said Mr. Veldhoven, at the restaurant Bonefish Grill. "Eight hours on, eight hours off. We could make it from L.A. to New York City in a day and a half, two days."
Mr. Veldhoven eventually quit that job to join a car dealership, where he is now manager of the used-car department. Mr. Lewie became a solo driver of an 18-wheeler, a job that has given him a front-seat view of global economic forces at work. For years, one of his regular assignments was hauling disassembled textile mills to container ports in Charleston, where they were floated to Mexico.
"Before the equipment was taken apart," Mr. Lewie said, "the companies would bring people up from Mexico up to South Carolina to learn the jobs. Everyone knew they were being replaced, but they needed the paycheck, and they'd teach the Mexicans until the place closed down."
Today, Mr. Lewie hauls steel construction rods, about 47,000 pounds of them a day. He is an independent contractor who owns his own truck and gets assignments from a company that keeps 23 percent of the revenue generated by each haul. He gets paid by the mile -- $1.67 -- no matter how many hours he's on the road.
He can burn through up to 600 gallons of fuel a week, a hefty part of his overhead. Fuel prices have come down, which is great news, but maintenance on his truck cost him $26,000 in 2014, and despite low inflation, the price of a new tire has doubled, to $400, in recent years. When we met, he'd earned $1,560 the previous week, before taxes.
This is a good living, but when all the numbers are tallied, Mr. Lewie says he is pocketing the same annual income that he did right before the recession. None of this makes him the least bit interested in Bernie Sanders, the candidate who, at least on paper, seems to speak most directly about what ails Mr. Lewie. There's no way he would vote for someone who calls himself a socialist, Mr. Lewie said. Nor did Mr. Sanders's policies appeal to him, not even raising the minimum wage. Mr. Lewie's hauls come from large corporations, and he worries about their financial health more than any frontline employee's.
"For me to prosper, the economy has to prosper," Mr. Lewie said, "and it's the rich people that produce jobs."
When asked to assign blame for stagnating wages, he and his wife pointed to the federal government. Regulations and high taxes, he said, not lower wages abroad, led those textile mill companies to move to Mexico.
"I was at a mill where the E.P.A. did a walk-around and found oil on the ground and fined the company tens of thousands of dollars," he said. "You go to Mexico, they don't have that." Then again, he acknowledged that he didn't know what Mexican textile workers were paid, making it hard to pinpoint what role wages played in decisions to relocate.
The Lewies and Veldhovens share a visceral dislike for President Obama, and much of their animosity for Washington seems entwined with their ill feelings about the president. The state of the nation, in their eyes, was at an all-time low.
"I think we're at the bottom," Ms. Lewie said. "It's everything. Taxes, the economy, the government."
"Our money is being wasted, wasted, wasted," she added. "And now we're paying more and more, and our debts are going up and up, and we need to stop the debt. We have to find someone that's going to actually take control and say, 'Stop spending.' "
Her husband said, "I don't think it could get any worse."
"The government is taking 39 percent now," said Mr. Lewie, a little morosely, referring to the top income tax bracket. Not for the first time during the meal, he worried that high taxes would discourage the wealthy from producing jobs. "If they want 45 percent, they'll take that and spend more. If they want 60 percent, they'll take that and spend more. How much is enough?"
The Lewies haven't settled on a candidate. But they know that their choice would probably be someone who had never worked in Washington.
>
There are political scientists who believe that neither the economy nor paychecks actually motivate voter behavior. They say cultural and social issues, like race relations, immigration and same-sex marriage, are the principal drivers of political choices.
"It's this sense, said Christopher S. Parker, of the University of Washington, "that the country is not what it used to be."
In South Carolina, it is certainly true that holding a dim view of the federal government is something of a tradition. In the span of five days, three different people remarked that South Carolina fired the first shots in the Civil War. Pollsters say that any optimism about the economy here is regarded as the work of state politicians who have succeeded despite the Democrat in the White House.
"When you hear any confidence among Republicans," said Scott Huffmon, a professor at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., "none of it is attributed to the Obama administration. It's sort of like, 'Thank God we have a wall of conservative protection to keep Obama from pushing through.' "
Florence County, which has a population of about 140,000, has lured some large companies, including Otis Elevator, QVC and General Electric, through aggressive economic outreach and statewide laws that strongly discourage unionization. And some of the county's 19th-century buildings are being renovated, including a 50,000-square-foot project that includes condos, a restaurant and a rooftop bar.
The counties that surround Florence, however, are ailing. The unemployment rate in nearby Marion County, for instance, is about 9.5 percent. And in addition to those seeking jobs, there are the so-called discouraged workers who have stopped looking. Nationwide, there are about seven million or eight million discouraged workers, said Timothy Kane, an economist at the conservative think tank the Hoover Institution.
"If supply of labor is ample," he added, "there is no wage pressure. It's not a coldhearted attitude to say that employees will be paid what they're worth to a firm."
That ethos explains the mind-set about wages at McCall Farms, a fruit and vegetable canning company in Effingham, about 10 miles from Florence. The company operates a one-million-square-foot factory, selling 60 items -- sweet potatoes, string beans, peaches, apple sauce, and so on -- to supermarket chains.
"We try to add five or six new products a year," said Henry Swink, the company's 70-year-old co-owner. It is a low-margin business, about 2 or 3 percent, and prices haven't risen much in recent years. But McCall, which is privately held, has done well, Mr. Swink said, though he declined to go into the details. He did, however, explain how McCall has grown.
"We've invested heavily in our plant," he said. Specifically, McCall has been upgrading the machines that put lids on cans, and McCall now cans 600 products a minute, double the rate of a few years ago.
McCall has also been buying up less nimble rivals -- in effect, acquiring their product lines and customers. Interest rates have remained low, a boon to a business that needs to borrow money to invest in equipment. Volume and productivity are up. That means more revenue and profits.
On the labor side, the picture is different. The company's payroll has doubled, to 1,000 employees, in recent years, about 80 percent of whom are hourly earners, Mr. Swink said. They average about $12.50 an hour.
"They've been given a cost-of-living increase," he explained. "But that's about it."
McCall has kept wages steady for hourly employees because there has been little competition for their jobs, and thus no upward pressure on their wages.
Their jobs tend to be low skilled -- spotting defective vegetables and removing them from production lines, for instance -- and McCall would have little problem replacing anyone who wanted to leave.
"We do feel some competition for employees," Mr. Swink said. "Honda has opened a plant here. Roche, the pharmaceutical company, is here. But we are able to get the caliber of employees that we need without an issue."
The 20 percent of salaried employees at McCall have fared better. They tend to be in higher-skilled positions in the maintenance or electrical departments, or working with computers. They could easily jump to a different company. In the last eight years or so, those employees have been given raises of about 15 percent.
"I had not thought about it until we discussed it," Mr. Swink said on the phone, in a follow-up conversation. "The average hourly wage earner here, their lifestyle isn't getting better. It's staying the same."
>
Economists differ about what exactly would help raise wages for hourly workers. Progressive economists urge more government intervention; right-leaning economists urge less. The former say that raising the minimum wage would have ripple effects on the paychecks of employees higher on the pay scale. The latter, such as Edward P. Lazear of the Hoover Institution, argue that increased regulations and capital gains taxes are to blame for stagnant wages and suppressed job creation.
The phrase "no silver bullet" came up a lot in discussions on the topic. And the elusiveness of solutions to the wage issue, perhaps, also leads voters to candidates with no Washington experience. In the absence of action and answers, a deep exasperation with the status quo sets in.
The day of that meal at the Bonefish Grill, John Boehner, the House speaker, announced that he would resign from Congress, citing a faction within his party that stood against deal-making of any kind with Democrats. It was a reminder that an insurrectionist, "throw the bums out" movement had, in 2010, put a few dozen Republican lawmakers with Tea Party leanings into office. Some were first-time office seekers; all of them had campaigned against Washington.
Which makes some wonder: Why would yet another populist wave cure what ails the economy? And why isn't anger, like that expressed by the Lewies and the Veldhovens, directed at the Republicans?
"There is anger at the G.O.P.," Mr. Lewie said. "That's why we're not looking at politicians anymore. What has the Tea Party done? I voted for those candidates."
"We want them out," his wife said. "We want people."
But isn't everyone a person until elected, at which point they become a politician?
You can never tell what someone will become after they get into office, Mr. Lewie said. "The ones that are entrenched," he explained, "need to go."

Full text:   A long stretch of unusual calm in the stock market gave way to a succession of violent swings in the third quarter as investors worried that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at last and then were disappointed -- after the briefest spurt of euphoria -- when the Fed demurred.
The net result was the worst quarter in four years, and some strategists predicted further trouble ahead.
"This doesn't end happily," said Komal S. Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, an investment consulting firm. "2016 looks like a volatile and pretty difficult year for markets in the United States and around the globe."
It was certainly a difficult quarter. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 6.9 percent in the three months through September, closing at 1,920, roughly where the benchmark stood in May of last year.
The decline was part of a broader trend toward shunning the risky assets that had been coveted for six-plus years. High-yield bonds fell, as did many commodities.
Treasury prices rose as their yields fell during the quarter, with the return on the benchmark 10-year note dropping to 2.04 percent from 2.35 percent at the end of the previous quarter. Treasuries are often a safe harbor during turbulent market conditions, and with the Fed maintaining its target for short-term rates at zero to 0.25 percent, as it has for nearly a decade, traders saw no reason to expect the outlook for long-term rates to change anytime soon.
The Fed's action, or absence of it, on Sept. 17 and accompanying remarks were as benign as investors possibly could have imagined. The central bank, in its statement and in the news conference held by its chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, highlighted a slightly diminished emphasis on domestic economic growth and inflation and a more pronounced concern about developments abroad.
If Wall Street seems unwilling to take yes for an answer, investment advisers say, it's because the Fed's welcome caution in raising rates is more than offset by the fact that the Fed sees so much to be cautious about.
"The market didn't expect a rate hike, and it didn't get one," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for wealth management at Northern Trust. "The problem is the tone of the minutes and press conference that suggested the Fed is worried more about the global growth outlook than previously. That's really spooking the market."
Laird R. Landmann, co-head of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, agreed that central bankers were unnerving investors and suggested that they might have given themselves the jitters, too.
"There's a mind-set that has developed at the Fed where they're waiting for a perfect moment that never comes," he said.
With or without the Fed's help, enough happened in the third quarter to leave owners of stock funds feeling a bit twitchy. The average domestic portfolio fell 7.8 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by specialists in energy and other natural resources, communications and technology.
Looking at a broad array of American economic indicators, it's hard to see what investors are afraid of. The United States is a paragon of growth, at least by the tepid standards of the last decade, especially the job market. The unemployment rate is hovering just above 5 percent, and the number of job openings hit 5.8 million in July, the most since the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics began reporting the figure in 2000.
"There are yellow lights flashing out there in terms of the global economy, but there's no deterioration in the U.S. economy," said Stephen E. Kylander, manager of the RBC Mid Cap Value fund.
That should be good news for small and medium-size companies. They depend on foreign markets for a smaller proportion of their sales than big companies do, but they benefit just as much from lower interest rates. Yet mid- and small-capitalization funds underperformed in the third quarter: Midcap portfolios lost 9.4 percent and small caps lost 10.8 percent.
One reason for the weakness, Mr. Kylander said, is that while smaller companies tend to have a domestic focus, many would like to gain a foothold overseas and cannot.
But he sees value in market segments that offer decent dividend income, like utilities and commercial real estate investment trusts, and in domestically focused industries like trucking.
Shareholders in international stock funds used the third quarter mainly as an opportunity to sell, driving the average one down 10 percent. Europe displayed newfound stability over the summer as Greece ceased to be an urgent problem for the moment, but that was more than offset by deteriorating conditions in emerging markets. Funds that specialize in Latin America, Asia and diversified emerging markets had average losses of 12.8 percent or more.
Chinese stocks had an awful quarter; funds that focus on the country plunged 20.9 percent. The economic malaise there continued and may have contributed to the decline in American stocks and the limited relief experienced when the Fed stood pat.
Persistent money flows out of China forced its central bank in August to sell nearly $94 billion of foreign-currency reserves, much of it held in United States Treasuries, to try to prop up the currency, the renminbi. That would have produced an effect opposite to quantitative easing -- the Fed's substantial purchases of Treasury bonds that began during the financial crisis, ended about a year ago and are widely seen to have benefited stocks along the way.
China is a huge exporter, and with the decline in the renminbi it has begun to export deflation to other developing countries, forcing them into a difficult, maybe hopeless, position. If they weaken their currencies to match the renminbi devaluation, the burden of their immense dollar-denominated debt will grow when expressed in their own currencies. If they keep their currencies relatively strong, however, their exports will become less competitive.
"There is no room for them to maneuver," Mr. Sri-Kumar said. He expects the developing countries to devalue, even if it leads to credit downgrades, defaults and difficulty in refinancing debt for corporate and government borrowers.
"They will have to go through with it to have fewer negative effects on competitiveness," he predicted.
It's a no-win situation. Mr. Sri-Kumar noted that emerging markets accounted for more than half of global economic output. They're not the small, exotic growth stories of 10 or 20 years ago.
If those countries slow because of this crisis, "eventually it's going to reverberate back to the United States," he said.
Mr. Sri-Kumar predicted a year ago that the Fed would hold rates steady this year, and fragility in the developing world has persuaded him to extend his forecast through 2016. That could leave the stock market in a bad spot, in his view, as investors, desensitized to the putative benefits of ultra-easy monetary policy after nearly a decade, sell into any short-lived rally after the Fed postpones a rate increase, as it did last month.
He recommends sheltering in high-quality bonds and blue-chip stocks that pay generous dividends.
Nothing goes down forever. At some point, perhaps in the first quarter, emerging stock markets will be cheap enough to present a low-risk buying opportunity, he said.
Rebecca H. Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, a firm that advises wealthy families, expects a shorter wait for the Fed to move.
"The Fed is still looking at raising interest rates at some point in the coming months," she said.
Ms. Patterson encourages investors to have a relatively heavy allocation in American stocks while they wait, particularly in financial services and consumer discretionary companies, and remain light in emerging markets and energy. She would also be comparatively light in bonds, although she finds mortgage-backed securities to be sound bets, she said, because they are less sensitive to rising rates and she detects consistent improvement in the housing market.
Ms. Nixon at Northern Trust has a similar view of American and emerging markets: heavy in the first, light in the second. She also advocates a more modest than usual bond allocation. As for the Fed, it "wants to get off the zero," she said, but "the job isn't going to get any easier" given the global backdrop. So "if the Fed hikes, it may be one and done," she said.
Mr. Landmann at TCW contends that the Fed is content to keep rates where they are.
"They're looking for reasons not to tighten," he said. "It's hard to believe, at any given meeting coming up, that we have more than a 50-50 chance of tightening if things stay as they are."
But with rates so low, Mr. Landmann cautioned, if conditions deteriorate in China and elsewhere and begin to weigh more heavily on the American economy and markets, there will be little the Fed can do. For six years, investors have bought stocks after declines. Now might be a good time to sell after rallies, he advised.
"If you're a conservative, value-oriented investor, when prices go up you want to use it as an opportunity to take risk out of your portfolio," he said. "Asset prices can't stay high forever. There may be decent returns for the next quarter as the Fed stays on hold, but even that won't work after a while. The rest of the world may take matters into their own hands. It may not matter what the Fed does."

Abstract: At Anheuser-Busch InBev and in the businesses now in the portfolio of 3G Capital, the private equity group they control, they have jettisoned noncore businesses, sold corporate frills like jets and relentlessly hacked away at seemingly inconsequential costs, limiting the use of printers, unplugging mini-refrigerators and putting executives up in budget hotel chains, sometimes two to a room.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. The beer industry equivalents of the Hatfields and McCoys are doing a mating dance. Anheuser-Busch InBev last week made public a $104 billion offer for its archrival SABMiller, which promptly rejected the price as too low.
There seems little doubt, however, that Anheuser-Busch InBev will keep pushing -- the $104 billion bid was its third since the companies made their courtship known in late September.
Wall Street has long said it was a question of when, not if, Anheuser-Busch InBev would make a play for its giant competitor. That's because the Brazilians who control it, while famous for cutting costs, have yet to demonstrate that they can grow without acquiring other companies.
Under their stewardship, Anheuser-Busch InBev has become decidedly more profitable -- but at the same time has lost market share in many places.
In 2008, Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Beto Alberto Sicupira used InBev, itself an amalgamation of European and Latin American beer brands, to buy Anheuser-Busch. The beer business is where the three men perfected what has become their playbook, which focuses on cost and profits.
At Anheuser-Busch InBev and in the businesses now in the portfolio of 3G Capital, the private equity group they control, they have jettisoned noncore businesses, sold corporate frills like jets and relentlessly hacked away at seemingly inconsequential costs, limiting the use of printers, unplugging mini-refrigerators and putting executives up in budget hotel chains, sometimes two to a room.
They then turned their attention to the supply chain, replacing higher cost inputs with lower cost ones -- thinner glass bottles, cheaper ingredients -- and pressing suppliers to give them twice as long to pay for goods. They also deployed zero-base budgeting, in which departmental managers are allocated a bare minimum each year for basic operations and asked to justify any additional expenses.
Along with cutting costs, they raised prices for products slightly, so that the additional pennies from the sale of each can of, say, Bud Light, fall almost directly to the bottom line.
Those higher prices also help mask what some analysts now say is the flaw in the model: falling market share. Anheuser-Busch sold 107 million barrels of beer in 2008 in the United States when the Brazilian investors acquired it, but it sold just 96 million barrels last year, according to Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication. In almost every year, it has lost nearly one point of market share.
Anheuser-Busch InBev has counted on increasing international sales to offset the declines, and SAB's strong presence in such markets is an asset it covets.
Mainstream beer brands in general have lost ground over that time, and Steven Lipin, a spokesman for 3G, said that Anheuser-Busch's market share had been falling long before the Brazilians bought the company. But Benj Steinman, the publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, said the company's market share was down "only marginally from its peak" before the merger. Budweiser's share had slipped, but Bud Light's growth had offset that decline -- until it, too, began to slip after the merger.
Last year, Anheuser-Busch InBev's sales declined 1.3 percent in North America, where it sold the equivalent of 12.1 billion liters; sales declined 6 percent in Europe, where it sold 4.4 billion liters. Those declines were offset by volume growth in northern Latin America and other emerging markets, according to its financial reports.
In the first half of this year, total beer volumes were down 1.6 percent, according to the company. Yet cash flow and profit margins still expanded.
"They raised prices more than inflation in the early years, which is the best way to leverage profitability when you're cutting costs the way they have," Mr. Steinman said. "That's not working anymore, by the way."
The Brazilian investors behind Anheuser-Busch InBev and 3G declined to answer questions. In an email, a spokeswoman for the company said, "We have created the world's leading brewer, through organic growth as well as industry-changing combinations."
The bid for SAB, with brands that include Miller and Coors, would be industry-changing, and it looks like an attempt to buy sales. "They need a transaction at least every three or four years to get growth," said David Peacock, who was an executive at Anheuser-Busch for 20 years, four of them under the Brazilians' management.
The Brazilian investors have applied the same strategies to the companies they have bought since they formed 3G. Those companies include Heinz, Kraft Foods and Burger King. But 3G's methods have spread far beyond the companies it owns.
Because 3G is seen as always setting the table for an acquisition, every food company considers itself a target and is either scrambling to get its house in order to become more competitive or to prepare for a potential sale.
Mondelez, the food company based in Northfield, Ill. that owns Oreo, Triscuit and Cadbury, has felt the heat from two activist investors -- Nelson Peltz and William A. Ackman -- who have sold other companies to 3G. The company adopted 3G's zero-base budgeting and recently announced 600 layoffs and further cuts to its marketing team.
Campbell Soup and Kellogg have taken similar steps. ConAgra is selling its capital-intensive private-label food business and recently announced it was eliminating 30 percent of its office-based work force, about 1,500 jobs.
The palpitations at America's largest food companies are occurring in part because 3G bought and then merged Kraft and Heinz into a multibillion-dollar food company in just two years.
But 3G may have found its standard tactics less effective at Heinz, which had already gone through several restructurings and sold off many of its least robust businesses when 3G bought it in 2013. Dean O'Hare, former chief executive of the Chubb Group and a member of Heinz's board at the time it was sold to 3G, said the closure of at least one Heinz plant that was attributed to 3G was already underway when it bought Heinz. "I think a lot of the job cuts they made had to do with the fact that Heinz no longer had shareholders and so a lot of corporate staff could be eliminated," Mr. O'Hare said.
3G sold corporate planes and eventually cut more than 7,000 jobs. A familiar pattern quickly emerged, however. In the 52 weeks ending July 12, which roughly corresponded to the second year of 3G's ownership, volume sales of Heinz ketchup fell more than 6 percent, according to IRI, a market research company.
Michael Mullen, a spokesman for Kraft Heinz, disputed IRI's numbers, and offered data from Nielsen, another data and research company, showing that in the 52 weeks that ended Sept. 5, Heinz ketchup's volume sales were down just 1.7 percent. Dollar sales, according to Nielsen and IRI, have risen, an indication of a price increase by Kraft Heinz.
Mr. Mullen said the company had increased spending on television, print and social media advertising by 30 percent in the last two years. "Our strategy is geared toward focused growth and emphasizes fewer, bigger, better innovations to unite Kraft Heinz's teams and efforts," he wrote by email.
Michael Weinstein, who was on the board at Heinz when 3G bought it, said:
"They're much more driven around the bottom line than the top line. Eventually, that can throw a consumer packaged-goods company into an ugly downward spiral that's difficult to get out of unless it makes investments in good marketing and advertising."
At Kraft, 3G's new management meant 2,500 jobs were cut in August and the end of the tradition of free Jell-O in the company's canteens.
Analysts have questioned how many truly significant cuts 3G can make at Kraft before it has to consider another acquisition.
"What I've always wondered is where they are eight years from now," Mr. Peacock, the former Anheuser-Busch executive, said of Anheuser-Busch InBev, "because once you buy SAB, you're kind of done -- there's not much else to buy."
Correction: October 25, 2015, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 11 about Anheuser-Busch InBev's ambitions to acquire a rival, SABMiller, described incorrectly Anheuser-Busch's performance in North America and Europe last year. The company's volume sales -- not its growth -- declined in both those areas.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Import prices in the United States fell only slightly in September, offset by recovering oil prices and suggesting a slowdown in the rate of imported deflation.
American import prices declined only 0.1 percent last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, and import prices, excluding oil, fell 0.2 percent, which was half the pace of the declines in July and August.
Analysts expected overall import prices to decline more.
"Today's report suggests a significant slowing in the rate of imported deflation," said Blerina Uruçi, an analyst at Barclays.
In September, the Federal Reserve held off from raising interest rates largely because a weak global economy and financial market volatility had raised doubts that inflation in the United States would rise toward the Fed's target of 2 percent as expected. A slowdown in the rate of imported deflation may help free the central bank to raise rates.
A surge in the value of the United States dollar last year, propelled by expectations that a strengthening American economy would lead to higher interest rates, has been a factor pushing down inflation, as shown by declines in nonoil import prices.
The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who said late last month that the Fed was likely to raise rates by the end of the year, has argued that the disinflationary impact of imports was bound to fade and that United States inflation would then tend to rise. The data on Friday appeared to confirm that.
Already, declines in oil prices have moderated after a late 2014 plunge, and prices for imported oil rose 1.1 percent in September after declining sharply in August.
Crude oil prices have actually moved higher over the last month. The dollar, which strengthened sharply in the second half of 2014, has weakened since March.
The Labor Department data also showed that the price of imported consumer goods other than cars actually rose 0.1 percent in September, the first gain since February. Imported car prices were flat.
Still, the data also pointed to continuing weakness in global demand that is weighing heavily on American factories and other exporters. Export prices fell 0.7 percent, more than the 0.2 percent decline expected.

Full text:   The stock market closed out its best week this year with a modest gain on Friday, helped by airlines and industrial companies.
Investors now turn their focus to corporate earnings, which will start to pick up next week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,084.49. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,014.89; and the Nasdaq rose 19.68 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,830.47.
The S.&P. 500 ended the week up 3.3 percent, its best week since mid-December. Global markets also had a strong week, with markets in Germany and France rising more than 5 percent. In Asia, markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong are up roughly 4 percent each.
Most of the gains this week came immediately after the release of last week's disappointing jobs report, which sent a signal to investors that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising interest rates at least for several more months.
That signal was reinforced on Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed that policy makers were too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.
"In short, we found little to change our view that the first Fed hike will not occur in 2015," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of fixed-income at Barclays, wrote in a report, and the "market has reached the same conclusion."
One sector that did push higher was airlines. The companies said they flew nearly full flights last month, an important profit driver for the industry. United Continental flew flights on average 82.9 percent full; American Airlines reported its flights were 82.7 percent full.
United Continental rose 6.6 percent, American rose 6.7 percent, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines added 3 percent each.
Shares in the commodities group Glencore rose strongly after the company said it was slashing its zinc production by a third and cutting jobs in response to a sharp fall in the price of the metal.
The move, which will involve a cut in annual zinc production by 500,000 tons in Australia, South America and Kazakhstan, is the latest response by the Switzerland-based company to the slide in commodity prices that has raised concerns over Glencore's underlying business model.
Investors responded positively and Glencore shares closed up 7 percent in London at 129 pence.
One industrial company that did not do well was Alcoa, the aluminum company, which fell 75 cents, or 7 percent, to $10.26. The company reported a steep drop in profits for its third quarter, citing lower aluminum prices and a strong dollar.
Investors are now positioning themselves for corporate earnings, which pick up steam next week when most of the nation's largest banks will report their results, along with big companies like Intel, Netflix, UnitedHealth and General Electric.
"Earnings are going to dominate the next few weeks," said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. "Once we get guidance from corporate America, investors will be reasonably more confident about getting back into the market."
The price of United States oil edged higher on Friday. Benchmark crude oil rose 14 cents to settle at $50.14 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 40 cents to $52.65 a barrel in London.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 0.9 cents to close at $1.417 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1.1 cents to close at $1.591 a gallon and natural gas rose 0.4 cents to close at $2.502 per 1,000 cubic feet.
United States government bond prices rose slightly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.09 percent. The euro rose to $1.1354 while the dollar rose to 120.22 yen.
Metals prices rose. Gold climbed $11.60 to $1,156.30 an ounce, silver gained 5 cents to $15.82 an ounce and copper climbed 7 cents to $2.41 a pound.

Signs That Fed Won't Raise Rates Soon Lift Shares

Abstract: The price of oil rose Thursday as the dollar weakened, making oil more attractive to overseas buyers, and on concerns that Russia's military actions in Syria raised the threat of a wider conflict in the region.

Full text:   Signs that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low for several more months pushed stocks broadly higher on Thursday, adding to what has been a near eight-day rally. Energy stocks advanced with the price of oil.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 138.46 points, or 0.8 percent, to 17,050.75. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 17.60 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,013.43, and Nasdaq rose 19.64 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,810.79.
The S.&P. 500 has risen seven out of the last eight sessions and is now above 2,000 for the first time since mid-August.
Stocks spent most of the morning little changed, but moved steadily higher after investors had a chance to work through the minutes from the Fed's September policy meeting.
In the minutes, Fed officials expressed confidence that the U.S. economy was improving, citing the improving job market. But policy makers had concerns that inflation continues to remain abnormally low, noting the recent drop in commodity prices, which were a major reason why the Fed did not raise interest rates.
The Fed has kept interest rates near zero for nearly seven years now. The Fed has repeatedly signaled it wants to raise interest rates, but it has held off on doing so.
"The Federal Reserve is waiting for the ideal time to raise rates. But, for those who live in the real world, we know that there is not a 'perfect' time to raise interest rates," said David Libovitz, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.
Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman's wealth management business, said investors no longer expect rates to go up this year, even though the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has said that's likely to happen. He added that the central bank is "beginning to falter" in communicating to investors what its plans are.
"The market has begun to conclude that they're the boy who cried wolf" where raising interest rates are concerned, Mr. Clemons said.
The price of oil rose Thursday as the dollar weakened, making oil more attractive to overseas buyers, and on concerns that Russia's military actions in Syria raised the threat of a wider conflict in the region.
Energy stocks were among the biggest gainers on Thursday, following oil higher. Marathon Oil rose 5 percent, Occidental Petroleum was up 3 percent, and Hess added 4 percent.
Benchmark U.S. oil rose $1.62, or 3.4 percent, at $49.43 a barrel in New York. Brent Crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $1.72, or 3.4 percent, to $53.05 a barrel in London.
In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline rose 1.8 cents to close at $1.408 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2.2 cents to close at $1.602 a gallon and natural gas rose 2.4 cents to close at $2.498 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Netflix had a strong day as well, rising $6.83, or 6 percent, to $114.93. The streaming movie and TV show company announced it was increasing prices on its most popular plan to cover the higher costs for its new original shows and series.
With stocks posting solid advances, investors sold bonds, pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.10 percent from 2.07 percent late Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.1274 while the dollar was little changed at 119.94 yen.
Precious and industrial metals futures ended lower. Gold lost $4.40 to $1,144.30 an ounce, silver fell 33 cents to $15.77 an ounce and copper declined two cents to $2.34 a pound.

Full text:   A photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe, once denounced in the United States Congress, sold at auction at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday for $478,000, including fees.
"Man in Polyester Suit," a black-and-white image from 1980 depicting a black man wearing a three-piece suit, with his penis exposed, was estimated at $250,000 to $350,000.
The image helped touch off a cultural conflagration in 1989 when Senator Jesse Helms cited it among examples of "filthy art" which had received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.
"Man in Polyester Suit" was also part of a show of Mapplethorpe works that led to criminal obscenity charges against the director of Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center. (He was acquitted in 1990.) The decidedly not-safe-for-work image, which cannot be reproduced here, can be easily found through a search engine.
In subsequent years the image has come to be seen as a key Mapplethorpe work, touching on issues of race, class and sexual stereotypes. The last time this print was sold at auction, in 1992, it traded hands for $9,900 (about $17,000 when adjusted for inflation).
Mapplethorpe will also be the subject of a retrospective exhibition next year in Los Angeles at the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. Denis Healey, a dexterous British socialist politician who used leadership positions to downsize his country's empire by militarily retreating from Asia in the 1960s and accepting harsh terms for an international loan in the 1970s, died on Saturday at his home in Alfriston, Sussex. He was 98.
His family announced the death.
Lord Healey brought a fierce intellect and a combative style to helping Britain map a more modest global strategy in the quarter-century after World War II.
As secretary of state for defense from 1964 to 1970, he slashed Britain's military budget and closed most of its bases east of the Suez Canal. As chancellor of the Exchequer from 1974 to 1979, he addressed raging inflation, a weakening pound and economic chaos by turning to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan in 1976.
The fund set tough criteria for reining in public spending, infuriating fellow Labour Party members who felt their own government was caving in to international capitalists to save the pound from collapse.
Lord Healey's wage restraints were salt in the wounds, and in later years he felt that the Treasury had exaggerated the size of the problem.
A tall, heavily built man with bushy eyebrows, Baron Healey of Riddlesden, as he became known in 1992, was known for his articulate pugnacity. He once called himself "a bit of a thug," and he proved it by likening an attack by the Conservative politician Geoffrey Howe to being "savaged by a dead sheep." (Politicians puzzled for years over what such an onslaught might involve.)
The press called Lord Healey a bully, bruiser and brawler. A victim once said that he "could not see a belt without hitting below it."
In spite of these qualities -- or perhaps because of them -- he was a longtime star of his party. He served as deputy leader, and he lost races to become leader in 1976 and in 1980, when Michael Foot defeated him by only 10 votes. Edward Pearce, in his 2002 book, "Denis Healey: A Life in Our Times," called him "the Labour Party's in-house intellectual, a sort of cerebral handyman."
Indeed, Lord Healey was often hailed as "the best prime minister we never had."
On Saturday, as news of his death spread, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said: "We've lost a huge figure of postwar politics." Mr. Healey, he said, "told his party hard truths about Britain having to live within her means."
The current Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called Mr. Healey "a Labour giant whose record of service to party and country stands as his testament." Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, praised him as a "towering intellect."
Denis Winston Healey, whose middle name honors Winston Churchill, was born on Aug. 30, 1917, in Mottingham, southeast London, then a part of Kent, but moved with his family to Yorkshire at the age of 5. He went to Balliol College at the University of Oxford, where he joined the Communist Party in 1937 because he liked its stand against Hitler. He was also chairman of the Labour Club, and graduated with highest honors in classics and philosophy.
He left the Communist Party after the fall of France in 1940. That year he was drafted into the British Army and served in the Royal Engineers. He rose to the rank of major, fought in campaigns in Sicily and Italy, and taught himself good Italian. He was the "beachmaster" in charge of landing British troops at Anzio.
In 1945, he ran for Parliament and lost. That year he also married Edna May Edmunds. She died in 2010. His survivors include two daughters, Cressida and Jenny, and a son, Tim.
After his defeat he became an official in the Labour Party, helping set foreign policy positions. In 1952 he won a seat in Parliament from Leeds, which he represented for 40 years before joining the House of Lords in 1992. He allied himself with the moderate wing of his party against leftists grouped around Aneurin Bevan and Tony Benn.
When Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1964, he appointed Lord Healey to the defense job. He unified the three armed services within the defense ministry, canceled new weapons and introduced tighter civilian controls in the manner of Robert S. McNamara, then the United States defense secretary and Lord Healey's friend.
Critics on the left assailed his support of the Vietnam War and opposition to the use of force in the breakaway colony of Rhodesia. They also castigated his strong support for Britain's remaining a nuclear power, even as it retrenched globally. (In the last years of his life, Lord Healey said Britain no longer had use for the bomb.)
After Labour lost in the 1970 general election, Lord Healey served as his party's spokesman on defense, a position called shadow secretary. He then served as shadow chancellor.
When Labour won in 1974, Prime Minister Wilson named him chancellor. After Mr. Wilson resigned in 1976, Lord Healey ran for his party's leadership but was defeated by James Callaghan, who automatically became prime minister. Lord Healey continued as chancellor under Mr. Callaghan.
Lord Healey again ran for the Labour leadership post in 1980 but was defeated by Mr. Foot, 139 to 129.
Lord Healey always insisted that he did not mind not reaching the political summit, saying he wanted to do something rather than be something. He was later deputy party leader and shadow foreign secretary, and was credited with helping to hold his party together at a time of struggle against fragmentation. In 1994, he was an early supporter of Tony Blair to become leader of the Labour Party after the death of John Smith.
He generated international headlines in 1983 when Britain and Argentina were fighting over the Falkland Islands by saying that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher "glories in slaughter" and that she had "wrapped herself in the Union Jack, exploiting the sacrifices of our troops."
Lord Healey's wit, particularly when directed against Mrs. Thatcher, tickled British politicians. In 1987, Julian Critchley, a Conservative member of Parliament, told The New York Times, "His diatribes against Margaret and his use of ridicule have really given pleasure to thousands, not least the government frontbench, all of whom used to sit there smirking like mad, trying not to show they were enjoying it."
In later years, he enjoyed photography and devoted time to the piano and to crime fiction. In a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said he swam 20 pool lengths a day in the summertime and missed his wife "very much indeed."
He was an intellectual in politics who did not always hold his tongue, and who was never a great favorite of the Labour left. "I don't think it's so much that I'm too clever by half, as has been said about some politicians," he once said. "I think that's it sometimes that I do say what I think without calculating the consequences, and this is very damaging for a politician."
Lord Healey used humor to make precise points, but his most famous line described all too many situations. What he called "Healey's First Law of Holes" advises, "When in one, stop digging."

Correction: October 18, 2015, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary in some editions on Oct. 4 about Denis Healey, a British socialist politician, misspelled the given name of an opponent in the leftist wing of the Labour Party in some copies. He was Aneurin Bevan, not Anuerin.

Full text:   Ever since the American dollar began to surge against foreign currencies late last year, economists have warned that the repercussions would eventually be felt on the home front.
If there were any doubts about that, they were resolved last week.
With Friday's Labor Department report showing slower hiring than expected in September, and the weaker data on exports and factory activity released earlier in the week, evidence of the effects of the dollar's rise on the domestic economy is piling up.
While hardly catastrophic -- almost no one expects the American economy to fall into recession anytime soon -- the greenback's strength will exert a significant drag on economic growth in the months ahead and could help push the Federal Reserve to wait until 2016 before raising interest rates.
"There is no question about it: The dollar is clearly having an impact," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy.
Indeed, while Mr. Behravesh estimates that domestic consumption rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter -- a healthy pace by most measures -- he expects economic growth for the period to come in at around 2 percent.
That's a significant gap, Mr. Behravesh said, with most of it due to the strengthening dollar, which makes American goods more expensive abroad, as well as slower growth overseas in important export markets like China and Brazil.
Other experts are even more pessimistic about the economy's growth rate in July, August and September, with Macroeconomic Advisers cutting its estimate to 1.4 percent on Friday, down from 2.4 percent at the start of the week.
Goldman Sachs expects the drag from trade on output to persist through the end of 2016, reducing the American economy's overall growth rate by nearly a full percentage point.
Although the dollar dipped after the release of Friday's anemic jobs report, few experts expect that weakness to persist. In fact, the dollar could eventually move a bit higher from current levels, depending on when the Fed finally makes its long-expected move to raise rates.
A stronger dollar not only makes American-made products more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas, but it also favors foreign manufacturers, since they can afford to sell their goods for less in the United States than domestic producers.
That is one reason there is nervousness on Wall Street with many big American companies reporting earnings for the third quarter in the coming weeks, starting with Alcoa on Thursday.
Still, as with most trends in the economy, this one cuts both ways, with benefits as well as costs.
Chief among the benefits are lower prices in the United States, especially for energy and consumer products, which has the effect of keeping inflation at bay.
Although inflation, if anything, has tended to be too low rather than too high since the current recovery began six years ago, Federal Reserve policy makers are keeping a very close eye on prices in order to determine when to finally raise short-term interest rates from near zero.
With import prices under pressure, the stronger dollar "is essentially doing the Fed's work for them in terms of keeping inflation in check," said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington.
To put it another way, the Fed has more leeway to leave rates near zero into early 2016. That would allow the labor market to recover more fully and average hourly earnings to potentially rise.
In fact, in a speech in late September, the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, cited the dollar's strength as a prime reason that inflation had been running well below the central bank's 2 percent target. Barring another drop in energy prices or further appreciation in the dollar, Ms. Yellen said she expected the inflation rate to rise to 1.5 percent or higher in 2016.
But the dollar's advance may not be over.
Although most of the dollar's rise against major currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, with exchange rates stabilizing more recently, emerging market currencies have continued to deteriorate in recent months.
Some of that is because of aftershocks from China's currency devaluation in August, which caught markets around the world by surprise, as well as from the impact of slowing growth within China.
Already, the drop in emerging market currencies is resulting in an uptick of goods arriving on American shores from countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, said Jon W. Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach in California, the country's second-busiest port after the Los Angeles port.
In fact, in the first seven months of the year, imports from Vietnam totaled $21 billion, up 27 percent from the same period last year, according to the Commerce Department. Imports from Malaysia are up 17 percent to more than $19 billion.
Over all, the trade deficit in the United States is running about $10 billion more than last year, and a sharp widening for August is expected when the government reports the latest data on Tuesday.
While much of the jump in imports is coming from consumer goods, which tend to be made overseas, American factories are being hurt as demand for equipment and other heavier goods from overseas ebbs.
Manufacturers shed 27,000 jobs in August and September, a significant reversal from the gains recorded from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2014, when factory employment jumped by more than 300,000.
"It takes a while for the dollar to work its way through the economy, but it's weighing on manufacturing," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.
Mr. Gapen said the dollar's surge -- and its ripple effects on the domestic economy in the United States -- were major factors in his firm's decision to move its forecast of the first Fed rate increase from December 2015 to March 2016.
"Some Fed policy makers are definitely looking at this, and they know that trade will be a big drag on growth," he said. "It's very clear that the dollar's strength is showing up in the numbers."

In 1952 he won a seat in Parliament from Leeds, which he represented for 40 years before joining the House of Lords in 1992. He allied himself with the moderate wing of his party against leftists grouped around Aneurin Bevan and Tony Benn.
When Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1964, he appointed Lord Healey to the defense job. He unified the three armed services within the defense ministry, canceled new weapons and introduced tighter civilian controls in the manner of Robert S. McNamara, then the United States defense secretary and Lord Healey's friend.
Critics on the left assailed his support of the Vietnam War and opposition to the use of force in the breakaway colony of Rhodesia. They also castigated his strong support for Britain's remaining a nuclear power, even as it retrenched globally. (In the last years of his life, Lord Healey said Britain no longer had use for the bomb.)
After Labour lost in the 1970 general election, Lord Healey served as his party's spokesman on defense, a position called shadow secretary. He then served as shadow chancellor.
When Labour won in 1974, Prime Minister Wilson named him chancellor. After Mr. Wilson resigned in 1976, Lord Healey ran for his party's leadership but was defeated by James Callaghan, who automatically became prime minister. Lord Healey continued as chancellor under Mr. Callaghan.
Lord Healey again ran for the Labour leadership post in 1980 but was defeated by Mr. Foot, 139 to 129.
Lord Healey always insisted that he did not mind not reaching the political summit, saying he wanted to do something rather than be something. He was later deputy party leader and shadow foreign secretary, and was credited with helping to hold his party together at a time of struggle against fragmentation. In 1994, he was an early supporter of Tony Blair to become leader of the Labour Party after the death of John Smith.
He generated international headlines in 1983 when Britain and Argentina were fighting over the Falkland Islands by saying that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher "glories in slaughter" and that she had "wrapped herself in the Union Jack, exploiting the sacrifices of our troops."
Lord Healey's wit, particularly when directed against Mrs. Thatcher, tickled British politicians. In 1987, Julian Critchley, a Conservative member of Parliament, told The New York Times, "His diatribes against Margaret and his use of ridicule have really given pleasure to thousands, not least the government frontbench, all of whom used to sit there smirking like mad, trying not to show they were enjoying it."
In later years, he enjoyed photography and devoted time to the piano and to crime fiction. In a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said he swam 20 pool lengths a day in the summertime and missed his wife "very much indeed."
He was an intellectual in politics who did not always hold his tongue, and who was never a great favorite of the Labour left. "I don't think it's so much that I'm too clever by half, as has been said about some politicians," he once said. "I think that's it sometimes that I do say what I think without calculating the consequences, and this is very damaging for a politician."
Lord Healey used humor to make precise points, but his most famous line described all too many situations. What he called "Healey's First Law of Holes" advises, "When in one, stop digging."

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary in some editions on Sunday about the British politician Denis Healey misstated one of his accomplishments as secretary of state for defense. He closed most of Britain's military bases east of the Suez Canal, not all of them.

Full text:   J. Michael Pearson has become a billionaire from his tough tactics as the head of the fast-growing Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.
And consumers like Bruce Mannes, a 68-year-old retired carpenter from Grandville, Mich., are facing the consequences.
Mr. Mannes has been taking the same drug, Cuprimine, for 55 years to treat Wilson disease, an inherited disorder that can cause severe liver and nerve damage. This summer, Valeant more than quadrupled its price overnight.
Medicare will now have to cover about $35,000 for the 120 capsules he takes each month, and he will have to pay about $1,800 a month out of pocket, compared with about $366 he paid in May.
"My husband will die without the medicine," said his wife, Susan, who is now working a second part-time job to help pay for health care. "We just can't manage another two, three thousand dollars a month for pills."
Cuprimine is just one of many Valeant drugs whose prices have spiked as part of the company's concerted strategy, which has richly rewarded its investors and made it one of Wall Street's most popular health stocks.
But Valeant's habit of buying up existing drugs and raising prices aggressively, rather than trying to develop new drugs, has also drawn the ire of lawmakers and helped stoke public outrage against the growing trend of higher and higher drug prices imposed by big drug companies. This year alone, Valeant raised prices on its brand-name drugs an average of 66 percent, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis, about five times as much as its closest industry peers.
Some presidential candidates have also seized on the issue. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, called for efforts to control "price gouging" after a public outcry over the actions of Turing Pharmaceuticals, which abruptly increased the price on a drug to $750 a tablet from $13.50.
And last week, Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform demanded that Valeant be subpoenaed for information about big price increases on two old heart drugs that the company acquired in February.
The threat of government action is making the pharmaceutical industry nervous. A big sell-off in biotechnology stocks over the last two weeks helped wipe out the sector's gains for the entire year. Valeant's stock has been among the hardest hit, losing about a quarter of its value since Sept. 18. Still, the stock is trading for about six times as much as it was five years ago, a meteoric rise that far outpaced most drug companies.
Valeant defended itself, saying in a statement that it "prices its treatments based on a range of factors, including clinical benefits and the value they bring to patients, physicians, payers and society." It says patients are largely shielded from price increases by insurance and financial assistance programs the company offers, so that virtually no one is denied a drug they need.
But Mr. Pearson, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, has said he has a duty to shareholders to wring the maximum profit out of each drug. And in some cases old neglected drugs sell for far less than newer drugs for the same diseases.
If "products are sort of mispriced and there's an opportunity, we will act appropriately in terms of doing what I assume our shareholders would like us to do," he told analysts in a conference call in April.
Valeant is an extreme example of practices that have been around in the pharmaceutical industry for years. The United States, unlike most countries, does not control drug prices, and pharmaceutical manufacturers have relied heavily on steady and sometimes outsize price increases in this country to bolster their revenue and profits.
Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3 percent of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20 percent of sales on research and development. Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada, although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey.
Price increases provide an extra boost to the company's sales and profits.
For example, after Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals this year, it raised the price of one Salix drug, the diabetes pill Glumetza, about 800 percent.
"How can they just do this?" said Gail Mayer, a retired computer systems analyst on Long Island, who said her monthly supply of Glumetza went from $519.92 in May to $4,643 in August. For now, her insurance is covering most of that increase, but she is worried that it will stop covering the drug altogether, as others have.
"I'm sure it didn't cost them $4,000 more to make," Ms. Mayer said. "You don't just go buy a bottle of milk and suddenly the supermarket charges you $100."
Mr. Pearson has told analysts that it is standard industry practice to raise the price of a drug shortly before it faces generic competition, which Glumetza might face in February.
The drug industry argues that list prices are typically not what health plans pay after discounts and rebates are negotiated, and there is evidence that these discounts are increasing.
But even if patients are often shielded, the costs are paid by insurers, hospitals and taxpayers and lead to higher premiums and co-payments for everyone, critics say.
Jeffrey M. Rosner, the senior director for pharmacy sourcing and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic, said that nine drugs with particularly egregious price increases had cost the hospital an additional $11.2 million annually, an increase of about 10 percent in drug costs for hospitalized patients. And Valeant's products represented 80 percent of that additional cost, he said.
The price of one Valeant drug, Mephyton, which helps blood clot better, has been increased eight times since July 2014, he said, and now costs about $58.76 a tablet, up from $9.37. The price of another, Edecrin, a diuretic, has gone up nine times since May 2014 and is now at $4,600 a vial, up from about $470. When his staff called to inquire, Valeant refused to discuss pricing over the phone, Mr. Rosner said.
Many drugs undergoing gigantic price increases are old and no longer have patent protection, raising the question of why generic alternatives do not pop up.
The generic equivalent of Cuprimine, the drug taken by Mr. Mannes, is being sold by some foreign pharmacies for $1 a tablet, in contrast to the $260 Valeant is now charging.
For some Valeant drugs there are generic alternatives. For others, the sales have been too small to interest a generic company. That could change now that the prices are higher, but it would probably take several years for a generic-drug maker to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to start selling such a product.
More conventional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which conduct their own research and development, have rushed to distance themselves from companies like Turing and Valeant. The Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, expelled Turing, saying it did not reflect the organization's values. Martin Shkreli, who runs Turing, is also facing a federal criminal inquiry into his activities at a previous company, Retrophin, according to Retrophin regulatory filings.
But while more conventional companies do not typically triple or quadruple prices overnight, they do often raise them year after year at a rate far faster than inflation. Big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Merck raised list prices an average of 13 percent in 2014 and 8 percent so far this year, according to Deutsche Bank.
Ronny Gal, a pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said smaller price increases on widely used drugs had a much bigger effect on health care spending than the larger increases by Valeant on drugs with small sales.
Dr. Irl B. Hirsch, a diabetes specialist at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, said insulin prices had risen so much in recent years that some patients were scrimping on groceries to pay for it. The price of a package of five Lantus injectable pens from Sanofi has gone from about $179 in 2010 to $372 last year, he said, and insurance will often cover only one package at a time.
"All of this stuff that makes life so inconvenient, this would have been unheard-of five or 10 years ago," he said.
The more conventional companies and their backers argue that research and development has a high risk of failure, so they deserve premium prices when a drug succeeds. They now are concerned that innovation will be undermined by a reaction to price increases imposed by companies like Turing and Valeant.
Jacking up prices of old drugs, "with no R&D risk-taking, is just not right," Bruce Booth, a prominent life sciences venture capitalist, posted on Twitter Tuesday, adding that the practice "hurts the industry & innovators."
With Valeant's stock price falling, Mr. Pearson sent a letter to employees last week, arguing that increased prices accounted for only a small and declining part of the company's business. "Valeant is well positioned for strong organic growth, even assuming little to no price increases," he wrote.
But in the company's regulatory filing for the second quarter, Valeant said that its growth in the United States and other developed markets "was driven primarily by price," not by increased volume. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that "outsized" price increases on eight drugs accounted for about 7 percent of Valeant's revenue and 13 percent of its earnings before taxes and interest in the second quarter.
For now, with Congress in the hands of Republicans and election season in full swing, quick government action on drug prices is considered unlikely.
The Manneses are applying for financial assistance from a foundation recommended by Valeant to help pay for Cuprimine. But Ms. Mannes was upset enough to write to elected officials and call local television stations.
"This madness has to stop," she said.

Full text:   BOSTON -- The 2008 financial crisis convinced most people in the world of central banking that it would be a good idea to try to prevent that kind of thing from happening again.
But policy makers have made little progress in figuring out how they might actually do so, a troubling reality highlighted at a conference that ended over the weekend at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
The Fed has publicly committed itself to a strategy of so-called macroprudential regulation, meaning it is now focused on maintaining the stability of the financial system as well as the health of individual firms. But senior Fed officials at the Boston conference described that as more of a goal than an achievement.
Crises remain hard to anticipate and prevent, and the available tools could cause significant economic damage.
"My own view is that while the use of macroprudential tools holds promise, we are a long way from being able to successfully use such tools in the United States," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, told the conference.
In the meantime, the importance of prevention has only increased because the Fed's ability to respond to the outbreak of a crisis has diminished. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act prevents the Fed from repeating some aspects of its 2008 actions. More important, the Fed expects interest rates to remain below historic norms for the foreseeable future, leaving less room to cut rates, which has long been its first line of defense.
Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chairman, said he was troubled by the gap between perception and reality. "If you ask people who is responsible for financial stability they would say, 'The Fed,' " said Mr. Kohn, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "But the Fed doesn't really have the instruments. It doesn't really have the tools.
"And I think this is a dangerous situation if people perceive that it has the responsibility and it doesn't have the tools."
The obvious reason to prevent bubbles is that crises are bad for the economy. Seven years after the peak of the 2008 crisis, the Fed still has not been able to drive unemployment or inflation back to normal levels. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.1 percent -- a level usually associated in the past with a robust economy -- but that figure overstates the current health of the labor market.
Prices, meanwhile, rose just 0.3 percent in the 12-month period ending in August, far below the 2 percent level the Fed would like to achieve to support healthy spending and investment.
The basic problem for regulators is that crises are hard to predict. A 2012 study by the International Monetary Fund concluded that only about one-third of credit booms ended in crashes. Many instead produced permanent economic benefits. And even in retrospect, the researchers found it hard to identify clear warning signs.
So popping bubbles probably means curtailing some beneficial booms, too.
"We'll have to make a choice about how much growth we are willing to give up in good times to limit the likelihood of a future financial crisis," said Loretta J. Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
Other officials and experts also share Mr. Dudley's doubts about the Fed's power to pop bubbles. American regulators have fewer tools than some of their European counterparts, and those tools are distributed among a number of agencies that have little history of cooperating either quickly or effectively.
"The current U.S. institutional setup is likely to fail in a crisis and will do less to prevent a crisis than it should," said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "And we are likely to suffer from this."
Frederic S. Mishkin, a former Fed governor, noted that financial firms tend to resist increased regulation, often with considerable success. "They're going to hire a lot of lawyers to figure out how to get around these regulations and undermine them," Mr. Mishkin, a Columbia University economist, said.
These constraints on the Fed's ability to recognize and respond to problems as they are developing has led officials to emphasize measures that strengthen the resilience of the financial system. A prominent example: stricter limits on banks' reliance on borrowed money. Mr. Dudley said progress in this area should provide "considerable solace" to those worried about the slow progress of macroprudential regulation.
Some officials, however, argue that a more drastic shift may be necessary. They want the Fed to use its most powerful tool -- raising and lowering interest rates -- to help maintain the stability of financial markets.
The Fed might curb speculative excesses by raising interest rates. Similarly, it could soothe fragile financial markets by holding rates steady, as it is doing now, or by cutting rates, as it does during downturns.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, has generally resisted this suggestion, arguing in a 2014 speech that monetary policy should remain focused on moderating inflation and minimizing unemployment. Raising interest rates across the economy to limit speculation in a particular area is the rough equivalent of weeding a garden with a bulldozer. Ms. Yellen has suggested she would consider it only as a last resort.
But Ms. Yellen's deputy, the Fed vice chairman Stanley Fischer, said on Friday at the Boston conference that the use of monetary policy for such goals deserves consideration. "There may be times when adjustments to monetary policy should be discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability," he said.
Jeremy C. Stein, a former Fed governor, has argued that the broader effects of raising interest rates actually numbers among its virtues, because it potentially enables the Fed to discourage risky speculation it has not even managed to identify.
Eric S. Rosengren, the Boston Fed president, argued in a paper that opened the conference that financial stability should join inflation and employment as explicit objectives of monetary policy. Moreover, Mr. Rosengren and his co-authors presented evidence that the Fed already treats financial stability as a goal. They showed that the movement of the Fed's benchmark rate tracks discussions of financial stability at Fed policy-making sessions.
Others, however, said it was not clear that raising rates was a more effective means of addressing risks to the financial system than sensible regulation.
"I'm a skeptic," Mr. Kohn, of Brookings, said. "I think that monetary policy, changes in interest rates, are likely to be not very effective in damping a lot of these cycles."
The current discussion is largely framed by the details of the last crisis. Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University, said he saw little reason to think the Fed could have curbed the rise of housing prices in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis by raising interest rates more quickly. He noted that Britain had higher rates than the United States and just as severe a housing bubble.
Instead, Mr. Gertler said, "We can certainly imagine that some kind of restrictions on the subprime market might have been a more effective way to contain this mess."
Nellie Liang, director of the Fed's office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, presented a study showing that changes in interest rates have a limited effect on credit booms in the early stages, and then even that fades away. That suggested that macroprudential measures had a role to play.
But the skeptics held sway.
Luc Laeven, director general for research at the European Central Bank, provided a fitting, if disheartening, summary of the conference.
"Both monetary policy and macroprudential policy are not really very effective," Mr. Laeven said.
He added a plaintive question. "Do we have other policies?"

Abstract: Denis Healey, a dexterous British socialist politician who used leadership positions to downsize his country's empire by militarily retreating from Asia in the 1960s and accepting harsh terms for an international loan in the 1970s, died Saturday at his home in Alfriston, Sussex, after a short illness, his family announced. The fund set tough criteria for reining in public spending, infuriating fellow Labour Party members who felt their own government was caving in to international capitalists to save the pound from collapse.

Full text:   Denis Healey, a dexterous British socialist politician who used leadership positions to downsize his country's empire by militarily retreating from Asia in the 1960s and accepting harsh terms for an international loan in the 1970s, died Saturday at his home in Alfriston, Sussex, after a short illness, his family announced. He was 98.
Lord Healey brought a fierce intellect and combative style to helping Britain map a more modest global strategy in the quarter-century after World War II. As secretary of state for defense from 1964 to 1970, he slashed Britain's military budget and closed all its bases east of the Suez Canal, effectively removing the last traces of an empire on which the sun once never set.
As chancellor of the Exchequer from 1974 to 1979, he addressed raging inflation, a weakening pound and economic chaos by turning to the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan in 1976.
The fund set tough criteria for reining in public spending, infuriating fellow Labour Party members who felt their own government was caving in to international capitalists to save the pound from collapse.
Lord Healey's wage restraints were salt in the wounds, and in later years, he felt that the Treasury had exaggerated the size of the problem.
On Saturday, as news of his death spread, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said: "We've lost a huge figure of postwar politics. A hero in World War II as beachmaster at Anzio and a brave politician, Denis Healey told his party hard truths about Britain having to live within her means."
The current Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, called Mr. Healey "a Labour giant whose record of service to party and country stands as his testament."
Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said that Lord Healey was "absolutely loyal to the Labour Party" and a "towering intellect."
A heavily built, tall man with bushy eyebrows, Baron Healey of Riddlesden, as he became known in 1992, was known for his articulate pugnacity. He once called himself "a bit of a thug," and proved it by likening an attack by the Conservative politician Geoffrey Howe to being "savaged by a dead sheep." (Politicians puzzled for years over what such an onslaught might involve.)
The press called Lord Healey a bully, bruiser and brawler. A victim once said that Lord Healey "could not see a belt without hitting below it."
In spite of these qualities -- or perhaps because of them -- he was a longtime star of his party, serving as deputy leader, and losing races to become its leader in 1976 and in 1980, when he lost to Michael Foot by only 10 votes. Edward Pearce, in his 2002 book, "Denis Healey: A Life in Our Times," called him "the Labour Party's in-house intellectual, a sort of cerebral handyman."
Indeed, Lord Healey was often hailed as "the best prime minister we never had."
Denis Winston Healey, whose middle name honors Winston Churchill, was born on Aug. 30, 1917, in Mottingham, southeast London, then a part of Kent, but moved with his family to Yorkshire at the age of 5. He went to Balliol College at the University of Oxford, where he joined the Communist Party in 1937 because he liked its stand against Hitler. He was also chairman of the Labour Club, and graduated with highest honors in classics and philosophy.
He left the Communist Party after the fall of France in 1940. That year he was drafted into the British Army and served in the Royal Engineers. He rose to the rank of major; fought in campaigns in Sicily and Italy; and taught himself good Italian. He was the "beachmaster" in charge of landing British troops at Anzio.
In 1945, he ran for Parliament and lost. That year, he married the former Edna May Edmunds, who died in 2010. His survivors include his daughters Cressida and Jenny, and his son, Tim.
After his defeat, he became an official in the Labour Party, helping set foreign policy positions. In 1952, he won a seat in Parliament from Leeds, which he represented for 40 years before joining the House of Lords in 1992. He allied himself with the moderate wing of his party against leftists grouped around Aneurin Bevan and Tony Benn.
When Harold Wilson became prime minister in 1964, he appointed Lord Healey to the defense job. He unified the three armed services within the defense ministry, canceled new weapons and introduced tighter civilian controls in the manner of Robert McNamara, then the United States defense secretary and Lord Healey's friend.
Critics on the left assailed his support of the Vietnam War and opposition to the use of force in the breakaway colony of Rhodesia. They also castigated his strong support for Britain remaining a nuclear power, even as it retrenched globally. (In the last years of his life, Lord Healey said Britain no longer had use for the bomb.)
After Labour lost in the 1970 general election, Lord Healey served as his party's spokesman on defense, a position called "shadow secretary." He then served as "shadow chancellor."
When Labour won in 1974, Prime Minister Wilson named him chancellor. After Mr. Wilson resigned in 1976, Lord Healey ran for his party's leadership but was defeated by James Callaghan, who automatically became prime minister. Lord Healey continued as chancellor under Mr. Callaghan.
In 1980, Lord Healey again ran for the Labour leadership post but was defeated by Michael Foot, 139 to 129.
Lord Healey always insisted that he did not mind not reaching the political summit, saying he wanted to do something rather than be something. He later was deputy party leader and shadow foreign secretary, credited with helping to hold his party together at a time of struggle against fragmentation. In 1994, he was an early supporter of Tony Blair to become leader of the Labour Party after the death of John Smith.
In 1983, he generated international headlines when Britain and Argentina were fighting over the Falkland Islands by saying that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher "glories in slaughter." He said she had "wrapped herself in the Union Jack, exploiting the sacrifices of our troops."
Lord Healey's wit, particularly when directed against Mrs. Thatcher, tickled British politicians. In 1987, Julian Critchley, a Conservative member of Parliament, told The New York Times, "His diatribes against Margaret and his use of ridicule have really given pleasure to thousands, not least the Government frontbench, all of whom used to sit there smirking like mad, trying not to show they were enjoying it."
In later years, he enjoyed photography and devoted more time to the piano and to crime fiction. In a 2012 interview with The Daily Telegraph, he said he swam 20 pool lengths a day in the summertime and missed his wife "very much indeed."
He was an intellectual in politics who did not always hold his tongue, and who was never a great favorite of the Labour left. "I don't think it's so much that I'm too-clever-by-half, as has been said about some politicians," he once said. "I think that's it sometimes that I do say what I think without calculating the consequences and this is very damaging for a politician."
Lord Healey used humor to make precise points, but his most famous line described all too many situations. What he called "Healey's First Law of Holes" advises, "When in one, stop digging."

Full text:   DOES preschool work? Although early education has been widely praised as the magic bullet that can transport poor kids into the education mainstream, a major new study raises serious doubts.
Since 2004, Tennessee has offered state-subsidized prekindergarten, enrolling more than 18,000 of the state's neediest 4-year-olds. An early evaluation showed that, as you'd expect, youngsters who attended pre-K made substantial gains in math, language and reading. But, startlingly, the gains had evaporated by the end of kindergarten.
Those first results were alarming, and worse was yet to come.
A just-released study tracks the same kids to third grade. There's still no evidence that the children benefited cognitively from preschool. They may be better socialized to school life -- a skill, emphasized in preschool, that may well bring long-term benefits -- but many of them haven't mastered the three Rs. That's terrible news, since being a proficient reader by third grade is widely regarded as the best predictor of high school graduation.
Pre-K critics will again pounce on the results. "Devastating for advocates of the expansion of state pre-K programs," wrote Russ Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, commenting on the first-round evaluation. It's an "I told you so" moment for Tennessee State Representative Bill Dunn, who slammed his state's prekindergarten as "like paying $1,000 for a McDonald's hamburger."
When a nationwide evaluation of Head Start, the federal government's preschool program, reported similarly disappointing outcomes three years ago, Mr. Whitehurst delivered a blistering critique. "The best available evidence raises serious doubts that a large public investment in the expansion of pre-K for 4-year-olds will have the long-term effects that advocates tout." Pre-K was generally thought to be better than Head Start, but that doesn't seem to be the case in Tennessee.
Have the claims made for early education been overblown? Not necessarily. Consider what's happening in Boston. A randomized study showed that prekindergartners there gained between four and seven months' progress in reading and math, and those gains persisted: 27 percent more of Boston's preschool children scored "proficient" or better on the state's rigorous third-grade exams.
What's the difference between Boston and Tennessee? In a word, quality. "Tennessee doesn't have a coherent vision," Dale Farran, a Vanderbilt professor and the Tennessee study's co-author, told me. "Left to their own devices, each teacher is inventing pre-K on her own."
Boston's teachers are taught to understand the complexities of child development, and receive abundant coaching from knowledgeable veterans. The curriculum is calculated to get children's minds in gear. "Too often, children sit in a circle and the adult does all the talking," says Jason Sachs, who runs Boston's public preschools. "Here, children take much more of an active role. They learn about the concept of length by comparing the shadows they cast when lying on the ground. They learn about measurement by producing a guide to making light blue. They collaborate in figuring out how to make their city a better place -- an assignment merging reading, math, art and science -- and get to present their work at City Hall."
Boston isn't the only pre-K success story. In New Jersey, poor children who went to prekindergarten and are now in fifth grade have closed 20 to 30 percent of the achievement gap between poor students and the nationwide average. Lasting achievement gains have also been recorded in North Carolina, Michigan and Tulsa, Okla. A long-term study of youngsters who attended Chicago's Child-Parent Centers showed that they had a 29 percent higher high school graduation rate and a 42 percent lower arrest rate for a violent offense than their peers. Economists calculate that every dollar invested in those centers generated $7.10 in benefits.
Recent evidence from Head Start is also positive. That program has been revamped -- almost every teacher has a B.A., the curriculum is more hands-on, and more coaching is being provided. Centers with weak results are shuttered. Consequently, test scores are improving. "The newest standards incorporate the latest research to make the program more effective," says Linda Smith, who runs Head Start.
Money doesn't guarantee good outcomes, but it helps. It pays for well-educated, experienced teachers, small classes and one-on-one coaching. "There are no easy routes to preschool success," says W. Steven Barnett, a Rutgers economist and the director of the National Institute for Early Education Research. "It takes time, money and a relentless focus on quality -- but it has been done."
Even as more 4-year-olds attend pre-K, many states are delivering it on the cheap. While Boston spends $10,000 for each preschooler, in 2014 the average expenditure, nationwide, was $4,125. That's $1,000 less (adjusted for inflation) than the 2002 average -- and a third of what's spent for each K-12 student. In education, as in much of life, you get what you pay for.

Full text:   SURPRISINGLY, there appears to be one small area of bipartisanship in Washington: the desire to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax. It is a tax on super-expensive health insurance plans provided by some private companies to their employees. The tax would be paid by employers who sponsor these high-cost plans.
In 2018, it is scheduled to be the final aspect of the Affordable Care Act to go into effect. Republicans desperately want to show they can repeal some aspect of the health care law. Under pressure from unions, some Democrats, now including Hillary Rodham Clinton, want to eliminate or postpone the Cadillac tax, too.
Rather than a triumph of bipartisanship, this would be a big mistake, for a number of reasons. In its first eight years, the Cadillac tax will raise some $91 billion. Repeal it and politicians -- if they are being fiscally responsible -- will have to find other sources of revenue rather than add to the deficit.
But more important, the tax makes sense. It was imposed to counter the negative effects of the government subsidy of company-paid health insurance. We can't get rid of that subsidy, but we can reduce its impact. The subsidy was encoded in law in 1954, when Congress passed an act making an employer's contribution to the premiums for workers' health insurance tax-free. This legislation gave employers an incentive to expand health insurance. Today, about half of all Americans get their insurance through their employer (or the employer of a relative) -- and benefit from the tax exclusion.
But the subsidy has created serious problems. For one thing, it is hugely regressive. The rich receive nearly triple the financial benefits from the tax exclusion than those with lower incomes because they are taxed at a higher rate and tend to have much more expensive health insurance. The health care tax exclusion is the single largest tax break in the United States, reducing federal revenue by more than $250 billion per year.
By providing an incentive for the purchase of ever-more-generous health insurance, the tax exclusion has been a major driver of health care inflation. By covering more services, offering more choices and lowering the costs people experience, expensive plans encourage people to use more health care services and, when there are options, more expensive services.
For instance, patients might use the emergency room for sore throats, or go to specialists instead of their primary care physician to adjust their blood pressure or thyroid medications, because their more generous insurance plan lowers the cost of using these expensive options.
This is no small matter. According to several economists' recent analyses, the tax exclusion may account for a more than 30 percent increase in health care spending for those with employer-sponsored insurance, because of this incentive to use more health care services.
In thinking through health care reform, President Obama supported reform of the tax exclusion because of its central role in fighting the scourge of health care inflation. He and his congressional allies recognized that the health care law needed to combine modifications to Medicare and Medicaid with changes in the private sector to effectively fight inflation.
The Cadillac tax levies a 40 percent excise tax on the portion of total health insurance premiums that exceed $27,500 for a family in 2018 and $10,200 for an individual. By way of comparison, in 2015 average premiums in employer-sponsored insurance for a family are $17,545 and for an individual, $6,251.
While many people believe that employers pay for their health insurance, economists have shown over and over that it is workers who pay for the higher fringe benefit through lower wages. Thus, if health insurance costs and premiums go up, workers will see even more anemic pay raises. In addition, as health care costs go up, people have less money to purchase other goods and services, lowering growth in other parts of the economy.
Finally, as health care costs go up, so does government health care spending in Medicare, Medicaid and subsidies provided to people purchasing in the exchanges. Through taxes, Americans pay for higher federal and state government spending on health care.
If there is to be reform of the Cadillac tax, a responsible approach could be to limit the financial benefits of the tax exclusion to $2,000 (or less) for households making over $250,000 and totally eliminate it for households making over $1 million. This would raise additional revenue that could be used to soften the impact of the Cadillac tax on less well-off Americans.
The public is complaining bitterly about the growing out-of-pocket expenses for health care. This is a big problem, largely driven by employers who are shifting costs through higher premiums and more deductibles to their workers. The best way to lower out-of-pocket costs is to rid our health care system of inefficiency and waste.

Abstract: The opening of negotiations, which started this week with a closed-door meeting of senior White House and Capitol Hill staff members, came as Treasury Secretary Jacob J.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- As the government nears a potentially devastating default, the White House and congressional leaders have begun bipartisan talks aimed at reaching a two-year budget deal, seizing on what could be their final chance at consensus before Speaker John A. Boehner's exit ushers in what is expected to be more combative leadership in the House.
The opening of negotiations, which started this week with a closed-door meeting of senior White House and Capitol Hill staff members, came as Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew warned on Thursday that the United States would exhaust its ability to borrow on Nov. 5 if lawmakers refuse to increase the amount of money the government can legally borrow.
That default date is weeks before lawmakers had expected, and it immediately increased the pressure to avoid a new fiscal crisis and break the gridlock that has become business as usual in Washington. Officials from both parties tamped down expectations for success, but the timing of the economic threats may provide a rare opportunity for cooperation.
"This back and forth, going to the brink all the time, it's bad governmentally, it's bad for the markets and it's bad politically," said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. "The average voter out there just thinks we're crazy."
The talks are unlikely to include Representative Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican expected to succeed Mr. Boehner as speaker, with whom the White House has never worked closely. By contrast, Mr. Obama's advisers regard Mr. Boehner as a familiar and straightforward -- if not always entirely cooperative -- negotiating partner.
The outlines of the long-running disagreements between the parties remain the same: Mr. Obama and Democrats insist on lifting strict spending limits on domestic programs, while Republicans continue to say any increased domestic spending must be offset by savings in other social programs not subject to Congress's annual discretion. Proposals such as raising the eligibility age for Medicare and changing the way Social Security retirement benefits are indexed to inflation are nonstarters for many Democrats and the White House. More likely, negotiators will look for trims to obscure government programs.
With Mr. Boehner's abrupt announcement that he will step down at the end of this month, White House officials believe the House speaker, who President Obama once said had repeatedly left him "at the altar" when they were on the brink of a deal, may now finally be in a political position to close one.
Administration officials say they are eager to test Mr. Boehner's willingness to defy the most conservative members in his party on a compromise, which, if reached, would require the votes of Democrats to pass. The White House plans to push for an increase in the federal debt limit, and separately, a long-term transportation funding bill and a reopening of the Export-Import Bank.
"We are interested in seeing what the speaker is prepared to do," said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary.
It is not clear whether Mr. Boehner shares a desire for a fiscal compromise -- and if he does, whether he and Mr. Obama can agree on the details. But Mr. Boehner has suggested that he would like to leave his successor a relatively clean slate, devoid of the most politically difficult votes that plagued his speakership.
The prospect of success in the next 30 days is tantalizing: Mr. Obama could end budget fights for the rest of his presidency. Mr. Boehner could send a message to the conservatives who have tormented him for years that they do not control him. Republican leaders could demonstrate they can govern just as their presidential candidates enter an election year. And Democrats could win welcome relief from spending caps that threaten to hobble government programs. Still, most cautioned against too much hope that bipartisanship was about to break out.
And several lawmakers predicted that the likelihood of an agreement would fade after Mr. Boehner's departure.
"It's hard to paint a scenario where it gets better," said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Democrat.
The lame-duck House speaker demonstrated this week a willingness to work with Democrats and buck his most conservative members by allowing approval of a spending bill that keeps the government operating until Dec. 11. The spending measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 91 Republicans.
But reaching a broader deal on government spending through 2017 will be more complicated.
Lawmakers are scheduled to take a weeklong recess to mark Columbus Day, Oct. 12. Also, talks could be sidelined during the political dramas surrounding next week's Republican leadership elections and Hillary Rodham Clinton's testimony at a Benghazi hearing this month.
Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said Thursday that a budget and debt deal is "worth exploring," but he said there is little time to complete one.
Mr. Boehner, freed from catering to a restive conservative wing that repeatedly demanded government spending cuts and policy changes certain to draw Mr. Obama's veto, no longer has to choose between keeping his job and engaging in the kind of legislative bargaining that until a few years ago was commonplace in Washington.
Mr. Obama has long seen Mr. Boehner as a pragmatic and rational figure, the kind of business-minded Republican with whom he often cut deals during his years in the Illinois State Senate. His surpassing flaw from the president's perspective, White House officials have said privately, has always been Mr. Boehner's inability to persuade his rebellious Republican colleagues to accept the agreements he negotiates.
"I do think that Speaker Boehner sometimes had a tough position because there were members in his caucus who saw compromise of any sort as weakness or betrayal," Mr. Obama said last week after Mr. Boehner notified him by phone that he would be relinquishing his post.
There is almost no chance, Mr. Obama's advisers concede, that Mr. Boehner's imminent exit will yield breakthroughs on some of the president's other policy priorities, such as an immigration overhaul, a plan to make community college free or a major revision of the tax code.
But officials at the White House and on Capitol Hill argue that the Republican shake-up has provided a rare opening for Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner to agree on a modest package that would address some pressing issues.
Citing Mr. Boehner's recent comment that he is interested in "cleaning out the barn" before he leaves, Mr. Earnest said Thursday that if Mr. Boehner wants to work in a bipartisan fashion, "he'll find partners at the White House willing to pick up their mops."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending in the United States grew briskly in August, and a key measure of inflation firmed a bit, according to economic data released on Monday.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending increased 0.4 percent after an upwardly revised 0.4 percent increase in July. The figures give a bullish sign for economic growth in the third quarter.
"These data underscore the ongoing health of the consumer sector," said John Hoff, an economist at RBS Securities.
The report could help convince investors that the economy is strong enough to warrant a rate increase this year, the view that the Federal Reserve's chairwoman, Janet Yellen, most recently expressed on Thursday. President William Dudley of the New York Fed also said on Monday that an increase was likely this year and could come as soon as October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that consumer spending would rise 0.3 percent last month. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity.
It was the latest report indicating momentum in the economy as it confronted recent global turbulence, kindled by concerns over a slowing Chinese economy. Those concerns pushed the Fed to hold off raising rates earlier in September.
Last month, spending on long-lasting goods like automobiles increased 0.9 percent. Outlays on services like utilities rose 0.5 percent.
Personal income increased 0.3 percent in August.
Overall inflation remained muted, reflecting low oil prices. Inflation, which has persistently run below the Fed's 2 percent target in annual terms, rose just 0.3 percent in August from the month a year earlier.
However, prices were up 1.3 percent when excluding food and energy, a crucial metric used by the Fed to gauge the trend rate of inflation. In July, core prices rose 1.2 percent year-over-year.
Despite the positive signals for consumer spending, the housing market in the United States appeared to lose a step last month. Contracts to buy previously owned homes fell 1.4 percent.

Full text:   Tabs on Spending
On Monday morning, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on consumer spending and personal income in August. Wall Street is looking for healthy gains for consumers, with income up 0.4 percent and consumption rising 0.3 percent. As unemployment continues to slowly decline, and with energy prices lower, consumer activity is expected to remain relatively robust through the end of the year. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
Late-Night Slots Full
After 10 months of late-night hosts being shuffled in and out of jobs (In: Larry Wilmore, Stephen Colbert and James Corden; Out: Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Craig Ferguson and Stephen Colbert), this week the final piece will be put into place. Trevor Noah, above, the 31-year-old South African comedian, will take over Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" on Monday. As Mr. Noah introduces himself to an American audience that is mostly unfamiliar with his work, his first-week guests will include the comedian and actor Kevin Hart, the musician Ryan Adams and the Republican presidential candidate and governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. JOHN KOBLIN
Tesla to Unveil S.U.V.
On Tuesday, Tesla Motors, the maker of electric cars, will finally release its much-anticipated sport utility vehicle, the Model X. The new S.U.V. is crucial to Tesla's plan to increase its sales of electric vehicles around the country, and the company has said it particularly hopes the Model X will bring in more female buyers. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, is expected to officially unveil the S.U.V. at a lavish event on Tuesday night at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif. AARON M. KESSLER
July Housing Statistics
The release on Tuesday morning of the latest data for the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July should provide clues to the health of the housing market. After big gains in the last few years, home prices have stabilized but remain robust. Economists expect the index to show prices up about 5 percent from the same month a year ago. Some have questioned whether the recent volatility on Wall Street would hurt the housing market. But that should not be evident until next month -- the numbers to be released on Tuesday will reflect conditions in July, before Wall Street tumbled in August. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
Senate Studies Puerto Rico
On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee will examine the predicament of Puerto Rico, which is struggling with huge debt and a shrinking economy. Although the island has home rule, the United States Constitution gives Congress the ultimate power to "make all needful rules and regulations." Opinions in Congress vary widely on what should be done. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Republican from Utah who is the committee's chairman, said it would "explore how the territory manages its finances" and consider "the interplay between federal entitlement and tax programs," in hopes of finding a way to avoid a default. MARY WILLIAMS WALSH
Bank of America's Plan
Bank of America has until Wednesday to resubmit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve. Earlier this year, the Fed gave the bank provisional approval for a multibillion-dollar share buyback. But the regulator found weaknesses in how the bank projected losses and revenue on certain parts of the test. Bank of America will try to address these deficiencies when it resubmits its plan this week. The Fed is expected to decide whether to approve the revised plan toward the end of the year. MICHAEL CORKERY
Uber Trial Set in France
On Wednesday, two Uber executives in France are expected to stand trial on charges of running an illegal taxi organization in the country. The trial, which may still be postponed, is linked to a recent French court ruling that upheld an earlier decision that outlawed Uber's low-cost service from operating in France. MARK SCOTT
VW Sales and a U.A.W. Deal
This week will be a busy and important one for the auto industry. On Thursday, Volkswagen will disclose its first monthly sales figures since news of the emissions-cheating scandal broke. The firestorm has consumed the company, outraged consumers and led to the resignation of the automaker's chief executive, Martin Winterkorn. (Mr. Winterkorn's replacement, the Porsche chief, Matthias Müller, was named on Friday.) Consumer backlash has been fierce, and since roughly half of the company's September sales would have occurred after the cheating became public, analysts will be watching to see if consumers stayed away from Volkswagen dealerships.
Voting by members of the United Automobile Workers union on a new proposed contract with Fiat Chrysler will continue this week. The voting is taking place plant by plant, and the deal has already run into opposition. U.A.W. members in Kokomo, Ind. -- where nearly 5,000 work at the automaker's transmission plants -- voted last week to reject the proposed four-year contract. Workers in Perrysburg, Ohio, also voted against the deal. If the deal fails to pass over all, it would mean the U.A.W. would have to decide whether to resume negotiations with Fiat Chrysler or consider a strike. The union could also decide to focus instead on General Motors or Ford, and then come back to Fiat Chrysler afterward to attempt a deal. AARON M. KESSLER
Manufacturing in China
China's sprawling but struggling manufacturing sector is expected to have continued to slump in September. On Thursday, two surveys -- one published by the government, the other by Markit Economics -- are expected to show China's manufacturing sector contracting at a sharper pace. Last week, an early reading of the so-called purchasing managers' index for the month came in worse than expected at 47 points, the weakest reading since 2009. (Anything below 50 signals a contraction.) The manufacturing decline, along with housing construction activity, has been a major drag on China's economy, which is expected to grow this year at its slowest pace in a quarter-century. NEIL GOUGH
Unemployment Interrrupted
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department is scheduled to announce whether the nation's official jobless rate continued inching down in September after dropping to 5.1 percent in August. If it falls below the 5 percent level, that will strengthen the argument that the economy is reaching full employment and unemployment cannot keep dropping without igniting inflation. Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said last week that the central bank remained on track to raise interest rates from their near-zero levels before the end of the year -- barring surprises. At the moment, the Fed is assuming that labor market conditions will continue to improve. But she said bank officials were also keeping an eye on the disappointingly low participation rate (a sign that many workers remained on the sidelines without being lured back into the work force), the large number of part-time employees who would prefer full-time jobs and long-stagnant wages.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- A funny thing happened on the way to the United Nations General Assembly, where President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will speak on Monday for the first time in 10 years.
In the weeks leading up to the meeting, the war in Ukraine all but disappeared from the state-run television channels that monopolize news coverage in Russia. In its place: War in Syria!
There was Dmitry Kiselyov, the infamous news anchor who repeatedly accused Washington of plotting every step of the Ukraine crisis, instead damning the Islamic State. "The barbarian caliphate in the Middle East is an absolute evil, slithering in the direction of Russia," he said, "But we have a firm ally in the Middle East: Syria. To surrender it means inviting terrorists to come to us."
With that, Mr. Kiselyov introduced a report by a prominent war correspondent, formerly stationed in eastern Ukraine, who filed the latest in a series of dispatches suggesting that the valiant Syrian military could not win on its own.
The Kremlin's effort to change the conversation at home to Syria marks an important, if ultimately temporary, shift. It shows that Mr. Putin's military and diplomatic moves leading up to the United Nations meeting are aimed as much at his domestic audience as the international front.
In some ways the goals are intertwined, with Mr. Putin's stature overseas meant to shore up his ability to single-handedly dominate Russia, as he has for much of the past 15 years.
"The most important goals, and the ones he really cares about, are the domestic ones," said Maxim Trudolyubov, the editor at large of the newspaper Vedomosti.
First, the focus on Syria allows Mr. Putin to move the conversation away from Ukraine, which most Russians are tired of anyway. Acting as if the whole thing is over in Ukraine gives him latitude to make compromises there that will spur the lifting of Western sanctions without him looking as if he is caving to foreign pressure.
Second, it gives Mr. Putin the opportunity to play the statesman, too busy reasserting Russia's rightful position in the world to get caught up in problems like recession, 16 percent inflation and a weak ruble.
"He wants to keep the society consolidated and to present himself continuously as a high-profile leader who lives somewhere above everything in the country," Mr. Trudolyubov said, "so you cannot connect anything that he is doing to what is happening with the ruble, or the hospitals or the schools or the roads. All that is beneath him."
Third, there is a kind of "bread and circus" aspect to it all. In keeping with the paternalistic traditions of czarist Russia, Mr. Putin constantly assumes the role of national superhero.
That requires a constant supply of new feats, however, from organizing the 2014 Winter Olympic Games to plotting the annexation of Crimea to taming Islamic terrorists (with the occasional wrestling with tigers in between).
"A lot of heroic things should be done by a hero in this land," said Konstantin V. Remchukov, owner and editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Moscow newspaper.
Certainly, Russia has real concerns about the events in Syria and maintains a good sense of its military weaknesses from having advisers in key war rooms under longstanding military aid contracts. The forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria were reportedly so depleted by the end of the summer that Damascus sent a senior envoy to Moscow to warn that the government was weighing a retreat from the capital to the coastal heartland of the Alawite minority that constitutes much of the elite. As in southeastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin could not contemplate any military humiliation for an ally.
In August, the United States and Saudi Arabia endorsed a renewed effort by Russia to seek a political solution to the Syria conflict. Russian officials told diplomats here that they hoped to get negotiations between the government and the Syrian opposition started again by the end of October. But progress was constantly impeded by the question of Mr. Assad's future in any political solution, apparently persuading Moscow to switch to the idea of a military coalition to fight the Islamic State.
No one is quite sure what Mr. Putin will say on Monday, whether he will propose specific military action or stick to general themes. He will spend only the day in New York and not stay overnight, his spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti.
This month Mr. Putin began emphasizing the idea that Mr. Assad was the ally needed to fight the Islamic State on the ground. First, target the Islamic State, Russia officials now say repeatedly, then worry about shaping a political transition in Damascus.
Mr. Putin laid out many of those themes in a speech at a regional security conference in Tajikistan two weeks ago, and some diplomats and analysts expect his United Nations speech to echo that one.
If the Islamic State seemed a distant threat at one point, the Kremlin now appears genuinely concerned about repercussions. About 2,400 Russians have joined the extremist movement, a senior security official announced recently, and an additional 3,000 men from Central Asian states are believed to be fighting in Syria.
It is considered unlikely that Mr. Putin will propose sending Russian troops to join the fighting. The memories of the Russian debacle in Afghanistan in the 1980s remain too fresh. Even Russian casualties fighting next door in Ukraine -- a war the public accepted as necessary for its own protection -- were hidden by the state.
By proposing a grand coalition against the Islamic State and providing the weapons to back it up, Mr. Putin has already leveraged himself into a meeting expected Monday with a reluctant President Obama. The leaders of Turkey, Israel and the Palestinian Authority have all held talks with the Russian leader in the last week.
"All these preparations are aimed at attracting more attention to Putin," said Nicolai Petrov, a political science professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. "It helped change Obama's mind about meeting Putin, which showed that it is effective."
Mr. Putin has claimed repeatedly in recent years that the chaotic state of the world, particularly the level of violence in the Middle East, is because the United States is the solitary power. The underlying idea is that things were better off when the Soviet Union was around to check American might.
Some expect Mr. Putin to frame his arguments in those terms at the United Nations, where he is likely to find a receptive audience. "It will be about establishing a new pillar so that power in the world is more balanced," Mr. Remchukov said.
Traditionally, Brazil opens the General Assembly, followed by a speech by the president of the United States. After that, the audience scatters. But Mr. Putin is due to speak sixth. Given the intense interest in what he will say, the government heads might actually stick around to listen and applaud.
The applause, of course, is the short-term reason Mr. Putin is coming to the United Nations for the first time in a decade. Because of the Ukraine crisis, he was thrown out of the G-8 countries of leading economic powers, and felt so snubbed at the last G-20 meeting in Australia that he flew home early.
"He has to leave Russia to demonstrate that he is not isolated, that he is a respected member of the international community gathering in New York," said Alexandr I. Shumilin, the head of the Center for the Analysis of Middle East Conflicts, in Moscow.
"For the Russian audience it will be an attempt to send the same message, that Putin is always right," Mr. Shumilin said, "that he is always a driving force, he is still raising Russia from its knees and flexing muscles. It is an attempt to maintain the level of propaganda that proved so successful with the Ukraine crisis."

G.D.P. Growth in 2nd Quarter Is Revised Up to 3.9%

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The United States economy expanded in the second quarter more than had been estimated on stronger consumer spending and construction. The development strengthens the case to raise interest rates before the end of the year, despite September data that sounded a note of caution.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that gross domestic product rose at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the April-June quarter, up from 3.7 percent reported last month.
The data suggests that the American economy may be gaining enough strength to withstand an increase in benchmark interest rates from record low levels despite concerns about the global economy.
Still, many economists expect a cooler pace of growth in the third quarter, a view supported by separate data showing slower growth in services and a drop in consumer sentiment in September.
The Federal Reserve held off on raising rates last week, but the central bank's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, kept the door open to an increase this year in a speech Thursday night, provided that inflation remains stable and growth is strong enough to increase employment.
"There are a lot of things to like about the domestic side of the economy for the second half of the year, despite all the global malaise," said Jacob Oubina, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
Second-quarter growth, which beat expectations in a Reuters poll that the third G.D.P. reading would remain unchanged at 3.7 percent, was bolstered by higher consumer spending, mainly on services like health care and transportation.
The preliminary purchasing managers' index for the services sector from Markit slipped to 55.6 in September, from a final reading of 56.1 in August. A reading over 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
"The survey data point to sustained, steady expansion of the U.S. economy at the end of the third quarter, but various warning lights are now flashing brighter, meaning growth may continue to weaken in coming months," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
The University of Michigan's final reading on consumer sentiment for September slipped to 87.2, from 91.9 in August, although it was higher than expectations.
But the stronger consumer spending and smaller inventory build reported for the second quarter are good signs for growth in the July-September period.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, was revised up to a 3.6 percent growth pace, helped by cheap gasoline prices and relatively higher house prices, which lift household wealth.
Revised construction spending data helped to push up the headline figure, with nonresidential fixed investment expanding 4.1 percent in the quarter. Business investment on structures was revised upward along with residential fixed investment.
The revisions to second-quarter growth also reflected a smaller accumulation of inventories than had been estimated, reducing the chance that a sharp unwinding in inventories would drag on growth.
"For the Fed, the forward-looking part is most important and the one positive takeaway is inventory contribution," said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rates strategist at TD Securities.
"There had been quite a bit of fear that strong inventory building in Q2 would be unwound in Q3," he said. "It actually shows G.D.P. should be a little firmer in the next quarter, but not by a whole lot."
After-tax corporate profits were also stronger in the second quarter than previously thought. After-tax profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments showed a 2.6 percent rebound from a slump in late 2014 and early 2015.

Full text:   RIO DE JANEIRO -- SOME tax lawyers in Brazil prefer to toil in obscurity, navigating a devilishly complex system that is added to nearly every day and then amended again, often in ways that contradict one another. On a continent known for its voluminous tax codes, Brazil stands out, ranking ahead of nations like Bolivia, Venezuela and Paraguay among contenders for the world's most time-consuming tax regime.
But Vinicios Leoncio is not your normal Brazilian tax lawyer.
Fed up with the gargantuan bureaucracy that requires Brazilians to photocopy, notarize, authenticate and stamp a superabundance of documents related to their life, Mr. Leoncio is taking aim at a central element of Brazil's red tape: the tax code. Embarking decades ago on a lonely crusade, he began documenting the absurdities of Brazil's methods of collecting taxes.
The product of his drudgery might qualify as a conceptual art piece if it were not such an accurate reflection of the anxiety many Brazilians experience when paying their taxes. Measuring 6 feet 10 inches tall, weighing several tons and spanning 41,200 printed pages, his book documenting Brazil's tax rules stands as a testament to a system that seems to have gone berserk.
"Complying with tax laws in Brazil is a surreal, punishing experience," said Mr. Leoncio, 55, the director of a law firm near Belo Horizonte, a city in Minas Gerais State in southeastern Brazil. "I simply thought that something should be done about the humiliation we must endure to pay our taxes in this country."
Since finishing his book in 2014 after working on it for 23 years, Mr. Leoncio has taken his tome to the capital, Brasília, to protest the tax system, and paraded it around Minas Gerais. He revels in dissecting what he calls a senseless way of financing government, contending that a convoluted tax bureaucracy limits Brazil's maneuvering room to deal with a simmering economic crisis.
Scholars say the dilemma is intertwined with one of Brazil's institutional strengths: collecting taxes. In contrast to some other countries in the developing world, the robust Federal Revenue Service employs more than 10,000 agents around the country who crack down on tax evasion, sometimes in elaborately orchestrated armed raids.
Called "The Lion" for its aggressive approach, the Federal Revenue Service is among the most efficient bastions of Brazil's vast bureaucracy, promptly imposing hefty fines on individuals and companies that fail to comply with often incomprehensible tax rules.
Mr. Leoncio attributes the increasingly tangled rules to legislation that allows thousands of different government entities to impose taxes, including more than 5,000 municipalities, 26 states and the federal district, Brasília, and, of course, the central government. Frequent changes in legislation produce a dizzying array of tax codes.
The result, Mr. Leoncio claims, is a system that prizes complexity and punishes the poor and middle class. About 46 new tax rules are created each day in Brazil, according to Alexandre Versignassi, a writer who specializes in deciphering the tax code. Large corporations often employ vast teams of accountants and tax lawyers to comply with the fast-changing rules, generating an immense amount of work for Mr. Leoncio and his peers.
While wealthy Brazilians remain exempt from paying taxes on dividends on stock holdings and find loopholes to avoid taxes on much of their other income, sales taxes account for about 30 percent of the price of many basic items including food and clothing. That increases the tax burden on the least affluent, perpetuating inequality in one of the world's most unequal countries.
"The tax system is designed to confound people," said Ivandick Rodrigues, a law professor at Mackenzie University in São Paulo. "It's still rare for someone to cohesively call attention to the problem in a way that people can grasp."
MR. LEONCIO, who dresses in dark suits and crisply ironed shirts, insists he is no ideological rebel. While libertarian activists in Brazil are growing more vocal, including some who echo calls in the United States to abolish the tax collection agencies, Mr. Leoncio says he believes that taxes are a necessary part of living in a "civilized society."
Mr. Leoncio explained that his fascination with taxes began while he was training to work as an accountant, before getting his law degree. After growing up poor as the eldest of six children of a fisherman and his wife in rural Minas Gerais, he understood taxes as a way to fund basic services and combat extreme poverty.
"I'm not against paying taxes, I mean, for the love of God, I'm a tax lawyer after all," Mr. Leoncio said. "But what I am against is insanity when trying to pay taxes."
Bewildered by Brazil's constantly changing tax landscape, he began work on his book in 1991, when the country was still grappling with high inflation and chronic economic instability. Amid the flux, Mr. Leoncio's law practice prospered, eventually allowing him to hire 11 other lawyers, including a daughter, the eldest of his three children.
He estimates that he spent the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars to compile his book, to which he gave the ironic title "Beloved Homeland." After laboring for well over a decade to document the myriad tax rules, he imported a machine from China that is normally used to design billboard advertisements and began printing the book's pages in 2008.
By 2014 he was finished, but the endeavor had taken its toll. After devoting so many hours over so many years to the project, he suffered three heart attacks and two divorces. Mr. Leoncio said it remains hard to count Brazil's tax laws and adjustments to the laws, with the list growing longer each day.
"People can't visualize the idiocy of the system if it's in some pen drives somewhere," he said.
After renting a truck to transport the book to Brasília and around Minas Gerais, he now keeps it in a building on a farm he owns in Santana dos Montes, near Belo Horizonte. He likes to think he and other tax reform advocates are pushing Brazil in the right direction.
There are some promising signs of progress. For instance, the tax authorities have increased the use of digital filing methods, cutting into the mountains of paperwork. Some small businesses are thought to have benefited from a method aimed at simplifying their taxes. New legislation requiring retailers to estimate the amount of sales taxes embedded in the prices of their products is raising awareness among some Brazilians about the taxes they pay on everyday purchases. That, in turn, seems to be stoking anger about the deplorable quality of the education, health care, policing and other public services they receive in return.
Brazil's economic crisis is opening a new debate about taxes, with President Dilma Rousseff's administration seeking to resuscitate a tax on financial transactions in an effort to raise government revenues. Other proposals under consideration would raise taxes on fuel and inheritance.
Mr. Leoncio acknowledges that he may need to publish another book if the Brazilian authorities succeed in creating more taxes, adding to the complex system instead of overhauling it. He is also dismayed by reports of thriving graft schemes in which the tax authorities are accused of pocketing bribes to allow giant corporations to evade taxes.
"Paying taxes should be a patriotic act, but instead it breeds evasion, corruption and anguish," Mr. Leoncio said. "Brazil will never reach its potential until we instill dignity in our tax system."

Full text:   RAMO VERDE PRISON, Venezuela -- ON Feb. 12, 2014, the repressive and inept elite that governs Venezuela ordered my arrest on charges of conspiracy, arson, inciting violence, damage to public property and other crimes. Later that week, after two surprise visits from the president of the National Assembly to my family's home, it was suggested to me that I should seek refuge in a foreign embassy.
I decided instead to turn myself in on Feb. 18, 2014, and confront the trial the regime had planned. I made this decision fully aware of the risks I was facing and the possible consequences of a politically motivated trial with a compromised judiciary. So when, on Sept. 10, 2015, Judge Susana Barreiros -- a mere puppet of those rulers intent on defending their wealth and privilege -- sentenced me to more than 13 years in prison, I had no regrets about the decision I had made. I was convicted on the absurd basis that I used "subliminal messages" in my speeches about nonviolence to inspire violence during the February 2014 protests.
I am now in solitary confinement in a 7-by-10-foot cell that has nothing more than a single bed, a toilet and a small shelf for my few changes of clothes. I am not allowed writing materials, and the only book permitted is the Bible. I don't even have a light or candle for when it gets dark outside. While this has all been hard for my family, they understand that great causes require great sacrifices.
I am convinced of the justice of our cause: the liberation of a people from the painful consequences of a system of government that has failed economically, socially and politically. Our economy is the worst-performing in the region: Gross domestic product is forecast to fall by 7 percent in 2015, and we suffer from the highest inflation in the world. This inflation has led to a devastating scarcity of basic staples and has destroyed domestic production, the oil industry included. The desperation these conditions have created, paired with widespread failures of law enforcement, has made ours one of the most violent countries in the world, with nearly 25,000 murders in 2014 alone.
What's more, we have lost our democracy. The government targets those who disagree and uses repression to stay in power. The judgment against me is intended to send a message to all Venezuelans who strive for a better country that, unless they desist and concede to the regime, they will be next. Our government wants to crush our aspirations and make us believe that this fight is hopeless. They want us to surrender. But we cannot afford to surrender, for he who tires, loses.
We are working toward a Venezuela where rights are guaranteed for all, including the right to a life with dignity. We want regular changes in power through free and fair elections, so that all Venezuelans can respectfully coexist, regardless of ideology.
For the economy, we want a model that allows everyone to benefit from growth -- especially those who have less. We want to promote local industries and encourage private investment to increase production and provide employment. We want to increase oil production and use the revenue to diversify our economy, rather than buy votes. And we want to provide the high-quality education necessary for all Venezuelans to prosper.
Our plans are ambitious, but they have the support of millions. For Venezuela to move forward, we must first change the system by democratically removing the corrupt ruling party that governs us. The parliamentary elections set for Dec. 6 present this opportunity. But to succeed in the polls, we must unite. An opposition alliance, the Democratic Unity Roundtable, has already formed, but we want to expand this unity to all members of society who desire change.
We cannot do this alone. Those around the world who have spoken out on our behalf I thank sincerely. That support gives us faith, but these efforts must not end today. We need the international community to lobby for our democratic rights by raising abuses directly with the Venezuelan government, condemning repression and promoting solidarity on human rights issues in the region. We need the United Nations to make these matters an agenda item for the Human Rights Council. And we want the Organization of American States to invoke its democratic charter to discuss our dire situation.
For the December elections, pressure must be applied on the government to allow electoral observers from the O.A.S. and the European Union, which has not occurred since 2006. Their independence and impartiality are needed now more than ever to ensure that our opportunity for change is not compromised.
Finally, the government of Venezuela must end its baseless disqualifications of opposition leaders from the coming election. The ten who are banned from running include the former state governors Manuel Rosales and Pablo Pérez, the opposition leaders María Corina Machado and Carlos Vecchio, and myself. The regime should also release all 76 of its political prisoners, including those under house arrest, like the mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, and the illegally ousted mayor of San Cristóbal, Daniel Ceballos.
An election cannot be free or fair when those who think differently are barred from running or are even behind bars.

Abstract: A lot of that increase came from the introduction of some very expensive and popular new treatments for the chronic liver disease hepatitis C. But costly new drugs for cancer, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disorders also explained the change, according to an analysis from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, which tracks the pharmaceutical industry. Americans have long paid the highest prices for drugs. Because the United States gives drug makers long periods of patent exclusivity and lets a multitude of insurers each negotiate with drugmakers on price, drug spending here is, on a per capita average, roughly double the amount spent in many developed countries.

Full text:   Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Rodham Clinton are trying to make the rising cost of prescription drugs an issue in the presidential campaign.
Mr. Sanders introduced a bill in Congress this month, spelling out a host of policy changes to drive down drug costs. Mrs. Clinton tweeted on Monday that her plan would be released Tuesday. (A new proposal from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank with connections to Mrs. Clinton, may provide some hints of its contents.)
Here's why prescription drugs are bubbling up to the top of the Democratic health care agenda: Drug prices are bubbling up. Per capita drug spending increased by more than $100 last year, a big jump. At the same time, a growing share of Americans are being asked to foot the bill for their medicines, even if they're insured. The Affordable Care Act, which has expanded insurance coverage, didn't do much to counteract those trends.
Voters have clearly noticed the higher drug costs. This year, a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation asked people to identify health issues that they thought should be top priorities for the president and Congress. The No. 1 issue was making drugs for serious diseases affordable. The No. 2 issue: lowering the cost of prescription drugs. A follow-up survey in August found that 24 percent of people said that they or a family member had declined to fill a prescription because of the cost.
Mr. Sanders said that hearing about this difficulty in obtaining needed medicines motivated his proposal. "It is totally absurd that if somebody does have health insurance and they walk into a doctor's office and the doctor writes a prescription, they can't fill it," he said. "What sense is that?"
After years in which Americans' spending on drugs barely increased, last year they popped: Nationwide, spending on drugs increased by 12 percent when adjusted for inflation, according to federal government estimates.
A lot of that increase came from the introduction of some very expensive and popular new treatments for the chronic liver disease hepatitis C. But costly new drugs for cancer, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disorders also explained the change, according to an analysis from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, which tracks the pharmaceutical industry. (The government numbers don't count all drugs -- some cancer medications and other drugs given by doctors aren't included -- but the number measures how much the country is paying for drugs sold through pharmacies, and that amount is rising.)
Just as the new and expensive treatments are entering the market, fewer older brand-name drugs are going generic. The process of going generic has historically led to lower prices. Industry analysts say that drug companies are also aggressively lifting their pricing. Sometimes, companies are putting in big price increases for long-established generic drugs, as my colleague Andrew Pollack recently wrote about.
Americans have long paid the highest prices for drugs. Because the United States gives drug makers long periods of patent exclusivity and lets a multitude of insurers each negotiate with drugmakers on price, drug spending here is, on a per capita average, roughly double the amount spent in many developed countries. That difference explains one of the planks of Mr. Sanders's drug proposal: to allow Americans to import Canadian drugs back into the United States.
Even Medicare, the government insurer for older Americans, doesn't negotiate on drug prices in a unified way; instead, individual private plans each haggle for separate discounts. Both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton have talked about shifting to a system where Medicare negotiates as a monolith.
When drug costs go up, people tend to feel the change more acutely than they do increases in other parts of the health care system, even though prescription drug costs represent only a small portion of overall health care spending in the country. Government estimates suggest that prescription drug spending makes up only about 10 percent of federal spending on health care. There's even research suggesting that use of pharmaceuticals often lowers other kinds of health care spending.
High drug costs are increasingly a problem even for the well insured. Most plans sold in the new Obamacare marketplaces include hefty deductibles for drugs of hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. Even people who get their health insurance from large corporations, which tend to have the richest benefits, are expected to pay a growing share of their drug bill out of their pockets. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducts a large survey of employers about their benefits, show the trend clearly. More than 40 percent of employers now ask their workers to pay deductibles of $1,000 or more. At small companies, more than 60 percent buy such plans.
A few employees every year get sick enough that they spend their deductibles on doctor or hospital care. But many more take prescription drugs, meaning that the cost of medications is an expense they encounter every month.
A growing number of plans are also adding special deductibles for drugs only. And insurance companies have been trying to discourage patients from choosing the most costly drugs by asking them to pay bigger co-payments even after they've used up their deductibles, meaning patients who need such drugs may be paying a big bill all year long.
"They are having to pay the full cost of their prescriptions, not just the co-payments; I think that's the thing that's changed," said Murray Aitken, the executive director of the IMS institute. "The very real explanation is people are having more exposure to the full cost."

Full text:   Charter and Time Warner Shareholders Vote
Shareholders of both Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable will vote on Monday on their proposed $56.7 billion merger. Announced in May, Charter's takeover of Time Warner Cable, along with a deal for Bright House Networks, would create the country's second-largest broadband Internet provider and third-largest video provider. Charter shareholders will also vote on Monday on the company's $10.4 billion deal for Bright House and the sale of $5 billion in stock to Liberty Broadband. The vote comes a little more than a week after the Federal Communications Commission started its 180-day timetable to review the deal. EMILY STEEL
One Job or Two for Bank of America Chief
On Tuesday, Bank of America shareholders will decide whether Brian T. Moynihan, above, keeps his dual titles of chief executive and board chairman. The bank's board argues that it needs the flexibility to grant him one or both titles. Opponents, including two large California pension funds, say the two roles should be separated to allow for greater oversight. Bank officials and the pensions have been lobbying major shareholders ahead of the vote in Charlotte, N.C. MICHAEL CORKERY
China Gathering Tech Leaders in Seattle
On Wednesday, China's president, Xi Jinping, is scheduled to mark the second day of his visit to America in Seattle attending a photo opportunity with select leaders of Chinese and American technology companies, possibly including Timothy D. Cook of Apple, after members of his delegation attend a broader tech gathering. China's Internet czar, Lu Wei, and executives like Jack Ma of Alibaba are expected at the gathering, which has frustrated American officials by veering off the plan for the visit. While some companies in the United States may take the chance to announce new deals in China, American officials worry that the gathering could portray China's leadership as constructively engaging American companies even as the administration has argued that China's cyberattacks and anticompetitive practices have hurt American firms. PAUL MOZUR
French Court to Rule on Uber
On Wednesday, a French court will rule on whether Uber's low-cost ride-hailing service can operate legally in the country. The decision follows widespread violent protests this summer by members of French taxi associations who were angry about Uber's aggressive expansion from Paris to Marseille. The legality ruling comes a week before two Uber executives in France accused of operating an illegal taxi service are scheduled to stand trial. MARK SCOTT
A European Opinion on Personal Data
The advocate general of the European Court of Justice, the region's highest court, will issue an opinion on Wednesday on whether people's online data can be shared between Europe and the United States. The case involves claims that Facebook cooperated in the National Security Agency's data collection program, called Prism, and could have wider implications for other American tech companies. While not binding, the advocate general's opinion will be a sign of how the European court will rule on the case later this year. MARK SCOTT
Yellen to Speak on Inflation
Janet L. Yellen, above, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, is scheduled to deliver a speech about inflation on Thursday at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The speech comes one week after the Fed concluded its September policy-making meeting by announcing that it was keeping interest rates near zero, in part because of the persistent sluggishness of inflation. Ms. Yellen's speech may shed light on why she thinks inflation has been so slow. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
Extradition Hearing in 'Flash Crash' Case
Navinder Singh Sarao, above, a British futures trader, will face a court hearing in London on Friday to determine whether he will be sent to the United States to face charges of engaging in improper trading that contributed to a sudden plunge in American stock markets five years ago, known as the "flash crash." Mr. Sarao, 36, was arrested in Britain in April and has been fighting extradition. He was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago this month. CHAD BRAY
Last Revision for Second-Quarter Growth
On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its third and final estimate of economic growth in the second quarter. The estimate was revised sharply upward to 3.7 percent in late August, and most economists are not looking for another big revision. But some analysts think a slight uptick could be in the offing, with growth boosted by stronger consumer spending and higher levels of construction. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
Gauging Consumer Sentiment
Also Friday morning, the University of Michigan will release its final reading on consumer sentiment in September. The initial September survey showed an unexpectedly steep drop in the index to 85.7, as worries about volatility on Wall Street and global markets filtered down to consumers. Experts will be watching to see if the recent partial rebound in stocks has improved the outlook among consumers. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
Apple's iPhone 6S and 6S Plus Go on Sale
Apple's latest smartphones, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, go on sale on Friday in several countries and territories, including the United States and China. Shoppers who buy the new devices in an Apple store can opt in to the new iPhone Upgrade Program, which includes Apple's warranty program and the option to upgrade to a new phone every year. Apple recently said that global preorders for the phones exceeded forecasts and that the company was racing to catch up with demand. KATIE BENNER

Full text:   Last week the Federal Reserve chose not to raise interest rates. It was the right decision. In fact, I'm among the economists wondering why we're even thinking about raising rates right now.
But the financial industry's response may explain what's going on. You see, the Fed talks a lot to bankers -- and bankers reacted to its decision with sheer, unadulterated rage. For those trying to understand the political economy of monetary policy, it was an "Aha!" moment. Suddenly, a lot of what has been puzzling about the discussion makes sense: just follow the money.
The basic principles of interest rate policy are fairly simple, and go back more than a century to the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. He argued that central banks like the Fed or the European Central Bank should set rates at their "natural" level, defined in terms of what happens to inflation. If rates are too low, inflation will accelerate; if rates are too high, inflation will fall and perhaps turn into deflation.
By this criterion, it's hard to argue that current rates are too low. Inflation has been low for years. In particular, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has consistently fallen short of its own target of 2 percent, and shows no sign of rising.
It's true that rates -- near zero for the short-term interest rates the Fed controls more or less directly -- are very low by historical standards. And it's interesting to ask why the economy seems to need such low rates. But all the evidence says that it does. Again, if you think that rates are much too low, where's the inflation?
Yet the Fed has faced constant criticism for its low-rate policy. Why?
The answer is that the story keeps changing. In 2010-2011 the Fed's critics issued dire warnings about looming inflation. You might have expected some change in tune when inflation failed to materialize. Instead, however, those who used to demand higher rates to head off inflation are still demanding higher rates, but for different reasons. The justification du jour is "financial stability," the claim that low interest rates breed bubbles and crashes.
I suppose this latest excuse for raising rates could be right. But it's striking how convoluted and dubious the case for rate hikes has become. I like to think of it this way: if left-leaning politicians were to offer rationales for their policies that were this dependent on shaky logic and weak evidence, they would be lambasted for their irresponsibility. Why does anyone take this stuff seriously?
Well, when you see ever-changing rationales for never-changing policy demands, it's a good bet that there's an ulterior motive. And the rate rage of the bankers -- combined with the plunge in bank stocks that followed the Fed's decision not to hike -- offers a powerful clue to the nature of that motive. It's the bank profits, stupid.
Many people have been led astray here by trying to figure out whether easy money is good or bad for wealthy people in general. That's actually a complicated question. What's clear, however, is that low rates are bad for bankers.
For banks make their profits by taking in deposits and lending the funds out at a higher rate of interest. And this business gets squeezed in a low-interest environment: the rates banks can charge on loans are pushed down, but rates on deposits can only go so low. The net-interest margin -- the difference between the interest rate banks receive on loans and the rate they pay on deposits -- has fallen sharply over the past five years.
The appropriate response of policy makers to this observation should be, "So?" There's no reason to believe that what's good for bankers is good for America. But bankers are different from you and me: they have a lot more influence. Monetary officials meet with them all the time, and in many cases expect to join their ranks when they come out on the other side of the revolving door. Also, it's widely assumed that bankers have special expertise on economic policy, although nothing in the record supports this belief. (The bankers do, however, have excellent tailors.)
So we shouldn't be surprised to see institutions that cater to bankers, not to mention much of the financial press, spinning elaborate justifications for a rate hike that makes no sense in terms of basic economics. And the debate of the past few months, in which the Fed has seemed weirdly eager to raise rates despite warnings from the likes of Larry Summers that it would be a terrible mistake, suggests that even U.S. monetary officials aren't immune.
But the Fed did the right thing last week: nothing. And the howling of the bankers should be taken not as a reason to reconsider, but as a demonstration that the clamor for higher rates has nothing to do with the public interest.

Full text:   Lots of buzz concerning the impact of higher interest rates in the United States. A major trading partner creating shock waves in the global economy. Stock market volatility spreading around the world.
Sound familiar? It certainly does to Federal Reserve policy makers, who hesitated this week about lifting their key interest rate lever from close to zero because of worries about the ripple effects of a shaky Chinese economy and uneasy global financial markets. What they remember is a situation that played out more than 20 years ago, in 1994 and early 1995.
The country in question then was Mexico, as rising rates in the United States put pressure on an emerging market economy already suffering from a weakening currency and too much debt.
Ultimately, Mexico had to be bailed out by the United States and the International Monetary Fund. And something like the so-called Tequila Crisis and other episodes of global economic turmoil in the 1990s are exactly what officials hope to avoid -- or at least lessen -- as they prepare for when the Fed finally raises rates.
"There is no doubt that policy makers in emerging markets have been trembling in their boots at the prospect of a Fed rate hike," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
In fact, Fed policy makers mainly cited global economic conditions -- not domestic ones -- when they decided not to raise rates at their meeting on Thursday.
That was the right call, said Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and more recently was director of the National Economic Council in President Obama's first term.
"People often underestimate the risks, especially when you have a lot of volatility, and things can go wrong that you can't foresee," he said. "Given what's happening in China, Brazil and other emerging markets, there's still reason for being cautious if there are no signs of substantial inflationary pressures anywhere."
Much of Wall Street is now looking for the Fed to finally tighten monetary policy at its last meeting of the year in December.
But if international conditions then are anything like they are now, and inflation still doesn't pose much of a threat, Mr. Summers said, "it will be just as significant an error to move in December as it would have been to move in September."
To some observers, the delay by the Fed will help give emerging markets more time to prepare and also recover from China-induced volatility. But Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed board member from 2006 to 2008, said it could actually complicate the situation.
"This exacerbates the risks and makes the communication even more difficult going forward," said Mr. Mishkin, now a professor at Columbia Business School. "When will global conditions be strong enough to raise rates? This will create even more confusion."
Elsewhere in the world, it is no so much the initial increase itself, which is expected to be limited to a modest quarter of a percentage point, that worries experts as the prospect of further aftershocks as the Fed shifts from an easy money stance to a gradually tightening posture.
Mr. Rogoff, who wrote the 2009 book "This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly" (Princeton University Press), with Carmen Reinhart, said it was "remarkable how focused the world is on the Fed, and there's no question emerging markets are very vulnerable right now."
These strains are evident in measures like the spread between what emerging market countries have to pay to borrow vs. what it costs the United States, as well as the rapid depreciation of some emerging market currencies.
At the beginning of the year, yields on Brazilian debt were about 2 percentage points more than American bonds. That spread has since doubled, to nearly four full percentage points. Over the same period, the value of Brazil's real has fallen by nearly a third against the dollar.
That doesn't necessarily mean that Brazil and other emerging markets are heading for disaster. Many potentially vulnerable economies are better prepared this time around than they were two decades ago, officials say.
A senior Treasury Department official, for example, said on Friday that many developing nations had taken steps over the last few years to prepare for the inevitable moment when the Fed starts to raise rates. The official, made available by Treasury on condition of anonymity, said that at the recent G-20 meetings, there was more concern about the impact of China's struggles than about actions in the United States.
Mexico and Brazil, like most countries, have forgone attempting to fix their exchange rates in favor of more flexible arrangements that prevent them from having to deplete their hard currency reserves in a futile effort to preserve the dollar peg.
Still, while exchange rates may be less of a worry, there is an additional factor putting pressure on emerging market economies these days: crashing commodity prices.
Because commodities are their main export, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia, along with the big oil producers of the Middle East, are feeling the pain from lower prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials.
"If you did a regression analysis of emerging market debt crises, the two key variables are commodity prices and global interest rates," Mr. Rogoff said.
But other analysts warn that such concerns are overblown and that further delays by the Fed in starting to "normalize" interest rates carry their own risks as well.
That's been plenty of advance notice, they say, that should have given emerging markets time to prepare for the new environment. That's the view, for example, of Glenn Hubbard, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and is now dean of Columbia's business school.
"It's been so well telegraphed," Mr. Hubbard said. Whether the increase happens in October, December or next March, "it will be gradual and it's already been priced in," he said.
Using the classic metaphor to describe the Fed's role in preventing an economy from getting too exuberant, Mr. Hubbard said, "People will realize the punch bowl is being taken away, but it's not like they are running out of the room with it. They can still get drinks as it's being taken away."
When Fed policy makers do eventually decide to move, they should emphasize that it is not the beginning of a relentless new tightening phase, said Robert E. Rubin, President Bill Clinton's Treasury secretary from 1995-99.
At the time of the initial rate increase, he said, Fed officials should make clear that future increases will only come if the data suggests the economy continues to strengthen and that higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policy are required to head off the clear risk of inflation.
"You need to defuse inferences about monetary conditions in the future," said Mr. Rubin, whose first major challenge after being sworn in was tackling the Tequila Crisis. "If they did that, I think it might actually reduce uncertainty and might not have the consequences that people worry about it in terms of a rate hike."

Abstract: With wage gains still scarce for most workers, and many having trouble finding full-time positions despite a 5.1 percent unemployment rate that would normally signal employers to raise pay, labor unions and liberal economists hailed the Fed's move as a sign policy makers see continuing slack in the labor market as much more of a threat than inflation.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve appeared surprisingly hesitant to raise interest rates, experts said on Thursday, following months of anticipation on Wall Street, in Washington and in corporate boardrooms around the country that a move was imminent.
A majority of economists on Wall Street and market indicators of investor sentiment had predicted the Fed would hold off on any move to tighten monetary policy at the two-day meeting that concluded Thursday afternoon. But several analysts said the language in the rate-setting committee's statement suggested that officials were even more cautious than they had thought.
"It felt like a dovish result with a dovish statement," said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. "Before this meeting, there was a supposition that they'd set the table for a future move. I didn't see any silverware in this announcement, and I think October is off the table."
"I don't think they are in much of a hurry," he added. "The international situation must have generated a real re-evaluation."
Still, other experts argued that the central bank is prepared to move as soon as global conditions improve, illustrating the uncertainty that will persist until at least the next Fed meeting in late October -- or more likely until the last gathering of the year for policy makers in mid-December.
"The global deterioration has caught their attention and, clearly, that was the main factor," said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "I don't think this will keep them on hold for an extended period of time. Both the meetings in October and December remain live."
Indeed, traders on Wall Street could not make up their minds Thursday on how to greet the Fed decision not to enact its first rate increase since 2006. After initially dropping after the 2 p.m. announcement, stocks quickly rallied by more than 1 percent, only to fall in the final hour of trading. Major market indexes finished the day down by about 0.25 percent.
Several analysts said they were struck by the second paragraph in the Fed's statement, in particular the conclusion that global volatility and economic events "are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term."
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said those conclusions constituted the major news in Thursday's announcement.
"I'm not surprised they didn't move, but I am slightly surprised that they were so explicit with their reasoning," he said. "The new stuff is the recent financial global developments, and for now they are kind of paralyzed."
Mr. Shepherdson said he expected the United States economy to continue to strengthen in the months ahead while volatility lessens in China and other markets, prompting the central bank to finally start tightening in December.
What is important to understand, said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, is that the Fed has concluded inflation will remain depressed, even if the other economic fallout from problems abroad is minimal.
"That's significant," said Mr. Gapen, who is an outlier on Wall Street in predicting that the Fed will wait until March 2016 to move. "Whether or not the risk materializes, they think it will suppress inflation, and that means they can let labor markets go a little longer without an increase."
With wage gains still scarce for most workers, and many having trouble finding full-time positions despite a 5.1 percent unemployment rate that would normally signal employers to raise pay, labor unions and liberal economists hailed the Fed's move as a sign policy makers see continuing slack in the labor market as much more of a threat than inflation.
"We are pleased that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged," said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We know the economic recovery still has not reached working families, and even a small increase can have devastating effects on our economic stability."
Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said he believes that Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, is focused on how uneven the recovery in the labor market has been.
"This doesn't feel like an economy that needs a brake tap," he said, adding that Ms. Yellen "has been consistently, and thankfully, mindful of the absence of full employment despite the 5.1 percent unemployment rate."
With the dollar strengthening by more than 15 percent over the last 12 months against other currencies, making imports into the United States cheaper, economic forces are quietly combating inflation through another channel, Mr. Bernstein noted.
"The appreciation of the dollar has been doing the Fed's work many times over," he said.
Many observers expect the dollar to continue to rise against other currencies, because of economic weakness in Asia and the relative strength of the American economy.
On the other end of the political spectrum, conservative economists and Republicans on Capitol Hill expressed worry that the longer the Fed waits to make its inevitable move to raise interest rates, the greater the threat that investors will get cold feet.
Thursday's decision "has less to do with the underlying weakness of the economy than the timidity of the Fed to take the first necessary step to normalize monetary policy," said Representative Kevin Brady, the top House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee. "As long as the Fed remains fearful to act lest it be blamed for any economic hiccup, market uncertainty will continue."

The Wild Day That Wasn't: Fed Avoids Tumult but Prolongs Uncertainty

Abstract: [...]the Fed chose not to raise rates. Some Fed watchers in the markets said that the Fed should have raised interest rates on Thursday -- to dispel the uncertainty that they believe the central bank has started to create in the markets. Because it chose not to raise rates on Thursday, investors will be fretting for months about when the big day will actually arrive.

Full text:   Thursday could easily have been a wild day on Wall Street.
If the Federal Reserve, at a long-anticipated meeting, had decided to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, a steep sell-off in the stock market was possible. Conversely, if the Fed kept rates at their ultralow levels, investors might have cheered its commitment to easy money and gone on a buying spree.
In the end, the Fed chose not to raise rates. Unexpectedly, the market closed slightly lower. The muted reaction may be welcome after the turbulence that roiled stock markets last month. And since investors were betting in certain markets that the Fed would not raise rates, it made some sense that they did not react strongly when they got what they expected.
But the stock market's apparent meekness on such a big day may not be as encouraging as it looks. The Fed's decision not to raise rates, combined with statements made by Fed officials on Thursday, may have deepened investors' fears about the strength of the global economy -- and raised new questions about the Fed's ability to respond to weakness around the world.
"What was problematic is that the Fed introduced a greater measure of concern about global issues," said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS. "The markets might be saying, 'What does the Fed know that we don't know?' "
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished the day down just 5.11 points, or 0.26 percent, at 1,990.20. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up as much as 194 points on Thursday afternoon, closed down 65.21 points, at 16,674.74. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended the day on a higher note, up 0.1 percent, to 4,893.95.
Investors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.217 percent, from 2.3 percent. The yield on the two-year Treasury plunged to 0.68 percent, from 0.81 percent.
Expectations about Fed policy have long driven investors' decisions. But the influence of the Fed grew after the central bank introduced an enormous stimulus program after the financial crisis to lift the economy. Even though the economy did not bounce back strongly, investors were encouraged that the Fed would keep printing money until it got the results it was looking for. And with the Fed holding rates at their lows on Thursday, investors would seem to have reason to believe that stocks will keep moving higher as the Fed keeps its foot on the pedal.
Inflation is well below the Fed's target in the United States, giving it some reason to delay raising rates -- maybe even into next year, although it will have two more opportunities before this year ends. Whatever the precise timing, the Fed also appears to believe that with large developing countries like China flashing signs of weakness, it should keep rates at low levels to try to ease global financial conditions and insulate the United States economy from trouble overseas.
One part of the statement released by the Fed's monetary policy committee in particular indicated that higher rates might be a long time coming. "The committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term," the statement said.
But the Fed's decision to hold off could be self-defeating. It might stoke fears rather than allay them, according to some analysts. And investors may start to believe that the Fed is in effect trying to set monetary policy for both the economies of the United States and China. That might be hard to pull off.
"China is now the Fed's reaction function," Mr. Mariscal said. "It's another source of uncertainty."
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, on Thursday appeared well aware of the difficulty of reacting to many different forces in the world economy and in global markets. She emphasized the existence of "crosscurrents" in a press briefing.
Some Fed watchers in the markets said that the Fed should have raised interest rates on Thursday -- to dispel the uncertainty that they believe the central bank has started to create in the markets. Because it chose not to raise rates on Thursday, investors will be fretting for months about when the big day will actually arrive. "It leaves you no different than you were one minute before the announcement," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. "My countdown clock just restarted for 30 days."
But raising rates could have created far greater uncertainty, by roiling markets and hammering developing countries when they are vulnerable. Or, as Ms. Yellen put it, "Given the significant economic and financial interconnections between the United States and the rest of the world, the situation abroad bears close watching."

Abstract: The unemployment rate is quite low, but there hasn't been nearly enough time to judge whether the August market volatility, partly rooted in an apparent slowing in the Chinese economy, is going to do any lasting damage to the United States labor market.

Full text:   It has been seven years of zero percent interest rates. What's another two or three months among friends?
That's the conclusion that Janet Yellen and her colleagues at the Federal Reserve reached in their policy meeting on Thursday. They left interest rates unchanged at the same near-zero level where they have been lodged since December 2008. For them, the risk of changing course prematurely just seemed higher than another couple of months of zero rates.
Ms. Yellen blinked, which is not to say she made a mistake. Sometimes blinking is a very sensible thing to do.
It's clear that the Fed officials think that the economy is well on the path toward healing and that neither a modest interest rate increase nor a volatile stock market will wreck it. Inflation may have been persistently below the central bank's 2 percent target the last few years, but it is on track to steadily rise in the year ahead.
That helps explain why 13 of 17 Fed officials continue to expect that interest rate increases will be warranted in 2015, according to newly released projections. In case you're counting, that is a year with a mere 104 days left in it, and two Fed policy meetings, which kind of narrows the possibilities of what they have in mind for policy.
What comes through in both the written materials the Fed released Thursday and Ms. Yellen's comments in a news conference is the sense that they want just a little more assurance, from both economic data and financial market prices, that their underlying assumptions are correct.
After all, inflation data has been undershooting the Fed's expectations for years. A drop in oil prices and a strengthening of the dollar since July will only hold inflation back further.
The unemployment rate is quite low, but there hasn't been nearly enough time to judge whether the August market volatility, partly rooted in an apparent slowing in the Chinese economy, is going to do any lasting damage to the United States labor market.
Ms. Yellen took pains to argue that the Fed was not simply responding to a few rough weeks in the stock market, but rather had its eyes on the United States economy.
"The Fed should not be responding to the ups and downs of markets," she said in her news conference. "But when there are significant financial developments, it's incumbent upon us to ask ourselves, 'What is causing them?' What we can't know for sure is how much concerns about the global economic outlook are drivers of those developments."
It's true that the cost of waiting a bit -- to ensure that the economy continues to perform the way the Fed's models predict -- appears to be low. (Unless, that is, you count the lost productivity of scores of professional and semi-professional Fed watchers who now get to spend the remainder of the year furiously speculating on when interest rate increases will come).
The challenge she and the policy committee will face is that 2015 may end without the open questions that led to the September delay being resolved. It can take many months for financial swings to ripple their way through the economy. For example, a steep drop in oil prices in the second half of 2014 is only now affecting capital investment in energy exploration -- and hence United States economic growth.
There is no assurance that these critical questions -- of whether inflation is finally, truly, really poised to rise, and whether economic softness in China and other emerging markets will crimp United States growth -- will be resolved by December or even by the spring of 2016.
The United States economy is at an odd moment when unemployment is basically back to healthy levels, at 5.1 percent (though that masks large numbers of Americans who have dropped out of the labor force). Yet inflation continues coming in less than forecast, and the global economy looks perilous.
Fed interest rate decisions affect the economy with, as central bankers are fond of saying, "long and variable lags," meaning it takes many months for them to affect growth and prices. How long is uncertain. As Stanley Fischer, the Fed vice chairman, said in a television interview last month, if the Fed waits until it is absolutely certain it is time to raise rates, it will probably be too late.
In other words, Fed officials inevitably have to make a decision based on what their models predict, not on cold hard evidence.
The decision to hold off on rate increases this week suggests Ms. Yellen and the Fed want a little more evidence that the economy is on the mend, but they may find themselves back in the same spot before they know it.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- One of the longest economic expansions in American history remains so fragile that the Federal Reserve said on Thursday it would postpone any retreat from its stimulus campaign.
Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, described the decision as a close call and said the central bank still expected to raise interest rates later this year. The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate close to zero since late 2008, when the nation's economy was at the depths of crisis.
"The recovery from the Great Recession has advanced sufficiently far and domestic spending has been sufficiently robust that an argument can be made for a rise in interest rates at this time," Ms. Yellen said at a news conference.
But, she said, "heightened uncertainties abroad," including the Chinese economy's weakness, had persuaded the bank to wait at least a few more weeks for fresh data that might "bolster its confidence" in continued growth.
The Fed's decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, had been widely expected by investors in recent weeks.
Fed officials spent most of the summer suggesting that they wanted to raise rates in September, only to lose confidence as signs of slowing global growth weighed on markets.
The 10-year Treasury note yield fell 0.11 percentage points to 2.189 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.26 percent to 1,990.20.
There were signs, however, that the Fed might hesitate only briefly. It separately released economic projections showing 13 of the 17 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee still expected to raise the benchmark rate this year.
The Fed has said it is moving toward raising rates because it expects economic growth to continue, reducing unemployment and eventually raising inflation; on Thursday, Ms. Yellen said that outlook had not changed.
"There's a tendency among some to think that they're always going to get cold feet, and I thought Yellen really as much as possible discouraged that kind of thinking," said John L. Bellows, a portfolio manager at Western Asset Management.
The policy-making committee still has scheduled meetings in October and December, and Ms. Yellen said a rate increase was possible at either meeting.
One official, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, in Virginia, voted to raise rates at the September meeting, the first dissent this year. The economic projections suggest that Ms. Yellen faces more disagreements at the Fed's October meeting, given that six officials predicted the Fed would raise rates at least two times this year, while four said that they expected no increases.
The latest postponement was welcomed by liberal activists and economists who argue that the recovery remains incomplete. Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, introduced legislation on Thursday directing the Fed to push the unemployment rate below 4 percent. While the bill has no chance of winning approval in the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Conyers addressed a rally organized by the Center for Popular Democracy outside an office building where Ms. Yellen spoke, joining in a chant of "Don't raise interest rates."
Critics expressed concern that the Fed has adopted increasingly ambitious goals for its stimulus campaign. "There is always a reason to chicken out," said Dean Croushore, a professor of economics at the University of Richmond. "The Fed will lose credibility over time, as it fails to follow its own prior announcements about when it will increase rates."
Ms. Yellen, asked about the efforts to put public pressure on the Fed, which have mounted in recent months, dryly observed, "We have been receiving advice from a large number of economists and interested groups."
She denied that outside pressure had influenced the Fed's decision. She also said it had not been influenced by concerns about a potential government shutdown, which could disrupt growth, though she said that it "would be more than unfortunate."
The Fed's decision is probably a "mixed blessing" for the global economy," Eswar S. Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell, said in an email. Instead of new pressures, investors must deal with continued uncertainty.
A Fed increase, for example, might have prompted investors to pull money out of countries like Turkey or Brazil, damaging their economies, and reduced demand for imports from Europe and other developed countries. But the decision to stand pat also could weigh on Europe in the short term if it causes the euro to rise against the dollar, making things harder for exporters.
The American economy is outpacing the rest of the world, and Ms. Yellen said on Thursday that the Fed did not yet see evidence that growth was slowing.
Fed officials say they believe that labor market conditions have nearly returned to normal. In the new round of economic projections, officials estimated unemployment would stabilize next year at 4.8 percent, just below the August level of 5.1 percent.
Officials also remain confident that inflation will rebound, although perhaps a little slowly because of the recent downturn in the prices of oil and other commodities. Since the financial crisis, inflation has remained consistently below the central bank's 2 percent annual target, lately rising just 0.3 percent over the previous year.
Fed officials argue that a tighter labor market will lead to higher inflation as employers are finally prodded to pay higher wages. But, Ms. Yellen said on Thursday, that will happen more slowly than the unemployment rate might suggest, because people not counted among the unemployed -- like those who have stopped looking for work or have taken part-time jobs -- may start looking again as conditions improve.
James A. Wilcox, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said that it was difficult to find evidence for a strong connection between inflation and employment, particularly over the last decade. Inflation fell less than expected during the recession, and it has increased less than expected in the aftermath.
"The events of the last 10 years have caused a lot of rethinking and stomach acid within the Federal Reserve and the research community," Dr. Wilcox said.
Recent history has reinforced the more basic point that it takes a lot to change the underlying pace of inflation. That stability has allowed the Fed to press its stimulus campaign, but Dr. Wilcox said it also provided a good reason for the Fed to be wary of allowing inflation to climb, because reversing the trend could be very painful.
"If the heat builds slowly, and it can only be turned down slowly, then you have to move ahead of time," he said. "That's why there's sympathy for the idea of starting to raise rates relatively soon."
Given the weakness of economic growth, however, Ms. Yellen reiterated on Thursday that the Fed planned to raise rates more slowly than its past practice. Fed officials expect the benchmark rate to reach 2.6 percent by the end of 2017.
In June, they predicted the rate would reach 2.9 percent. Officials also expect the rate to reach a new plateau of about 3.5 percent, less than the June prediction of 3.8 percent and significantly below the level once regarded as normal. Such a low plateau would limit the Fed's ability to respond to economic downturns.
The Fed has already held its benchmark rate near zero much longer than it once expected. It announced in 2012 that it would keep rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent. That threshold was crossed in April 2014.
Last winter, when the Fed ended its bond-buying campaign, officials pointed to June as the most likely moment for "liftoff" from the so-called zero bound.
Some officials have made clear they are not inclined to wait much longer.
Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned in late August that officials would not be able to postpone a decision until all doubts were resolved. "When the case is overwhelming," he said, "if you wait that long, then you've waited too long."
Ms. Yellen echoed that warning on Thursday. "We don't want to wait until we've fully met both of our objectives to tighten monetary policy," she said.
The Fed's hesitation on Thursday echoed events of two years ago, when investors expected the central bank to announce at its September 2013 meeting that it was tapering its bond purchases. The Fed demurred, citing uncertainty about economic conditions.
Instead of September, it acted in December.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, faces a crucial moment on Thursday when the Fed's policy-making committee announces whether the time has come to start raising interest rates.
Liberal activists, economists and some policy makers are pressing hard for Ms. Yellen to continue the Fed's stimulus campaign of near-zero rates because the economic recovery remains far from complete, leaving most Americans still struggling to pay their bills on stagnant incomes.
At the same time, Ms. Yellen faces growing internal pressure to start raising rates from Fed officials who are concerned about froth in financial markets and about maintaining control of inflation.
Analysts say the decision will further sharpen Ms. Yellen's priorities as perhaps the most powerful economic official in the world.
"They are paying a lot more attention to the labor market than in the past," said William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "I know it's in the Fed's thinking. I know it concerns them. I just hope that it's deep enough a part of their equation that they wait to see real progress happen."
For much of the summer, the Fed seemed on track to announce after this meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that it would raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the financial crisis. The last time the Fed raised rates was more than nine years ago, and it has kept rates near zero since the end of 2008.
Then China swooned and markets skittered downward, and Fed officials started wondering aloud whether it might make sense to wait at least a few more weeks, if not longer.
That has turned the outcome of the September meeting into something of a cliffhanger.
"The F.O.M.C.'s near-term strategy has become so opaque that even the most seasoned analysts can only guess what policy decisions may be forthcoming at its upcoming meetings," wrote Andrew Levin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College who worked at the Fed as an adviser to Ms. Yellen.
The sense of mystery owes partly to Ms. Yellen's silence. In early July, she told an audience in Cleveland that "communicating with the public is an important part of my job." The next week she testified twice before Congress. But for two months, she has said nothing.
She will speak for the first time since July at a news conference Thursday afternoon, at the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting, which convened on Wednesday.
The Fed has already kept its benchmark rate near zero much longer than anticipated. Officials in 2012 agreed to keep rates near zero until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent. Unemployment fell to 5.1 percent in August.
Those calling for the Fed to extend its campaign argue there is still room for more progress on jobs, which could help lead to higher wages as well.
Strikingly, the list of public warnings against raising rates includes President Obama's former economic advisers. Lawrence H. Summers, who was head of the National Economic Council, has said in articles and interviews that it would be a "serious error" for the Fed to raise rates. Gene B. Sperling, his successor, made the same argument in a recent opinion article for Politico.
Liberal activists plan to rally outside the office building where Ms. Yellen will speak on Thursday. Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, will address the gathering.
Mr. Spriggs, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. economist, said keeping rates low is particularly important for minorities, because a tight labor market makes discrimination more expensive. The unemployment rate for blacks with college degrees is higher than for whites with high school degrees.
"I think the data are rather clear that it takes a while for employers to expand outside their natural networks and reach black workers and bring their unemployment rates down," Mr. Spriggs said. "If we stay the course, we will get to a point at which firms are willing to do more to find workers."
Rod Adams, a sanitation worker at the Mall of America outside Minneapolis, makes $10.10 an hour and says it is barely enough to get by. Mr. Adams, 26, graduated from community college in May -- accumulating several thousand dollars in student loans along the way -- and has since applied for roughly 75 office jobs of various kinds. Only one company offered an interview.
"I'm living in poverty even though I have a full-time job," he said. "I just hope the people at the Fed, I hope they realize people at the bottom of the totem pole are barely making it."
Wage growth also remains slow. Mr. Spriggs said the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had surveyed member unions about recent contracts and found little progress in winning wage increases. He said workers were generally expected to get nothing more than 1 percent increases over the next three to four years.
Ms. Yellen, in 2014, her first year as chairwoman, similarly highlighted low wages as evidence employers were finding workers so easily they had no need to compete on pay. But recently, she and other officials said that may be the result of slow productivity growth.
The Fed's vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, who has spoken several times during Ms. Yellen's quiet period, suggested in late August that labor markets were strong enough for liftoff.
Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote last week, "There should be little doubt that the Fed has achieved, or is very close to achieving, its employment objective." He said the Fed would be wise to raise rates in September, rather than waiting until later in the year, because "adding up trivial delays can put policy nontrivially behind the curve."
The policy committee still has meetings scheduled in October and December.
The Fed also faces political pressure to start raising rates, although it has not been nearly as strong in recent months as the pressure to wait. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who is running for president, wrote Tuesday in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal that the Fed should "set markets free" by raising interest rates, which he said would encourage growth.
Yet there is reason to think the Fed will wait a little longer. Notably, Fed officials have emphasized that they do not want the first rate increase to surprise investors -- and measures of market expectations suggest that many investors would be caught off guard if the Fed raised rates on Thursday.
Moreover, the Fed has a good reason to wait: Inflation remains sluggish, just 0.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and a global slowdown may suppress any short-term rebound.
"If they move in September, it would tell us that they are not weighting the global developments very strongly, they are not weighting the inflation disappointments very strongly," Julia Coronado, chief economist at Graham Capital Management, said recently at the Brookings Institution.
The Fed has maintained a united front in recent months. Ms. Yellen has won unanimous votes to continue the stimulus campaign at each of the committee's five meetings so far this year. But as liftoff approaches, there are growing signs of fragmentation over the precise timing.
If Ms. Yellen does persuade the committee to announce another delay on Thursday, the vote is unlikely to be unanimous. At least one member, Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has indicated that he expects to vote in dissent if the committee does not raise rates.
His last speech, this month, was titled "The Case Against Further Delay."

Abstract: "Despite decent employment growth in 2014, the persistent high unemployment yielded no improvements in wages and no improvement in the median incomes of working-age households or any reduction in poverty," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group influential with Democrats in Congress. "Rather than just treating the symptoms of poverty, our goal must be to help people move from welfare into work and self-sufficiency," Mr. Ryan said In its annual report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage, the Census Bureau said that the percentage of people without insurance was 10.4 percent last year, down from 13.3 percent in 2013.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Nearly nine million people gained health insurance last year, lowering the ranks of the uninsured to 10.4 percent of the population. But there was no statistically significant change in income for the typical American household in 2014, the Obama administration said on Wednesday.
Median household income in the United States was $53,660 last year, the Census Bureau reported, and the poverty rate -- 14.8 percent -- also saw no improvement. About 46.7 million people were in poverty in 2014, the bureau said, the fourth consecutive year in which the number of people in poverty was not statistically different from the official estimate for the prior year.
Overall, the new census numbers suggest that one major government program, to provide health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, is working, but that for ordinary Americans, especially the poor, the economic recovery -- now into its seventh year -- has yet to deliver measurable benefits.
"Despite decent employment growth in 2014, the persistent high unemployment yielded no improvements in wages and no improvement in the median incomes of working-age households or any reduction in poverty," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group influential with Democrats in Congress.
"Anyone wondering why people in this country are feeling so ornery need look no further than this report," Mr. Mishel continued. "Wages have been broadly stagnant for a dozen years, and median household income peaked in 1999."
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the new numbers showed that Congress should revamp antipoverty programs.
"Rather than just treating the symptoms of poverty, our goal must be to help people move from welfare into work and self-sufficiency," Mr. Ryan said
In its annual report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage, the Census Bureau said that the percentage of people without insurance was 10.4 percent last year, down from 13.3 percent in 2013.
The fraction of the population without health insurance decreased last year in every state, the bureau said.
Much of the change was attributable to the Affordable Care Act, officials said, but the Census Bureau could not say exactly how much.
In the last two years, the Obama administration has issued a steady stream of upbeat reports showing a big expansion of coverage and a sharp reduction in the number of uninsured.
To support its claims, the administration has cited estimates by the Urban Institute, the RAND Corporation, the Gallup organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others.
None of those estimates, however, are as reliable or authoritative as the census data, which showed increases in both private and government coverage.
From 2013 to 2014, the bureau said, the overall rate of insurance coverage increased for all racial groups and for Hispanics, who may be of any race.
The increases were comparable for blacks, Asians and Hispanics (just over 4 percentage points) and lower for non-Hispanic whites (about 2 percentage points).
The lack of any significant change in median household income, after adjustment for inflation, was somewhat surprising to experts, who had expected to see some modest growth in income because of improvements in the economy last year.
Edward J. Welniak Jr., a Census Bureau statistician, said the income findings may reflect the fact that there were more "nonfamily households" in 2014.
These households -- single people living alone or with roommates, and unmarried couples -- "typically have much lower incomes than family households," Mr. Welniak said.
Many households have still not regained the purchasing power they had before the recession that began in December 2007. Median household income was 6.5 percent lower in 2014 than in 2007, the bureau said. The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number below it.
The report included these findings:
About 10 percent of households had incomes above $157,480 last year, while 5 percent had incomes above $206,570. At the other end of the spectrum, 10 percent of households had incomes less than $12,280.
The pay gap between men and women has changed little in recent years. Among full-time year-round workers, median earnings for women were 79 percent of those for men last year, compared with 78 percent in 2007. By contrast, in 1964, the ratio was 59 percent.
None of the major racial and ethnic groups experienced a statistically significant change in their poverty rates or in the number of people in poverty.
The poverty rate for blacks (26 percent) is about two and half times that for non-Hispanic whites (10 percent).
A family of four was classified as poor if its income was less than $24,230 last year. For one person, the threshold was $12,070.
The biggest gains in health insurance coverage occurred last year among households with incomes less than $50,000 a year. For households with incomes of $100,000 or more, the gains were small.
The extremes of coverage, as often in recent years, were found in Massachusetts, where 3.3 percent of the people are uninsured, and Texas, where 19 percent lack coverage.
In Vermont, Hawaii and Minnesota, small shares of the population are uninsured.
The reverse is true in Alaska, Florida and Georgia. Florida significantly expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but 16.6 percent of Floridians were still uninsured last year, the bureau reported.

Full text:   Central banks, to boil their job down to its simplest level, face this perpetual dilemma: Should they push for easier money, to try to support a nation's economic growth, or for tighter money, to try to head off inflation?
History is rife with mistakes in both directions, with either type of error causing its own variety of pain. But since the global financial crisis, when major central banks have erred, it has been overwhelmingly -- perhaps exclusively -- in the direction of excessive fear of inflation and complacency about growth.
That is the reality that haunts the Fed as its leaders begin a two-day meeting Wednesday at which they could choose to raise their short-term interest rate target above the near-zero level (where it has rested for nearly seven years). If they elect to move -- futures markets gave it a 28 percent probability as of Tuesday -- it would be a bet that they are getting the timing right, in contrast with international counterparts who have repeatedly moved prematurely and regretted it, or previous moments when the Fed has made hawkish noises prematurely.
"I cannot think of any advanced economy central bank that has been too dovish since 2007, except possibly Iceland, and I have not studied Iceland," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Fed official.
A rate increase would be a signal that Fed leaders are confident the risks facing the United States economy tilt more toward overheating and financial excess, after years in which weak employment and growth have been the nation's overriding problems.
Of course, that is just what many other central banks, including the Fed itself, have thought over the last several years as they looked toward the easy-money exit. Here's a look at some of those experiences, and the specific lesson they offer for the Fed in 2015.
The E.C.B. in 2011
We now know that 2011 was the year that the European economy slumped into a new recession and that the euro currency region very nearly ripped apart. In the earlier part of that year, the European Central Bank acted as if it were blind to those risks. It raised short-term interest rates in April and July.
The official reason: Energy prices had spiked, and officials were fearful that those prices might start to pass through to create broader-based inflation. It also doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to suspect that Jean-Claude Trichet, then the E.C.B. president, may have wanted to signal his inflation-fighting credentials at a time he was under fire by Germans for his efforts to combat the eurozone crisis, including the buying of Greek bonds.
Either way, as the severity of the dangers facing Europe's economy and the power of the deflationary forces at work on the Continent both became clearer, it was evident it had been the wrong move. Mr. Trichet's successor, Mario Draghi, reversed the rate increases by the end of the year.
The lesson: Tighten monetary policy only because economic conditions truly justify it, not as a device for political signaling.
Sweden, Norway, Australia and Israel in 2010-2011
What these have in common: They are small countries that escaped the brunt of the global financial crisis that began in 2008 and were in a hurry to get their interest rate policies back toward normal shortly after growth returned.
They had much stronger economies in 2010 than the United States and Western Europe did. They didn't face the unwinding of housing bubbles, the near-collapse of their banking systems or crises of confidence in their public debt.
What their central bankers missed was the deep interconnections each economy faced with the rest of the world. Their vulnerability to the continued turmoil in the United States and European economies (and in the case of Australia, to a China slowdown) meant that a few quarters of solid growth were not enough. All four of the countries reversed their rate increases soon after as recessions or substantial slowdowns ensued.
Worth noting: The governor of the Bank of Israel at the time was Stanley Fischer, now the No. 2 official at the Fed.
The lesson: The global environment matters, and it can be a mistake to raise rates based solely on domestic consideration if the rest of the world is a mess.
The Fed in 2010
This might seem an odd choice to include here. After all, the Fed left interest rates safely near zero throughout 2010, and started a controversial program of quantitative easing, $600 billion in bond buying known as Q.E. 2, in November of that year. It didn't make as blatant a policy error as the E.C.B.'s 2011 rate increases.
But what's easier to forget is how eagerly some Fed officials were looking toward the monetary exits, especially at the start of 2010. The Fed chairman Ben Bernanke gave congressional testimony about the Fed's "exit strategy" in February of that year. There was a sense of bailout fatigue, creating a focus on how the Fed would end its era of easy money. It would turn out, of course, that that era was only beginning. The tenor of the entire discussion at that point, we now know, was directionally wrong. As the economic recovery proved sorely disappointing, the discussion needed to be on how to try to encourage growth, not how to exit from the Fed's earlier interventions.
Mr. Bernanke was assailed for the Q.E. 2 program at the time for what conservative critics in the United States and abroad considered excessive activism. With hindsight, it appears to have had the opposite problem. It wasn't until two years later, when the Fed shifted to an open-ended Q.E. 3 program linked to specific economic goals, that the United States economic recovery finally became more robust.
The lesson: Just being exhausted with monetary activism isn't a reason to change policy; economic conditions have to justify it.
The fact that errors by the Fed and other central banks have all pointed the same direction the last several years does not mean that a rate increase this week would be a mistake, of course. At some point it will be time to tighten the spigot of easy money. With the United States unemployment rate at a mere 5.1 percent and economic growth moving along, there is a perfectly solid case that that time is now. But as they consider whether to move, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues can also recall that there are some reasons to be wary from the not-too-distant past.

Full text:   Focusing on Boeing
Airbus, the European airplane maker, will formally open a jet assembly plant in Mobile, Ala., on Monday, its first such factory in the United States. The move into the heart of Boeing's home turf is part of a long-term strategy by Airbus aimed at doubling its share of the American market for 150-seat airplanes, which is currently dominated by Boeing's top-selling 737. Airbus plans to build as many as 36 of its competing A320 and A321 models a year by 2018 and says the Mobile plant has the capacity to double that production. All of the aircraft produced at the site are destined for delivery to American carriers, which are expected to need as many as 4,700 new single-aisle planes over the next 20 years. --Nicola Clark
Autoworkers' Contract Talks
Contract talks between the United Automobile Workers union and Detroit's three automakers enter the final stretch this week, as the current four-year agreement expires on Tuesday. The U.A.W. represents more than 140,000 workers in the United States at General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. On Sunday, Fiat Chrysler confirmed that it had been selected as the primary target for the first settlement. The union is pushing for wage increases and job security, while the automakers are seeking a contract that reduces health care costs and brings overall labor costs down. Workers at all three companies have voted to authorize a strike if negotiations break down. --Bill Vlasic
Retail Sales Data
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report the latest data on retail sales in August. Spending by consumers drives the economy, so analysts will be closely watching to see if July's unexpectedly strong 0.6 percentage point jump in retail activity was a one-time blip or if the momentum continued. Wall Street is looking for a 0.3 percentage point increase, but lower gasoline prices in many parts of the country may be spurring shoppers to spend more. Strong auto sales lately could also lift the headline number. --Nelson D. Schwartz
International Motor Show
The world's automakers will converge on Frankfurt on Tuesday for the International Motor Show. The annual event, which alternates between Frankfurt and Paris, comes as car sales have revived in Europe but slowed in China. China had become one of the largest and -- until recently -- fastest-growing markets for companies like Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. In addition to the usual splashy new model introductions, industry executives will be talking about the slow but steady growth of battery-powered vehicles, and efforts by tech companies like Apple and Google to take over car dashboards and, perhaps, to someday even build vehicles themselves. The show, known by its German initials I.A.A., opens to the media on Tuesday and to the public on Saturday. --Jack Ewing
Report on Consumer Prices
On Wednesday, the Labor Department will report on consumer prices in August. While some experts believe the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates to head off any threat of inflation down the road, there is not likely to be much hint of higher prices ahead in the report. Economists are looking for a 0.1 percent decline in the Consumer Price Index for August, compared with a 0.1 percent rise in July. The drop in gasoline prices is largely responsible for the downshift. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core C.P.I. is expected to rise 0.1 percent. --Nelson D. Schwartz
Oracle's Earnings
Like many of the older big tech companies, Oracle has been fighting to show its relevance (and profitability) in a world of cloud computing and mobility. A number of acquisitions have given the database giant a revenue stream in the new world, but investors will be looking for growth in the company's core products when Oracle reports its latest quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Investors will also be seeking evidence that the company built by Larry Ellison, above, can thrive without him at the helm. Mr. Ellison stepped down as chief executive last year, but he still serves as executive chairman and chief technical officer. --Quentin Hardy
Decision on Interest Rates
Through much of the summer it seemed likely that the Federal Reserve would start to raise interest rates at the September meeting of its policy-making committee, on Wednesday and Thursday. But the march toward liftoff has lost some momentum in recent weeks. Inflation remains weak and Fed officials have expressed unease about the volatility of global financial markets. After the decision is announced on Thursday afternoon, Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, is to hold a news conference. --Binyamin Appelbaum
Seeking Stability in Greece
After a long summer of financial and political upheaval, Greeks will vote next Sunday in the second general election this year. The outcome will determine whether Greece returns to stability, after agreeing to terms of the country's third multibillion-euro international bailout last month, or enters a new period of uncertainty. The snap elections were called last month after the resignation of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who came to power in January on a pledge to stop austerity, but capitulated to creditors' demands after months of grueling negotiations that destabilized the economy and led to the imposition of capital controls on Greek banks. Mr. Tsipras quit in a bid to consolidate his grip on power following a rebellion by radical leftist lawmakers who oppose austerity and have since formed their own party. Although Greek opinion polls gave Mr. Tsipras and his Syriza party a clear lead over rivals earlier this summer, many new surveys put Syriza virtually neck and neck with its main political opponent, the conservative New Democracy, which led the coalition government that preceded Mr. Tsipras's administration. --Niki Kitsantonis

Abstract: Could the fact that Fed policy makers are of a generation with firsthand experience with high inflation make them more antsy about a risk that might seem to younger Americans distant or utterly improbable?

Full text:   If you are an 18-year-old college freshman in the United States, inflation in your lifetime has averaged less than 2 percent. If you are a 30-year-old millennial, you experienced inflation above 5 percent for only one year -- when you were in kindergarten, perhaps in the form of the coins in a piggy bank buying fewer pieces of candy the longer they sat unspent.
If, by contrast, you are one of the 17 people who set monetary policy for the United States, you have had a rather different experience. The median age of the Federal Reserve System's policy-making committee members is 58, meaning all of them were fully formed adults during the double-digit inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. They know firsthand how it feels when mortgage rates are astronomical and a dollar buys substantially less every year.
The Fed, which this week will weigh whether it is time to raise interest rates after seven years of keeping them near zero, is motivated by a desire to keep inflation around 2 percent. But any decision it makes will follow decades in which inflation has been quiescent and, in the last few years, consistently below that 2 percent target.
Might that accident of the calendar have something to do with it? Could the fact that Fed policy makers are of a generation with firsthand experience with high inflation make them more antsy about a risk that might seem to younger Americans distant or utterly improbable? I did some analysis of the relationship between the inflation level when Fed officials were at a formative age and the degree of concern about price inflation they have shown as policy makers, and while it is far from definitive, it suggests there just might be something there.
I started by collecting the years of birth for the five current governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks, who collectively participate in the interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (I used the recently retired presidents of the Dallas and Philadelphia Fed banks, Richard Fisher and Charles Plosser, because their successors have not yet made their views on monetary policy known).
I then calculated the average annual inflation rate during each one's formative years. I chose to consider the years from ages 18 to 35 -- a time span in which they would have first made financial decisions, first studied economics and in most cases obtained a Ph.D. and begun publishing research.
There is no doubt that these officials experienced a different level of inflation in their early adult years than today's young people. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, experienced 3.4 percent annual inflation during his prime years, the lowest of his colleagues. The highest was Mr. Fisher, 66, the recently retired Dallas Fed chief, who witnessed average annual inflation above 6 percent as a young adult.
The median inflation experienced by the Fed officials as young adults is 5.4 percent, much more than the 1.9 percent of someone who turned 35 this year.
Close followers of the Fed may notice a pattern there. Mr. Kocherlakota, 51, is arguably the most "dovish" of current Fed officials, which is to say he is less concerned about inflation and more concerned about growth and employment. Mr. Fisher and Mr. Plosser were two of the most "hawkish" on inflation.
At first glance, this fits the theory. Does it hold up more broadly? I took a ranking of Fed officials on a hawkish-dovish scale created by economists at Barclays Capital and converted it to a numerical scale of hawkishness to see if there is a correlation.
The answer: Yes, but a weak one.
Knowing the inflation level in officials' early adulthood explains only 8 percent of the variation in their later hawkishness (that is, the regression analysis had an r-squared of 0.08). That is not high, and the sample is far too small to draw any firm conclusions, but it at least suggests that the theory that what people experience as young adults affects their instincts when they become middle-aged central bankers is not totally outlandish.
It is, of course, impossible to get into people's heads and know what truly motivates them to advocate the policy choices they do. And central banks the world over have a strong culture of inflation aversion that exists regardless of individual experience.
But it is also true that we are all shaped in ways we may not even realize by our personal experiences. People close to Arthur Burns, the Fed chairman during the 1970s, described him as obsessed with preventing an economic downturn, having been scarred by the Great Depression in his youth. I spent my young adult years writing about the aftermath of the dot-com bust and then the global financial crisis, and thus I may be inclined in the decades ahead toward seeing financial bubbles around every corner.
One way policy makers -- and all of us -- can overcome our biases is by studying history, to help understand the world beyond what we have witnessed in our own lifetimes. A knowledge of history helped a former Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, for example, see the commonalities between the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Depression, which preceded his birth by two decades.
Which means as Fed officials gather around their big mahogany table this week to decide their next move, they might do well to remember that while the past might repeat itself from time to time, what ailed the world in their youth is not necessarily the same thing that ails it today.

It's easy to take for granted the Federal Reserve's ability to raise interest rates. Even among the legions who doubt that Fed officials will pick the ideal moment to start increasing rates for the first time since 2008, few question the Fed's technical competence. The central bank has a long history. The engine is known to work.
So it may come as a surprise to learn that the old engine is broken. When the Fed decides that it's time to "lift off" -- perhaps this week, but more likely later this year -- it will be relying on a new system, assembled from spare parts, to make interest rates rise.
There is a general agreement among economists and market analysts that the Fed's plans make sense in theory. A team led by Simon Potter, a former academic who now heads the Fed's market desk in New York, has been testing and fine-tuning the details by moving billions of dollars around the financial system.
But markets have a long history of scrambling the best-laid plans.
"If something is going to go wrong, I haven't been able to figure out what, but there's a lot of reason for caution," said Stephen G. Cecchetti, the former chief economist at the Bank for International Settlements. "We've never done this before."
The stakes are huge. The Fed is in charge of keeping economic growth on an even keel: minimal unemployment, moderate inflation. It tends to operate conservatively and to change very slowly because when it errs, the nation suffers.
Yet the Fed has found itself forced to experiment. The immense stimulus campaign that it started in response to the 2008 financial crisis changed its relationship with the financial markets. It has pumped so many dollars into the system that it cannot easily drain enough money to discourage lending, its traditional approach. Instead, the Fed plans to throw more money at the problem, paying lenders not to make loans.
The Fed, embedded in the banking system, has also concluded that working through the banks is no longer sufficient to influence the broader economy. It plans to strengthen its hold by working directly with an expanded range of lenders.
Fed officials have repeatedly expressed confidence that the plan will work. "The committee is confident that it has the tools it needs to raise short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, told Congress earlier this year, referring to its policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee.
And if the new approach does not work at first, Mr. Potter said in a recent speech, then his team of monetary mechanics "stands ready to innovate" until it does.
Freezing, Not Draining
The markets desk at the New York Fed has put monetary policy into practice since the mid-1930s. In the decades before the Great Recession, the desk exercised its remarkable influence over the American economy through its control of an odd little marketplace in which banks could come to borrow money for a single night.
The Fed requires banks to set aside reserves in proportion to the deposits the banks accept from customers. The reserves can be kept in cash or held in an account at the Fed. Banks that need reserves at the end of a given day can borrow from banks that have a surplus. Before the crisis, the Fed controlled the interest rate on those loans by modulating the supply of reserves: It lowered interest rates by buying Treasury securities from banks and crediting their accounts, increasing the supply of reserves; it raised rates by selling Treasuries to banks and debiting their accounts.
As the crisis hit in 2008, the Fed pressed this machine to its limits. It bought enough securities and pumped enough reserves into the banking system to drive interest rates on short-term loans to nearly zero. The federal government now pays about a dime to borrow $1,000 for one month. Companies with good credit pay about a dollar to borrow $1,000 from money market funds and other investors.
But the Fed didn't stop there. It kept buying Treasuries and mortgage bonds to eliminate safe havens, forcing money into riskier investments that might generate economic activity. As a byproduct, the Fed kept expanding the supply of reserves.
One result is a banking system almost comically awash in money. In June 2008, banks had about $10.1 billion in their Fed accounts. The total is now $2.6 trillion. Picture all of the money in June 2008 as a single brick; the Fed has added 256 bricks of the same size. On top of that first brick, there is now a stack five stories tall.
Bank of America, for example, had $388 million in its Fed account at the end of June 2008. Seven years later, at the end of June 2015, it had $107 billion. The bank could double in size and double again and still have more reserves than it needs.
To switch metaphors, the old monetary-policy machine sits at the bottom of a lake of excess reserves. The Fed would need to sell most of the securities it has accumulated before short-term rates would start to rise. Selling quickly could roil markets; selling slowly could allow the economy to overheat. So the Fed decided to find another way.
Instead of draining all that excess money, the Fed decided to freeze it.
Paying Banks Not to Lend
For the last seven years, the Fed has encouraged financial risk-taking in the service of its campaign to increase employment and economic growth. By starting to raise interest rates, the Fed intends to gradually discourage risk-taking.
The straightforward part of the plan is persuading banks not to make loans.
In a serendipitous stroke, Congress passed a law shortly before the financial crisis that let the Fed pay interest on the reserves that banks kept at the Fed. Written as a sop to the banking industry, it has become the new linchpin of monetary policy.
Say the Fed wanted to raise short-term interest rates to 1 percent, meaning that it did not want banks to lend at lower rates. Because the glut of reserves is so great, the Fed could not easily raise rates by reducing the availability of money. Instead, the Fed plans to pre-empt the market, paying banks 1 percent interest on reserves in their Fed accounts, so banks have little reason to lend at lower rates. "Why would you lend to anyone else when you can lend to the Fed?" Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC, asked rhetorically.
This is not a cheap trick. Since the crisis, the Fed has paid banks a token annual rate of 0.25 percent on reserves. Last year alone, that cost $6.7 billion that the Fed would have otherwise handed over to the Treasury. Paying 1 percent interest would cost four times as much. The Fed has sent roughly $500 billion to the Treasury since 2008. As the Fed raises rates, some projections show that it may not transfer a single dollar in some years. Instead, the Fed will pay banks tens of billions of dollars not to use the trillions it paid them previously.
At first, Fed officials thought that paying interest to banks would establish a minimum rate for all short-term loans, exerting the same kind of broad influence as the old system. It soon became clear, however, that rates on most such loans remained lower than 0.25 percent. Even banks that needed overnight loans found they could borrow more cheaply. The average rate in July was 0.13 percent -- about half of the Fed's new benchmark rate.
The rest of the financial system is also awash in cash, and lenders -- like money market mutual funds -- put downward pressure on interest rates as they fight to attract borrowers.
And here's where the Fed's plans got a little less orthodox.
The Fed lacks the legal authority to pay these lenders a minimum interest rate on deposits, as it does to the banks. But two years ago, Lorie Logan, one of Mr. Potter's top aides, suggested the Fed could achieve the same goal by borrowing from these companies at a minimum interest rate.
The resulting deals, known as overnight reverse repurchase agreements, signal a significant break from the Fed's history of working through only the banking industry.
"We're pushing more activity out of the regulated banking sector, and so monetary policy has to take account of the unregulated sector," said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who until recently served as an adviser to Ms. Yellen, and before that to her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. "The world is changing, and I think the bigger risk is not changing along with it."
When liftoff arrives, however, the Fed plans to place this machinery inside the familiar language of the old system. It is likely to announce that it is raising the federal funds rate, the interest rate that banks pay to borrow reserves, from its current range of 0 to 0.25 percent to a new range of 0.25 to 0.5 percent. The Fed does not plan to emphasize that this rate is now a stage prop or that the real work of raising rates will be done outside the limelight by its new tools.
Mission Control
On weekdays at about 12:45 p.m., the New York Fed's trading portal, known as FedTrade, plays three musical notes -- F-E-D -- signaling that Mr. Potter's shop is open for business. So begins another day of training camp, another test of the Fed's plans to borrow money from nonbank financial companies.
The Fed's traders sit at terminals in a converted conference room. Along one wall are five chairs and five sets of computer monitors beneath five historical photographs of the trading desk: men answering phones, men writing bids in chalk on a long board and, in the most recent photograph, from the 1980s, a glimpse of a woman in the background. On another wall is a screen that links the room in New York by videoconference with a backup trading room at the Chicago Fed.
Potential lenders -- a preapproved group of 168, including a bevy of money market funds and the housing finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- have 30 minutes to offer the Fed up to $30 billion each. At 1:13 p.m., a warning message starts blinking red. At 1:15 p.m., the Fed closes the auction and accepts up to $300 billion in loans at an interest rate of 0.05 percent.
During two years of experiments, the Fed team has adjusted the rates it pays, the amounts it accepts and the time it enters the market, among other variables. Mr. Potter and his lieutenants have also held lunch meetings with investors on the other side of the portal to solicit advice and complaints.
The size of the program poses the most obvious risk. Fed officials limited daily borrowing to $300 billion because they didn't want to freeze more money than necessary. They also worry about exacerbating market downturns by giving investors a new place to flee. These concerns were heightened by reports that some investment companies were interested in creating money market funds that would be advertised as the safest place to park money -- because the money would be parked at the Fed.
Last year, at the end of September, shortly after the cap was imposed, lenders offered the Fed $407 billion on a single day. Demand was so high that instead of asking for interest, some lenders offered to pay the Fed to take the money. The Fed ended up borrowing at zero percent and turning away $107 billion in loans.
A cardinal rule of central banking is that you don't starve financial markets during panics, and the Fed has been leaning in the direction of doing more. It has already announced that it is willing to borrow at least $200 billion through a parallel program at the end of September this year, for a total of $500 billion. It has also suggested that it may raise the cap during liftoff. "My sense is we're better off making sure we can maintain control," James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, said in a recent interview.
Unpredictable Reactions
"This is where the nutty people on the bond-trading desks have control," joked Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, when asked if the Fed's plan would work.
Mr. Blinder's point was that markets ultimately determined the cost of borrowing money, particularly for longer-term loans like mortgages and corporate bonds. The Fed can be precise in its planning, but the market is unpredictable in its reactions.
Fed officials have emphasized that they do not want the liftoff to surprise investors. "This has probably been the most telegraphed 25-point rate hike in history," said Wayne Schmidt, chief investment officer at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minn. "I think when they actually do something, it will be more of a nonevent."
But there are at least three reasons markets are becoming less predictable.
The rise of an interconnected global financial system has weakened the Fed's influence over interest rates. When the Fed last raised short-term rates, beginning in 2004, officials were surprised that long-term rates failed to rise because foreign money was pouring into the housing market and other domestic investments. This time, there are plenty of warnings that the weaknesses of other developed economies could once again make it harder for the Fed to raise domestic interest rates.
"Financial market conditions have come to depend increasingly not only on developments at home but also on developments abroad," William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a February speech in which he cautioned the Fed's control over those conditions had been "loosened."
The Fed's audience also increasingly consists of computer programs that will start buying and selling securities before people have time to read the first words of the Fed's policy statement, creating the potential for new kinds of chaos.
On Oct. 15, for example, automated trading programs drove up the price of 10-year Treasuries in a burst of buying so intense that a government report later found the machines bought more than 10 percent of the securities from their own firms. Then, just as quickly, the computers turned around and drove prices back down.
The 12-minute spree was among the largest price movements ever seen in one of the world's most liquid markets, yet the government report found no clear cause.
Finally, investors say regulatory changes are keeping some large traders on the sidelines, making it harder to buy and sell, even in the highly liquid market for Treasuries. That can exacerbate market movements because when people are in a hurry to buy or sell, they tend to chase the best available offers. "The depth of the market is not what it used to be," said Tad Rivelle, chief investment officer for fixed income at TCW, a Los Angeles investment firm that manages some of the world's largest bond funds. "You can get the same trades done, but it takes more time."
Other observers, however, urge a broader perspective.
"People are very concerned about those 12 minutes last year," said Mr. Cecchetti, now a professor of finance at the Brandeis International Business School. "I'm very reassured by the fact that there were only 12 minutes."
Moreover, Mr. Cecchetti said that removing some liquidity was a good thing because much of that liquidity was a result of public subsidies for the banking system that had encouraged undue risk-taking.
"Does it mean that there's going to be more high-frequency volatility? Sure," he said. "It means the Simon Potters of the world are going to have to be much more careful about what they're doing. But that seems to me to be kind of O.K."
Volcker's Messy Lesson
Mr. Potter has worked at the New York Fed since the late 1990s, but he spent most of his career there in the research department before taking over the markets desk in 2012. He became more involved in the practical side of the Fed's work during the financial crisis. In a 2012 speech at New York University, Mr. Potter said the experience -- particularly during a four-week period at the peak of the crisis -- had impressed upon him the limits of theory, the need to understand what investors are thinking and the value of flexibility in policy making.
"For economists who did not have the opportunity to observe the panic up close as I and most of my colleagues had, the developments in this four-week period must have been bewildering, given how widely events on the ground and theory diverged," he said.
That perspective may come in handy. The last time the Fed shifted the basic mechanics of monetary policy was in the early 1980s, when Paul Volcker was its chairman. That campaign is remembered as a triumph of central banking. Mr. Volcker succeeded in driving inflation down toward modern levels, ending a long period in which governments had floundered helplessly to prevent rising prices.
But Mr. Faust, the Johns Hopkins economist, says the messiness of Mr. Volcker's triumph is often overlooked. The Fed's initial plans did not work and were revised and did not work and were revised again -- and still didn't work.
He said the Volcker episode was a reminder that monetary policy is not figure skating. The Fed is likely to flail, he says, but it will be measured by its success in getting interest rates to rise, not by the grace of its performance.
"If you're into the internal plumbing, I suspect there will be times when that looks messy because this is new," Mr. Faust said. "But central banks can raise interest rates, and they will. And as long as that happens, from the standpoint of the broader economy, everything is fine and the rest will be forgotten or become a footnote of history."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. MOSCOW -- ON a warm August evening, I found myself sitting with three educated young Russians at the Beverly Hills Diner, a chain restaurant whose gaudy décor includes human-size figures of Porky Pig and Marilyn Monroe.
They had invited me to join their table, inside a green convertible car, after I had asked a few reporter-type questions about their country. But all talk of Russia kept leading to America.
"America is trying to encircle us," said Kristina Donets, 29, swabbing a slice of dessert waffle in banana compote. "We have finally risen out of chaos and you don't like that."
Reporting in Russia after more than a decade away felt a lot like visiting an old friend. It is where I owned my first car (and had it stolen), met my husband and first worked as a journalist.
But the friend had changed.
In some ways, it was for the better. People were wealthier -- despite the recent decline in the ruble and jump in inflation -- and better traveled. The kindhearted woman who hosted me when I first moved to Moscow in 1997 said it best: "We don't have to wash out our plastic bags anymore." Her tiny salary had quadrupled since I'd last seen her. She had taken her first trip abroad -- a package tour to Tunisia.
But there was a darker side. Society had grown more defensive, and self-conscious, like a teenager constantly looking at herself in the mirror. Oligarchs had always had exit ramps -- a house in London and a second passport -- but now my own friends were looking for escape routes.
Intellectuals pointed me to books on Berlin in the 1920s and the concept of "ressentiment," a philosophical term that describes a simmering resentment and sense of victimization arising out of envy of a perceived enemy. It often has its roots in a culture's feeling of impotence. In Berlin in the early 20th century, it helped explain the rise of German fascism. In Russia in August, it seemed to have many targets: Ukraine, gay people, European dairy products and above all the United States.
"America stuffs its democracy in our face," bellowed a cabdriver named Kostya in the city of Nizhny Novgorod. (His main beef was with the "propaganda of pederasts," using a derogatory word used to describe homosexuals, a few weeks after the Supreme Court's approval of gay marriage.) "If you're saying yes, yes, yes, all the time and nodding your head, well sometimes you have to say no," he said, explaining that Russia had finally stood up to the United States.
There is, of course, a lot of history behind such sentiments. In the 19th century, Slavophiles and Westernizers clashed over the right path for Russia. There was obviously the fierce rivalry with the United States in Soviet times. Since then, there have been low points, often connected with American actions in the world. (The NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 and the American invasion of Iraq are examples.) But nothing like the current opinion of America, which this year sank to its lowest level since the Soviet Union collapsed nearly 24 years ago, according to polling by the Levada Analytical Center in Moscow.
Anti-Americanism is more potent now because it is stirred up and in many ways sponsored by the state, an effort that Russians, despite their hard-bitten cynicism, seem surprisingly susceptible to. Independent voices are all but gone from Russian television, and most channels now march to the same, slickly produced beat. Virtually any domestic problem, from the ruble's decline to pensioners' losing subsidies on public transport, is cast as a geopolitical standoff between Russia and America, and political unrest anywhere is portrayed as having an American State Department official lurking behind it.
"America wants to destroy us, humiliate us, take our natural resources," said Lev Gudkov, director of Levada, the polling center, describing the rhetoric, with which he strongly disagrees. "But why? For what? There is no explanation."
>
DURING my visit, Russians were thinking about America a lot, which was a kind of compliment, but in the way of a spurned lover who keeps sending angry texts long after the breakup.
"Tell her how well we all live, how much better than in Europe and how wonderful Crimea is now," hissed a woman in a skintight dress to someone I was interviewing. She was referring to the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed last year. That of course, was the other big change I encountered.
Inside Russia, Mr. Putin's actions in Crimea have broken friendships and split families, leaving society as divided as I have ever seen it. Politics, once everyone's obsession, now seems like a distant land no one visits. Those who do, pay a price. Mr. Gudkov said he felt like "a Jew in Hitler's Germany" when he opposed the Crimea annexation.
The move also caused the biggest break in relations with the West since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"It's like a divorce," said Keith Darden, a political-science professor at American University. "They are saying: 'the relationship we had is over. We've had enough of your efforts to change us. We're doing our own thing now.' "
He added, "But they don't know what their own thing is."
What is the Kremlin's grand strategy? Many Russian liberals I talked to believe there isn't one. Mr. Putin and his inner circle are simply lurching from crisis to crisis. How else to explain Russia's sanctions on imported food, which have driven up inflation at home, or Crimea, which has lost a chunk of its tourists and saddled Moscow with expensive new social obligations.
Dmitry Volkov, a journalist who took part in the 2011 protests against Mr. Putin, compared the annexation, and Russia's subsequent military action in eastern Ukraine, to a mugging that ends in accidental murder.
"They keep crossing boundaries only to find that once they are across, it's only logical to cross the next one," he said. "That's not a strategy. That's a behavioral pattern."
Others believe that the government is unraveling, and that the shrillness of the nationalist narrative is a harbinger. Oil prices have plunged, shrinking the pie that Mr. Putin's loyalists had been feasting on.
"It's like before Pompeii, when all the springs dried up," said one Russian friend, a former journalist who is a keen observer of the political system. "The ground is hot."
The low opinion of America, Mr. Gudkov said, is not a permanent condition. The resentment seems to have more to do with Russians themselves than with any American action, a kind of defensive, free-floating expression of current anxieties.
But the biggest question is where it is all leading. Some Russians aren't sticking around to find out.
"I don't like what's happening now," said Alexander Yeremeyev, an Internet entrepreneur, walking with his family in Sokolniki, a park in central Moscow. "Now we're all supposed to unite against what -- the U.S., Europe, cheese?"
He said he was considering leaving. "I have friends who say, 'it's great to do business in Russia.' But you know what they all have in common? Foreign passports."

Abstract: Hoping to prevent Brazil from cooling too much after the sizzling boom of the previous decade, Ms. Rousseff, 67, a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured during the military dictatorship in the 1970s and took office in 2011, doubled down on bets that she could stave off a severe slowdown by harnessing a web of government-controlled banks and energy companies.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. BRASÍLIA -- The president of Brazil should have been ecstatic. She had just won re-election after an intense campaign in which she fiercely defended her role in making Brazil, for a few fleeting years, a rising star on the global stage.
But in the days after her victory last October, President Dilma Rousseff was worried, confronted in private deliberations with her closest advisers by signs that Brazil's triumphs were at risk of coming undone.
"We went too far," Aloízio Mercadante, Ms. Rousseff's chief of staff, acknowledged publicly this month, describing the sense of alarm as the dust settled after the election and Ms. Rousseff and her aides grappled with the weaknesses in Brazil's economy.
It was not just the drop in global prices for Brazilian commodities like iron ore, the slumping demand in markets like China, or even the brewing corruption scandal at the national oil company that was hurting the country. Ms. Rousseff's own economic policies were taking a toll, too, officials concede.
Now, an economic crisis is unleashing a withering national exploration of how Brazil squandered its hard-won success.
Highlighting the strain, Standard & Poor's downgraded Brazil's credit rating to junk status on Wednesday, igniting a broad sell-off of Brazilian financial assets on Thursday. The blow is expected to increase Brazil's borrowing costs while focusing even more scrutiny on the government's inability to rein in public spending.
"We were putting off our date with reality," Carlos Langoni, a former chief of Brazil's central bank, told reporters after the downgrade. "Now is the time to do it."
Newcomers to the fragile middle class are fuming as the economy hemorrhages jobs and interest rates soar. The Federal Court of Accounts, an auditing body tied to Brazil's Congress, is examining whether the president improperly used funds from giant state banks to shore up the federal budget.
Fighting to keep her job as calls for her impeachment intensify, Ms. Rousseff has even issued a rare mea culpa, saying she experienced a series of "scares" shortly after her re-election as the crisis grew far more serious than she had imagined.
"The Brazilian model celebrated just a few years ago is turning into a slow-motion train wreck," said Mansueto Almeida, a prominent commentator on economic policy. "Our political leaders want to point fingers at China or some external villain, but they cannot escape the fact that this self-inflicted crisis was made in Brazil."
Even with the country's legacy of economic turmoil, some historians say that Ms. Rousseff's track record on economic growth ranks among the worst of any Brazilian president's over the last century.
Brazil eked out just 0.1 percent growth in 2014. The economy is expected to shrink almost 3 percent this year. For 2016, economists are forecasting no growth at all or yet another recession.
As Ms. Rousseff's administration and the opposition bicker over austerity measures, the crisis is casting attention on striking levels of corruption, flawed decisions and a gargantuan public bureaucracy denounced as wasteful and inept.
Memories are still fresh here of Brazil's recent glory days, when global leaders applauded the country's robust economic growth, its reductions in inequality and its thriving democracy. Summing up the exuberance as Brazil boomed from exports of raw materials, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva triumphantly likened huge oil discoveries less than a decade ago to a "winning lottery ticket."
But the economic crisis is now curbing Brazil's ambitions at home and abroad, and its leaders are struggling to mend policies that helped expose Latin America's largest country to its worst slump in decades.
Many economists argue that Brazil's troubles have their origins in a series of policy shifts that Ms. Rousseff pursued once it became clear that the economy was slowing after a burst of 7.6 percent growth in 2010, the fastest rate in more than two decades.
Hoping to prevent Brazil from cooling too much after the sizzling boom of the previous decade, Ms. Rousseff, 67, a former Marxist guerrilla who was tortured during the military dictatorship in the 1970s and took office in 2011, doubled down on bets that she could stave off a severe slowdown by harnessing a web of government-controlled banks and energy companies.
Ms. Rousseff pressured the central bank to reduce interest rates, fueling a credit spree among overstretched consumers who are now struggling to repay loans. She cut taxes for certain domestic industries and imposed price controls on gasoline and electricity, creating huge losses at public energy companies.
Going further, she expanded the sway of Brazil's colossal national development bank, whose lending portfolio already dwarfed that of the World Bank. Drawing funds from the national treasury, the bank, known as the B.N.D.E.S., increased taxpayer-subsidized loans to large corporations at rates that were often significantly lower than those individuals could obtain from their banks.
Ms. Rousseff's critics argue that she also began using funds from giant government banks to cover budget shortfalls as she and her leftist Workers' Party headed into elections.
"They deliberately destroyed the public finances to obtain re-election," said Antônio Delfim Netto, 87, a former finance minister and one of Brazil's most influential economists. Taking note of the government's inability to rein in spending as a budget deficit expands, Mr. Delfim Netto and other economists are warning that officials may simply opt to print more money, stirring ghosts in an economy once ravaged by high inflation.
Some critics contend that Ms. Rousseff's missteps were not only tactical but also ideological in nature. Like her predecessor, Mr. da Silva, she and the Workers' Party pursued a model that enhanced the government's clout in the economy, especially in industries like oil and banking. While the strategy seemed to work for a while, early warnings about its durability went unheeded.
"Our leaders wanted to find the formula to increase their power and remain in office, even if this meant intensifying mediocrity in an economy," said Reinaldo Gonçalves, an economist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and a former adviser on economic matters to the Workers' Party.
But supporters of Ms. Rousseff contend that Brazil remains on stronger financial footing than in the past, ruling out the need to request emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund. Indeed, Brazil remains a net creditor after amassing large holdings of United States Treasury bonds; the central bank guards about $370 billion of foreign currency reserves.
Moreover, programs in which the government pays monthly cash stipends to the poor, a central pillar of declining inequality since the Workers' Party gained the presidency in 2003, do not seem to be at risk. Even Ms. Rousseff's opponents acknowledge that such programs are a relatively cheap way to combat extreme poverty, effectively assuring their continuity.
José Guimarães, a congressman from the Workers' Party, attacked Standard & Poor's after the downgrade, calling it an "agency from the end of the world."
"This downgrade won't diminish the government's spirit to find solutions for balancing the Brazilian economy," he said.
Still, Ms. Rousseff is facing fierce criticism as she tries to unwind some of the policies she promoted in her first term. While energy prices are falling in much of the world, they are soaring in Brazil as the government loosens its price controls. Residential electricity rates alone have surged more than 40 percent this year as the authorities try to recoup losses at public electricity companies.
The economic and political crises swirling around Ms. Rousseff are now feeding one another. A ruling against Ms. Rousseff by the federal accounts court could open the way for the impeachment proceedings her opponents have been pushing for.
The economic slowdown in China is also limiting Brazil's maneuvering room. As Brazil grew more reliant on exporting commodities like iron ore, soybeans and oil to China, the share of manufactured goods in its exports fell to 45 percent in 2013 from 62 percent in 2000.
"We are paying the price in Brazil for the government's mistakes over the previous decade," said André Nassif, an economist at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, an elite Brazilian university.
Brazil's unemployment rate is already surging, hitting a five-year high of 7.5 percent in July, largely because of stalled or abandoned infrastructure projects as construction giants remain embroiled in the graft scandal around the national oil company, Petrobras.
The scandal, in which contractors paid an estimated $3 billion in bribes to officials, could wipe out the equivalent of 2.5 percent from Brazil's gross domestic product in 2015, according to GO Associados, a consulting firm in São Paulo that measured job losses at contractors and the scaling back of aggressive expansion plans at Petrobras.
Not surprisingly, the national mood is souring. Only 21 percent of Brazilians express optimism about the country's future, the lowest in more than two decades, according to a survey by a leading polling firm, the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics, known as Ibope. The poll, conducted from May 14 to 18 in interviews with 2,002 people, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus two percentage points.
"Everything is trash today, and I have no idea if I'll find a job when I graduate," said Daiane Andrade, 21, a business student in Rio de Janeiro. "Unemployment and inflation are rising. Just when you think it can't get worse, it does."
Unemployment is expected to climb even higher as the authorities ponder ways to cut a federal bureaucracy that grew almost 30 percent from 2003 to 2013, to 600,000 civil servants.
A pension crisis is also brewing, partly because of laws that allow many Brazilians to start receiving retirement benefits in their early 50s, even though life expectancy has increased and the fertility rate has fallen, limiting the number of young people to support the aging population.
"How can a person who is 52 years old be able to retire with a pension?" Luiz Fernando Figueiredo, a former central bank official, asked reporters. "These things have to be confronted. If not, the country will become another Greece."
Parts of Brazil's business establishment are in revolt, openly expressing disdain. Exame, a leading business magazine, devotes an entire section called "Only in Brazil" to documenting problems with the public bureaucracy.
These examples include a $120 million light-rail system in the city of Campinas that lies abandoned because of poor planning, and a measure requiring companies to obtain a special license before allowing employees to work on Sundays.
Economists warn that fixing Brazil's problems could take years, drawing uneasy comparisons to the so-called lost decade of hyperinflation and debt crisis in the 1980s. The political battles between Ms. Rousseff and her opponents are heightening the uncertainty as many try to gauge whether she will survive the storm.
"Brazilians kept on dancing even though the music had stopped," said Norman Gall, director of the Fernand Braudel Institute of World Economics in São Paulo. "Now, they are scared."
Correction: September 25, 2015, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sept. 11 about Brazil's national reckoning with the missteps that turned an economic boom into a crisis misstated the age of President Dilma Rousseff. She is 67, not 66.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The labor market appeared to gain momentum in early September as fewer Americans filed for weekly unemployment benefits, but inflation pressures remain weak.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 275,000 for the week ended Sept. 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the 27th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, ticked up 500 to 275,750 last week.
"Consistently low readings for initial and continuing jobless claims suggest that the separations side of the labor market remains healthy, and we see little reason to expect a meaningful shift in labor market dynamics in the near term," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
In another report, the Labor Department said import prices fell 1.8 percent last month as the cost of petroleum and a range of goods dropped, after sliding 0.9 percent in July.
August's drop in import prices was the largest in seven months and suggested that a strong dollar and soft global demand were continuing to put downward pressure on imported inflation. Import prices now have declined in 12 of the last 14 months.
In the 12 months through August, import prices declined 11.4 percent, the largest drop since September 2009.
The unemployment rate, which is at a seven-and-a-half-year low of 5.1 percent, is within the range that most Federal Reserve officials see as consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation. That could bolster expectations that a pickup in wages will help lift inflation toward the central bank's 2 percent target.
For now, inflation is trending lower. Import prices excluding petroleum slipped 0.4 percent in August, the eighth consecutive monthly drop. That most likely reflects the impact of the dollar's 17.5 percent rise against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014. Imported food prices rose modestly last month and prices for capital goods fell.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories fell in July for the first time in nearly two years, a tentative sign that businesses were starting to whittle down a huge stockpile of merchandise.

Abstract: Deflation has also created worrisome "debt dynamics": Japan, unlike, say, the United States after World War II, can't count on growing incomes to make past borrowing irrelevant. When central banks like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan print money, they generally use it to buy government debt.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Visitors to Japan are often surprised by how prosperous it seems. It doesn't look like a deeply depressed economy. And that's because it isn't.
Unemployment is low; overall economic growth has been slow for decades, but that's largely because it's an aging country with ever fewer people in their prime working years. Measured relative to the number of working-age adults, Japanese growth over the past quarter century has been almost as fast as America's, and better than Western Europe's.
Yet Japan is still caught in an economic trap. Persistent deflation has created a society in which people hoard cash, making it hard for policy to respond when bad things happen, which is why the businesspeople I've been talking to here are terrified about the possible spillover from China's troubles.
Deflation has also created worrisome "debt dynamics": Japan, unlike, say, the United States after World War II, can't count on growing incomes to make past borrowing irrelevant.
So Japan needs to make a decisive break with its deflationary past. You might think this would be easy. But it isn't: Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, has been making a real effort, but he has yet to achieve decisive success. And the main reason, I'd argue, is the great difficulty policy makers have in breaking with conventional notions of responsibility.
Respectability, it turns out, can be an economy-killer, and Japan isn't the only place where this happens.
As I said, you might think that ending deflation is easy. Can't you just print money? But the question is what do you do with the newly printed money (or, more usually, the bank reserves you've just conjured into existence, but let's call that money-printing for convenience). And that's where respectability becomes such a problem.
When central banks like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan print money, they generally use it to buy government debt. In normal times this starts a chain reaction in the financial system: The sellers of that government debt don't want to sit on idle cash, so they lend it out, stimulating spending and boosting the real economy. And as the economy heats up, wages and prices should eventually start to rise, solving the problem of deflation.
These days, however, interest rates are very low in most major economies, reflecting the weakness of investment demand. What this means is that there's no real penalty for sitting on cash, and that's what people and institutions do. The Fed has bought more than $3 trillion in assets since 2008; most of the cash it has pumped out there has ended up just sitting in bank reserves.
How, then, can policy fight deflation?
Well, the answer currently being tried in much of the world is so-called quantitative easing. This involves printing a very large amount of money and using it to buy slightly risky assets, in the hope of doing two things: pushing up asset prices and persuading both investors and consumers that inflation is coming, so they'd better put idle cash to work.
But is this sufficient? Doubtful. America is recovering, but it has taken a long time to get there. Europe's monetary efforts have fallen well short of expectations. And so far the same is true of "Abenomics," the bold -- but not bold enough -- effort to turn Japan around.
What's remarkable about this record of dubious achievement is that there actually is a surefire way to fight deflation: When you print money, don't use it to buy assets; use it to buy stuff. That is, run budget deficits paid for with the printing press.
Deficit finance can be laundered, if you like, by issuing new debt while the central bank buys up old debt; in economic terms it makes no difference.
But nobody is doing the obvious thing. Instead, all around the advanced world governments are engaged in fiscal austerity, dragging their economies down, even as their central banks are trying to pump them up. Mr. Abe has been less conventional than most, but even he set his program back with an ill-advised tax increase.
Why? Part of the answer is that demands for austerity serve a political agenda, with panic over the alleged risks of deficits providing an excuse for cuts in social spending. But the biggest reason it's so hard to fight deflation, I contend, is the curse of conventionality.
After all, printing money to pay for stuff sounds irresponsible, because in normal times it is. And no matter how many times some of us try to explain that these are not normal times, that in a depressed, deflationary economy conventional fiscal prudence is dangerous folly, very few policy makers are willing to stick their necks out and break with convention.
The result is that seven years after the financial crisis, policy is still crippled by caution. Respectability is killing the world economy.

Why Bigger Wage Gains Are Still Not Happening

Abstract: Low inflation over the last year, fueled by a late-2014 drop in oil prices, means that real wage growth after accounting for inflation is more solid than it has been in recent years, but that is set to change as the impact of cheaper oil fades from inflation data.

Full text:   The unemployment rate is low by any historical standard at 5.1 percent. Businesses are complaining of worker shortages in industries like health care, construction and trucking. Household-name companies like Walmart and McDonald's have announced increases to their pay for low-wage workers.
Add those together, and it would seem to point to 2015 as the year American workers start seeing substantially larger paychecks. The only problem: There is no real evidence in the economic data that this is happening.
Rather, a wide range of economic measures points to the same sluggish pay rises in 2015 that American workers witnessed in 2011 and every year since. The giant question hanging over the United States economy -- for workers hoping to see a raise, employers trying to decide whether to give them one, and the Federal Reserve as it decides when and how much to raise interest rates -- is whether that is poised to change soon.
Average hourly earnings for all private-sector workers were up 2.2 percent in August from a year earlier, according to new data released Friday, roughly the same level at which wage growth has been for years. There has been no evidence of acceleration in pay as the year has progressed; in the last three months hourly pay rose at a 2.2 annual rate, below its level earlier in the year. Other data points to the same conclusion. Employment compensation costs -- which includes both wages and the employer's cost of health care and other benefits -- rose 2 percent in the year ended in June, in line with recent years.
Low inflation over the last year, fueled by a late-2014 drop in oil prices, means that real wage growth after accounting for inflation is more solid than it has been in recent years, but that is set to change as the impact of cheaper oil fades from inflation data.
The roughly 2 percent annual rise in wages is considerably lower than what has historically been evident when the jobless rate is in its current range (it was 5.1 percent in August). Using data since 1965, the unemployment rate over the last year would predict an annual wage increase for nonmanagerial workers of about 2.5 percent; it has actually been only 1.85 percent.
The explanation for the disconnect that best fits the data is also the simplest one. More so than in the past, the United States labor force seems to have large numbers of so-called shadow workers. These people are lurking on the sidelines of the job market but not accounted for in the unemployment rate because they are not actively looking for work.
The percentage of prime-working-age adults -- 25 to 54 years old -- who were employed fell during the last recession, to about 75 from about 80. As Jared Bernstein, who studies the labor market at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, notes, it has rebounded only about halfway, to 77 percent.
Add in some Americans over age 55 who retired earlier than they would have preferred during the last downturn but who could be coaxed back to work, and you quickly arrive at millions of Americans able and willing to work as employers have gone looking.
There has been lots of debate in recent years over whether the people who left the labor force during the recession are gone for good or will return to work amid an improving economy. The answer seems to be that they are coming back to work, just more slowly than one might hope, given that the recession ended more than six years ago.
"If we continue to get good job reports where we're adding over a couple hundred thousand jobs a month, eventually we'll see the pace of wage growth accelerate," Mr. Bernstein said. "I think that connection remains a viable one. It just hasn't happened yet because there's a lot more slack in the job market than the topline numbers suggest."
You could even imagine a story where the complaints of businesses that it is hard to find good workers, and the voluntary increases of entry-level wages, fit with this story of a large shadow work force that is glacially coming back into the market.
When there is a large pool of people who fit the official definition of unemployed -- people actively looking for work -- finding them is relatively easy. It can be a simple matter of picking the most promising applicants and paying a competitive wage.
But when the pool of potential workers is heavily tilted toward people who are not actively seeking work, as appears to be the case today, it may be that employers have to work harder to find them. Perhaps employers are paying more for the lowest-paid, entry-level staff, even as they are keeping the lid on pay increases for those at middle levels and are ultimately finding the staff they need after more difficulty than usual.
A hiring manager had an easy job between 2009 and a year or two ago, with hordes of unemployed Americans beating down the door in search of work. It's getting harder to attract and keep good staff, and some companies may be having trouble with the adjustment, said Paul McDonald, a senior executive director at the staffing firm Robert Half International.
"If I'm an employer, I'm asking, 'When was the last time I gave my employees, especially my high performers, a bump in compensation?' " Mr. McDonald said. "I'm asking myself, 'What am I doing to retain my workers?' That's a wake-up call for some clients."
In other words, right now companies may be having to work harder to find staff given a low unemployment rate. As more of the shadow work force finds its way back into jobs, employers will most likely have to back their efforts with cold, hard cash, and when that happens higher wage gains should follow.

Abstract: Inpatient hospital costs account for nearly 30 percent of health care spending in the United States and are increasing by a little less than 2 percent a year, adjusted for inflation, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The linchpin of this effort at the University of Utah Health Care is a computer program -- still a work in progress -- with 200 million rows of costs for items like drugs, medical devices, a doctor's time in the operating room and each member of the staff's time.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. SALT LAKE CITY -- Only in the world of medicine would Dr. Vivian Lee's question have seemed radical. She wanted to know: What do the goods and services provided by the hospital system where she is chief executive actually cost?
Most businesses know the cost of everything that goes into producing what they sell -- essential information for setting prices. Medicine is different. Hospitals know what they are paid by insurers, but it bears little relationship to their costs.
No one on Dr. Lee's staff at the University of Utah Health Care could say what a minute in an M.R.I. machine or an hour in the operating room actually costs. They chuckled when she asked.
But now, thanks to a project Dr. Lee set in motion after that initial query several years ago, the hospital is getting answers, information that is not only saving money but also improving care.
The effort is attracting the attention of institutions from Harvard to the Mayo Clinic. The secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, visited last month to see the results. While costs at other academic medical centers in the area have increased an average of 2.9 percent a year over the past few years, the University of Utah's have declined by 0.5 percent a year. "We have bent the cost curve," Dr. Lee said.
Inpatient hospital costs account for nearly 30 percent of health care spending in the United States and are increasing by a little less than 2 percent a year, adjusted for inflation, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
The cost issue has taken on new urgency as the Affordable Care Act accelerates the move away from fee-for-service medicine and toward a system where hospitals will get one payment for the entire course of a treatment, like hospitalization for pneumonia. Medicare, too, is setting new goals for payments based on the value of care.
Under such a system, if a hospital does additional tests and procedures or if patients get infections or are readmitted, the hospital bears the cost. To make money, medical centers have to figure out what it actually costs to provide care and how to spend less while maintaining or improving outcomes.
The linchpin of this effort at the University of Utah Health Care is a computer program -- still a work in progress -- with 200 million rows of costs for items like drugs, medical devices, a doctor's time in the operating room and each member of the staff's time. The software also tracks such outcomes as days in the hospital and readmissions. A pulldown menu compares each doctor's costs and outcomes with others' in the department.
The hospital has been able to calculate, for instance, the cost per minute in the emergency room (82 cents), in the surgical intensive care unit ($1.43), and in the operating room for an orthopedic surgery case ($12).
With such information, as well as data on the cost of labor, supplies and labs, the hospital has pared excess expenses and revised numerous practices for more efficient and effective care.
Michael Porter, an economist and professor at Harvard Business School, called the accomplishments "epic progress."
Recently, Dr. Porter and a colleague, Robert Kaplan, visited Utah and concluded that the hospital group was one of the few in health care to properly measure the costs of care. Elsewhere, with a very few exceptions, Dr. Porter said, "it's a total mess."
Other medical institutions, including MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn., are also trying to get a handle on costs.
"I can give you an unambiguous endorsement" of the Utah system, Dr. Russell M. Howerton, chief medical officer at Wake Forest Baptist Health in North Carolina, said after a recent visit.
It is not easy, said Dr. Thomas W. Feeley, who is leading the effort at MD Anderson. His group decided to go through every single process a patient experiences and figure out what the hospital paid for each person caring for the patient.
The group began with head and neck cancer, treatment of which turned out to involve 160 processes requiring measurement. To assess outcomes, it asked patients which they thought were most important. Head and neck cancer patients wanted to be able to talk and to swallow. (Survival, which many doctors had thought was a top priority, was not something patients raised; many assumed they would survive.)
At the Utah hospital, the group began by looking at how much supplies cost -- bandages, sutures, medications. Then it started tracing use of those items to individual patients.
"Let's say I need a hip replacement," said Dr. Robert C. Pendleton, Utah's chief quality officer. "Well, how many bandages did you use for me, and how many did you use for the guy in the bed next to me and the lady in the next room who also had hip replacements?
"Then you can start to say, 'Well, wait a minute, patients who have their hips replaced by Dr. Jones are using twice as many bandages. Why is that?' "
They added in labor costs, a more complicated question. Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Porter of Harvard tell hospitals to go in to hospital rooms with a stopwatch and time how long each staff member spends on each procedure and with each patient.
At the Mayo Clinic, the stopwatch is changing practices. Instead of having doctors in the emergency department type in notes on each patient, for example, the clinic has started a pilot project in using lower cost scribes do that work.
With their new computer program, executives at the Utah hospital are also finding some simple ways to improve outcomes and reduce costs.
When internal medicine doctors looked at their costs per day, they were stunned to see how much they were spending on lab tests. Each was cheap, $10 or $20, but the total bill came to about $2 million a year.
Studies have found that 20 percent to 50 percent of hospital lab tests were completely unnecessary, ordered by residents with no questions asked. Most insurers were paying a lump sum for patients' treatment so the cost for extra tests was borne by the hospital. Patients were getting so many blood tests that some became anemic.
The Utah doctors decided to require residents to justify each lab test. Orders plummeted. The hospital saved $200,000 a year.
Changes also involved bypass surgery in a project led by Dr. David A. Bull, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Utah. He and his colleagues asked what variables made a difference in costs and outcomes, hoping to improve both.
That led them to nine measures they called "perfect care," the primary determinants of how long a patient stays in the hospital after surgery, which is a major contributor to costs and a harbinger of poorer outcomes.
The variables included such practices as keeping blood sugar under control -- 75 percent of their bypass patients had diabetes -- and giving oxygen to patients who are having trouble breathing when they are taken off the ventilator. The usual quality measures, like giving antibiotics before surgery, did not affect length of stay.
The group standardized the care after surgery with those nine items in mind, and nurses were permitted to give medications or oxygen without having to contact a doctor first.
Some were skeptical the program would make a difference, Dr. Bull said. But costs fell by 30 percent because patients spent less time in the hospital and had fewer complications. Letting nurses initiate treatment meant patients got needed medications faster, and the emphasis on "perfect care" meant the most important things got done.
"When I first started working in health care, like everybody I thought: 'Oh, my God. It's such a tough problem,' " Dr. Porter, the Harvard economist, said.
Now he has changed his mind. "I have no doubt we can solve it," he said. "We know exactly what we have to do."
Correction: September 9, 2015, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about determining the cost of health care at a Utah hospital misstated the given name of a researcher from Harvard Business School who praised the hospital's efforts. He is Robert Kaplan, not Michael.

Full text:   China's Bill of Health
China reports a basket of monthly data this week that is expected to provide a clearer picture of how much its economic growth is slowing. On Tuesday, it will release trade figures for August; exports have been flat so far this year, and imports declined 15 percent in the first seven months of 2015. Other reports include inflation figures on Wednesday and industrial output, investment and retail sales on Saturday. Investors will also be watching on Monday for August data on China's foreign exchange reserves. While still the world's largest, China's reserves are expected to have declined after the surprise devaluation last month of its currency, the renminbi, which has raised concerns over capital outflows. -- Neil Gough
Puerto Rico Debt Plan
The Puerto Rico government is planning to complete its debt restructuring plan on Tuesday. The much-awaited plan is expected to include a moratorium on certain bond payments as well as structural changes to the commonwealth's budget. The plan has been in the works since Gov. Alejandro García Padilla announced in June that the island's $72 billion of debt was not payable. The completion of the plan was postponed by about a week because the government said it was busy dealing with a tropical storm. -- Michael Corkery
Debut of the New Prius
Toyota Motor is scheduled on Tuesday to unveil the next generation of its Prius hybrid, the leader in sales among alternative-fuel vehicles. While electric cars are drawing more attention, the Prius continues to dominate the market for vehicles not powered solely by gasoline engines. The auto research firm Edmunds.com estimates that the Prius accounts for 23 percent of sales of alternative-fuel vehicles in the United States. The new model, which will be shown at an event in Las Vegas, is expected get better mileage and feature more technology, as Toyota seeks to re-establish its credentials as an innovator in more environmentally friendly vehicles. -- Bill Vlasic
Colbert Returns to Late Night
A new era in late-night television begins Tuesday at 11:35 p.m. when Stephen Colbert officially takes over duties as the host of "The Late Show" on CBS. Mr. Colbert will reintroduce himself to viewers as he sheds the abrasive and satirical character he played for nine years on Comedy Central's late-night program, "The Colbert Report." His list of guests for the first week suggests his "Late Show" will be eclectic. They include Hollywood royalty (George Clooney and Scarlett Johansson), a writer (Stephen King), tech stars (Elon Musk of Tesla Motors and Travis Kalanick of Uber) and a presidential hopeful (Jeb Bush). -- John Koblin
Apple Shows Off Gadgets
Apple plans to unveil a host of new products on Wednesday at an event to be held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in downtown San Francisco. Among the new products is a revamped iPhone, the company's most crucial product. The iPhone 6S will have a higher-quality camera and a feature called Force Touch, which lets users gain access to phone functions by pressing hard on the screen, according to people briefed on the products. An upgraded Apple TV that supports video games will accentuate Apple's desire to become a bigger presence in the living room. And Apple fans can expect updated iPads, too. -- Katie Benner
Bank of England Rate Decision
On Thursday, the Bank of England will announce its monthly decision on whether to raise a main interest rate. The Monetary Policy Committee is expected to leave the benchmark rate steady at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. After the committee's August meeting, Mark Carney, the Bank of England's governor, told reporters that the timing for the first rate increase was "drawing closer," but most experts have said they believe that the committee will not raise rates before the first half of next year. According to the minutes of the committee's August meeting, one member, Ian McCafferty, said the central bank needed to begin the process of gradually raising rates or face the possibility that it might have to increase rates "more sharply later on." -- Chad Bray
Snapshot of Consumer Attitudes
The preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment will be released Friday morning, providing an early snapshot of consumer attitudes this month. Although Wall Street does not expect much change from the final August reading of 91.9, analysts will be watching for any sign that the recent sharp stock market sell-off has made consumers more anxious. This survey has been stable this year, after a big rise in 2014 as employment rose and energy prices fell. Despite the recent market volatility, most other economic data has been relatively positive, so a big drop in consumer sentiment would catch some traders by surprise. -- Nelson D. Schwartz
Ruling on G.E.-Alstom Deal
The European Commission is scheduled to rule by Friday on whether it will block General Electric's $13.5 billion bid for Alstom's power business on antitrust grounds. G.E. has been negotiating with the commission for months, proposing the sale of some assets to allay competitors' fears that the proposed combination with the French company would give it too much sway over the market for heavy gas turbines. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the G.E. boss, has said that he expects to win approval, but that G.E. would agree only to remedies that maintained the commercial logic of the deal. -- David Jolly

Abstract: Since the early 1970s, median pay has risen by only 8.7 percent, after adjusting for inflation, while productivity has grown by 72 percent. Since 2000, the gap has become even bigger, with pay up only 1.8 percent, despite productivity growth of 22 percent.

Full text:   For most Americans, paychecks determine living standards. Unfortunately, wages in America have long stagnated or declined for most working people, including college graduates.
The disappointing employment report for August -- in which wage growth showed no sign of accelerating -- only drove home that reality.
Worse, flat or falling pay is self-reinforcing because it dampens demand and, by extension, economic growth. In the current recovery, median wages have fallen by 3 percent, after adjusting for inflation, while annual economic growth has peaked at around 2.5 percent. At that pace, growth isn't able to fully repair the damage from the recession that preceded the recovery. The result is a continuation of the pre-recession dynamic where income flows to the top of the economic ladder, while languishing for everyone else.
Policy makers should be focused on strategies to raise wages, but the opposite appears to be happening. Just as Congress enfeebled the economy by switching too soon from stimulus spending to budget cuts, Federal Reserve officials have all but vowed to begin raising interest rates this year. That move reflects a belief that the economy is returning to "normal," but it would be premature, because today's norm is an economy that is incapable of generating and sustaining broad prosperity.
In a healthy economy with upward mobility and a thriving middle class, hourly compensation (wages plus benefits) rises in line with labor productivity. But for the vast majority of workers, pay increases have lagged behind productivity in recent decades. Since the early 1970s, median pay has risen by only 8.7 percent, after adjusting for inflation, while productivity has grown by 72 percent. Since 2000, the gap has become even bigger, with pay up only 1.8 percent, despite productivity growth of 22 percent.
Why has worker pay withered? The answer, in large part, is that rising productivity has increasingly boosted corporate profits, executive compensation and shareholder returns rather than worker pay. Chief executives, for example, now make about 300 times more than typical workers, compared with 30 times more in 1980, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Other research shows far greater discrepancies at some companies.
For younger people, pay has actually declined. The average hourly wage for recent college graduates in early 2015 was $17.94, compared with $18.41 in 2000. That "loss" in starting pay, about $1,000, can carry over to diminished earnings for years to come. Young high school graduates have it even worse. Their average hourly pay was $10.40 in early 2015 versus $11.01 in 2000.
The Fed is a crucial player in reversing those trends, since one of its mandates is to foster full employment. Wage stagnation is a clear sign that the economy is not at full employment, which means it needs loose monetary policy, not tightening. An interest rate hike, by sending the wrong signal of economic health, could make it harder for labor groups and policy makers to assert the urgency of their efforts to raise pay.
In the past year, low-wage workers have successfully fought for minimum wage increases in states and cities. Congressional Democrats have championed legislation to raise the federal minimum wage and to fight wage theft and abusive worker scheduling. The Labor Department is moving ahead with a much needed new rule to update the nation's overtime-pay laws.
In the midst of those efforts, it would be a setback for the Fed to act as if the economy is already near full employment. It's not. The proof is in the paycheck.

Abstract: The debate over the federal minimum wage in the nascent presidential campaign is really two debates: one among Democrats and one among Republicans.

Full text:   The debate over the federal minimum wage in the nascent presidential campaign is really two debates: one among Democrats and one among Republicans.
Democrats are divided on how much to raise the minimum, currently $7.25 an hour. Hillary Rodham Clinton has spoken favorably of a Democratic bill for a raise to $12 by 2020. Senator Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, as well as several congressional Democrats, support $15 an hour by 2020. Is $12 adequate to ensure a minimally decent living? Would $15 be economically feasible?
Going to $12 by 2020 would bring the minimum more in line with historical benchmarks, including wage and price inflation. But it is a stretch to believe that $12 an hour in 2020 would provide a minimally decent living. In 14 states and Washington, D.C., the cost of living for one person is already near or above $12 an hour, according to data compiled by economists at M.I.T. In most of the remaining states, one person now requires an hourly wage of $10 to $11 to eke out a living.
Fifteen dollars, phased in gradually, is the better option. It would be adequate and feasible, assuming that policy makers also take steps to raise middle-class wages, which would include tough enforcement of updated laws on overtime, scheduling, worker classification and other labor issues.
Among Republican candidates, two want to raise the minimum wage (Ben Carson to an unspecified sum, Rick Santorum to $8.75 over three years). Some want to leave it at $7.25, and one, Carly Fiorina, has suggested abolishing it. These positions have nothing to do with what it takes to make a living or what the economy could bear; they reflect a longstanding Republican opposition to a robust federal minimum wage. Here are some of the Republican arguments, none of which make much sense:
States should decide Mrs. Fiorina has said that setting a minimum wage should be "a state decision, not a federal decision," because of differences in the cost of living around the country. Many Republicans who want to leave the federal minimum where it is, including Jeb Bush and Gov. Scott Walker, make basically the same argument.
Experience shows that state minimums are inadequate without a robust federal minimum. Today, 21 states do not impose minimums higher than $7.25, which was already too low when it was mandated by Congress in 2007. None of the other 29 states have minimums high enough to cover local expenses for an individual worker. In New York, including New York City, the minimum will top out at $9 at the end of this year, even though it takes an hourly wage of $12.75 for one person to cover living costs in the state.
If there were no federal minimum, states would be free to perpetuate poverty level wages. Under the law in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, there is no state minimum wage; in Georgia and Wyoming, the state minimums are $5.15 an hour.
The market should decide Jeb Bush has said that ideally each state's minimum wage would be decided by the "private sector." Mr. Walker and Senator Rand Paul have said much the same thing; Mr. Paul could have been speaking for the pack when he said the "minimum wage is only harmful when it's above the market wage."
Markets do reliably establish the prices of goods and services when businesses have to compete. When businesses compete for workers, for example, wages rise because employees gain a modicum of bargaining power. The law has long recognized, however, that low-wage workers seldom have bargaining power. An adequate federal minimum wage effectively substitutes for that lack.
Businesses will be hurt Donald Trump has said a higher minimum wage would make it impossible for American companies to compete with low-paying foreign rivals. That stance is baffling given his stated aim to "make America great again," because broad prosperity requires rising wages, not a race to the bottom with countries whose economies are built on low pay.
Robots will replace workers Senator Marco Rubio has been trotting out this scare tactic at every opportunity: "I don't want to deny someone $10.10. I'm worried about the people whose wages are going to go down to zero because you've made them more expensive than a machine."
But keeping worker pay low to discourage capital investment is a recipe for a faltering economy and ignores history, in which new technology has both replaced and created jobs.
The job of economic leaders is to help ensure not only rising profits but also rising wages at all pay levels. The Democratic candidates get that a robust minimum wage is vital to that challenge. The Republicans do not.

Full text:   Despite disappointing job growth last month, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since early 2008, sharpening the debate within the Federal Reserve over whether to raise interest rates when policy makers meet in two weeks.
Friday's report from the Labor Department -- which found that employers added a weaker-than-expected 173,000 jobs in August while the official jobless rate dipped to 5.1 percent -- provided fodder for both camps to make their cases.
The slowdown in job growth and the absence of any significant wage pressure could strengthen the arguments of those who see little risk in keeping borrowing costs exceptionally low and waiting not just for more encouraging data but also for unruly markets to settle down.
On the other side, there were enough positive indicators to keep a September tightening in play, even as Wall Street looks more seriously at the possibility of a Fed move in October or at the central bank's last meeting of the year, in December.
"I don't think it changes anyone's views," said Michael Gapen, head of United States economic research at Barclays. "It's strong enough to keep the September-ists stuck on September and weak enough for everyone else who is looking for a later takeoff."
The report was hotly anticipated, mainly because it represents the last major piece of economic evidence the central bank will have on hand before its long-awaited meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.
The August payroll increase was well below the 220,000 jump economists had predicted. But the unemployment rate's fall to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent in July bolstered the case that the job market was returning to a healthier state, similar to conditions before the recession.
At that level, joblessness is nearing the threshold that economists and the Fed consider close to full employment; inflation foes worry that allowing the unemployment rate to fall significantly below 5 percent runs the risk of leading to an overheated economy.
While millions of Americans are still struggling to find work that pays adequately, there are nascent signs that wages are finally beginning to rise. Average hourly earnings rose by a better-than-expected 0.3 percentage point in August.
Most Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they think this year is the appropriate time to raise interest rates from near zero, where they have been since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008.
But the exact timing of the decision has become an obsession on Wall Street, which has enjoyed a long period of ultracheap money that helped, until the last few weeks, feed a long bull market.
For investors around the world, that sense of anxious waiting is only going to build after Friday's report, increasing the odds of more stock market swings. At the close of trading in New York, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down just over 1.5 percent, to 1,921.22. Bonds were little changed.
Whenever the Fed decides to act, the initial rate increase will be small -- a quarter of a percentage point -- but it looms large psychologically because it will be the first increase in short-term rates by the Fed since June 2006.
All this has contributed to a knife-edge quandary for Federal Reserve policy makers: Raise rates too soon and markets could plunge, economic momentum could fade and long-sought hopes for better-paying jobs could wither. Wait too long, however, and the Fed risks rekindling inflation and fostering speculative excesses on Wall Street.
Officials said at the last Fed meeting, in July, that they wanted to see "some further improvement" in labor markets. Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserve vice chairman, said last Saturday that the Fed was awaiting the results of the August survey to help make that judgment.
Not only did the jobs report do little to clarify the situation, the sharp sell-off in global markets recently further complicated matters.
"A month ago, this report and the other data on the economy would have created a strong rationale for raising rates at the September meeting," said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy. "But the world has changed and our expectation is now for a rate increase in December."
Indeed, some Fed officials are warning that the recent market turmoil hints that the economic picture might turn darker.
"In my view, these developments might suggest a downward revision in the forecast that is large enough to raise concerns about whether further tightening of labor markets is likely," Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said on Tuesday.
A minority of officials made up their minds even before the release of the August numbers. Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, delivered a speech on Friday titled "The Case Against Further Delay." Mr. Lacker, a voting member of the policy committee this year, has indicated he is likely to dissent if the Fed does not raise rates at the September meeting.
On the other side of the debate, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, argued in a speech on Thursday night that the Fed should not raise rates this year because price inflation remains too low.
The longer-term trend for job creation in 2015 has been fairly robust, even if wage gains have been disappointing. Since the start of the year, the average monthly payroll gain stands at 212,000. In addition, payroll gains for June and July were revised upward by 44,000.
As has been the case all summer, hiring in blue-collar industries like manufacturing, construction and mining was weak last month, while white-collar sectors like financial activities and professional and business services were relatively strong.
In fact, some employers in these fields are picking up the pace of hiring and offering higher salaries.
Hyland Software, a Westlake, Ohio, company that helps businesses manage and retrieve documents digitally, is on track to hire 450 new workers this year and an additional 450 to 475 in 2016. That's well above the 250 to 350 employees it added annually between 2010 and 2014.
With average starting salaries of $55,000 to $65,000 for software development and technical roles, these positions pay well, said Debbie Connelly, vice president for human resources at Hyland. But the company needs candidates with specific skills in software development and information management or credentials like an engineering or information systems degree.
"Over the last five years, starting salaries have increased as we compete for talent," said Ms. Connelly, noting that it is not always easy for a company in the Cleveland suburbs to lure workers who might be able to find similar jobs on the coasts.
"We hire many of our candidates at the entry level from Ohio colleges and universities," she said. "If you grew up in Ohio, you're far more likely to accept a job and stay in Ohio after school."
There is yet another twist for the Fed to consider. The initial employment reports for August -- for largely seasonal rather than fundamental factors -- have a long history of coming in below the underlying trend, only to be revised upward later by the Labor Department.
In addition, this year's monthly figures could also be in for a sizable revision because fewer businesses than normal responded to the government's survey.
Only 69.9 percent of businesses reported their payroll change last month, the lowest rate in nearly four years, and well below the 79.4 percent average over the last 12 months.
"That's a big difference," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. As those missing reports for August come in, she said, "it could lift the revision for private sector hires."
In other words, while a monthly gain of fewer than 200,000 jobs the rest of the year might be considered weak, this month is different, said Robin Anderson, senior economist with Principal Global Investors in Des Moines.
"The trend is so strong that one number alone won't derail the Fed," Ms. Anderson added. "These numbers are prone to revision, and you have to take the first estimate with a grain of salt."

Abstract: Do you buy that argument, or think that rising wages are right around the corner as the models predict? "The labor market continued to tighten, which should allow the Fed to feel 'reasonably confident' inflation will eventually turn higher," wrote economists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in a research note, using a phrase often used by Fed officials to describe the conditions that would prompt rate increases.

Full text:   The latest numbers on the job market, which the government released Friday morning, are good pretty much all around. But that is not really a surprise; the jobs numbers have been consistently good for at least the last year.
What makes this jobs report different from all the other ones? It is, of course, the fact that it is the last major reading on the state of the labor market before the Federal Reserve meets Sept. 16-17 and decides whether the time is right for the first interest rate increase in nearly a decade.
Nothing about the latest numbers is likely to tip the balance for the Fed one way or the other. The unemployment rate is now down to 5.1 percent, its lowest since April 2008, when the Great Recession was a mere toddler. The 173,000 payroll jobs added in August were a little below analyst expectations, but revisions to earlier months were positive. Average hourly earnings rose a healthy 0.3 percent.
The Fed has emphasized for the last couple of years that it is "data-dependent," a convenient defense for when Fed officials are asked a question they don't want to answer. (Sample question: "When are you going to raise interest rates?" Answer: "When the data supports it.")
But the data, including the new numbers out Friday, are offering no surprises that might obviously tilt a close decision one way or the other. If there were evidence that job growth and wages were breaking higher, it could make the case for pulling the trigger on rate increases. It isn't happening; instead we're getting the same consistent story that has been evident about the economy for months.
That means that the data-dependent line doesn't cut it anymore. Now we're in the place where the analytical judgments of Chairwoman Janet Yellen and her colleagues will have to prevail.
"There are nuggets here for both sides of the Fed debate," said Krishna Guha, who tracks the central bank for the research firm Evercore I.S.I., in a research note. "But there is nothing here that would obviously tip the debate one way or the other."
Two key questions stand out that they must resolve among themselves as they make their decision.
The first question: Is the labor market now tight enough that wage inflation is sure to follow, even though there is only spotty evidence for it so far?
The 5.1 percent unemployment rate is in the ballpark of what the Fed considers the long-term sustainable rate of joblessness, which means that in its models wages should start rising more soon. But in the last year, average hourly earnings for private sector workers are up only 2.2 percent, hardly a blockbuster pace of increase.
Skeptics of rate hikes argue that the low unemployment rate masks millions of workers who are available to be pulled back into the job market. Do you buy that argument, or think that rising wages are right around the corner as the models predict?
"The labor market continued to tighten, which should allow the Fed to feel 'reasonably confident' inflation will eventually turn higher," wrote economists at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in a research note, using a phrase often used by Fed officials to describe the conditions that would prompt rate increases.
The second question: How much should the new strains in financial markets and the global economy matter for United States monetary policy?
The sharp sell-off in the global stock market in the last three weeks amid an apparent slowing of the Chinese economy is sure to have some impact on the United States economy. A lower stock market means Americans are less wealthy and therefore they might spend less. A sell-off in corporate bonds means borrowing costs are now higher for many United States companies than they were a month ago.
In other words, if the Fed was looking to tighten monetary conditions by raising interest rates, global markets may have already done the job for them.
On one hand, it is important that the Fed not be led around by the latest fluctuations in financial markets and make decisions based on what is happening in the real economy, not on what is happening on Wall Street. But what happens on Wall Street affects the real economy, so it can't ignore markets entirely. This is a big moment for Ms. Yellen and her colleagues to decide which of those facts is more important.
"The August jobs report was not the smoking gun the markets were hoping for," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, in a research note.
For the Fed, the biggest question in shaping policy is usually "How is the economy doing?" We know the answer to that, and the new jobs numbers don't do anything to change our understanding of where the economy stands. In two weeks, we get to learn Ms. Yellen and her colleagues' answer to these two somewhat more complicated ones.

Full text:   Stocks moved slightly higher on Thursday as markets calmed after recent turmoil.
Investors were encouraged by comments from European Central Bank policy makers, who said they were willing to provide more stimulus to the region's economy, if needed.
Attention now turns to Friday, when an important jobs report will be released that could help determine whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this month.
"There's a lot of trepidation in the market over what the Fed will do, and it's only getting worse as we get closer to the meeting," said Kristina Hooper, head of investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors. The two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee begins Sept. 16.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 23.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,374.76. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.27 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,951.13, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 16.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,733.50.
Stocks started Thursday solidly higher, but momentum waned as the day progressed. Major indexes dipped briefly into the red by midafternoon before ending mostly higher.
Investors were initially encouraged by news from the European Central Bank, whose president, Mario Draghi, said was prepared to give the eurozone a bigger dose of stimulus if inflation across the 19-country bloc did not pick up.
Along with keeping interest rates low, the central bank is pumping 60 billion euros a month into the region's economy by buying government and corporate bonds. The program is to run at least through September 2016.
"Draghi said in 2012 he would do whatever it takes to grow the eurozone economy, and he's holding to that promise," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.
European markets jumped on the news. Germany's DAX closed up 2.7 percent, France's CAC-40 rose 2.2 percent and U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 1.8 percent.
The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates in the United States for the first time since the financial crisis. While chances of a rate increase in September have diminished because of signs of weakening global growth and a sell-off in Chinese stocks, many contend the growing United States economy may be ready to withstand higher interest rates.
Friday's jobs report for August, an important gauge of how the United States economy is doing, could play a big role in guiding the Fed's decision. Economists are forecasting that employers created 220,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent.
The price of oil followed the stock market higher. United States crude rose 50 cents to close at $46.75 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many refineries in the United States, rose 18 cents to close at $50.68 a barrel in London.
In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 1.2 cents to close at $1.437 a gallon; heating oil rose a penny to close at $1.619 a gallon; and natural gas rose 7.7 cents to close at $2.725 per 1,000 cubic feet.
United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.16 percent from 2.19 percent.
The euro fell to $1.1123 from $1.1224. The dollar fell to 119.94 yen from 120.28 yen.
The price of gold fell $8.80, to $1,123.70 an ounce; silver rose 4 cents, to $14.70 an ounce; and copper rose 6 cents, to $2.39 a pound.

Abstract: The only concrete change in monetary policy by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday was to raise self-imposed limits on how much it can buy of any single government's or private lender's bond issue.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, pledged on Thursday to intervene by increasing economic stimulus spending if the turmoil in the global economy continues.
But the central bank will not act until it has more information about the effect of a slowdown in emerging markets and other risks, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference. Also on Thursday, the central bank cut its previous growth forecasts for the eurozone economies because of the global turbulence.
"The Governing Council wanted to emphasize its willingness to act, its readiness to act and its ability to act," Mr. Draghi said after a meeting of the council, the bank's policy board.
For now, the central bank still needs to assess whether what is happening in the rest of the world is "worsening our medium-term outlook or is just a transitory thing," Mr. Draghi said. "And then we'll decide whether to do more or not."
Staff economists at the European Central Bank, in a report issued Thursday, scaled back their eurozone growth projections for this year and through 2017, citing lower demand from emerging markets -- a clear reference to the repercussions of the economic slowdown in China.
Growth in the 19 countries of the eurozone will be 1.4 percent this year, central bank economists said, compared with a forecast of 1.5 percent that they made in June. Inflation is now projected at 0.1 percent for the year, compared with an earlier forecast of 0.2 percent.
Analysts had not expected such a robust indication of stronger stimulus, and some took it as a sign that the Governing Council had grown comfortable deploying measures that were extremely controversial only a few months ago. A long debate had preceded the central bank's decision in January to begin buying government bonds and other assets to pump money into the eurozone economy. Opponents on the council had argued that the government bond purchases violated a provision in the central bank's charter that prohibits it from financing governments.
Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, said that Mr. Draghi would have been more cautious on Thursday if he still faced opposition from conservatives like Jens Weidmann, a member of the council who is also president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank. But Mr. Weidmann and other skeptics appear to have softened their resistance to government bond purchases as a stimulus measure.
"I don't think resistance within the E.C.B. council is a major argument" against additional action, Mr. Krämer said.
European stocks, which had already been up for the day, were further buoyed by Mr. Draghi's remarks. The euro also fell against the dollar, which bolsters the eurozone economy because it makes European exports cheaper abroad.
The only concrete change in monetary policy by the European Central Bank at its meeting on Thursday was to raise self-imposed limits on how much it can buy of any single government's or private lender's bond issue. The change gives the central bank more leeway to increase the asset purchases that it began in March as a way of pumping money into the eurozone economy and forcing down interest rates.
"Once again the E.C.B. has managed to provoke a desired market reaction (particularly a weakening of the euro) without any actual change in policy," Karen Ward, senior global economist at HSBC Bank, wrote in a note to clients.
In coming months, economists will probably focus on whether, and how soon, the European Central Bank might see a need to step up that bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing. Currently, the bank is buying government bonds and other assets at a rate of 60 billion euros, or about $68 billion, a month. It has said the purchases will continue at least until September 2016.
Mr. Draghi said that the central bank was prepared to adjust the "size, composition and duration" of that program if necessary. Many economists now expect it to act before the end of the year, by raising the volume of assets it buys or by extending the program beyond September 2016, or both.
The big challenges for the central bank include the threat that inflation in the eurozone will fall below zero, that there will be less demand for eurozone exports because of economic problems in China and other emerging markets, and that there will be upward pressure on eurozone interest rates because of action under consideration by the Federal Reserve in the United States.
Mr. Draghi declined to comment on what effect Fed policy would have on the eurozone, except to say that if a rate increase is necessary to achieve "the objectives of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, this is a plus for the world."
The central bank left its benchmark interest rate at 0.05 percent, where it has been for almost a year, and a change would have been a big surprise.
Unlike the Fed, which could begin raising interest rates as soon as this month, the European Central Bank is expected to keep its main rate at close to zero for some time. The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone is 0.2 percent, far below the official target of just under 2 percent.
Though the central bank displayed a willingness to increase its stimulus measures, it remains reluctant to apply the stimulus to Greece.
A Greek journalist asked Mr. Draghi whether the bailout agreement that Athens reached this summer with its international creditors would allow the European Central Bank to start buying Greek government bonds as part of its stimulus program. Such purchases would increase the market demand for Greek bonds as well as their value.
Mr. Draghi said it was too soon to make that move, however. As Greece reaches various milestones in its bailout program in the coming months, he said, the European Central Bank would assess whether to begin buying Greek bonds.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The trade deficit in the United States fell in July to its lowest level in five months as exports rose broadly, signaling underlying strength in the economy despite concerns about a global growth slowdown.
While other data on Thursday showed an increase in the number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits, the trend in jobless claims remained consistent with a strengthening labor market. Activity in the vast services sector also hovered at a 10-year high in August.
"There is little evidence that the abrupt deterioration in financial market conditions and the heightened concerns about the global economy have begun to affect the U.S. economy," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pa.
The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.4 percent to $41.9 billion, the smallest level since February. The trade deficit for June was revised to $45.2 billion from the previously reported $43.8 billion.
When adjusted for inflation, the deficit fell to $56.2 billion in July from $59 billion the previous month.
The smaller deficit implied a modest contribution to gross domestic product from trade early in the third quarter. Trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to the economy's 3.7 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter.
Data ranging from consumer spending to employment and housing have suggested the economy retained much of its momentum from the second quarter and was on solid footing when global financial markets were rocked by turbulence triggered by worries over China's economy.
The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000 for the week that ended on Tuesday.
The claims data has no bearing on Friday's closely watched employment report for August as it fell outside the survey period. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls most likely increased by 220,000 last month after rising 215,000 in July.
But job gains could come in below expectations as the first reading of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.
The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 16-17 policy-setting meeting. There is speculation the central bank could raise interest rates at that meeting.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,250 to 275,500 last week.
It was the 23rd consecutive week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.
A third report from the Institute for Supply Management showed its services industry index slipped to 59 last month from a reading of 60.3 in July, which was the highest since August 2005. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
Fifteen out of 18 service industries, including real estate, construction and retail trade, reported an expansion in activity - the most since October. Only mining reported a contraction.
"The domestic economy is holding strong. The Fed must weigh this against the prospects of a weakening global economy as they decide whether to raise interest rates in two weeks," said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
The strong services sector should help offset the drag on the economy from manufacturing, which has been hit by a strong dollar and spending cuts by energy companies.
But the buoyant dollar's negative impact on the economy is starting to ease. Exports increased 0.4 percent to $188.5 billion in July, the first rise since April. There were increases in exports of food, industrial supplies and materials, and capital goods in July. Automobile exports also rose.
Imports fell 1.1 percent to $230.4 billion, led by consumer goods such as pharmaceuticals and cell phones. However, automobile imports were the highest on record and the value of crude oil imports was the highest since January.
Soft import growth is usually associated with sluggish domestic demand. The weakness, however, is probably related to a slowdown in inventory accumulation as businesses try to whittle down a huge stockpile of merchandise accumulated in the first half of 2015.
The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit was $31.6 billion in July, up 0.4 percent from June. That trade gap will be closely watched in the coming months in the wake of China's recent devaluation of its currency.
Exports to Canada fell 8.3 percent in July and could come under more pressure after the Canadian economy slipped into recession in the second quarter.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Thursday was supposed to be an occasion for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, to take a victory lap.
Instead, he may face questions on why he and his policy council are not running even harder, given all the new uncertainties in global and European economies.
Mr. Draghi would probably prefer to note the positives. Six months after the central bank began an unprecedented stimulus program, eurozone growth has improved. Unemployment is edging lower. Inflation is back above zero, if just barely. There are signs that credit is flowing more easily. The crisis in Greece has faded, for now at least.
But on Thursday, when Mr. Draghi presides at a regularly scheduled meeting of the central bank's Governing Council, he will need to address the welter of new and in some cases unexpected threats from around the globe, which could create pressure for yet more stimulus spending.
A slowdown in the economy of China and other emerging markets has prompted wild swings in stock prices, although markets were relatively calm on Wednesday.
The Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates in the United States as early as this month, possibly causing borrowing costs to rise in the eurozone before growth is strong enough.
Some economists are even warning again about the eurozone's lapsing into deflation, a broad decline in prices that is considered poisonous to growth and employment.
An influx of refugees into Europe from Syria and other conflict zones, while outside the purview of monetary policy, adds to the uncertainty. Confusion among European leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone.
These factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, that the European Central Bank began in March as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates.
As a result, some analysts, so far apparently a minority, expect Mr. Draghi to send a strong signal on Thursday that the central bank's Governing Council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned.
But any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the Governing Council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive, pre-emptive action. It took years for Mr. Draghi to resolve those tensions and begin the bond-buying program in the first place.
"I can imagine that the controversy within the Governing Council and the debates within the Governing Council continue to be quite heavy," said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "Since there are some improving signs in the eurozone, those governors who were against quantitative easing will be against it even more."
Partly because of that dissent, Mr. Darvas said he did not expect any major shift in policy from the European Central Bank on Thursday. Many analysts seem to agree.
Nor, Mr. Darvas said, is major action necessary right away. While China is an important export market for Germany and other European countries, he said, a slowdown there will not derail eurozone growth.
And while an increase in official interest rates by the Fed could spill over into the eurozone and raise borrowing costs, higher interest rates in the United States would also tend to strengthen the dollar and weaken the euro. That would be good for eurozone exporters, because their products would be cheaper for customers paying in other currencies.
Still, at a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Draghi is almost certain to at least repeat earlier statements that the central bank is ready to deploy further stimulus if circumstances warrant.
As of Aug. 28, the central bank had spent 290 billion newly created euros, or about $327 billion, buying eurozone government bonds on open markets. The sum is roughly in line with its aim of monthly government bond purchases of [euro]50 billion.
There is scope to increase the pace of the purchases, analysts said, and some see a chance that on Thursday Mr. Draghi will signal an increased willingness to do so.
He could also signal that the European Central Bank intends to continue the stimulus spending beyond September 2016, the earliest it has said it would end the program. The central bank could also step up its purchases of private sector assets, in addition to the [euro]10 billion per month it is buying already.
"A time extension of the asset purchase program to beyond September 2016 is the most likely option," analysts at Barclays said in a note to clients, adding that the decision could come as early as Thursday, and before the end of the year in any case.
There are arguments in favor of stronger action.
Unemployment in the eurozone fell to 10.9 percent in July from 11.1 percent in June, according to official figures published Wednesday. That is the lowest jobless rate in the 19 countries of the eurozone since February 2012. Still, it is almost double the rate in the United States and far from a level considered healthy.
Inflation, at 0.2 percent in August, was unchanged from June and July. The rate is still well short of the European Central Bank's official target of just below 2 percent.
Some economists remain concerned that the eurozone could yet slip into deflation, which has already infected some eurozone countries like Greece.
And while China and the global market have at least temporarily pushed Greece from the financial headlines, that country continues to lurk as a risk to eurozone integrity. Fears have faded that Greece will be forced to drop out of the eurozone, but the country's economy is still in a shambles and there is uncertainty about whether a stable government will emerge after national elections scheduled for Sept. 20.
Mr. Draghi could help calm those worries by announcing on Thursday that the central bank is ready to lift a ban on buying Greek government bonds as part of the stimulus program. Greece should now qualify because it has agreed to conditions demanded by other eurozone countries in return for as much as [euro]86 billion in additional aid.
If so, Greece's hard-pressed commercial banks would be among the main beneficiaries because they have large holdings of their own government's debt. European Central Bank purchases would help raise the market value of those bonds and help restore confidence in the country's banks.
And Greeks who have withdrawn cash from their accounts might begin depositing money again and help the banking system return to normal.
But economists and investors hoping for powerful action by the European Central Bank on Thursday may be disappointed. The central bank is not known for acting pre-emptively, and it is likely to wait until the Fed has taken action and until it is clearer what effect China's problems will have on Europe.
"Others are betting the E.C.B. will step up quantitative easing, but it's too early," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Bank. "They still want to see what the Fed will do."

Low-Income Workers See Biggest Drop in Paychecks

Abstract: [...]the report by NELP, a left-leaning research and advocacy group, underscores why so many Americans are still angry about the state of the economy and with what they see as the inability of Democratic and Republican leaders alike in Washington to do anything to improve living standards for many ordinary workers.

Full text:   Despite steady gains in hiring, a falling unemployment rate and other signs of an improving economy, take-home pay for many American workers has effectively fallen since the economic recovery began in 2009, according to a new study by an advocacy group that is to be released on Thursday.
The declines were greatest for the lowest-paid workers in sectors where hiring has been strong -- home health care, food preparation and retailing -- even though wages were already below average to begin with in those service industries.
"Stagnant wages are a problem for everyone at this point, but the imbalance in the economy has become more pronounced since the recession," said Irene Tung, a senior policy researcher at the National Employment Law Project and co-author of the study.
Jasmin Almodovar, a home health care aide in Cleveland, knows all about that.
She has worked for the same health care agency since 2003, and for the first four years she received an annual wage increase of 25 cents an hour. But since 2007, her hourly pay has been stuck at $9.50 an hour.
"I've asked for raises several times and each time I get the runaround," said Ms. Almodovar, who is licensed by Ohio as a nurse's assistant. Bills for natural gas, electricity, food and other necessities have gone up since her last raise, she noted, leaving little extra money for her and her 12-year-old son.
In many ways, Ms. Almodovar's predicament encapsulates the contradictions evident each month when the government reports the latest figures on hiring and unemployment.
And the report by NELP, a left-leaning research and advocacy group, underscores why so many Americans are still angry about the state of the economy and with what they see as the inability of Democratic and Republican leaders alike in Washington to do anything to improve living standards for many ordinary workers.
One explanation may lie in the findings of another study released on Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute, also a liberal research group. Its report showed that even as labor productivity has improved steadily since 2000, the benefits from improved efficiency have nearly all gone to companies, shareholders and top executives, rather than rank-and-file employees.
Labor Department data released on Wednesday indicated that productivity in the American economy in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, the biggest quarterly gain since late 2013 and much better than first estimated.
The Labor Department's next batch of data on hiring and unemployment, for the month of August, is due out on Friday. Economists are looking for a gain of roughly 220,000 jobs, and for the unemployment rate to dip slightly to 5.2 percent.
Friday's jobs report is especially significant because it is the last one before Federal Reserve policy makers meet in mid-September to decide whether to go ahead with or delay their long-telegraphed move to raise short-term interest rates from near zero.
The fall in the unemployment rate from a postrecession high of 10 percent is certainly good news, Ms. Tung said, but NELP's analysis showed that once inflation was taken into account, median wages across all occupations fell by 4 percent between 2009 and 2014.
Wage declines in the lowest-paid occupations were much worse, dropping 8.9 percent for restaurant cooks and 6.2 percent for home health aides.
Along with stagnant or falling wages, one of the most persistent complaints about the current economic expansion is that many of the jobs created so far have been low-paying ones. That has changed recently, with more hiring in better-paying fields like business and professional services.
An earlier NELP study was criticized by economists for exaggerating the extent of the so-called low-wage recovery. Ms. Tung said the analysis in the report to be released on Thursday was different from the earlier report, focusing on actual wage trends within occupations, not the proportion of jobs created in different fields.
NELP's findings come at a time when income inequality and the failure of many workers to gain ground during the recovery are coming to the political fore. Candidates from both parties have sought to address the worries of middle-income Americans, while trying not to be too closely identified with Wall Street and other symbols of corporate America.
The past year has been the best for the job market since the end of the recession. Employers have added, on average, 243,000 people to their payrolls each month. That would normally constitute a "hot" job market, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
"When you see all those jobs being added per month, you think, 'Come on, how can this be bad?,' " Mr. Slok said. "But there has been a lot of pain and suffering, and people have been losing their skills or have not been able to re-skill."
The roots of wage stagnation are deep, according to Mr. Slok.
Some of it is linked to what he calls the "glacial changes" wrought by macroeconomic forces like automation, demographics and globalization.
Other factors are specific to the American economy, including the real estate boom and bust, consumer debt levels and continuing slack in the labor market because of relatively low demand compared with the still-large numbers of people who are looking for work or would return to the labor force if they had a better chance of finding a worthwhile job.
For Ms. Almodovar, 36, acquiring new credentials and skills is a big obstacle.
When she talked with her employer's human resources department about how to increase her long-frozen salary, their advice was to go back to school. Although Ms. Almodovar took the G.E.D. test and earned the equivalent of a high school diploma in her late 20s, taking classes would be a tough proposition now.
"I'm living with roommates, and if I don't go to work, I don't get paid," she said. "Even one day makes a big difference."
Many other workers in some low-paid sectors are worse off than they were a couple of decades ago.
While attending high school in the mid-1990s, Derrell Odom worked at KFC, earning $5.50 an hour. That's the equivalent of $8.61 today.
After two years of college, two military tours in Iraq and other jobs, he is back working as a cook at an Atlanta location of the fried chicken chain. Two decades after his first stint at KFC, his hourly pay now is only $7.25 an hour.
That is barely enough to support himself, let alone his fiancée and two sons. "I have leadership skills and led missions in Iraq," Mr. Odom said. "Right now, I'm trying to survive."

Full text:   MEXICO CITY -- Jesús Rascón embodies the sort of success story that was supposed to epitomize "Mexico's moment."
The plastics company he founded 13 years ago now employs 350 people in two factories. He sells parts to global companies like Volkswagen and Whirlpool. Even the slide in the value of the Mexican peso this year works in his favor because it makes his products cheaper overseas.
Then why is he feeling so glum about Mexico's economy?
In a word: poverty. "Unfortunately the problem in Mexico is the wage rate, which is enough only to survive," said Mr. Rascón, 48. Unless people have money to spend, he added, the companies that sell to them will never be able to expand the way his has.
Such economic pessimism is pervasive across much of the country as President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to reboot his presidency midway through his six-year term.
Over the past year, as his administration's credibility has tumbled in the face of corruption scandals and skepticism over its handling of the drug war, the president could still point to the package of economic changes that were sold as "Mexico's moment" and promise that better times were around the corner.
In the days leading up to his state of the nation speech on Wednesday, his administration has blitzed news media outlets with ads extolling the changes, which include rules to rein in powerful private telecommunications companies and an end to state control of the energy industry. The campaign repeats the pledge that investment and jobs are coming.
But that story is beginning to look thin.
Growth has been slower under Mr. Peña Nieto's presidency than the annual 2.3 percent average in the two decades before he took office. In the last couple of weeks, both the central bank and the Finance Ministry have reduced their forecasts, suggesting that growth in 2015 may not reach that figure either.
Salaries are stagnant, while recent studies show that inequality and poverty have increased over the past few years.
Now, just when Mexico might have begun to see the first concrete benefits of the economic revisions, the economy is being pummeled by forces beyond the government's control as global financial uncertainty mounts.
The peak of the wave of constitutional changes that Mr. Peña Nieto maneuvered through a divided Congress in his first three years was opening the oil, gas and electricity industry to private investment, reversing the nationalization of the country's oil industry 75 years ago.
The timing could not have been worse. The collapse in oil prices all but halted the predicted rush by international oil companies into Mexico and will force the government, which relies on oil revenue to fund at least a third of its spending, to make significant cuts in social and infrastructure programs next year.
The first auction for offshore oil exploration blocks in July drew so few bids that only two of the 14 on offer were awarded. Regulators have relaxed the conditions for coming bids, but the billions in investment that the government promised seem even further off.
"Energy reforms are going to kick in some time in the future," said Gabriel Casillas, chief economist at Banorte Financial Group, a large Mexican bank. "It's going to take longer, 15 years, not by 2017 or 2018 as we thought."
In addition, the peso's slide over the past year -- along with the fall of currencies in other emerging markets -- has raised the price of imports from the United States about 30 percent. That upends business investment plans and makes consumers nervous about big purchases.
There are bright spots. Prudent economic management over the years has kept inflation under control and debt in check. About $20 billion in foreign investment has poured into the Mexican auto industry over the past six years to take advantage of Mexico's proximity to the United States, its trade agreements and its skilled labor force.
The results, though, are pockets of success in the highly efficient export sector that have failed to reach those on lower rungs of the economic ladder.
"These policies have delivered stability, they haven't delivered growth," said Joydeep Mukherji, a managing director at Standard & Poor's who follows Mexico closely.
"There is a general negativeness in the air for many, many reasons," Mr. Mukherji added. "That's the hardest thing to turn around because you have to boost the confidence of investors and consumers. It requires political leadership and a different set of skills than passing a law."
There are other problems that weigh on the economy. Citing measurements from Mexico's national statistics institute, Alonso Cervera, the chief Latin America economist at Credit Suisse, estimated that crime cuts a full percentage point off Mexican growth.
"The economic reforms were very powerful and very forceful," Mr. Cervera said. "I would have liked to see the same forcefulness on judicial reform. Crime and corruption have to be punished."
Business leaders argue that preaching patience is no longer enough.
Along with opening up the energy sector, the economic changes closed tax loopholes, gave new powers to antitrust regulators, set up special rules to weaken telecommunications monopolies, encouraged banks to lend to small businesses, and gave employers new flexibility to hire and fire workers. But businesses argue that the economy now needs incentives for investment and job creation.
Analysts argue that Mr. Peña Nieto's government failed to invest during his first two years in office -- when high oil prices gave finance officials much more room to maneuver than they have now -- and lost a valuable opportunity.
"Instead of building a bridge, they put money in accounts," said Mr. Casillas of Banorte. "They earmarked money, but it was never used."
Others say the main diagnosis of Mexico's ailment was wrong.
"The reforms were oversold," said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de México and the author of a recent study for Oxfam that found that the country's already vast inequality was growing.
The government thought "that the energy issue was the solution to the country's problems," he said. "All sectors need to grow. It won't drag up the rest of the economy."
The government points to an increase of 1.4 million workers during the last two years who are affiliated with Mexico's Social Security Institute, a measure of formal employment and an indicator of success. But 60 percent of the population still works in the informal sector in jobs such as taxi drivers or street vendors, most of them barely scraping by. Almost 42 percent of workers cannot afford to meet their basic needs with their salary alone, according to one think tank, Mexico Como Vamos, a figure that is about the same as it was when Mr. Peña Nieto took office.
"Low salaries are a fundamental part of the economy," Mr. Esquivel said. "A good part of the economy has no purchasing power."
Luis Foncerrada, the director of the Center for Economic Studies of the Private Sector, a think tank affiliated with Mexico's main business alliance, argues that overall salaries have been depressed because 21 percent of the work force is either unemployed or working just a few hours a week.
"It's naïve to sit here with our arms crossed waiting for the reforms to have results," he said. "It's like telling somebody who is sick to wait five years for the cure to appear."

Full text:   Keep the seatbelts on.
Stock markets around the world tumbled Tuesday, dashing hopes that financial markets would calm down after two weeks of turbulence.
Investors appear to be growing more nervous about the strength of the global economy. China released a weak report on manufacturing on Tuesday, and an influential international policy maker sounded a downbeat note on the outlook for Asian economies. In early trading on Wednesday, Chinese stocks again fell sharply, leaving the Shanghai composite index 40 percent lower than its recent peak. The price of contracts for the future delivery of oil, an indicator of the course of economic activity, also continued to drop in Asian trading.
In the United States, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 58.33 points, or 2.96 percent on Tuesday. The benchmark is now 10.2 percent below its nominal high, putting it back in a correction -- the Wall Street term for a decline of more than 10 percent from a peak level. The S.&P. 500 index is still 2.48 percent above the low it closed at last week.
But the underlying ugliness of the action -- only three stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose -- suggested that the market could have further to drop.
And some analysts said it might be a while before the market recovers.
"You rarely get a V-shaped bottom," said John De Clue, an investment officer for U.S. Bank. "You usually bounce around for a while."
The Dow Jones industrial average, a popular market barometer, lost 469.68 points, or 2.84 percent, on Tuesday, to close at 16,058.35. The index is more than 12 percent below its nominal high, reached in May. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.94 percent on the day, and is down 11 percent from its recent high.
Investors are now scouring the horizon for events that drive the markets up or down.
Looming at the end of this week is the release of the United States jobs numbers. If the government figures on Friday show that employment growth has remained strong, investors may be encouraged that developments overseas will not do too much harm to the American economy. On the other hand, a robust jobs number may also lead investors to conclude that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month, rather than wait longer.
"The jobs numbers on Friday will be really important," said Edward J. Perkin, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance Management. "It will determine Fed policy one way or another." If the Fed decides to raise rates this month, it will most likely announce the move after monetary policy meetings scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17.
The prospect of a September rise in interest rates has worried many economists and investors. In particular, they assert that the low level of inflation in the United States is a sign that the economy is still quite vulnerable to a slowdown.
In a speech in New York on Tuesday, Eric S. Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, highlighted that inflation numbers were well below the Fed's target of 2 percent. Mr. Rosengren, who is an alternate member of the Fed's committee on interest rates, also suggested that a weaker global economy and turmoil in the markets might make reaching that level harder.
"Given the low wage and price inflation data seen to date, and increased uncertainty about global growth, it will be particularly important for monetary-policy makers to closely monitor and depend on incoming data," he said.
Even if the Fed decides not to increase rates this month, further problems in China and elsewhere could make investors reluctant to jump back into the stock market.
On Tuesday, a report from Beijing showed that Chinese manufacturing activity had slipped in August to a three-year low, with both current production and new orders falling. That added to fears that the world's second-largest economy, after that of the United States, may be slowing more than analysts had believed.
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned on Tuesday that the world economy would most likely expand at only a moderate pace and would probably be weaker than the I.M.F. forecast two months ago.
"Asia as a region is still expected to lead global growth," she said in a speech in Jakarta, Indonesia. "But even here, the pace is turning out slower than expected -- with the risk that it may slow even further given the recent spike in global risk aversion and financial market volatility."
The sell-offs in global markets started soon after China unexpectedly devalued its currency, the renminbi, on Aug. 11. Analysts at the time said the move could bolster Chinese exports by making them cheaper in other currencies. It was also expected to reduce Chinese imports, since foreign goods and services would cost more in renminbi.
Both outcomes, however, could affect countries with economies that rely heavily on exports. As a result, such countries may decide to further devalue their currencies to regain competitiveness with China. The high stakes of such rivalries were made clear on Tuesday when South Korea reported export figures for August that were well below expectations.
In contrast with past periods of turbulence, this one has not so far spurred a fierce rally in the 10-year Treasury note, a safe-haven investment. Its yield fell slightly to 2.16 percent on Tuesday from 2.21 percent on Monday.
Adding to the nervousness on Tuesday, the price of oil fell after a strong rally in recent days. The benchmark crude contract in New York declined $3.79, or 7.7 percent, to $45.41. Over time, a lower price might signal less demand for oil as economies slow.
The Vix index, a measure of volatility in the S.&P. 500 that is often called Wall Street's fear gauge, jumped 10 percent, but it is still well below last week's high.
In another sign that investors remain pessimistic, European shares declined despite an official report on Tuesday showing that the jobless rate in the eurozone had slipped by 0.2 of a percentage point in July, to 10.9 percent -- the first time it had sunk below 11 percent since early 2012. While that still leaves about 17.5 million people classified as unemployed, it suggests a modest economic recovery in the bloc.
The major European indexes all closed the day 2 to 3 percent lower. In London, the FTSE 100 fell 3 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 2.4 percent.

Full text:   Late last month, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela declared a state of emergency in areas that abut Colombia, shut down the border and ordered a mass roundup of Colombian immigrants. In a decree issued on Aug. 21, he warned that drug trafficking, contraband and rampant violence along the border made it necessary to suspend basic rights, such as public gatherings and demonstrations. After Venezuelan authorities evicted Colombians from their homes, some dwellings were marked with the letter D, meaning they would be demolished.
There was, in fact, no crisis requiring these extraordinary measures along the border, where Colombians and Venezuelans have coexisted amicably through good times and bad. The whole thing was phony, a crisis manufactured by an increasingly unpopular president who is desperate to shore up support for his party ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for December.
Mr. Maduro's popularity dipped to 24 percent in July, reflecting growing public dismay with government policies that have led to soaring inflation, a severely devalued currency and worsening food shortages. To ward off a bruising defeat at the polls, Mr. Maduro has jailed prominent opposition politicians and ordered that others be disqualified from appearing on the ballot.
Mr. Maduro's go-to boogeyman has been the United States, which he's accused of working underhandedly to oust him from power. But as relations between Washington and Caracas have marginally improved, Mr. Maduro has chosen to deflect attention from the country's problems by picking unnecessary fights with his neighbors. Earlier this year, he reignited a long-dormant territorial dispute with Guyana after learning that Exxon Mobil had discovered offshore oil reserves in Guyana's waters, asserting a right to as much of two thirds of Guyana, a tiny country of roughly 800,000 people.
Mr. Maduro then turned his attention to his western border, where his antics have disrupted an important commercial corridor, separated families and displaced hundreds of people from their homes. As Venezuelan security forces began searching home to home for Colombians the government said were in the country without authorization, hundreds of Colombians fled on foot across the border, some waddling across a muddy river, carrying a few belongings overhead.
Colombian officials have sensibly refrained from a war of words that could increase nationalist fervor in Venezuela. Mr. Maduro, meanwhile, has been characteristically glib. Last week Venezuelan television showed him doing shoulder presses on a gym machine that looked too small for his stocky frame. Smiling broadly, he challenged a prominent Colombian politician to a fist fight. Mr. Maduro should focus on the actual fight at hand: at the ballot box. Further alienating his neighbors will only deepen Venezuela's many problems.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- With little fanfare, the Obama administration has been pursuing an aggressive campaign to restore protections for workers that have been eroded by business activism, conservative governance and the evolution of the economy in recent decades.
In the last two months alone, the administration has introduced a series of regulatory changes. Among them: a rule that would make millions more Americans eligible for extra overtime pay, and guidelines suggesting that many employers are misclassifying workers as contractors and therefore depriving them of basic workplace protections. That is an issue central to the growth of so-called gig economy companies like Uber.
A little more than a week ago, a federal appeals panel affirmed an earlier regulation granting nearly two million previously exempted home care workers minimum wage and overtime protections. And on Thursday, President Obama's appointees to the National Labor Relations Board pushed through an important ruling that makes it easier for employees of contractors and franchises to bargain collectively with the corporations that have sway over their operations.
"These moves constitute the most impressive and, in my view, laudable attempt to update labor and employment law in many decades," said Benjamin I. Sachs, a professor at Harvard Law School and a former assistant general counsel for the Service Employees International Union. The goal, he said, is to "keep pace with changes in the structure of the labor market and the way work is organized."
In one sense, Mr. Obama foreshadowed these efforts as a candidate in 2008, when he suggested that, if elected, he would aim to be a Democratic version of Ronald Reagan. "Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not," he told a newspaper editorial board in Nevada. "He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it."
Once in office, Mr. Obama delivered on that implied promise in a few critical ways, particularly his signature health care legislation. But throughout much of his first term, he disappointed supporters with his inability to pursue a larger progressive agenda and with what they saw as an insufficient focus on the balance of power between workers and their employers.
Labor unions complained that he failed to throw his energy behind a measure that would have made it easier for workers to organize by requiring employers to recognize a union once a majority of workers had signed cards, rather than allowing employers to insist on a secret ballot election.
Liberals criticized the pace at which Mr. Obama put judges on the federal bench, including the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has enormous influence over federal regulations. And they complained that he failed to move quickly in placing appointees at agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, which went without two of its three Democratic members until well into the second year of his presidency.
"They were very weak on getting people into their positions in the first term," said Lawrence Mishel, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning research and advocacy group. "They lost many years of potential fruitful activity." (The White House says that the president was prompt in naming appointees, whose nominations then became bogged down in the Senate.)
After spending several months in 2011 on a failed effort to negotiate a deficit-cutting "grand bargain" with the new House Republican majority, however, Mr. Obama did an apparent about-face, deciding that he would use every tool available to enact what he considered to be a bold pro-worker agenda on his own.
"Perhaps the most substantively important speech of the Obama presidency was the Osawatomie speech in 2011," said Dan Pfeiffer, a former communications director and senior adviser to the president, referring to a speech that December in Kansas. "It was a set of marching orders to the entire government that increasing income inequality and declining economic mobility are the key challenge of our time. Given the congressional gridlock, the president pushed us very hard to pull every lever possible."
Since he has not been able to advance legislation through the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Obama has failed to achieve a number of important goals, most notably raising the federal minimum wage. And many of the recent actions could be undone by a future administration.
At the same time, the economic and political forces pushing in the other direction have proved extremely difficult to overcome. From 1979 until 2009, the hourly wage for the typical worker grew about 10 percent after adjusting for inflation, falling far behind the increase in productivity, a measure that wages once closely tracked. After the Great Recession, the median wage fell for a few years and then made up little ground through 2014.
Meanwhile, critics abound across the ideological spectrum.
Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute who served as Mitt Romney's domestic policy director in 2011 and 2012, said that calling the Obama economic agenda pro-worker "misses the forest for the trees -- or perhaps, more precisely, misses the trees for a few stray weeds."
In an email, Mr. Cass said that "increasingly onerous employment regulation is driving employers to avoid employment relationships altogether, which benefits no one."
Liberals and union supporters, while applauding Mr. Obama's record in the narrow realm of labor rights, complain that he has undercut workers with his efforts to promote global trade agreements and balanced budgets.
"As long as the budget deal the administration negotiated continues to restrict domestic discretionary spending," the Department of Labor's ability to enforce the laws guaranteeing workers a minimum wage and overtime pay "and fight misclassification will be severely limited," Ross Eisenbrey, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute who was one of the architects of the overtime regulation, said in an email.
Still, there is little doubt that the Obama administration has become more ambitious in pursuing worker rights during the president's second term.
Consider the home health care decision. The Labor Department wrote the original rule exempting home care professionals employed by staffing agencies from minimum wage and overtime protections in 1975, back when very few home care workers of that sort existed. In recent decades, however, the field has exploded, turning what was once a small exemption into a yawning regulatory gap at the heart of the service economy.
The Clinton administration proposed closing the exemption three times, but the proposals were never made final. Mr. Obama's Labor Department pushed through new rules in 2013, but they stuck only after a protracted legal fight. After the home care industry challenged the rule and a Federal District Court struck it down, it took a three-judge panel on the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia to revive it. Obama helped make that decision possible back in 2013, when he appointed two of the three judges.
In many cases, the administration and its appointees have understood themselves to be not merely updating laws and regulations to reflect current economic realities, but also explicitly undoing what they considered to be efforts of Republican administrations to put workers at a disadvantage.
"The overtime provision was intended in no small measure to correct a regulation from the Bush era that took leverage from workers and gave it to employers -- by design," said Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez. "We were restoring what was a time-honored economic and social compact, which is that as we have productivity and profitability in this country, that is shared between business and workers."
Last week's ruling by the labor board, which changed the standard for when a corporation may be designated a joint employer of workers hired by its contractors and franchisees, followed a similar logic.
For decades before the mid-1980s, the N.L.R.B. considered a corporation to be a joint employer, and therefore liable for violations of workers' rights, as long as it enjoyed a fair amount of control over working conditions at facilities run or staffed by a contractor or franchisee. It didn't really matter whether the control was hands-on or arm's-length.
In 1984, the Reagan-era N.L.R.B. began to sharply tighten the standard. On Thursday, voting 3 to 2 along partisan lines, the board tossed out the Reagan era rule, arguing that it was essentially returning to what had existed before.
Taken together with other key regulatory actions and executive orders -- an N.L.R.B. rule that effectively sped up the process for holding elections on whether to form a union and Mr. Obama's order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 -- the effect has been to significantly alter the tilt of federal law.
"We're really digging out of a 40-year hole," Mr. Mishel said. "The Clinton years were ones where they more triangulated between business and workers rather than weigh in on the side of workers."
Mr. Obama has long seen himself as working to empower the economically marginal, as steadfast in his commitment to labor protections as President Reagan was in rolling them back.
That self-image dates all the way back to one of his first jobs after college, as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago. "Those are the folks he worked with," said Gerald Kellman, the organizer and labor activist who hired him back then. "He feels strongly about this stuff."

Abstract: The unemployment rate for four-year college graduates is currently 2.6 percent, and the typical household headed by a college graduate earns $58,000 more per year more than the typical household headed by a high school graduate. The Institute for College Access and Success recommends keeping the standard 10-year repayment plan, but automatically shifting borrowers into an income-based plan if they fall behind on payments.

Full text:   Politicians who complain about college costs frequently cite two numbers: one trillion and seven million. Student borrowers owe more than $1 trillion, and seven million borrowers are in default, according to the latest Department of Education data.
It's natural for people listening to the politicians to connect the two facts with a causal arrow: More debt leads to more default. But the reality is surprising: Borrowers who owe the most are least likely to default.
The reason for this strange pattern? The biggest borrowers tend to become the highest earners.
In particular, borrowing is highest for those who go to graduate school. Forty percent of new loans go to graduate students. Among those earning law and medical degrees in 2012, median debt (undergraduate and graduate school) is $141,000 for lawyers and $162,000 for doctors.
Those holding graduate degrees tend to handle higher debt because they earn more. Over the past 50 years, workers with graduate degrees have enjoyed the largest gains of any education group, with their inflation-adjusted earnings nearly doubling since 1964. Some struggle, of course: The Department of Education estimates that 7 percent of graduate borrowers default. But this default rate is far lower than the 22 percent rate for those who borrow only for their undergraduate studies.
This fact about loan defaults is one way in which the national conversation about student debt is at odds with the data. In many people's minds, the so-called student-debt crisis revolves around graduates of selective colleges or graduate programs who run up six figures in debt.
But such borrowers aren't the real source of trouble. The vast majority of bachelor's degree recipients do very well. Only 2 percent of undergraduates borrow more than $50,000, and they also aren't the ones who tend to have problems with their debt.
The unemployment rate for four-year college graduates is currently 2.6 percent, and the typical household headed by a college graduate earns $58,000 more per year more than the typical household headed by a high school graduate.
Defaults are concentrated among the millions of students who drop out without a degree, and they tend to have smaller debts. That is where the serious problem with student debt is. Students who attended a two- or four-year college without earning a degree are struggling to find well-paying work to pay off the debt they accumulated.
We can see this in the Direct Loan program, the source of all federal loans for college students since 2010. The 3.2 million borrowers in default on these loans owe an average of $15,000, while the other 29.4 million borrowers owe an average of $26,000.
Most borrowers have small debts, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; 43 percent borrowed less than $10,000, and 72 percent less than $25,000. And borrowers with the smallest debts are most likely to default. Of those borrowing under $5,000 for college, 34 percent end up in default. The default rate steadily drops as borrowing increases. Among the small group (just 3 percent) of those borrowing more than $100,000, the default rate is just 18 percent.
What does this all mean for loan policy? Getting students to borrow less is not an obvious path to reducing default, since 51 percent of defaulters left college with less than $10,000 in student loans.
The approach of some countries, including England and Australia, is to link payments directly to income so that borrowers pay little to nothing during hard times. The United States also has income-based repayment options, but relatively few student borrowers -- currently 19 percent of Direct Loan borrowers -- are enrolled in them. The people who need these programs the most are not taking them up.
Part of the reason is the complexity of the process. Getting into and staying in an income-based plan requires an annual round of complicated financial paperwork. As is true with the process of applying for student aid, those who most need a helping hand are probably least able to navigate this bureaucracy.
There are several proposals circulating around Washington by think tanks and policy advocates that would get more troubled borrowers into an income-based repayment plan. A coalition of student-aid organizations recommends making income-based payment the universal default option, as it is in England and Australia.
I have co-written a similar proposal, which also recommends extending the repayment period to 25 years, as is it in many countries. This allows for smaller monthly payments than the 10-year payment plan that is standard in the United States. The Institute for College Access and Success recommends keeping the standard 10-year repayment plan, but automatically shifting borrowers into an income-based plan if they fall behind on payments.
Of course, if no students borrowed, there would be no defaults. But student borrowing is not going to end. Even if tuition were eliminated at public colleges, as proposed by the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, many students will still borrow to fund their living expenses. And none of the free-college proposals apply to private college, attended by 20 percent of students. Fixing repayment requires its own solution, distinct from efforts to reduce the price of attending a public college.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Conservative activists who want the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates distributed chocolate coins in golden wrappers at the local airport last week as Fed officials arrived for their annual policy retreat.
Liberal activists in green "Whose Recovery?" T-shirts formed a receiving line at the resort hotel in the heart of Grand Teton National Park where the meeting was held, to personalize their argument that the Fed should wait.
Sometime soon -- possibly as early as mid-September and probably no later than the end of the year -- the Fed plans to raise its benchmark interest rate one-quarter of one percentage point, a mathematically minor move that has become a very big deal.
Investors, who always pay attention to the Fed, are paying particular attention now. The central bank has held short-term rates near zero since December 2008; the impending end of that era is one cause of recent financial market turmoil.
But the Fed's plans have also become the latest point of contention in a broader debate about the government's management of the American economy, pitting liberals who see a need for more aggressive measures to bolster growth against conservatives concerned that Washington and the Fed are already doing much too much.
"There shouldn't be this intense interest in a quarter-point increase, and there shouldn't be this intense interest in whether it comes in September or December," said Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist and the Fed's vice chairman in the mid-1990s. "But the Fed remains the center of the financial universe. People stare at it like they stare at the North Star."
And so, as Fed officials conferred with other central bankers and academics, the liberal activists held two days of "Fed Up" teach-ins in a room directly below the main conference, while the conservatives convened a "Jackson Hole Summit" at a nearby dude ranch.
In the decades before the financial crisis, policy makers generally agreed that central banks should focus on moderating inflation. Now, both that goal and the best way to achieve it are subjects of debate. Liberals argue that the Fed should aim more broadly to lower unemployment and encourage rising living standards. Conservatives want to strengthen the focus on inflation by requiring officials to follow rules in making policy.
With the critics lining up outside, central bankers found no escape inside the main conference, where a series of academics warned policy makers that their view of inflation was oversimplified, and that their policies were less effective as a consequence.
"The conference was more about what we don't know, about a candid willingness to analyze what we don't know," said Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor at London Business School and former director general of research at the European Central Bank. "It did not really inspire confidence" in monetary policy.
The formal program, on "Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy," was devoted to the vexing reality that inflation in recent years has not behaved as economists predicted. The basic paradigm, known as the Phillips Curve, is that inflation falls as unemployment rises, and rises as unemployment falls. But inflation did not fall as much as expected during the Great Recession, and it has remained surprisingly weak during the recovery.
Over the course of two days, the invited academics argued that the real story was more complicated. One study, for example, presented evidence that prices fall more slowly during recessions because cash-short firms actually tend to increase prices in the face of declining demand for their products.
"Once you integrate all these dynamics, it may turn out that life is not that simple," said Eric M. Leeper, an economist at Indiana University and co-author of a paper arguing that central banks need better economic models.
Central bankers, however, have shown little interest in paradigm shifts. Several said that the basic understanding of inflation, while obviously imperfect, remains more functional than any alternatives.
"I don't think the folks at the Fed are of a mind to redesign monetary policy just because of what happened during the crisis," said Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.
Indeed, Vítor Constâncio, vice president of the European Central Bank, said the euro area was currently experiencing "a renaissance of the Phillips Curve."
Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, painted a somewhat more complicated picture of inflation, arguing that the role of labor market slack is easily overstated, and that exchange rates play an important role.
But his bottom line, too, was that the Fed understands inflation well enough to predict its movements. While domestic inflation has been surprisingly sluggish for years now, Mr. Fischer said on Friday that his confidence in an eventual rebound remained "pretty high."
The organizers of the fringe conferences acknowledged the odds against their more radical proposals.
"Fed Up" is mostly funded by the foundation of a Facebook co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz, which said: "Our best guess is that the campaign is unlikely to have an impact on the Fed's monetary policy, but that if it does, the benefits would be very large."
Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation, spoke at the conservative conference of "a long and difficult battle that we can and must win."
The Center for Popular Democracy, which organized the "Fed Up" campaign, wants the Fed to keep rates near zero even as overall unemployment falls, to spur wage gains and help members of minorities, in particular, find jobs. It brought about 50 people to Jackson Hole as part of an effort to engage community groups that generally focus on civil rights or local issues like minimum wage laws.
Dawn O'Neal, 48, makes $8.50 an hour as a day care worker in suburban Atlanta; her husband has not found regular construction work in a year. When Ms. O'Neal needs a refill on her asthma medication, she cuts back on food, buying hot dogs instead of beef and canned vegetables instead of fresh vegetables.
"I don't feel like anyone at the Fed has ever had to make a decision about whether to eat or get medication, and so when I hear that they're going to raise interest rates in September, it angers me and it scares me," Ms. O'Neal said.
The protesters struck a chord with some officials at the main meeting. Jason Furman, President Obama's chief economic adviser, went downstairs and delivered an impromptu speech. "We don't comment on monetary policy, but what I can say is that monetary policy matters," he told the activists. The prosperity of the late 1990s, he added, resulted in part from "a set of decisions made by the Federal Reserve that allowed that to happen."
Other officials, however, said the push for low rates was misguided.
"The biggest risk for those that are less fortunate is that we would go back into recession," said James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who said he leaned toward raising rates in September. "I'm hoping my policy would lengthen out the expansion longer."
The conservative conference was aligned with efforts by congressional Republicans to impose new restrictions on the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. A leading proposal would require the Fed to choose a formula for setting rates and stick with it.
This view has few fans among the central bankers, who see their own judgment as an essential part of policy making.
Mr. Blinder said part of the disconnect between the officials and the activists may reflect that broader concerns motivate liberals and conservatives. Conservatives see the Fed as enabling the growth of the federal debt, while liberals see the Fed as contributing to the rise of inequality.
Mr. Blinder said the central bank had little power to reverse either trend. "They overstate the importance and power of the Federal Reserve," he said. All it can do, he added, is "address these problems around the edges."
Correction: September 1, 2015, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about pressure on the Federal Reserve from groups with differing ideas on when the Fed should raise interest rates misidentified, in some editions, the group that organized the "Fed Up" campaign, which wants the Fed to keep rates low, to lower unemployment rates and to raise living standards. It is the Center for Popular Democracy, not the Center for Public Democracy.

Full text:   By the close of the stock market on Friday, the recent ups and downs in share prices had worked out to a mild correction. In all, the market was down 6.6 percent from its all-time high in May.
Yet it's hard to escape a vague sense of unease. The swoon that began a week before last was quickly attributed, at least in part, to China's economic problems. Just as quickly, many investors and policy makers concluded that China's leaders would manage those problems in ways that would allow the global economy to chug along. But what if they don't? A prolonged slowdown is more likely to provoke social unrest in China than in other developed economies, because stability there has been based on high growth rather than political and other institutional arrangements. The prospect of social unrest, in turn, raises economic and national-security concerns not raised by economic crises elsewhere.
Closer to home, market volatility has significantly reduced the odds that the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates at its next meeting in mid-September. A delay is nothing to lament, because the still significant slack in the labor market would make an increase this year premature. The Fed has generally played down the potential impact of China and other international headwinds, while asserting that the negative effects of low oil prices and a strong dollar were likely to be temporary. But these forces are proving potent and long lasting -- further reason to give the Fed pause.
Renewed stock market downdrafts could disrupt the economy, and the Fed's plans, in other ways. The recovery in housing is an important gauge of economic health. But this year, the big increases in sales and prices have come at the high end of the market, where investment wealth is assumed to be more of a factor in the decision to buy than wages and salary. The very real possibility is that if the stock market falters again, so too will the housing market.
Economic fundamentals today are no different than they were before the market took a walk on the wild side. Inflation is well below the Fed's target of 2 percent. Unemployment is still higher than it was before the last recession and wages have shown no signs of rising. The economy is being propelled forward by consumers and other advantages, and being held back by insufficient government spending and other disadvantages.
It all works out to an economy growing at 2.5 percent. At that modest pace, the United States cannot be of much help if other economies falter. But it can rebound from a market swoon, at least for now.

Full text:   JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Federal Reserve's vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, said on Saturday that he saw "good reason" to expect that inflation would rebound to a healthier pace as the American economy continued to grow.
The remarks, delivered at an annual conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, reinforced other recent indications that the Fed remained on course to raise interest rates this year. Mr. Fischer said on Friday that the Fed's policy-making committee would consider acting when it meets in September, adding that economic conditions in the United States were approaching the standards the Fed has said would be necessary for it to raise rates.
His remarks on Saturday were highly anticipated after days of turmoil in financial markets that raised questions about whether the Fed's plans had changed. Mr. Fischer, an important adviser to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, was also stepping into a void created by Ms. Yellen's decision not to attend this year's Jackson Hole meeting.
The Fed said after its meeting in July that it wanted to see "some further improvement in the labor market" before raising rates. The next week, the Labor Department announced that the economy had added an estimated 215,000 jobs in July. "We now await the results of the August employment survey," Mr. Fischer said on Saturday, "which are due to be published on Sept. 4."
As for inflation, the Fed has said repeatedly that it will act based not on observed inflation but instead on its expectations for future inflation. The Fed exerts gradual influence on economic conditions, so officials must set interest rates on the basis of their expectations about developments.
The Fed's preferred measure of inflation shows that prices rose 0.3 percent during the 12 months ending in July, well below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed considers healthy. A narrower measure excluding food and oil prices, which the Fed regards as more predictive, increased 1.2 percent over that same period.
Inflation by both measures has stayed below 2 percent for more than three years.
Some outside economists -- and a few Fed officials -- argue that the central bank should not raise interest rates until inflation returns to an annual pace of 2 percent, the Fed's declared target. Lower inflation limits the Fed's ability to respond to economic downturns. It also can slow growth by making debts harder to repay and by impeding adjustments in wages and prices.
These economists also see low inflation as evidence that the economy continues to operate below capacity, suggesting that the Fed can safely continue its stimulus campaign -- and perhaps should be doing even more.
Mr. Fischer said on Saturday that the impact of economic slack might be overstated, noting that conditions had undoubtedly improved but inflation had not rebounded.
He pointed to evidence that the strength of the dollar was a major culprit. As the American economy grows and the rest of the world struggles, the dollar has gained value in comparison with foreign currencies. Americans are buying more cheap imports, holding down the cost of living, while American companies are struggling to sell exports, putting a damper on economic growth.
These headwinds, Mr. Fischer said, were beginning to subside.
"Given the apparent stability of inflation expectations, there is good reason to believe that inflation will move higher as the forces holding down inflation dissipate further," he said. "While some effects of the rise in the dollar may be spread over time, some of the effects on inflation are likely already starting to fade."
Even so, Mr. Fischer declined to deliver an explicit verdict on September.
"I will not, and indeed cannot, tell you what decision the Fed will reach Sept. 17," he said, referring to the date of the Fed's next policy meeting.
Mr. Fischer and other officials have said the Fed might delay an increase because of the turmoil in financial markets even if domestic economic conditions are ripe.
Officials say they are not inclined to act in the face of volatility, in part because they see little practical difference between moving in September and waiting a little longer. The Fed is also scheduled to meet in October and December.

Full text:   Ruth Sivard, an economist who for more than three decades drew attention to the disparity between social and military spending around the globe, even after the Pentagon objected to her making that comparison for a federal agency, died on Aug. 21 at her home in Washington. She was 99.
The cause was complications of dementia, her daughter, Susan, said.
As chief of the economics division of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, she issued her first analysis of worldwide defense expenditures in 1964.
With military spending rising precipitously, Ms. Sivard and her staff decided two years later to dramatize the competition for resources by also measuring government budgets for things like education, health and foreign aid.
Her reports informed the public debate over arms control by incorporating social indicators like infant mortality and female literacy, and suggesting how even modest reductions in military spending could help national governments meet their social goals.
Hers were not impenetrable tracts intended to gather dust on government shelves. She infused them with provocative facts -- noting early on, for example, that developed nations had as many soldiers per capita as teachers, and that 25 percent of the world's scientific talent was devoted to defense.
In 1970, Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird described the comparisons as misleading and said they were "complicating the Pentagon's task of presenting the defense budget to Congress." The Nixon administration ordered the arms control agency to stop publishing its analyses.
Ms. Sivard quit the next year; formed a nonprofit, World Priorities; and began publishing "World Military and Social Expenditures." It would be issued in 16 editions from 1974 -- when world military spending was nearing $300 billion on "an arms race out of control," she wrote -- to 1996, when, in developed countries alone, it had surpassed $500 billion in constant dollars.
In 1981, the diplomat George F. Kennan wrote in his foreword to the seventh edition, "These volumes paint, as does scarcely any other publication of these dimensions, the irrefutable statistical picture of the way in which our civilization is hurrying, in its anxious preoccupation with armed conflict, towards its own destruction."
Seeking what she described as "an objective basis for assessing relative priorities," Ms. Sivard warned in 1978: "The arms race clashes with world development needs, stimulates price inflation, contributes to unemployment and poverty. It amplifies problems that all nations have in common, while weakening the cooperative effort necessary to deal with them. The accumulation of destructive force in the name of national defense has itself become the major threat to international stability and human security."
Ms. Sivard published her report with the support of groups like the World Policy Institute, the Arms Control Institute and the Congress for Peace Through Law. She published several similar surveys on women's equality and energy. She eventually stopped because of poor health.
Ruth Lucille Leger was born in Elmhurst, Queens, on Nov. 25, 1915. Her father, George, was a wool salesman. Her mother, the former Susan Zieten, was a seamstress.
She graduated from Flushing High School, where she met her future husband, Robert Sivard, who would become the art director for the United States Information Agency. After graduating from Smith College in 1937 with a degree in sociology, she earned a master's in economics at New York University.
She worked for several federal agencies and international relief organizations in Washington and Europe before joining the arms control agency in 1961.
In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, James, and two grandsons.
In his foreword to the 1978 edition of Ms. Sivard's report, the economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that few political contests were more unequal than the competition with the military for limited resources.
"On the one side, powerful military bureaucracies, influential and richly financed weapons industries, their lobbies, their captive legislators, those for whom paranoia or past wars are a way of life," he wrote. "On the other side, only reason, the will to survive, the inarticulate poor."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending rose in July as American households stepped up vehicle purchases, but consumer sentiment dipped in August. Though confidence remains at levels consistent with solid spending growth, many households have been fretting over a recent stock market sell-off.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity in the United States, increased 0.3 percent last month, after a similar gain in June.
Spending on long-lasting goods like automobiles increased 1.1 percent, reversing June's decline. Auto purchases accounted for about half of the increase. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent; it was flat in June.
"We score this report as a solid adjunct to yesterday's strong G.D.P. report that should encourage members of the Fed's policy-making committee that income and spending fundamentals remain in good shape," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Economists say that underlying strength -- also highlighted by a rebound in business spending, and buoyant housing and labor markets -- gives the economy muscle to weather the fallout from the market rout.
The economy grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, according to revised data released on Thursday. The consumer spending data was the latest report indicating momentum in the economy as it confronted global markets turbulence, sparked by concerns over a slowing Chinese economy, which has diminished the chances of an interest rate increase next month.
The personal consumption expenditures index, excluding food and energy, rose 1.2 percent in the 12 months through July, the smallest rise since March 2011.
In another report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 91.9 this month from a reading of 93.1 in July. Still, the index remained at levels consistent with a 2.9 percent growth pace in consumer spending this year.
The University of Michigan survey showed a mild decline in buying intentions for durable goods and an increase in home purchase expectations.
"We continue to see relatively stable buying intentions as a positive for consumer spending activity in the months to come. And as the global equity markets have rebounded, we expect consumer confidence to pick up over the next few months," said Cheng Chen, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
Consumer spending should be supported by steady income growth and higher savings. Last month, personal income increased 0.4 percent in July. Income has risen by that same percentage for four straight months.
Savings increased to a $651.1 billion annual rate, from $627.3 billion in June.
"The economy has built up a huge amount of steam to push it forward in the months to come with the substantial cash reserves that consumers are holding," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

Full text:   THE financial markets and the Federal Reserve Board have been playing out a tragicomedy in three acts. Here's how it works: Initially, a flurry of news stories appear about how, a few months hence, the Fed intends to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in years. Second, the predictable market swoon, as Wall Street traders ponder the fact that the morphine drip of free money that they have been enjoying since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis might be pulled out of their arms. Finally, the Fed backs away from its much-overdue policy change, causing traders to rejoice and the artificially stimulated bull market in both stocks and bonds to continue. The curtain comes down, and the audience roars its approval.
A similar drama occurred in the spring of 2013, during what has been called the Taper Tantrum. And now it's happening again.
Some background: At end of the 2008, the Fed dropped its benchmark short-term interest rate to around zero. It also began a program with the Orwellian name of quantitative easing -- buying huge sums of bonds to suppress long-term interest rates and stimulate lending and spending. Thanks to Q.E., the cost of borrowing money was pushed to next to nothing. This was a bonanza for those who make money from money -- hedge-fund managers, private-equity moguls, banks -- and a disaster for savers, retirees and anyone on a fixed income. (Have you checked the interest your bank pays you on your savings account? Mine: .06 percent per year.)
The Taper Tantrum began in May 2013, when Ben S. Bernanke, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, announced in congressional testimony that later in the year the Fed would most likely start slowing -- hence, "tapering" -- its monthly bond buying. On June 19, in a news conference, Mr. Bernanke reaffirmed that decision: The Fed, he said, "currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year." Before the afternoon was out, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen more than 200 points, or 1.4 percent, and the bond market tanked as the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 2.36 percent, its highest level since March 2012. The Fed quickly backed down and the rallies in the stock and bond markets resumed.
The third round of quantitative easing ended last fall. And all of this year, the markets have been chattering about an expected announcement that the Fed will finally -- after nine years -- raise short-term interest rates in September, by a modest 0.25 percentage points.
Yes, it would be a little painful to start having to pay a little more for short-term borrowing and, yes, the net worth of Wall Street billionaires might increase at a slightly lower rate, but it looks as if the moment is at hand to end the morphine drip.
The case for raising rates is straightforward: Like any commodity, the price of borrowing money -- interest rates -- should be determined by supply and demand, not by manipulation by a market behemoth. Essentially, the clever Q.E. program caused a widespread mispricing of risk, deluding investors into underestimating the risk of various financial assets they were buying.
The only way to return the assessment of risk to something resembling normalcy is to stop the manipulation. That requires nothing less than serious intestinal fortitude from the Fed and a willingness to raise interest rates in the face of determined opposition from Wall Street.
Sadly, the Fed, under Mr. Bernanke's successor, Janet L. Yellen, seems to be caving. The worsening economic news from China, combined with uncertainty about the Fed's plans, contributed to the recent sharp declines in stock markets around the world.
All too predictably, the powerful advocates of the Fed's zero-interest-rate policy have raced to its defense. Under the headline "The Fed looks set to make a dangerous mistake," Lawrence H. Summers, the former Harvard president and Treasury secretary, wrote in The Financial Times, "At this moment of fragility, raising rates risks tipping some part of the financial system into crisis, with unpredictable and dangerous results." He then tweeted, "It is far from clear that the next Fed move will be a tightening" (a raising of rates).
Around then came a leaked note to clients from Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds, agreeing with Mr. Summers's assessment. He warned that the Fed might be so wedded to its "highly advertised tightening path that it will be difficult for them to change to a significantly easier path if that should be required."
This elite pas de deux reached a crescendo on Wednesday when William C. Dudley, the president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that, upon reflection, September was not the time for the Fed to raise short-term interest rates. The argument for doing so, he said, seemed "less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago," noting that "international developments have increased the downside risk to U.S. economic growth somewhat." Once the news of Mr. Dudley's words got out, the markets rocketed upward. Crisis averted?
Thursday was also the first day of the annual central-banker retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The gathering's theme is the boring-sounding "Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy," but it's the perfect setting for these supposedly brilliant economists to figure a way out of this perennial Catch-22 once and for all. The right answer is self-evident: End the easy-money addiction, raise rates in September and begin the healing.

What Carter Achieved as President

Full text:   To the Editor:
"Jimmy Carter's Unheralded Legacy," by Stuart E. Eizenstat (Op-Ed, Aug. 25), gave only passing reference to one of President Jimmy Carter's most significant achievements: making human rights a cornerstone of foreign policy.
While his predecessors informally pledged to uphold human rights, President Carter declared, in Presidential Directive 30: "It shall be a major objective of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights throughout the world." As part of this policy, the United States condemned repression in countries like the Soviet Union and Uganda, reduced aid to governments that systematically violated human rights, and stopped importing chrome from the white supremacist government of Rhodesia.
President Carter said it was the "historical birthright" of Americans to respect human rights. He didn't mean that the United States was exceptionally ennobled; he was -- and is -- diligent in calling out American violations. Rather, he meant that respect for human rights was our country's founding ideal, and we should judge ourselves as a nation by our fidelity to it.

To the Editor:
Another example supporting Stuart E. Eizenstat's claim that President Jimmy Carter's greatest achievements were in foreign policy is SALT II.
The strategic arms limitation treaty, an offensive nuclear arms pact between the United States and the Soviet Union, was signed in Vienna in June 1979. The full Senate never got to debate the draft treaty; after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan later that year, President Carter asked the Senate to delay consideration. Still, the terms negotiated were informally complied with beyond President Reagan's first term and into the tenure of the Soviet Union's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
It was both militarily and symbolically significant that the SALT II framework continued to serve as a high-profile example of something Moscow and Washington could agree on -- however informally -- even when Cold War tensions were on the rise.

To the Editor:
Jimmy Carter certainly did some good things as president, as noted by Stuart E. Eizenstat, his former White House aide. One of the greatest impacts of his one-term presidency, however, was the setting of the stage for the election of Ronald Reagan and the imposition of the trickle-down/supply-side conservative policies that still adversely affect our economy.
People forget that in 1976 Ronald Reagan was perceived by many Americans as a right-wing extremist. He was regularly lampooned on the hot new show "Saturday Night Live" as a doddering, out-of-touch reactionary. But after four years of the Carter administration, with double-digit inflation, gas lines and a general air of ineffectiveness emanating from the White House, voters rushed to the polls to elect Ronald Reagan as president.

To the Editor:
Stuart E. Eizenstat reminds us that Jimmy Carter worked tirelessly for many important achievements during his term in office. One not mentioned was the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
Those of us who witnessed the president signing this epochal public land law in the East Room on Dec. 2, 1980, realized that in that moment our national park system and our National Wildlife Refuge System doubled in size, the miles of rivers protected in our Wild and Scenic Rivers System vastly increased, and our statutorily protected wilderness areas grew by 57 million acres.
As a leader in the citizen campaign working to persuade Congress to enact this law, I know just how engaged President Jimmy Carter was day to day in persuading members of Congress that this would be an achievement in which they, too, could take great personal pride.

To the Editor:
Jimmy Carter was a better president than most give him credit for, but airline deregulation is not one of his finer accomplishments.
With deregulation came the hub system, forcing travelers to go from here to somewhere else much of the time before getting to there. Smaller airports lost service altogether. And speaking of service, airlines could now dispense with that, since pricing was all important rather than differentiation based on the quality and comfort of a particular flight.
So, sorry, Mr. Carter, despite all the good you did, and have continued doing, I long for the days of a reasonably sized seat and some knee room, a menu from which selections could be made and, yes, even fewer passengers elbowing one another at the baggage carousel.
RICHARD M. FRAUENGLASS
Huntington, N.Y.
To the Editor:
"Jimmy Carter's Unheralded Legacy" ought to be required reading for every citizen, especially those too young to have witnessed and experienced Mr. Carter's commitment to a true democracy with a government of, by and for the people.
The former president is one of Us ... not one of Them.

Ukraine and Top Creditors Make Deal on Foreign Debt

Abstract: Ukraine and its main creditors agreed on Thursday to restructure $18 billion of the country's foreign debt, in a rare deal between bond funds and a wobbly, emerging-market government. Officials in Kiev, the capital, had been hinting strongly that the creditors should accept the loss given the glaring signs of corruption in the government of Mr. Yanukovych, who kept a private zoo and golf course at his residence.

Full text:   Ukraine and its main creditors agreed on Thursday to restructure $18 billion of the country's foreign debt, in a rare deal between bond funds and a wobbly, emerging-market government.
If the deal is approved by the Parliament of Ukraine, it would write off 20 percent of the nation's foreign debt, helping to avoid a drawn-out, Greek-style negotiation with large bondholders. The terms would also offer financial relief to Ukraine during a deep recession and an armed conflict with pro-Russia separatists.
But it leaves unanswered whether lenders not represented in the negotiating committee -- including, critically, Russia -- would comply with the deal. The committee of creditors backing the proposal represents holders of about half of the debt.
Under the proposal, bondholders, including the California-based Franklin Templeton fund, Ukraine's largest lender, would accept an immediate loss on the principal. The deal would allow Ukraine to delay repayments for four years, though interest rates would rise slightly. The creditors might recoup some losses after 2021 if the country's economy returns to growth faster than expected.
In only three other instances in the last 15 years did creditors agree to reduce principal amounts without a country heading first into default, according to Ukraine's minister of finance, Natalie A. Jaresko. The previous cases involved Greece, the small Central American nation Belize, and St. Kitts and Nevis, in the Caribbean.
"It's a benchmark for emerging markets" that might serve as a template for other countries bogged down by debt, Ms. Jaresko said on Thursday in a telephone interview. "It is every sovereign's dream."
"I would hope that it shows that you don't need to rush into a default, even having the willingness to use a moratorium if needed," she said, adding that a country can end up "working with creditors" and "not on opposite sides of the table."
Big bond investors, like Michael Hasenstab at Franklin Templeton, poured money into Ukraine before President Viktor F. Yanukovych was ousted last year. The Yanukovych government had lobbied Franklin Templeton to hold its bonds, sending a first deputy prime minister to the fund's offices in San Mateo, Calif., even as Ukraine's foreign policy swiveled away from the West toward Russia and the economy started to skid.
Although the economy was stumbling, some investors argued they would win regardless of the geopolitical outcome, because either the International Monetary Fund or Russia could be expected to bail them out with public sector aid to Ukraine.
After the power change, the cash-poor Ukraine started pushing for debt relief. The government asked for an immediate 40 percent reduction and threatened to default. Officials in Kiev, the capital, had been hinting strongly that the creditors should accept the loss given the glaring signs of corruption in the government of Mr. Yanukovych, who kept a private zoo and golf course at his residence.
The Ukrainian officials argued that an initial bailout might not have worked, if bondholders had held out. If that had happened, Ukraine faced being back at the table with creditors again and again -- much like Greece.
But big investors initially resisted, arguing instead for extending the repayment period. They figured Ukraine's economy would recover quickly enough to make the payments by dipping into gold and foreign currency reserves.
Eventually, they compromised, agreeing to a 20 percent loss. Franklin Templeton's bonds, once worth $7 billion, are now worth roughly $4.6 billion. Franklin Templeton declined to comment.
Under a concession, the government will pay the creditors bonuses under a value recovery instrument, if Ukraine's economy bounces back faster than expected.
If gross domestic product rises faster than 3 percent after 2021, for example, Ukraine must pay creditors part of the total value of the economic growth. It would be based on a sliding scale from 15 percent to 40 percent, depending on how quickly things pick up.
The deal also helps Ukraine meet a requirement of the International Monetary Fund to save $15.3 billion by reducing payments to commercial creditors over four years. Ukraine had to do so as a condition of receiving $34.7 billion in I.M.F. loans and aid from the United States and other Western nations.
"Less of the government's scarce financial resources will be spent servicing high debt levels taken on by previous governments," Ukraine's Ministry of Finance said in a statement. "And more will be available for critical social spending and national defense."
The Ukrainian Parliament must vote on the deal and, if it is approved, creditors not represented in the committee would have to decide whether to participate.
That could be complicated, given that Russia is a major creditor.
Russia is unlikely to be swayed by the Ukrainian government's arguments to lenders that the agreement would free money for the military to fight the separatists in the east of the country. A protracted legal dispute could ensue.
Anton G. Siluanov, the Russian finance minister, said on Thursday that he expected Ukraine to repay its debt to Russia in full.
And the deal hardly solves Ukraine's broader economic problems. Besides its debt, Ukraine is plagued by high inflation. The inflation rate peaked at 60 percent in April and was still at 55 percent in July.
The central bank raised an important interest rate significantly in March, in an attempt to curb inflation, which had been made worse by a decline in the value of the currency, the hryvnia.
But the situation is showing signs of stabilizing. On Thursday, after the government announced the debt-reduction agreement, it cut the rate by 3 percentage points, to 27 percent.

Abstract: Mr. Maduro says the Colombian immigrants include smugglers who spirit much-needed goods out of his country, worsening chronic shortages; black marketeers who drive up prices for products in Venezuela, where inflation is soaring; and right-wing paramilitary groups that Mr. Maduro accuses of seeking to attack his government, under orders of his enemies at home and abroad. For now, the focus of Mr. Maduro and the hundreds of soldiers he dispatched has been on a large slum that hugs the Táchira River separating the two countries, an area he says is a nest of paramilitary groups, brothels, criminals and smugglers.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED. SAN ANTONIO DEL TÁCHIRA, Venezuela -- At night and in the early morning, they wade across the thigh-deep river in Colombia, with televisions, refrigerators and other household possessions on their backs. By day, watched by gun-toting soldiers, they line up to cross what was once a busy international bridge now under military lockdown, dragging roller suitcases while their children shoulder school backpacks.
Hundreds of Colombians are fleeing across the border, running from a crackdown on immigrants initiated by Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro.
"It's heartbreaking," said Handerles Suárez, 25, a construction worker, as he waited with his wife and baby daughter at dusk to cross the Simón Bólivar Bridge to his native Colombia. He said he had lived in Venezuela for 10 years, but now, seeing his countrymen rounded up and deported, their houses marked for demolition by the government, he decided to leave voluntarily rather than risk the uncertainty of a forced departure.
"Venezuela has given us everything," he said, tears in his eyes. "It's been like a second mother to us."
Last Friday, Mr. Maduro ordered troops to close the border here, shutting bridges to almost all traffic and commerce with Colombia. And he declared a state of emergency in a stretch of territory along the border, allowing warrantless searches and placing restrictions on public gatherings or protests.
At the same time, soldiers in this Venezuelan border town began house-to-house searches in a sprawling slum, checking identity papers and rounding up hundreds of Colombian citizens, many of whom had lived in Venezuela for years. They were made to sit in a dusty soccer field under the baking sun for hours before being sent to the bridge and kicked out of the country.
Officials said that more than 1,000 people were deported.
In closing the border, Mr. Maduro said he was responding to an episode in which three Venezuelan soldiers were shot and wounded. The details remain hazy, but Mr. Maduro said it was an attack by a Colombian paramilitary group obeying the orders of a former Colombian president, Álvaro Uribe, whom he has frequently described as an enemy bent on overthrowing his leftist government.
Mr. Maduro said the border shutdown would last indefinitely, and that he planned to expand the state of emergency to other parts of the country.
But to analysts and those caught in the crackdown, the state of emergency was inextricably tied to the economic and political crisis gripping Venezuela, with politicians looking for someone to blame.
Mr. Maduro says the Colombian immigrants include smugglers who spirit much-needed goods out of his country, worsening chronic shortages; black marketeers who drive up prices for products in Venezuela, where inflation is soaring; and right-wing paramilitary groups that Mr. Maduro accuses of seeking to attack his government, under orders of his enemies at home and abroad.
For now, the focus of Mr. Maduro and the hundreds of soldiers he dispatched has been on a large slum that hugs the Táchira River separating the two countries, an area he says is a nest of paramilitary groups, brothels, criminals and smugglers.
During a televised news conference this week, he vowed to raze the slum.
"We're going to knock down all the houses there, just so you know," Mr. Maduro said. "Not a single house will remain."
The warnings set off despair and anger here in the neighborhood, where a backhoe has already started knocking down houses. Many people said they were hard-working Venezuelan citizens or Colombians with legal residency, and they asked why their homes were slated to be torn down.
"I don't see the justification at all," said Jairo Gómez, 55, a Venezuelan who has a small business selling empanadas. He built a house here 13 years ago and now fears he will lose it.
In an area of the slum, named after the Argentine revolutionary hero Che Guevara, a backhoe was brought in this week and began knocking down the cinder block houses.
On Wednesday night, some families were busy dismantling their own homes to salvage the construction materials so they could be sold or used again later.
"You just want to lie down and never wake up," said Tatiana Cerna, 33, a Colombian who said she lived here legally with her Venezuelan husband and child. A few yards from other houses that had already been demolished, the family was working with hand tools under the moonlight to take apart their home, brick by brick, beam by beam.
"This is the kind of family that lives here," said Ms. Cerna, a seamstress whose husband is a taxi driver. "If they want to stop the smuggling, I think the national guard itself is involved. To come and knock all this down is not the solution."
Mr. Maduro's popularity is extremely low because of the country's economic struggles, and the country is approaching a crucial legislative election in December that could enable the opposition to win a majority for the first time in years.
While closing the border and evicting immigrants may stir some nationalist sentiment, it could backfire in a country where many naturalized Venezuelans vote and many other voters have Colombian relatives.
"We were Chavistas, but never again," said Wilson Velazco, 32, Ms. Cerna's brother-in-law, covered in dust from the demolition and using the Spanish term for the followers of Mr. Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chávez.
"Maduro is a clown, not to use a more offensive word," he said. "If Chávez were alive, he never would have permitted this."
The actions here have also brought strong condemnation from Colombian officials. On Tuesday, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia condemned what he called the mistreatment of deported Colombians.
"Raiding houses, removing the inhabitants by force, separating families, not allowing them to take with them their few belongings and marking the houses in order to demolish them later on, these are totally unacceptable actions that recall bitter episodes of humanity that must not be repeated," Mr. Santos said.
Each country has long pointed to the other in times of internal tension. Relations reached a low point when the conservative Mr. Uribe and the leftist Mr. Chávez were presidents and engaged in a heated ideological struggle.
Mr. Uribe accused Mr. Chávez of supporting guerrilla groups fighting the Colombian government. Tensions cooled after Mr. Santos became president in 2010 and Venezuela helped broker peace talks between Colombia and its largest rebel group.
But this week the acrimony returned, and on Thursday both countries announced that they had recalled their ambassadors.
"Venezuela's problems are made in Venezuela, not in Colombia," Mr. Santos said. Mr. Maduro, in turn, called Mr. Santos a liar and accused him of neglect. "Colombia has turned into a net exporter of poor people, fleeing misery, fleeing war," Mr. Maduro said on Thursday.
Mr. Maduro defended his border policy. "I'm not anti-Colombian," he said this week, adding that 5.6 million Colombians live in Venezuela, which has a total population of about 30 million. "We love the Colombian people."
He said that if the houses of any innocent people were destroyed the government would provide them with new apartments, although he offered no specifics about how the government would determine who was innocent or when they might get new housing.
He also rejected comparisons that his critics have made between him and Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate whose campaign is partly built on stirring sentiment against Mexican immigrants to the United States.
"I don't have Donald Trump's hairdo and much less his bank account and even less his ideology," Mr. Maduro said.
But Mr. Maduro and other government officials have increasingly lashed out at Colombian immigrants since last year, saying that through smuggling and black-marketeering they are responsible for the escalating shortages and high prices here.
Venezuela has fallen further into economic disarray since Mr. Maduro was elected in 2013 after the death of Mr. Chávez.
The government has stopped disclosing basic economic data, but most economists estimate that inflation is well over 100 percent annually and that the economy is in a deep recession, all made worse by plummeting prices for oil, the country's only major export. Many basic goods are in short supply and long lines at stores are common.
The opportunities for smugglers are enormous. Gasoline in Venezuela, which has the world's largest estimated oil reserves, is virtually free, costing about six cents a gallon at the main exchange rate of 6.3 bolívars to the dollar, and just a small fraction of that at black market exchange rates that currently run more than 700 bolívars to the dollar.
But in Colombia, gasoline fetches prices similar to or higher than those in the United States. Vast quantities of fuel are routinely smuggled across, generating enormous profits.
There is also a brisk trade in other goods that can be bought in Venezuela at low government-mandated prices and sold at much higher prices in Colombia, including staples like corn flour, powdered milk and rice, or materials like cement.
Across the border in the Colombian city of Cúcuta, hundreds of deportees were jammed into shelters, and there were long lines at gas stations caused by the sudden absence of contraband gasoline.
Some deportees sneaked back across the river at night, making several trips back and forth carrying their belongings. Some, including those leaving voluntarily, continued to carry belongings across in the early morning, with Colombian police officers wading into the gray water to help.
Patricia Helves, 19, sat on the riverbank nursing her 11-month-old baby. Ms. Helves, a Colombian married to a Venezuelan bus driver, said that she had walked across the river fearing that she would be deported if she stayed. Her husband carried the family belongings over.
"I'm not going back," she said.

Full text:   Not long ago, the United States was considered the tortoise of the world economy, at least in comparison to emerging powers like China and Brazil.
Lately, however, slow but steady seems to be winning the race. The American economy continues to chug along, while the onetime hares in Asia, South America and elsewhere are flagging.
The latest evidence of this shift came on Thursday, as the Commerce Department revised sharply upward its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to a healthy annual pace of 3.7 percent, from an initial estimate of 2.3 percent. At the same time, the Labor Department, in reporting another drop in weekly unemployment claims, provided further evidence that the job market was on the mend.
Stocks on Wall Street jumped by nearly 2.5 percent on Thursday, following a broader 4 percent rebound on Wednesday. Oil prices also rallied by almost 10 percent to settle above $40 a barrel after sinking to postrecession lows earlier in the week.
"The United States relies more than any other developed economy on demand within our own borders," said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. "While the focus in the past three weeks has been on international instability, this should position us to withstand the consequences of recent market volatility."
With markets remaining on edge, investors are already turning their attention to coming data about the economy's course, which will help determine whether the Federal Reserve will make its long-awaited move to raise interest rates in September or wait until later meetings.
Moreover, the impact of the recent plunge in stock prices on the broader economy will not be known for some time. Growth data for the current quarter will be released in late October. And the cutoff date for data for the Labor Department's report on hiring and unemployment in August, due next Friday, was earlier this month, before the stock market correction took hold.
Still, far from the anxious trading desks in New York, many American executives in the business trenches report that growth has not wavered in recent months, and has even picked up in some cases.
"We have returned to prerecession levels, and we expect volume for the entire year to be above where it was back then," said Jon Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach in California, the country's second-largest port. "There is tremendous consumer demand here, and we're seeing a real surge in volumes."
Much of what stevedores in Long Beach and other ports are hauling are consumer goods like electronics and apparel being imported into the United States, but the economic situation in the countries that produce those products is not nearly as cheerful.
Chinese output certainly is not shrinking, but the pace of expansion in what is now the world's second-largest economy is clearly cooling down. And that is sending shivers through emerging markets in South America and Asia as well as in more developed economies like Australia, as China's seemingly limitless appetite for iron ore, bauxite for aluminum and other commodities slows down.
Japan has faltered once again, and European economies have been in and out of recession in recent years.
While the German economy remains healthy and unemployment is relatively low there, Germany's dependence on exports makes it more vulnerable in the face of weakening demand from China and its neighbors on the Continent.
As a result, companies from other countries are showing greater interest in acquisitions in the United States to increase their exposure to the faster-growing North American market.
Last month, for example, the Würth Group of Germany acquired Northern Safety & Industrial, based in Utica, N.Y., a maker of protective equipment like safety glasses, gloves and hard hats for industrial customers.
"We are their entree into the safety market in the U.S.," said Neil Sexton, president of Northern Safety & Industrial. "I wouldn't call the overall business climate here high-flying, but it is very solid." Most of the company's $200 million in sales last year came from North America, and nearly all of its 500 employees are based in the United States.
"Würth has a big target on the U.S. for growth," Mr. Sexton added. "There are headwinds here from the energy sector, but there has been great strength in the chemical industry, and construction has also been a real bright spot."
Much of the jump in overall economic activity during the second quarter, from an initial estimate of a 2.3 percent growth rate, came from strong spending by businesses looking to expand factories, buildings and other physical structures.
Other tailwinds included a better trade picture, as net exports improved, and increased government spending, especially at the state and local levels.
Companies also added to their stockpiles of goods, which could weigh on growth in the months ahead. Real private inventories increased at a $121.1 billion pace in the second quarter, adding a little more than 0.2 percentage points to overall economic activity.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 6,000 last week, to 271,000 -- a level that suggests the labor market remains on a solid footing.
When the Labor Department reports the latest figures for hiring and the unemployment next Friday, Wall Street is looking for a gain of about 200,000 jobs and expects the unemployment rate to remain flat at 5.3 percent. Normally, that might be enough to nudge the Fed into action, but the plunge in overseas markets and the correction on Wall Street has blurred that timeline. Many experts now expect policy makers to wait until December.
The uncertainty over the central bank's course has prompted investors and economists to put each new data point under a microscope.
Yet for all the zigs and zags of economic data over the last couple of years, the underlying growth rate has not deviated much from about 2.5 to 3 percent annually, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a private research and forecasting firm.
"Historically, this is a modest growth rate," he said, explaining that the American economy now faces what he termed "speed limits," including the retirement of the baby boomers, slower population growth and weak productivity gains recently.
"Would we like to see faster growth? Of course," said Mr. Behravesh. "But we're growing twice as fast as Europe and three to four times as fast as Japan. For a mature economy, this is about as fast as we can grow, and it's something we can feel good about."

Full text:   Will China's stock crash trigger another global financial crisis? Probably not. Still, the big market swings of the past week have been a reminder that the next president may well have to deal with some of the same problems that faced George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Financial instability abides.
So this is a test: How would the men and women who would be president respond if crisis struck on their watch?
And the answer, on the Republican side at least, seems to be: with bluster and China-bashing. Nowhere is there a hint that any of the G.O.P. candidates understand the problem, or the steps that might be needed if the world economy hits another pothole.
Take, for example, Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin. Mr. Walker was supposed to be a formidable contender, part of his party's "deep bench" of current or former governors who know how to get things done. So what was his suggestion to President Obama? Why, cancel the planned visit to America by Xi Jinping, China's leader. That would fix things!
Then there's Donald Trump, who likes to take an occasional break from his anti-immigrant diatribes to complain that China is taking advantage of America's weak leadership. You might think that a swooning Chinese economy would fit awkwardly into that worldview. But no, he simply declared that U.S. markets seem troubled because Mr. Obama has let China "dictate the agenda." What does that mean? I haven't a clue -- but neither does he.
By the way, five years ago there were real reasons to complain about China's undervalued currency. But Chinese inflation and the rise of new competitors have largely eliminated that problem.
Back to the deep bench: Chris Christie, another governor who not long ago was touted as the next big thing, was more comprehensible. According to Mr. Christie, the reason U.S. markets were roiled by events in China was U.S. budget deficits, which he claims have put us in debt to the Chinese and hence made us vulnerable to their troubles. That almost rises to the level of a coherent economic story.
Did the U.S. market plunge because Chinese investors were cutting off credit? Well, no. If our debt to China were the problem, we would have seen U.S. interest rates spiking as China crashed. Instead, interest rates fell.
But there's a slight excuse for Mr. Christie's embrace of this particular fantasy: scare stories involving Chinese ownership of U.S. debt have been a Republican staple for years. They were, in particular, a favorite of Mitt Romney's campaign in 2012.
And you can see why. "Obama is endangering America by borrowing from China" is a perfect political line, playing into deficit fetishism, xenophobia and the perennial claim that Democrats don't stand up for America! America! America! It's also complete nonsense, but that doesn't seem to matter.
In fact, talking nonsense about economic crises is essentially a job requirement for anyone hoping to get the Republican presidential nomination.
To understand why, you need to go back to the politics of 2009, when the new Obama administration was trying to cope with the most terrifying crisis since the 1930s. The outgoing Bush administration had already engineered a bank bailout, but the Obama team reinforced this effort with a temporary program of deficit spending, while the Federal Reserve sought to bolster the economy by buying lots of assets.
And Republicans, across the board, predicted disaster. Deficit spending, they insisted, would cause soaring interest rates and bankruptcy; the Fed's efforts would "debase the dollar" and produce runaway inflation.
None of it happened. Interest rates stayed very low, as did inflation. But the G.O.P. never acknowledged, after six full years of being wrong about everything, that the bad things it predicted failed to take place, or showed any willingness to rethink the doctrines that led to those bad predictions. Instead, the party's leading figures kept talking, year after year, as if the disasters they had predicted were actually happening.
Now we've had a reminder that something like that last crisis could happen again -- which means that we might need a repeat of the policies that helped limit the damage last time. But no Republican dares suggest such a thing.
Instead, even the supposedly sensible candidates call for destructive policies. Thus John Kasich is being portrayed as a different kind of Republican because as governor he approved Medicaid expansion in Ohio, but his signature initiative is a call for a balanced-budget amendment, which would cripple policy in a crisis.
The point is that one side of the political aisle has been utterly determined to learn nothing from the economic experiences of recent years. If one of these candidates ends up in the hot seat the next time crisis strikes, we should be very, very afraid.

Abstract: Fed officials are taking a holistic view of what constitutes low unemployment, and other signs of slack in the labor market (such as low labor force participation and modest wage growth) may offset a low headline unemployment rate.

Full text:   There was a bit of good news buried in an update of the Congressional Budget Office's economic projections released Tuesday. It has increased its estimate of how many Americans are going to look for work in coming years, and how many of those people will find jobs.
There's a concept in economics called the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or Nairu, which is the lowest level of unemployment the economy can support without causing inflation to rise. The C.B.O. had estimated this at 5.3 percent, with expectations that it would fall to 5.2. Now, it is pegging it at 5.0 percent. It is also raising the projection of how many Americans will participate in the labor force, either by working or looking for work; that is, unemployment will be lower in the long run even as a greater share of the population seeks work.
These changes are pretty small, which is why the Congressional Budget Office did not significantly raise its forecasts of economic growth at the same time it made these bullish calls on employment. But the changes do point toward answers to two key questions about the labor market: Why aren't wages rising more briskly when unemployment has fallen so much, and has the job situation improved so much that the Federal Reserve should start raising interest rates?
In general, as unemployment falls and the number of job openings per job seeker falls, wages should rise as companies compete to hire a limited pool of available workers. But steadily falling unemployment in the United States has not turned into wage growth.
This sounds like a conundrum, but the C.B.O.'s new numbers are saying it isn't: Wages aren't rising because the labor market isn't as tight as we thought; there are more people available to re-enter the work force as more jobs become available, and the unemployment rate can fall more before it becomes truly hard for firms to find workers.
The Congressional Budget Office isn't alone: In recent years, the Federal Reserve has similarly shifted its view of what constitutes a low unemployment rate. Back in 2012, unemployment was 7.8 percent and the Federal Reserve announced the Evans Rule, under which it said it would maintain extremely low interest rates at least as long as unemployment was above 6.5 percent and inflation was below 2.5 percent.
Now, unemployment is 5.3 percent and interest rates are still near zero. Guidance from the Federal Reserve in recent months has explained why: Fed officials are taking a holistic view of what constitutes low unemployment, and other signs of slack in the labor market (such as low labor force participation and modest wage growth) may offset a low headline unemployment rate.
The key question, then, is why a rate hike is necessary, if 5.3 percent unemployment does not mean full employment and if there are no signs of inflation. It's possible the Federal Reserve will look at that question and say it's not.
The probability of a rate increase can be imputed from yields on Treasury bills of varying maturities: If market participants think the Federal Reserve will raise rates soon, the price they are willing to pay for Treasury bills should fall, but only for bills that will mature after the expected rate hike. Looking at the difference in those yields, the C.M.E. Group estimates just a 21 percent chance of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve's September meeting, and less than a 50 percent chance of a rate hike by December.
If the Congressional Budget Office is right, the Fed has breathing room to wait.

Abstract: Turmoil in global financial markets has reduced the chances the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate in September, a senior Fed policy maker said on Wednesday, but the possibility of a rate increase remains on the table, provided markets regain balance and economic problems in other countries do not disrupt the slow but steady performance of the domestic economy.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Turmoil in global financial markets has reduced the chances the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate in September, a senior Fed policy maker said on Wednesday, but the possibility of a rate increase remains on the table, provided markets regain balance and economic problems in other countries do not disrupt the slow but steady performance of the domestic economy.
William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said at a news conference in New York that the case for raising interest rates had become "less compelling" in recent weeks.
It was the first public indication that Fed officials had been rattled by recent market turbulence, which had already led many investors to conclude the Fed would wait a little longer before raising rates.
"From my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September F.O.M.C. meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago," Mr. Dudley said, referring to the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.
Even if the Fed hesitates, Mr. Dudley said he would hope to move later this year, at a subsequent meeting in October or December. He has emphasized previously that he does not want the timing of a move to come as a surprise for investors.
"Normalization could become more compelling by the time of the meeting as we get additional information on how the U.S. economy is performing and more information on international and financial market developments, all of which are important in shaping the U.S. economic outlook," Mr. Dudley said.
For all the hedging in Mr. Dudley's comments, some analysts saw them as confirmation the Fed is unlikely to move at its meeting next month, scheduled for Sept. 16 and 17. Market-based measures of investor expectations, which have fallen alongside the stock market, already put the odds of a September rate increase at just 24 percent Wednesday.
"The odds of a September rate hike have just dropped further, and we have to push our forecast for the first move to December," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, told clients Wednesday afternoon. "A massive payroll number next week, coupled with strength in August auto sales, retail sales and the ISM surveys, could yet persuade the Fed to move, but markets would have to rebound significantly too, and this all seems a bit too much to ask."
But Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said in an email on Wednesday that he still saw a real chance for a September increase, provided markets behaved and the domestic economy continued to show strength.
"I do think he left the door open to September just a tad, which makes sense given that markets and payrolls can surprise in a bunch of ways," Mr. Feroli said.
The Fed is marching toward higher rates because officials are concerned the economy will eventually overdose on easy money. While recovery from the recession remains incomplete, monetary policy works slowly, and the Fed is wary of the risk that the economy will overheat in coming years. The unemployment rate stood at 5.3 percent in July, and policy makers at the central bank are hesitant to push it much below 5 percent.
The government reported Wednesday that orders for durable goods rose 2 percent in July, the latest in a string of positive data. Analysts expect the government on Thursday to raise its estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product.
But an economic slowdown in China, and that government's troubled response, have buffeted global financial markets in recent weeks, driving down equity prices, contributing to a new round of declines in the prices of oil and other commodities, and sending a rush of money into safe assets like United States Treasury securities.
Some developments, like lower oil prices, will benefit American consumers. Others, like the decline of stock prices, are erasing wealth that might have been spent.
The question confronting Fed officials is whether they are sufficiently confident about the resilience of domestic growth to raise interest rates.
Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta -- and like Mr. Dudley, one of 10 Fed officials with votes on monetary policy this year -- said on Monday that he still expected the Fed to raise interest rates this year.
Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, is scheduled to speak Saturday at an annual conference for monetary policy makers in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Other Fed officials also plan to attend the gathering, where the impact of recent market developments will certainly be a major topic of discussion.
Even as Mr. Dudley suggested a September rate increase was less likely, he cautioned on Wednesday against assuming the Fed would significantly alter its plans. He dismissed the possibility of a new round of stimulus.
"It's important not to overreact to short-term market developments because it's unclear whether this will just be a temporary adjustment or something more persistent that will have implications for the U.S. growth and inflation outlook," Mr. Dudley said.
But the Fed might decide to wait a little longer. Markets have not found their balance, and Mr. Dudley noted that it was too soon to gauge the impact of the market downturn in broader indicators. The government, for example, will release next week a report on August job growth based on a survey conducted earlier in the month.
William Lee, the head of North American economics at Citigroup, described Mr. Dudley's remarks as careful and balanced. If the market downturn continues, and broadens, Mr. Lee said he would expect the Fed to delay raising rates. If markets find their balance, he said he still expected the Fed to move in September.
Mr. Lee noted Fed officials anticipated the decline of stocks, if not the timing. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, described valuations in May as "quite high."
"It's a little more violent than people would like," Mr. Lee said of the market correction. "It's bigger than people would like. But is it surprising? It shouldn't be."
More important, he said, was the continued strength of domestic economic data.
But Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon and a close Fed watcher, said that the Fed, in effect, was already tightening domestic financial conditions by standing still while central banks in other countries, including China, were racing to stimulate their economies. Raising domestic interest rates under those conditions, he said, would be "too much, too fast."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A gauge of business investment plans in July posted its largest increase in just over a year, underscoring the durability of the economic recovery in the United States despite a slowing global economy.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans also called core capital goods orders, increased 2.2 percent last month, the biggest rise since June 2014.
A separate report on Wednesday said that applications for home mortgages in the United States edged up last week as interest rates declined.
"The economy had a tailwind heading into the recent market rout. That tailwind will help to carry us through the turbulent waters that lie ahead," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
July's increase in core capital goods orders was on top of an upwardly revised 1.4 percent increase in June and brought two straight months of hefty gains. Economists had forecast that these core capital goods would rise only 0.4 percent in July, after a previously reported 0.9 percent increase in June.
The report added to employment, industrial production, retail sales, housing and consumer spending data in highlighting the United States economy's resilience.
The string of upbeat reports suggests the Federal Reserve could still raise interest rates this year despite a global market sell-off, caused by worries over China's slowing economy, and policy makers' concerns about low inflation.
William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Wednesday that the prospect of a September rate increase "seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago." Stocks on Wall Street rallied.
And the surge in core capital goods orders in July bodes well for economic growth prospects in the third quarter.
"It points to a sharp acceleration in the pace of business capital investment activity in the third quarter and provides some upside risks to our expectation for growth," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, rose 0.6 percent last month. According to revised numbers, the June increase was 0.9 percent, compared with a previously reported 0.3 percent rise. The revision suggests that second-quarter gross domestic product could be increased when the government publishes its revised estimate on Thursday.
June data on business inventories and construction spending have already suggested that second-quarter growth could be revised to as high as a 3.3 percent annualized pace from the 2.3 percent rate reported last month.
A 4.7 percent increase in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods -- items like toasters and aircraft that are meant to last three years or more -- which rose 2 percent in July.
Transportation was lifted by a 4 percent rise in orders for automobiles and parts, as automakers kept most assembly lines running during the summer instead of shutting them down for retooling.
That increase offset a 6 percent decline in aircraft orders. Boeing reported on its website that it had received 101 orders last month, down from 161 in June.
The upbeat durable goods report is good news for manufacturing, which has been hobbled by a strong dollar, weak global demand and deep spending cuts in the energy industry after a plunge in crude oil prices.
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.2 percent in July, the largest gain since November, after being flat in June. Durable goods inventories were unchanged after rising 0.4 percent in June.
In the mortgage report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose0.2 percent in the week ended Aug. 21.
The association's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 1 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 1.7 percent.
The refinance share of total mortgage activity fell to 55.3 percent of applications from 55.5 percent the week before.
Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.08 percent in the week, compared with 4.11 percent the previous week.
The survey covers over 75 percent of American retail residential mortgage applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
