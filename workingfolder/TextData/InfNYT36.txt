Full text: It was not just two mismanaged wars and trillions of dollars in misconceived and poorly supervised weapons contracts that drove Pentagon spending to unsustainable levels over the past decade -- about $700 billion for last year alone. Military pay, benefit and retirement costs rose by more than 50 percent over the same decade (accounting for inflation). Leaving aside Afghanistan and Iraq, those costs now account for nearly $1 out of every $3 the Pentagon spends.
Much of that is necessary to recruit and retain a high-quality, all-volunteer military. The men and women who risk their lives to keep us secure deserve decent pay while they serve and ample benefits once they retire. But current military pay, pension systems and retiree health care benefits are unsustainable and ripe for reform.
President Obama has proposed two changes that would save $27 billion over 10 years: increasing co-payments for some prescription drugs for retirees and dependents of active-duty soldiers and charging a modest fee for policies supplementing Medicare coverage for retirees. That would still leave insurees paying substantially less than most other Americans.
Working-age military retirees also pay too little for basic family coverage. The current annual premium of $460 has not been increased since 1995. The Pentagon hopes to raise that to $520 for new enrollees once Congress approves financing bills for the new fiscal year that starts on Saturday. That is still barely a tenth of what federal civilian workers pay for comparable insurance.
Another $45 billion to $50 billion could be saved by adjusting the formula for pay increases to take account of special allowances and benefits worth about $5,000 a year.
The retirement system is both unfair and increasingly expensive. Most veterans, including many who have served multiple combat tours, will never qualify for even a partial military pension or retiree health benefits. These are only available to those who have served at least 20 years. Those who do qualify can start collecting their pensions as soon as they leave service, even if they are still in their late 30s, making for huge long-term costs.
Mr. Obama called for a commission to study possible reforms. But the change the Pentagon reportedly has in mind, phasing in a 401(k)-type plan for future retirees, is the wrong way to go. Military pensions should not be held hostage to stock market gyrations. Partial pensions should be made available to those serving less than 20 years. Payments should begin at normal retirement age.
The Pentagon needs to contribute at least $400 billion in 10-year budget savings if the Congressional deficit panel does reach an agreement by December and as much as $900 billion if it does not.
To find those savings, the Pentagon must also sharply prune the tens of billions it spends every year on building new versions of cold war weapons systems ill suited to America's 21st-century military needs: aircraft carriers, nuclear attack submarines, stealth destroyers and manned aerial combat fighters. The United States already has a comfortable margin of dominance in all these areas. The Pentagon's ambitions expanded without limit over the Bush era, and Congress eagerly wrote the checks. The country cannot afford to continue this way, and national security doesn't require it.
The White House and Congress must find the courage to proceed. Reforms of pay, benefits and pensions must be phased in fairly and commitments already made must be honored. But they, too, cannot be deferred any longer.

Full text: LONDON -- With the leaders of both parties in the governing coalition pledged to uphold their pact until a new election in 2015, Britain, at least on the face of it, has the basis for political stability as it wrestles with the financial crisis roiling Europe and the apparent drift of Britain's own economy toward stagnation.
But as it approaches the 18th-month mark, Britain's first peacetime coalition government in nearly 70 years has come to resemble a leaky boat in heaving seas. A groundswell of unease in both parties, the Conservatives under Prime Minister David Cameron and the Liberal Democrats under the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has heightened the underlying political tensions and raised new doubts about how long the pact will last.
If most political analysts believe that the coalition will endure, their judgment rests less on inherent strength in the partnership than in the reluctance of all three major parties, including Labour, which governed for 13 years until the May 2010 election, to agree to an early election. Voters, too, seem opposed to an early election, especially at a time of deepening economic uncertainty.
Each fall, their annual conferences provide a showcase for the parties. This week, with Labour meeting in Liverpool, marks the midpoint; the Liberal Democrats met last week in Birmingham and the Conservatives gather next week in Manchester. Exhaustive television coverage attracts mainly political wonks, but the conferences can present hazards for the party leaders, especially when powerful blocs are close to open revolt, or at least in vigorous dissent.
That is the case for all three parties this year, with the touchstones being the economy and the government's harsh program of public spending cuts, averaging close to 20 percent across the board over the government's projected four-year span. Although the cuts were announced last fall, they began to bite more deeply this summer.
In the past week, the economic news has gotten worse, emboldening the left wings of Labour and the Liberal Democrats to argue that the government's bid to cut record levels of government borrowing -- said by Mr. Cameron to be worse, proportionally, than in Greece, Italy and Spain -- has been a case of "too far, too fast." Many of these critics say the government should ease the cuts and follow the Obama administration, which advocates a combination of cuts and new stimulus spending to try to reduce unemployment.
The latest figures -- more than 2.5 million people in a British work force of 30 million out of work; inflation rising to 4.5 percent, the highest in years; and limp quarterly growth, at little more than 1 percent annually -- have led some experts to predict an extended period of stagflation. With the economy weakening, monthly government borrowing, which had been falling, rose sharply again in August. This suggests that the austerity plan is, at least for now, failing either to stimulate the economy or cut the deficit, as the government had promised.
But Mr. Cameron, in New York last week for the United Nations General Assembly, said the government would hold course. "You have got to deal with the debts," he told ABC News. It was, he said, "vitally important to prove to the world that we can pay our way." That has been the message, too, from Mr. Clegg, who told the Liberal Democrats' conference that the historic burden of debt bequeathed by the Labour government had left Britain "teetering on the edge of an economic precipice."
"Burying your head in the sand, that's not liberal," he said. "Saddling our children with the nation's debt, that's not fair."
Mr. Clegg emerged from the conference with what amounted to a reluctant assent from many of the delegates to remain in the coalition. But the coalition endured a barrage of hostility.
The party's president, Tim Farron, made a speech in which he described "divorce" from the Conservatives after four years as inevitable. Taunting the Conservatives with words like "wickedness," "reactionary Tory drivel" and "witless knee-jerk populism," he added: "Being in coalition with the Tories has tainted us. Our identity is blurred. Many who support us are confused."
The barrage extended to Liberal Democrat ministers. Chris Huhne, the energy minister, compared Conservative backbenchers restless with the concessions Mr. Cameron has made to the Liberal Democrats to hold the coalition together to conservative Republicans in the United States. "We need no Tea Party tendency in Britain," he said.
Recent opinion polls have shown that the Liberal Democrats have plunged in public support to as little as 11 percent, and that an early election could lead to the loss of many of the 59 seats they currently hold in the 650-seat House of Commons. Across a wide range of polls, the Conservatives have trailed Labour, though the Conservatives have narrowly outpolled Labour in polls taken among respondents who say they plan to vote.
Many commentators in Britain say that the signs point to a new era of coalition politics, and that the disillusionment for the coalition among Liberal Democrats makes an alliance with Labour beyond the next election more likely than a renewed deal with the Conservatives. That prospect appeared to be one of the few items that stirred much enthusiasm among delegates at the Birmingham conference, where Mr. Clegg, noting the "docility" in the conference hall, compared the gathering at one point to a party conference in North Korea.
But Labour, too, has problems. Unreconciled differences flourish between the centrist wing of the party that dominated for 10 years under Prime Minister Tony Blair, and the party's left-wing, labor union base, which has been newly assertive since the election defeat last year. Senior Labour figures, including the new leader, Ed Miliband, have said that to regain power the party must first regain the trust among voters by owning up to the mistakes it made in economic management including allowing the annual deficit to balloon.
But left-wing stalwarts, including the party's chief economic spokesman, Ed Balls, have been slow to acknowledge past errors. Though Mr. Balls did say on Monday that he regretted some of the Labour government's decisions, like instituting a tax on low earners and a slight rise in state pensions, much of the focus in Liverpool is expected to be on a new emphasis on candor about past mistakes, along with a renewed effort to boost Mr. Miliband's lagging popularity, which has trailed far behind Mr. Cameron's in many polls.
Even Mr. Balls has joined in. "We've got to rebuild our credibility," he told The Sunday Telegraph in an interview. "And that's hard."

Is Junk Food Really Cheaper

Abstract: [...] it isn't cheaper to eat highly processed food: a typical order for a family of four -- for example, two Big Macs, a cheeseburger, six chicken McNuggets, two medium and two small fries, and two medium and two small sodas -- costs, at the McDonald's a hundred steps from where I write, about $28.

Full text: THE "fact" that junk food is cheaper than real food has become a reflexive part of how we explain why so many Americans are overweight, particularly those with lower incomes. I frequently read confident statements like, "when a bag of chips is cheaper than a head of broccoli ..." or "it's more affordable to feed a family of four at McDonald's than to cook a healthy meal for them at home."
This is just plain wrong. In fact it isn't cheaper to eat highly processed food: a typical order for a family of four -- for example, two Big Macs, a cheeseburger, six chicken McNuggets, two medium and two small fries, and two medium and two small sodas -- costs, at the McDonald's a hundred steps from where I write, about $28. (Judicious ordering of "Happy Meals" can reduce that to about $23 -- and you get a few apple slices in addition to the fries!)
In general, despite extensive government subsidies, hyperprocessed food remains more expensive than food cooked at home. You can serve a roasted chicken with vegetables along with a simple salad and milk for about $14, and feed four or even six people. If that's too much money, substitute a meal of rice and canned beans with bacon, green peppers and onions; it's easily enough for four people and costs about $9. (Omitting the bacon, using dried beans, which are also lower in sodium, or substituting carrots for the peppers reduces the price further, of course.)
Another argument runs that junk food is cheaper when measured by the calorie, and that this makes fast food essential for the poor because they need cheap calories. But given that half of the people in this country (and a higher percentage of poor people) consume too many calories rather than too few, measuring food's value by the calorie makes as much sense as measuring a drink's value by its alcohol content. (Why not drink 95 percent neutral grain spirit, the cheapest way to get drunk?)
Besides, that argument, even if we all needed to gain weight, is not always true. A meal of real food cooked at home can easily contain more calories, most of them of the "healthy" variety. (Olive oil accounts for many of the calories in the roast chicken meal, for example.)In comparing prices of real food and junk food, I used supermarket ingredients, not the pricier organic or local food that many people would consider ideal. But food choices are not black and white; the alternative to fast food is not necessarily organic food, any more than the alternative to soda is Bordeaux.
The alternative to soda is water, and the alternative to junk food is not grass-fed beef and greens from a trendy farmers' market, but anything other than junk food: rice, grains, pasta, beans, fresh vegetables, canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, bread, peanut butter, a thousand other things cooked at home -- in almost every case a far superior alternative.
"Anything that you do that's not fast food is terrific; cooking once a week is far better than not cooking at all," says Marion Nestle, professor of food studies at New York University and author of "What to Eat." "It's the same argument as exercise: more is better than less and some is a lot better than none."
THE fact is that most people can afford real food. Even the nearly 50 million Americans who are enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) receive about $5 per person per day, which is far from ideal but enough to survive. So we have to assume that money alone doesn't guide decisions about what to eat. There are, of course, the so-called food deserts, places where it's hard to find food: the Department of Agriculture says that more than two million Americans in low-income rural areas live 10 miles or more from a supermarket, and more than five million households without access to cars live more than a half mile from a supermarket.
Still, 93 percent of those with limited access to supermarkets do have access to vehicles, though it takes them 20 more minutes to travel to the store than the national average. And after a long day of work at one or even two jobs, 20 extra minutes -- plus cooking time -- must seem like an eternity.
Taking the long route to putting food on the table may not be easy, but for almost all Americans it remains a choice, and if you can drive to McDonald's you can drive to Safeway. It's cooking that's the real challenge. (The real challenge is not "I'm too busy to cook." In 2010 the average American, regardless of weekly earnings, watched no less than an hour and a half of television per day. The time is there.)
The core problem is that cooking is defined as work, and fast food is both a pleasure and a crutch. "People really are stressed out with all that they have to do, and they don't want to cook," says Julie Guthman, associate professor of community studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and author of the forthcoming "Weighing In: Obesity, Food Justice and the Limits of Capitalism." "Their reaction is, 'Let me enjoy what I want to eat, and stop telling me what to do.' And it's one of the few things that less well-off people have: they don't have to cook."
It's not just about choice, however, and rational arguments go only so far, because money and access and time and skill are not the only considerations. The ubiquity, convenience and habit-forming appeal of hyperprocessed foods have largely drowned out the alternatives: there are five fast-food restaurants for every supermarket in the United States; in recent decades the adjusted for inflation price of fresh produce has increased by 40 percent while the price of soda and processed food has decreased by as much as 30 percent; and nearly inconceivable resources go into encouraging consumption in restaurants: fast-food companies spent $4.2 billion on marketing in 2009.
Furthermore, the engineering behind hyperprocessed food makes it virtually addictive. A 2009 study by the Scripps Research Institute indicates that overconsumption of fast food "triggers addiction-like neuroaddictive responses" in the brain, making it harder to trigger the release of dopamine. In other words the more fast food we eat, the more we need to give us pleasure; thus the report suggests that the same mechanisms underlie drug addiction and obesity.
This addiction to processed food is the result of decades of vision and hard work by the industry. For 50 years, says David A. Kessler, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and author of "The End of Overeating," companies strove to create food that was "energy-dense, highly stimulating, and went down easy. They put it on every street corner and made it mobile, and they made it socially acceptable to eat anytime and anyplace. They created a food carnival, and that's where we live. And if you're used to self-stimulation every 15 minutes, well, you can't run into the kitchen to satisfy that urge."
Real cultural changes are needed to turn this around. Somehow, no-nonsense cooking and eating -- roasting a chicken, making a grilled cheese sandwich, scrambling an egg, tossing a salad -- must become popular again, and valued not just by hipsters in Brooklyn or locavores in Berkeley. The smart campaign is not to get McDonald's to serve better food but to get people to see cooking as a joy rather than a burden, or at least as part of a normal life.
As with any addictive behavior, this one is most easily countered by educating children about the better way. Children, after all, are born without bad habits. And yet it's adults who must begin to tear down the food carnival.
The question is how? Efforts are everywhere. The People's Grocery in Oakland secures affordable groceries for low-income people. Zoning laws in Los Angeles restrict the number of fast-food restaurants in high-obesity neighborhoods. There's the Healthy Food Financing Initiative, a successful Pennsylvania program to build fresh food outlets in underserved areas, now being expanded nationally. FoodCorps and Cooking Matters teach young people how to farm and cook.
As Malik Yakini, executive director of the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network, says, "We've seen minor successes, but the food movement is still at the infant stage, and we need a massive social shift to convince people to consider healthier options."
HOW do you change a culture? The answers, not surprisingly, are complex. "Once I look at what I'm eating," says Dr. Kessler, "and realize it's not food, and I ask 'what am I doing here?' that's the start. It's not about whether I think it's good for me, it's about changing how I feel. And we change how people feel by changing the environment."
Obviously, in an atmosphere where any regulation is immediately labeled "nanny statism," changing "the environment" is difficult. But we've done this before, with tobacco. The 1998 tobacco settlement limited cigarette marketing and forced manufacturers to finance anti-smoking campaigns -- a negotiated change that led to an environmental one that in turn led to a cultural one, after which kids said to their parents, "I wish you didn't smoke." Smoking had to be converted from a cool habit into one practiced by pariahs.
A similar victory in the food world is symbolized by the stories parents tell me of their kids booing as they drive by McDonald's.
To make changes like this more widespread we need action both cultural and political. The cultural lies in celebrating real food; raising our children in homes that don't program them for fast-produced, eaten-on-the-run, high-calorie, low-nutrition junk; giving them the gift of appreciating the pleasures of nourishing one another and enjoying that nourishment together.
Political action would mean agitating to limit the marketing of junk; forcing its makers to pay the true costs of production; recognizing that advertising for fast food is not the exercise of free speech but behavior manipulation of addictive substances; and making certain that real food is affordable and available to everyone. The political challenge is the more difficult one, but it cannot be ignored.
What's easier is to cook at every opportunity, to demonstrate to family and neighbors that the real way is the better way. And even the more fun way: kind of like a carnival.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Michael Kazin is a professor of history at Georgetown, a co-editor of Dissent and the author of "American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation."
SOMETIMES, attention should be paid to the absence of news. America's economic miseries continue, with unemployment still high and home sales stagnant or dropping. The gap between the wealthiest Americans and their fellow citizens is wider than it has been since the 1920s.
And yet, except for the demonstrations and energetic recall campaigns that roiled Wisconsin this year, unionists and other stern critics of corporate power and government cutbacks have failed to organize a serious movement against the people and policies that bungled the United States into recession.
Instead, the Tea Party rebellion -- led by veteran conservative activists and bankrolled by billionaires -- has compelled politicians from both parties to slash federal spending and defeat proposals to tax the rich and hold financiers accountable for their misdeeds. Partly as a consequence, Barack Obama's tenure is starting to look less like the second coming of F.D.R. and more like a re-run of Jimmy Carter -- although last week the president did sound a bit Rooseveltian when he proposed that millionaires should "pay their fair share in taxes, or we're going to have to ask seniors to pay more for Medicare."
How do we account for the relative silence of the left? Perhaps what really matters about a movement's strength is the years of building that came before it. In the 1930s, the growth of unions and the popularity of demands to share the wealth and establish "industrial democracy" were not simply responses to the economic debacle. In fact, unions bloomed only in the middle of the decade, when a modest recovery was under way. The liberal triumph of the 1930s was in fact rooted in decades of eloquent oratory and patient organizing by a variety of reformers and radicals against the evils of "monopoly" and "big money."
Similarly, the current populist right originated among the articulate spokespeople and well-funded institutions that emerged in the 1970s, long before the current crisis began. The two movements would have disagreed about nearly everything, but each had aggressive proponents who, backed up by powerful social forces, established their views as the conventional wisdom of an era.
THE seeds of the 1930s left were planted back in the Gilded Age by figures like the journalist Henry George. In 1886, George, the author of a best-selling book that condemned land speculation, ran for mayor of New York City as the nominee of the new Union Labor Party. He attracted a huge following with speeches indicting the officeholders of the Tammany Hall machine for engorging themselves on bribes and special privileges while "we have hordes of citizens living in want and in vice born of want, existing under conditions that would appall a heathen."
George also brought his audiences a message of hope: "We are building a movement for the abolition of industrial slavery, and what we do on this side of the water will send its impulse across the land and over the sea, and give courage to all men to think and act." Running against candidates from both major parties and the opposition of nearly every local employer and church, George would probably have been elected, if the 28-year-old Theodore Roosevelt, the Republican who finished third, had not split the anti-Tammany vote.
Despite George's defeat, the pro-labor, anti-corporate movement that coalesced around him and others kept growing. As the turn of the century neared, wage earners mounted huge strikes for union recognition on the nation's railroads and inside its coal mines and textile mills. In the 1890s, a mostly rural insurgency spawned the People's Party, also known as the Populists, which quickly won control of several states and elected 22 congressmen. The party soon expired, but not before the Democrats, under William Jennings Bryan, had adopted important parts of its platform -- the progressive income tax, a flexible currency and support for labor organizing.
During the early 20th century, a broader progressive coalition, including immigrant workers, middle-class urban reformers, muckraking journalists and Social Gospelers established a new common sense about the need for a government that would rein in corporate power and establish a limited welfare state. The unbridled free market and the ethic of individualism, they argued, had left too many Americans at the mercy of what Theodore Roosevelt called "malefactors of great wealth." As Jane Addams put it, "the good we secure for ourselves is precarious and uncertain, is floating in mid-air, until it is secured for all of us and incorporated into our common life."
Amid the boom years of the 1920s, conservatives rebutted this wisdom and won control of the federal government. "The chief business of the American people is business," intoned President Calvin Coolidge. But their triumph was brief, both ideologically and electorally. When Franklin D. Roosevelt swept into the White House in 1932, most Americans were already primed to accept the economic and moral argument progressives had been making since the heyday of Henry George.
Will Rogers, the popular humorist and a loyal Democrat, put it in comfortably agrarian terms, "All the feed is going into one manger and the stock on the other side of the stall ain't getting a thing. We got it, but we don't know how to split it up." The unionists of the Congress of Industrial Organizations echoed his argument, as did soak-the-rich demagogues like Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin. The architects of Social Security, the minimum wage and other landmark New Deal policies did so as well.
After years of preparation, welfare-state liberalism had finally become a mainstream faith. In 1939, John L. Lewis, the pugnacious labor leader, declared, "The millions of organized workers banded together in the C.I.O. are the main driving force of the progressive movement of workers, farmers, professional and small business people and of all other liberal elements in the community." With such forces on his side, the politically adept F.D.R. became a great president.
But the meaning of liberalism gradually changed. The quarter century of growth and low unemployment that followed World War II understandably muted appeals for class justice on the left. Liberals focused on rights for minority groups and women more than addressing continuing inequalities of wealth. Meanwhile, conservatives began to build their own movement based on a loathing of "creeping socialism" and a growing perception that the federal government was oblivious or hostile to the interests and values of middle-class whites.
IN the late 1970s, the grass-roots right was personified by a feisty, cigar-chomping businessman-activist named Howard Jarvis. Having toiled for conservative causes since Herbert Hoover's campaign in 1932, Jarvis had run for office on several occasions in the past, but, like Henry George, he had never been elected. Blocked at the ballot box, he became an anti-tax organizer, working on the belief that the best way to fight big government was "not to give them the money in the first place."
In 1978 he spearheaded the Proposition 13 campaign in California to roll back property taxes and make it exceedingly hard to raise them again. That fall, Proposition 13 won almost two-thirds of the vote, and conservatives have been vigorously echoing its anti-tax argument ever since. Just as the left was once able to pin the nation's troubles on heartless big businessmen, the right honed a straightforward critique of a big government that took Americans' money and gave them little or nothing useful in return.
One reason for the growth of the right was that most of those in charge of the government from the mid-1960s through the 2000s -- whether Democrats or Republicans -- failed to carry out their biggest promises. Lyndon Johnson failed to defeat the Viet Cong or abolish poverty; Jimmy Carter was unable to tame inflation or free the hostages in Iran; George W. Bush neither accomplished his mission in Iraq nor controlled the deficit.
Like the left in the early 20th century, conservatives built an impressive set of institutions to develop and disseminate their ideas. Their think tanks, legal societies, lobbyists, talk radio and best-selling manifestos have trained, educated and financed two generations of writers and organizers. Conservative Christian colleges, both Protestant and Catholic, provide students with a more coherent worldview than do the more prestigious schools led by liberals. More recently, conservatives marshaled media outlets like Fox News and the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal to their cause.
The Tea Party is thus just the latest version of a movement that has been evolving for over half a century, longer than any comparable effort on the liberal or radical left. Conservatives have rarely celebrated a landslide win on the scale of Proposition 13, but their argument about the evils of big government has, by and large, carried the day. President Obama's inability to solve the nation's economic woes has only reinforced the right's ideological advantage.
If activists on the left want to alter this reality, they will have to figure out how to redefine the old ideal of economic justice for the age of the Internet and relentless geographic mobility. During the last election, many hoped that the organizing around Barack Obama's presidential campaign would do just that. Yet, since taking office, Mr. Obama has only rarely made an effort to move the public conversation in that direction.
Instead, the left must realize that when progressives achieved success in the past, whether at organizing unions or fighting for equal rights, they seldom bet their future on politicians. They fashioned their own institutions -- unions, women's groups, community and immigrant centers and a witty, anti-authoritarian press -- in which they spoke up for themselves and for the interests of wage-earning Americans.
Today, such institutions are either absent or reeling. With unions embattled and on the decline, working people of all races lack a sturdy vehicle to articulate and fight for the vision of a more egalitarian society. Liberal universities, Web sites and non-governmental organizations cater mostly to a professional middle class and are more skillful at promoting social causes like legalizing same-sex marriage and protecting the environment than demanding millions of new jobs that pay a living wage.
A reconnection with ordinary Americans is vital not just to defeating conservatives in 2012 and in elections to come. Without it, the left will remain unable to state clearly and passionately what a better country would look like and what it will take to get there. To paraphrase the labor martyr Joe Hill, the left should stop mourning its recent past and start organizing to change the future.
Correction: October 2, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A historical photograph on Sept. 25, with an opinion essay about the absence of a vibrant left-wing movement in the United States, was published in mirror image. The picture, of a Communist rally in Union Square in Manhattan on May 1, 1934, was taken by The Associated Press. The park pavilion should have been on the right, and the row of buildings should have been on the left. In the distance is the former Tammany Hall building, on East 17th Street near the northeast corner of Union Square Park.
The photograph also appeared in mirror image in The Times on May 2, 1934. After a writer for The Times pointed out the recent error, editors retrieved the photograph, which was distributed by The A.P., from The Times's archives; it also was printed in mirror image. An editor at The A.P. checked its copy of the original photograph and found that it too was printed in mirror image.
It is not known why the original prints were made in mirror image. But one possibility is that editors at The A.P. did so in order to make several signs, carried by members of the crowd in the foreground, legible to readers. (The letters evidently bled through the signs, which appear to have been made of cloth, and would have appeared backward if the image had been printed without alteration.) At the time, retouching and altering images for clarity's sake were not uncommon practices; The A.P. and The Times no longer permit such changes to photographic images.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Is China's economy in trouble, too?
As the American economy appears to teeter on the edge of another recession, Europe struggles with a financial crisis and emerging markets like Brazil and India show new weaknesses, China may appear to be in better shape than most countries, economists say. But "better" is relative.
On the surface, economists at the International Monetary Fund and most banks are still estimating China's growth rate to be over 9 percent this year. China continues to run very large trade surpluses. New construction starts have soared with a government campaign to provide more affordable housing.
And yet, the country's huge manufacturing sector is starting to slow and orders are weakening, especially for exports. The real estate bubble is starting to spring leaks, even as inflation remains stubbornly high for consumers -- despite a series of interest rate increases and ever-tighter limits on bank lending.
Because China's mighty growth engine has been one of the few drivers of the global economy since the financial crisis of 2008, signs of deceleration could add to worries about the global outlook.
A survey of Chinese purchasing managers, just completed by HSBC and Markit Economics, shows a third consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector. The release of the survey results on Thursday contributed to a global slide in stock markets that day.
Meanwhile, huge loans that Chinese banks have made to state-owned enterprises and local governments over the last three years could cause trouble if the economy does slow.
What's more, there are further signs of trade hostilities from Washington, where the impulse is to blame China's cheap exports, at least partly, for America's continued high unemployment.
On Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators announced that they would pursue legislation requiring the Obama administration to confront China more directly on currency policy. They want the White House to push harder for China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate.
If China does allow its currency to rise more quickly and if its trade surplus narrows, that could help economies elsewhere. But too much of a slowdown in China could simply add to the world's financial gloom.
Chinese exporters are particularly worried.
Nicole Huang, the sales manager at the Dongguan Lianyi Sport Goods Company, a maker of beer coolers, diving suits and other products in the industrial hub city of Dongguan, said the number of orders had dropped 5 percent so far this year, and the average size of each order had also begun to shrink.
And instead of the labor shortages that plagued many manufacturers last year as workers sought better jobs elsewhere, more people now seem willing to accept assembly-line tedium. Short term, that could help exporters. But it could be an early sign of looming unemployment problems.
"At least it is easier now for us to hire workers who come into our factory looking for work, after seeing our job notices posted outside," Mr. Huang said. "Before, no one would respond to these notices."
The sentiments of investors and economists inside and outside China have taken a bearish turn in recent weeks. As global stock markets have tumbled, the Shanghai A-share stock market has fallen 14.7 percent since July 15. That includes a further decline of 0.4 percent on Friday.
The most worried economists are those who follow China's manic monetary policy. The central bank oversaw a huge stimulus effort in 2009 and 2010 in response to the global economic slowdown, rapidly expanding its issuance of money and then encouraging banks to lend and relend it. Broadly measured, the money supply surged 53 percent in two years.
The extra cash has sent inflation at the consumer level surging to more than 6 percent even by official measures, which tend to understate true inflation for methodological reasons.
With inflation now running at more than twice the regulated interest rate paid by banks for deposits, millions of Chinese have been betting their savings on real estate. That frenzy had been sending property prices through the roof, at least until the last couple of months.
But this year, to fight inflation, the Chinese financial authorities have veered in the other direction, setting strict administrative quotas on new loans. And they have ordered the mostly state-owned banks to park more than a fifth of their assets at the central bank, which further limits the banks' ability to lend -- and businesses' ability to borrow.
Orchid Chen, the sales director of the Fujian Yuandong Electric Motor Group, which makes motors in Fu'an in southeastern China's Fujian Province, said that banks were strictly following Beijing's instructions.
"The smaller enterprises have found it difficult to secure any type of lending from banks," she said.
"We are a good-sized company and still have support from the banks, though our loan rates have been adjusted upward two to three times this year already."
Diana Choyleva, a Hong Kong-based economist for Lombard Street Research, predicted that the combination of tighter monetary policy with a likely slowdown in foreign demand for China's exports would result in the Chinese economy's growing at an annualized rate of only 5 percent in the second half of this year and the first half of next year.
"Just as the authorities are managing to hammer down demand growth, the rest of the world is not looking healthy, so there's going to be an export shock," she said.
Despite the gloomy purchasing managers survey issued Thursday by HSBC and Markit, Donna Kwok, an economist in the Hong Kong offices of HSBC, noted that the survey also showed shrinkage in companies' inventories of finished goods. So at least short term, companies may need to maintain production to fill orders, instead of meeting them from existing stockpiles.
China has been highly successful in creating jobs and shifting unemployment to other countries through its intervention in currency markets.
This has kept the renminbi weak and made Chinese exports very competitive in foreign markets, even as it has kept imports expensive for Chinese consumers.
That policy, though, could be increasingly hard to continue as high unemployment persists in the West, and Washington lawmakers demand a White House response.
Hong Lei, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a news briefing on Friday in Beijing that appreciation of the renminbi was not the answer to American trade deficits with China.
Many large American companies rely heavily on imports from China and are lobbying against the legislative push.
Within China, domestic demand is starting to weaken slightly. China's auto market, the world's largest by number of vehicles sold, looks fairly strong at first glance, with family vehicle sales up 6 percent in August from a year earlier. But that is a significant slowdown, coming after a decade of almost continuous double-digit growth.
More worrisome, the growth in August occurred mainly among Japanese manufacturers in China that were finally filling orders as they recovered from the parts shortages created by the earthquake and tsunami last March. Price discounts have begun to spread, even among multinational brands.
And many Chinese automakers, which have tended to sell the least expensive and often lowest-quality cars, had sharply lower sales in August -- particularly of small minivans and pickup trucks, for which government incentives expired at the end of last year.
Then there are real estate prices, which have been soaring in China for more than a decade.
A government survey released on Sunday showed that prices had fallen in August compared to July in 16 cities, notably Chongqing in western China. And prices stayed flat in 30 cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, although they did continue rising in 24 other cities.
The hardest question to answer in China is whether slower economic growth and continued inflation could lead to more social tensions, which in turn could damage the economy through weaker investment and more cautious spending.
Though blue-collar wages have surged over the last decade, tripling in some coastal provinces, the salaries for many white-collar workers, particularly recent college graduates, have been trailing inflation.
The central government banned local taxes and fees in rural areas six years ago. And it has been talking for years about whether to start assessing property taxes instead; so far it has experimented with that approach in only a few cities, notably Chongqing and Shanghai. Without a broad base of property taxes, local governments across China raise much of their money by seizing land from peasants with minimal compensation based on the value of recent harvests, rezoning it for industrial or commercial use and then selling the land for far more to developers.
Roy Prosterman, the founder and chairman emeritus of Landesa, a rural development policy group based in Seattle, said in a speech in Hong Kong on Thursday that the group's surveys in China had found that peasants typically receive only one-fifteenth of what developers pay for land in these deals.
The news media have reported a spate of protests in recent months in rural areas, including riots this week in the southern province of Guangdong. But protests have erupted periodically for years and there are no reliable national statistics on whether the overall number of protests is rising or falling.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The global economic crisis may set off upheaval and even unrest, but the ability of the world's governments to buy new military hardware was sharply curtailed last year by strains on their national treasuries, according to a new Congressional study.
Worldwide arms sales in 2010 totaled $40.4 billion, a drop of 38 percent from the $65.2 billion in arms deals signed in 2009 and the lowest total since 2003, the study found.
Even in this tight market, the United States maintained its dominating position in the global arms bazaar, signing $21.3 billion in worldwide arms sales, or 52.7 percent of all weapons deals, a drop from $22.6 billion in 2009.
Russia was second with $7.8 billion in arms sales in 2010, or 19.3 percent of the market, compared with $12.8 billion in 2009. Following the United States and Russia in sales were France, Britain, China, Germany and Italy.
Developing nations continued to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales, according to the report, by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. The annual study is considered the most detailed collection of unclassified global arms sales data available to the public.
The report found that the total value of arms transfer deals with developing nations last year was $30.7 billion, or 76.2 percent of worldwide deals. That was a drop from $49.8 billion in 2009.
India, which signed $5.8 billion in weapons transfer deals, was the top purchaser in the developing world last year, followed by Taiwan with $2.7 billion in agreements and Saudi Arabia with $2.2 billion in deals. Other major purchasers were Egypt, Israel, Algeria, Syria, South Korea, Singapore and Jordan.
The United States was not only the largest weapons supplier last year, but also the main source of weapons to the developing world, accounting for about $14.9 billion of these deals -- or 48.6 percent. That was a striking rise from 2009, when its sales of $15.1 billion to developing nations accounted for 30.3 percent of the market.
Russia was second in arms deals with developing nations last year, signing $7.6 billion in agreements, or about 24.7 percent.
"Worldwide weapons sales declined generally in 2010 in response to the constraints created by the tenuous state of the global economy," wrote Richard F. Grimmett, a specialist in international security at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.
"In view of budget difficulties faced by many purchasing nations, they chose to defer or limit the purchase of new major weapons systems," he wrote. "Some nations chose to limit their buying to upgrades of existing systems or to training and support services."
To compare weapons sales over various years, the study used figures in 2010 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to give a constant financial measurement.

Abstract: According to new estimates by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, one-fourth of those with incomes of more than $1 million a year pay income and payroll tax of 12.6 percent of their income or less, putting their tax burden below that of many in the middle class.

Full text: This week President Obama said the obvious: that wealthy Americans, many of whom pay remarkably little in taxes, should bear part of the cost of reducing the long-run budget deficit. And Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan responded with shrieks of "class warfare."
It was, of course, nothing of the sort. On the contrary, it's people like Mr. Ryan, who want to exempt the very rich from bearing any of the burden of making our finances sustainable, who are waging class war.
As background, it helps to know what has been happening to incomes over the past three decades. Detailed estimates from the Congressional Budget Office -- which only go up to 2005, but the basic picture surely hasn't changed -- show that between 1979 and 2005 the inflation-adjusted income of families in the middle of the income distribution rose 21 percent. That's growth, but it's slow, especially compared with the 100 percent rise in median income over a generation after World War II.
Meanwhile, over the same period, the income of the very rich, the top 100th of 1 percent of the income distribution, rose by 480 percent. No, that isn't a misprint. In 2005 dollars, the average annual income of that group rose from $4.2 million to $24.3 million.
So do the wealthy look to you like the victims of class warfare?
To be fair, there is argument about the extent to which government policy was responsible for the spectacular disparity in income growth. What we know for sure, however, is that policy has consistently tilted to the advantage of the wealthy as opposed to the middle class.
Some of the most important aspects of that tilt involved such things as the sustained attack on organized labor and financial deregulation, which created huge fortunes even as it paved the way for economic disaster. For today, however, let's focus just on taxes.
The budget office's numbers show that the federal tax burden has fallen for all income classes, which itself runs counter to the rhetoric you hear from the usual suspects. But that burden has fallen much more, as a percentage of income, for the wealthy. Partly this reflects big cuts in top income tax rates, but, beyond that, there has been a major shift of taxation away from wealth and toward work: tax rates on corporate profits, capital gains and dividends have all fallen, while the payroll tax -- the main tax paid by most workers -- has gone up.
And one consequence of the shift of taxation away from wealth and toward work is the creation of many situations in which -- just as Warren Buffett and Mr. Obama say -- people with multimillion-dollar incomes, who typically derive much of that income from capital gains and other sources that face low taxes, end up paying a lower overall tax rate than middle-class workers. And we're not talking about a few exceptional cases.
According to new estimates by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, one-fourth of those with incomes of more than $1 million a year pay income and payroll tax of 12.6 percent of their income or less, putting their tax burden below that of many in the middle class.
Now, I know how the right will respond to these facts: with misleading statistics and dubious moral claims.
On one side, we have the claim that the rising share of taxes paid by the rich shows that their burden is rising, not falling. To point out the obvious, the rich are paying more taxes because they're much richer than they used to be. When middle-class incomes barely grow while the incomes of the wealthiest rise by a factor of six, how could the tax share of the rich not go up, even if their tax rate is falling?
On the other side, we have the claim that the rich have the right to keep their money -- which misses the point that all of us live in and benefit from being part of a larger society.
Elizabeth Warren, the financial reformer who is now running for the United States Senate in Massachusetts, recently made some eloquent remarks to this effect that are, rightly, getting a lot of attention. "There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody," she declared, pointing out that the rich can only get rich thanks to the "social contract" that provides a decent, functioning society in which they can prosper.
Which brings us back to those cries of "class warfare."
Republicans claim to be deeply worried by budget deficits. Indeed, Mr. Ryan has called the deficit an "existential threat" to America. Yet they are insisting that the wealthy -- who presumably have as much of a stake as everyone else in the nation's future -- should not be called upon to play any role in warding off that existential threat.
Well, that amounts to a demand that a small number of very lucky people be exempted from the social contract that applies to everyone else. And that, in case you're wondering, is what real class warfare looks like.

Full text: Is the smart money fleeing gold?
For the better part of the last two years, some of the world's biggest hedge funds have been piling into gold, betting the precious metal would provide an effective hedge against inflation or be a safer place to park cash as equity markets around the world stumbled.
But to the surprise of many investors, when equity markets across the globe tumbled once again on Thursday, gold moved sharply lower as well.
Gold futures for September delivery fell $66.30, or 3.7 percent, to $1,739.20 an ounce in New York. It was quite a turnabout for the metal, which has been soaring in recent months amid the turbulent stock markets.
Hedge funds, which have been ratcheting down their positions in gold futures since early August, were quickly named as the culprits in the latest sell-off.
Some traders said that hedge funds were beginning to unwind, or close out, what has been a very popular and profitable trade for the last 18 months as they bet the dollar would fall and that gold would rise. In the last month alone, the euro has fallen nearly 4 percent against the dollar amid worries about the European debt crisis.
The sell-off in gold was part of a broader move in the markets that had investors shifting away from perceived riskier assets, like commodities, and into the dollar in reaction to the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday of its new stimulus program.
In addition, the Fed said that there were "significant downside risks" to the United States economy, which sent several commodities, including crude oil and copper, tumbling on Thursday on fears of a global slowdown in demand.
Other market participants said hedge funds were selling their positions in gold to raise cash to meet increased capital demands for their borrowings from Wall Street banks as the assets they have put up as collateral, like other commodities or stocks, have declined sharply in value.
"On the one hand you have a lot of strength in the U.S. dollar, historically gold and the dollar do trade inversely," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research. "The hedge funds are long gold and they need to raise cash and it looks like they are definitely selling some gold."
Others say some hedge funds may be selling to meet redemption requests from investors who have been spooked by the recent market volatility and fear a repeat of the problems of late 2008.
"A lot of investors are waking up to the realization that something is off. We've seen Goldman Sachs close its flagship fund, legendary hedge funds are down sharply, and I suspect we're going to see significant withdrawals from some hedge funds this year," said Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist of the investment advisory firm Pension Partners.
"The tendency for individual hedge funds or anybody is to sell winners before they sell losers. What's been one of the few winners this year? It's been gold," Mr. Gayed added.
Still, some are not yet ready to call the end of the gold rush. Even with the pullback, gold remains one of the most profitable investments this year with a gain of 22 percent.
Some strategists have even predicted that gold will reach a record of above $2,300, which it hit during the early 1980s when adjusted for inflation and translated into current dollars. Likewise, the world's largest exchange-traded gold fund, the SPDR Gold Shares, fell 2.6 percent on Thursday, but remains up 22 percent for the year.
Gold, whether through futures contracts or via exchange-traded funds, has been a popular investment among some of the world's largest hedge funds. One of the best known "gold bugs" is John A. Paulson, whose firm, Paulson & Company, is the biggest shareholder in the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. But many other hedge funds have embraced the metal as well.
After peaking in early August, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure in the gold futures market, according to Mary Ann Bartels, the head of United States technical analysis for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
"A lot of speculators were very long in July," Ms. Bartels said. "But they've been taking it down ever since."

Full text: It's not just sovereign debt.
Just when markets were focused on the risks of a Greek default and the possibility of contagion to other countries, Spain's central bank reported this week that things were getting worse for that country's banks -- but not because they held a lot of Greek debt or bonds issued by other troubled European economies.
The problem, instead, is the same old one. With Spain's economy weak and home prices falling, bad loans are growing. And the central bank thinks things are getting worse.
In a surprisingly frank presentation to investors in London on Tuesday, Jose Maria Roldan, the Bank of Spain's director general of banking regulation, said that Spanish land prices had fallen about 30 percent from the 2007 peak, adjusted for inflation, and that home prices were off about 22 percent. "In both cases, we expect further corrections in the years to come," he said. For land prices, he said, the bank's "baseline scenario" was that prices would fall to little more than half of the peak level. The "adverse scenario" indicated that the decline could be significantly worse.
That was a significant change from a presentation he made in February. Then, with home prices down about 18 percent from the peak, he argued that the decline was similar to past cyclical downturns and that prices were likely to begin rising soon.
Remarkably enough, collapsing home prices have not left Spanish banks holding large amounts of bad mortgage loans, thanks largely to the fact the Spanish mortgage market operated during the boom in far different ways than the American market.
But if lending to home buyers was conducted in a far more prudent manner than it was in the United States, lending to real estate developers and construction companies was, if anything, more irresponsible. The higher land prices went, the more eager the banks were to push out loans.
The story of how Spain's banks got into the mess -- and the way its mess differs from that of American banks -- show that it is impossible for banks to walk away from a collapsing bubble in real estate. It also shows that the structure of mortgage markets can make a major difference in how a collapse plays out.
The figures released by the central bank this week showed that by the middle of this year, 17 percent of Spanish bank loans to construction companies and real estate developers were troubled -- or "doubtful," the term favored by the central bank. That figure has been rising rapidly, reflecting the deterioration in real estate values.
When the financial crisis first broke out, in 2008 and 2009, it appeared that Spanish banks were in a better position than most, in part because of regulation that had kept the big banks from making some of the mistakes others made.
But it turned out that smaller Spanish savings banks were heavily exposed to a real estate market that had outpaced even the United States' market for a time during the first decade of this century. That market continued to rise after the American housing market stopped climbing.
The Bank of Spain has created a program to force mergers of the smaller banks and to bring in better management. It has put about 11 billion euros into the banks to recapitalize them, and is putting in another 15 billion euros in a process that is supposed to be completed by the end of this month, said Antonio Garcia Pascual, the chief Southern European economist for Barclays Capital. But, he added, "our estimate is that the overall number needed is closer to 50 billion euros."
The banks are bleeding from loans secured by raw real estate, and from loans for construction. The pain is made worse because such lending soared during the property boom. It is those loans that are now devastating bank balance sheets, as developers who borrowed to build offices, stores and neighborhoods saw demand dry up and now cannot pay the banks back.
Other corporate loans are also showing weakness, as would be expected when unemployment is above 20 percent and not expected to improve for at least two years, but less than 5 percent of those loans are said to be doubtful. There are also signs of trouble in car loans and other loans to individuals.
And then there is the mortgage market. Perhaps the most remarkable statistic in the reports released by the Bank of Spain this week was the low percentage of mortgage loans that appeared to be in trouble. It is just 2.5 percent, half a percentage point less than in mid-2009. If American mortgages were doing as well, there would be far less angst here.
How can that be?
The most important fact may be that refinancing is very unusual in Spain. They are generally unnecessary; since mortgage loans are made at variable rates, there is no need to take out a new loan if rates are declining. The absence of refinancing, along with the absence of home equity lines of credit, meant homeowners could not take out cash to spend on other things.
As a result, if you bought a house in Spain a few years before the peak, you still have equity in the home, even with prices down. If you lose your job and can no longer afford the payments, you can sell the home and emerge with something.
That would also be true in the United States if mortgages were for only house purchases. But in the housing cycle that led to the recent bubble -- unlike previous cycles -- it was far easier for homeowners to cash in their equity and use the money for whatever they wanted. So some people who have been in the same home for decades are desperately under water.
There were other differences as well. There were no "originate-to-distribute" strategies in the mortgage markets, so the loans were not bundled into securities to be sold to foolish investors.
Banks that made the loans expected to profit if -- and only if -- they were repaid. There were few loans to investors who planned to rent or flip homes. Moreover, mortgage loans in Spain are recourse. Buyers cannot walk away if they have other assets, as they can in some American states.
The Bank of Spain has said it is emphasizing transparency in seeking to fix the banking system, and that it is willing to be flexible as conditions change. Its openness may be winning over investors. No one likes to hear bad news, but it is reassuring to believe that the news is accurate, rather than sugar-coated.
I have not seen other banking regulators distributing charts forecasting that the biggest problem facing their banks was likely to get significantly worse, as the Bank of Spain did this week. It has been more common for regulators to seek to weaken accounting rules, on the theory that it will help confidence if banks seem to be strong, regardless of the facts. That is an attitude that has backfired, particularly after the European stress tests chose to assume that all sovereign debt was safe.
Rather than denigrate markets as being foolishly negative -- as some other European officials have done recently -- Mr. Roldan cited market trends, including the rising cost of credit-default swaps on the banks, as evidence of the problems confronting them.
It is a refreshing attitude in a regulator. When, and if, Mr. Roldan ever starts to say the worst is over, it will be a lot easier to believe him.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve announced an unconventional plan on Wednesday to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, trying once more to spur economic growth despite urgings from Republicans that it refrain from any expansion of its stimulus program.
The Fed said that it would invest $400 billion in long-term Treasury securities over the next nine months, using money raised by selling its holdings of short-term federal debt, in an attempt to drive down interest rates on mortgage loans, corporate bonds and other forms of credit.
The Fed's policy-making committee said in a statement that it was acting because it saw little prospect that the economy would expand fast enough and soon enough to help the 25 million Americans unable to find full-time work. It also said there was a significant risk that "strains in global financial markets" could further damage prospects for recovery.
"Growth remains slow. Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions and the unemployment rate remains elevated," the Fed said in the statement, which listed its reasons for worrying about the anemic condition of the American economy. "Household spending has been increasing at only a modest pace in recent months."
The markets responded with mixed signals. Bond investors already had driven down interest rates in expectation of the Fed's announcement, but rates fell further on Wednesday, reflecting a measure of surprise about the size of the plan. Investors in the stock markets appeared more concerned about the bleak outlook for the economy and Europe's, as the major domestic indexes fell sharply.
Lower rates may encourage companies to invest in equipment and hire more workers, and consumers to start spending again on homes and cars and vacations. But tough lending standards are likely to limit the benefits. Loans already are cheap, but they are also hard to get.
"Only history will be able to gauge Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's success or failure," Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, wrote in a note commenting on the committee's decision. "No one will question his willingness to try."
Three members of the 10-member Federal Open Market Committee dissented from the decision, just as they had with the committee's last aid effort, in August, but their concerns did not seem to restrain the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. The committee's statement noted only that they "did not support additional policy accommodation at this time."
Republican politicians, meanwhile, reiterated their argument, put forth late Tuesday in a letter sent to the Fed from four Republican leaders, that the Fed's efforts were not helping the economy and could have harmful consequences.
"I am absolutely convinced that the challenges in our economy are not a phenomenon that can be addressed by monetary policy," said Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is a member of the special deficit reduction committee.
Some liberals said the Fed had not done enough. "Today's action by the Federal Reserve is not bold and will not create the millions of jobs that America needs," said Senator Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont.
The new effort is an experiment without a direct precedent, although the Fed tried something similar in the 1960s. Essentially, the Fed hopes to drive down rates not by expanding its portfolio, as it has done twice in recent years, but by shifting its money into riskier long-term investments.
The Fed has amassed more than $1.6 trillion of federal debt. It said Wednesday that by June 2012 it would sell $400 billion in securities with remaining maturities of less than three years and buy roughly the same amount in securities with maturities longer than six years. It said the result would shift the average maturity of its holdings to 100 months, or more than eight years, from the current average of 75 months, or just over six years.
Separately, the Fed said it would maintain its investments in mortgage-backed securities at the current level of about $885 billion, ending a policy that had allowed the portfolio to shrink by $100 billion so far this year, to push down mortgage rates with particular force. While rates are already at record lows, reducing rates even further is the only tool available to the Fed.
Economists project the Fed's efforts could reduce interest rates by a few tenths of a percentage point, a significant increment when multiplied by the vast extent of borrowing.
Macroeconomic Advisers, the St. Louis forecasting firm, estimated in advance of the Fed's announcement -- based on its best guess about the details of such a program -- that the Fed's efforts could add about 0.4 percentage points to economic output and create about 350,000 jobs over the next two years.
Other economists, however, predicted a smaller economic impact. They noted that lower interest rates so far had not produced the full measure of predicted benefits because lending standards remained unusually strict.
Most outstanding mortgages still carry interest rates above 5 percent, despite the availability of lower rates, because it remains difficult to refinance.
The Fed already is engaged in an enormous effort to stimulate growth. Most recently, the Fed announced in August that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero until at least the middle of 2013, extending a policy that has been in place since December 2008.
The central bank's latest efforts are unfolding in an environment of heightened political pressures. As Democrats and Republicans battle over the role of government in improving the economy, both parties are seeking to influence the Fed's decisions.
Republican presidential candidates have made criticism of the Fed a central theme of the early campaign.,
Some Democrats, meanwhile, have accused the central bank of being too cautious. Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has proposed legislation that would remove the presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks from their seats on the policy-making committee. The 12 presidents of regional banks, who are elected in part by local businesses, now fill five seats on the committee on a rotating basis. The rest of the members of the policy-making committee are governors of the Federal Reserve board.
The regional bank presidents tend to be more concerned about inflation and less concerned about unemployment. Mr. Frank has described their participation as "undemocratic" and said it was impeding the Fed's ability to pursue all the measures he considered necessary to support an economic recovery.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
They called it the "Greenspan put," and it reassured a generation of traders. If economic storms were gathering, the top central banks -- most important the Federal Reserve, then led by Alan Greenspan -- could and would step in to prevent disaster.
Because the traders effectively had a put option, they could safely bet that the markets would survive even the worst crisis.
This year, volatility has soared and share prices have fallen sharply, in part because few think there is a Bernanke put, or, for that matter, a Trichet put. It is far from clear that the authorities could stem a new panic, and even less clear that many would be willing to try.
In other words, the slogan for markets as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meet this week in Washington could well be, "You're on your own. Don't count on anybody to bail you out."
The situation is thus drastically different from that of three years ago, when I.M.F.-World Bank meetings served as a forum to find joint strategies to ameliorate the financial crisis that had followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Now there appears to be division and disarray within Europe and the United States. Central bank efforts to help the economy have become politically controversial, and there has been infighting at both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.
At the European Central Bank, the departing president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has faced sniping from Germany and the resignation of Jurgen Stark, a German member of the bank's executive board. Mr. Stark cited personal reasons, but his departure was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the bank's purchases of bonds issued by troubled European nations.
At the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman who succeeded Mr. Greenspan, has faced dissents within the central bank on recent efforts to stimulate the economy.
There was a long-lived bipartisan consensus in the United States -- it lasted at least from 1992, when Mr. Greenspan helped banks recover from bad loans to Latin American nations, through 2008 -- that the Fed was expected to steer the economy and would be treated gently by politicians.
Presidents tended to reappoint Fed chairmen, even those appointed by predecessors of the other political party, in part because of fear that markets would be outraged by any effort to politicize monetary policy. There have been six presidents since Paul A. Volcker took over at the Fed in 1979, but Mr. Bernanke is just the third chairman.
That consensus seems to have vanished, with candidates for the Republican presidential nomination vying with one another to show their hostility to Mr. Bernanke, even though he is a Republican who previously served as the chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush.
One candidate, Mitt Romney, has said he would ask Mr. Bernanke to resign. Another, Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, suggested that Mr. Bernanke might be trying to stimulate the economy to aid President Obama's re-election campaign. On Tuesday , Republican Congressional leaders took the extraordinary step of publicly calling for the Fed to do no more.
That did not stop the Fed from announcing some initiatives on Thursday, but they were relatively small and disappointing to investors. Share prices fell sharply after the announcement.
The political challenges may make it harder for the Fed to do much more over the next year, even if the economy is weaker than expected. Similarly, Mario Draghi, the Italian central banker who will take over from Mr. Trichet on Nov. 1, will be under great pressure from Germany to avoid actions that might increase inflation, even if they may be needed to prevent a new financial collapse.
At the same time, European governments have found it hard to agree on effective action. A July 21 agreement, which was supposed to provide money for Greece while limiting the losses for banks, has yet to be put in place, and markets seem convinced that a Greek default is inevitable. Italy is the latest country to find bond markets hesitant to provide funds.
European banks, many of which were slower than American ones to raise capital when investors grew more friendly in 2010, may need to be rescued again precisely because of fears that the rescuers of 2008 -- national governments -- may not be able to meet their obligations.
At a meeting of European finance ministers last week, Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, pleaded for coordinated action. "Governments and central banks need to take out the catastrophic risk to markets," he said. After he left, Austria's finance minister said Americans should stop lecturing Europe.
Those countries that can borrow money easily and cheaply -- most important, Germany and the United States -- are reluctant to do so, even with the threat of a new recession seeming to grow. The Germans argue that other European nations must cut back spending to regain competitiveness, that there is no gain without pain. Mr. Obama has proposed a new stimulus program, but it faces uncertain political prospects only weeks after the two parties agreed to seek consensus on ways to reduce government spending.
Large banks around the world have seized on the disarray of governments to begin campaigns to reduce regulation, complaining that new rules adopted after the 2008 debacle threaten growth. They want capital rules eased and hope that few will remember it was their excessive risk-taking, relative to the capital they had, that helped to create the 2008 disaster and that threatens a new one.
Some politicians join in that complaint, saying current problems stem from excessive government interference in the economy, particularly in free markets.
Those who remember the "Greenspan put" may find that argument odd. It is the fear that governments may not ride to the rescue that seems to have unnerved markets.
Perhaps it is the low expectations that provide the best hope for some kind of success at the meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. Three years ago, it was widely expected that governments and central banks could act cooperatively and effectively. Now any indication they can still do so would come as a pleasant surprise.

Abstract: Other than the entry-level pay raises, the veteran G.M. workers received no wage increases in the tentative contract, which union members will vote on by next week. The union's president, Bob King, said workers were already guaranteed at least a $3,500 profit-sharing check in 2012 based on profits already earned this year at G.M. G.M. executives have declined to comment on the savings the company expects from the new agreement, which was reached on Sept. 16 after marathon negotiations that lasted two days past the expiration of the old contract.

Full text: DETROIT -- The new labor contract between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers will accelerate the hiring of lower-paid, entry-level workers at the company and bring jobs to the United States that were headed for Mexico.
While the U.A.W. achieved only modest economic gains for its 48,000 members at G.M. -- longtime G.M. workers will receive no wage increases under the deal -- the emphasis on adding jobs was the top concern for the union's leadership.
"What we were looking for was jobs, jobs, jobs, and that's what we came away with," Joe Ashton, a U.A.W. vice president, said at a media briefing here on Tuesday.
The union estimates that G.M. will create or preserve 6,400 jobs over the next four years, mostly by hiring new, entry-level employees but also by retaining work in the United States that was going to move to Mexico.
The impact will be felt in several communities that are home to G.M. facilities. The company agreed to reopen idled assembly operations at a plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., add a shift of workers at a truck plant in Wentzville, Mo., and increase employment at an engine plant in Romulus, Mich.
Over all, the union said G.M. would invest $2.5 billion in factories in this country over the life of the contract, which expires in 2015.
While some of the additional jobs will be taken by workers laid off during G.M.'s bankruptcy, the majority of the positions will be filled by new, entry-level workers, Mr. Ashton said.
The union won better wages and benefits for lower-tier workers in the agreement as well.
G.M. now has about 1,900 second-tier workers, who are paid a starting wage of about $14 an hour. Longtime union workers earn double that amount.
Under the new agreement, the base hourly wage of the new workers will go up to nearly $16 immediately after the contract is ratified, and increase to about $19 over the next four years.
The entry-level workers will also get enhanced health care coverage in the new agreement and financial assistance toward college tuition programs.
Even with slightly higher wages, the new workers are considerably less expensive for G.M. than traditional U.A.W. employees, because of both lower wages and less generous benefits. Analysts said that as older G.M. workers retire, the influx of lower-tier employees would further reduce the company's production costs.
"Given G.M.'s demographics, long-term savings could be substantial," Brian Johnson, a Barclays Capital analyst, said in a research report.
About 35 percent of G.M.'s workers are eligible to retire, said Mr. Ashton. The new contract provides $10,000 bonuses for those employees if they retire within the next two years.
Other than the entry-level pay raises, the veteran G.M. workers received no wage increases in the tentative contract, which union members will vote on by next week. Mr. Ashton sought, but was unable to get, cost-of-living increases for the entire work force.
However, every U.A.W. worker at G.M. will receive a $5,000 bonus for approving the contract, as well as $1,000 "inflation protection" payments in each of the last three years of the agreement.
G.M. also agreed to modifications in its profit-sharing formula for all workers.
Under the old system, payments were calculated solely on profits made in the United States.
The new contract calls for workers to get about $1,000 in profit-sharing for every $1 billion that G.M. earns in its larger North American operations, which include Canada and Mexico.
The union's president, Bob King, said workers were already guaranteed at least a $3,500 profit-sharing check in 2012 based on profits already earned this year at G.M.
G.M. executives have declined to comment on the savings the company expects from the new agreement, which was reached on Sept. 16 after marathon negotiations that lasted two days past the expiration of the old contract. It was not explained in detail by the union until Tuesday.
In a statement, G.M.'s chief labor negotiator, Cathy Clegg, emphasized that the deal stabilized the company's cost structure as it built on its turnaround since emerging from its government-sponsored bankruptcy in 2009.
"We used a creative problem-solving approach to reach an agreement that addresses the needs of employees and positions our business for long-term success," said Ms. Clegg.
Mr. King said Tuesday that he expected Ford and Chrysler to follow the model set in negotiations with G.M.
"This is a general framework and pattern that we will go to Ford and Chrysler with," Mr. King said. "I'm confident we can put together an agreement with both."
Negotiations at Ford and Chrysler could take several more days. Mr. King said the union had not yet decided which company to focus on first.
Chrysler, the smallest and least profitable of Detroit's Big Three, may balk at matching the size of the bonuses agreed to by G.M.
Talks at Ford could also be affected by the union's ability to strike the company if discussions break down. The U.A.W. agreed to not strike G.M. or Chrysler in this round of negotiations as a condition of the government's bailouts of those two companies.

Abstract: "The whole reason military people are willing to pursue a career is because after 20, 30 years of extraordinary sacrifice, there is a package commensurate with that sacrifice upon leaving service," said Steven P. Strobridge, a retired Air Force colonel who is the director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, which is lobbying against changes to the benefits.

Full text: As Washington looks to squeeze savings from once-sacrosanct entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, another big social welfare system is growing as rapidly, but with far less scrutiny: the health and pension benefits of military retirees.
Military pensions and health care for active and retired troops now cost the government about $100 billion a year, representing an expanding portion of both the Pentagon budget -- about $700 billion a year, including war costs -- and the national debt, which together finance the programs.
Making even incremental reductions to military benefits is typically a doomed political venture, given the public's broad support for helping troops, the political potency of veterans groups and the fact that significant savings take years to appear.
But the intense push in Congress this year to reduce the debt and the possibility that the Pentagon might have to begin trimming core programs like weapons procurement, research, training and construction have suddenly made retiree benefits vulnerable, military officials and experts say.
And if Congress fails to adopt the deficit-reduction recommendations of a bipartisan joint Congressional committee this fall, the Defense Department will be required under debt ceiling legislation passed in August to find about $900 billion in savings over the coming decade. Cuts that deep will almost certainly entail reducing personnel benefits for active and retired troops, Pentagon officials and analysts say.
"We've got to put everything on the table," Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said recently on PBS, acknowledging that he was looking at proposals to rein in pension costs.
Under the current rules, service members who retire after 20 years are eligible for pensions that pay half their salaries for life, indexed for inflation, even if they leave at age 38. They are also eligible for lifetime health insurance through the military's system, Tricare, at a small fraction of the cost of private insurance, prompting many working veterans to shun employer health plans in favor of military insurance.
Advocates of revamping the systems argue that they are not just fiscally untenable but also unfair.
The annual fee for Tricare Prime, an H.M.O.-like program for military retirees, is just $460 for families and has not risen in years, even as health care costs have skyrocketed. Critics of the system say the contribution could be raised substantially and still be far lower than what civilians pay for employer-sponsored health plans, typically about $4,000.
Those critics also argue that under the current rules, 83 percent of former service members receive no pension payments at all -- because only veterans with 20 years of service are eligible. Those with 5 or even 15 years are not, even if they did multiple combat tours. Such a structure would be illegal in the private sector, and a company that tried it could be penalized, experts say.
"It cries out for some rationalization," said Sylvester J. Schieber, a former chairman of the Social Security Advisory Board. "Why should we ask somebody to sustain a system that's unfair by any other measure in our society?"
But within military circles, and among many members of Congress, the benefits are considered untouchable. Veterans groups and military leaders argue that the system helps retain capable commissioned and noncommissioned officers.
And having volunteered to put their lives at risk, those people deserve higher-quality benefits, supporters argue. The typical beneficiary, they add, is not a general but a retired noncommissioned officer, with an average pension of about $26,000 a year.
"The whole reason military people are willing to pursue a career is because after 20, 30 years of extraordinary sacrifice, there is a package commensurate with that sacrifice upon leaving service," said Steven P. Strobridge, a retired Air Force colonel who is the director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America, which is lobbying against changes to the benefits.
A wild-card factor in the debate is the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, which some experts say could avoid the stigma of cutting benefits while troops are at war.
"The fact that you are getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan does make it easier," said Lawrence J. Korb, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan administration who was a co-author of a recent proposal for reducing the cost of military health care. "When the war in Iraq was in terrible shape, it was hard to get people to join the military, and no one wanted to touch any military benefits."
By far the most contentious proposal circulating in Washington is from a Pentagon advisory panel, the Defense Business Board. It would make the military pension system, a defined benefit plan, more like a 401(k) plan under which the Pentagon would make contributions to a service member's individual account; contributions by the troops themselves would be optional. Mr. Panetta has said that if adopted, the plan would not apply to current military personnel.
While health care costs for active and retired troops are growing faster, military pension costs are larger. Last year, for every dollar the Pentagon paid service members, it spent an additional $1.36 for its military retirees, a much smaller group. Even in the troubled world of state and municipal pension funds, pensions almost never cost more than payrolls.
Citing the fiscal hazards and inequities of the system, the Defense Business Board proposal would allow soldiers with less than 20 years of service to leave with a small nest egg, provided they served a minimum length of time, three to five years. But it would prevent all retirees from receiving benefits until they were 60.
The business board says that its proposal would reduce the plan's total liabilities to $1.8 trillion by 2034, from the $2.7 trillion now projected -- all without cutting benefits for current service members.
Steve Griffin of Tallahassee, Fla., is the type of soldier the defense board is trying to appeal to: a former captain who did two tours in Iraq, he left the Army in 2010 after five years of service and thus receives no pension.
Yet in a sign of the deep support for the existing system, Mr. Griffin says it should be left alone because it provides incentives for recruitment and rewards retirees who have endured great hardship.
"Yes, it would be nice for people like me," Mr. Griffin, 28, said of the proposal. "But I think the retirement system now is fair. We shouldn't take anything from it. If anything, we should add to it."
Much like in the debate over Social Security, questions about the sustainability of the military pension system abound.
Each year the Defense and Treasury Departments set aside more than $75 billion to pay not only current and future benefits but also pensions for service many years in the past. But the retirement fund has not accumulated nearly enough money to cover its total costs, with assets of $278 billion at the end of 2009 and obligations of about $1.4 trillion.
The government tries to close the shortfall by simply issuing more Treasury securities each year, thereby adding to the nation's debt.
Given the political potency of veterans groups, it is unclear whether anyone in Congress will lead an effort to revamp the pension or retiree health systems.
But the debt ceiling agreement approved this summer by Congress, under which the Pentagon must find $400 billion in reductions over the next 12 years, may force cuts once considered unthinkable. And if Congress does not adopt the recommendations of the bipartisan committee studying deficit reduction, the mandated reductions in Pentagon spending would more than double, to about $900 billion, and fall on just about every category of defense spending.
Deficit hawks, led by Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, have begun taking smaller steps, pushing for an array of cuts to military benefits, including ending subsidies for base commissaries and tightening disability compensation for diseases linked to Agent Orange.
But those trims are considered marginal compared with the deeper reductions many experts say are necessary to contain Pentagon spending.
"If the trend continues, it will call into question the military's ability to do other things, like buy equipment, do maintenance, train troops and equip them," said Nora Bensahel, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a nonprofit organization with ties to the Obama administration.
"At some point, the cost pressures by the retirement benefits will really start to impede military capabilities."

CHARTS: Spiraling Costs of the Military Pension Program: While a vast majority of those who serve in the military get no pension at all, the amount that the federal government contributes to military pensions has tripled since 2000 and is now larger than the entire military payroll.

A Little Inflation Can Be a Dangerous Thing

Full text: IN all the commentary about Ben S. Bernanke's recent speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., little attention has been paid to six crucial words: "in a context of price stability." Those words concluded a discussion by Mr. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, of what tools the central bank could consider appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery.
Ordinarily, a central banker's affirming the importance of price stability is not headline news. But consider the setting. There is great and understandable disappointment about high unemployment and the absence of a robust economy, and even concern about the possibility of a renewed downturn. There is also a sense of desperation that both monetary and fiscal policy have almost exhausted their potential, given the size of the fiscal deficits and the already extremely low level of interest rates.
So now we are beginning to hear murmurings about the possible invigorating effects of "just a little inflation." Perhaps 4 or 5 percent a year would be just the thing to deal with the overhang of debt and encourage the "animal spirits" of business, or so the argument goes.
It's not yet a full-throated chorus. But remarkably, at least one member of the Fed's policy making committee recently departed from the price-stability script.
The siren song is both alluring and predictable. Economic circumstances and the limitations on orthodox policies are indeed frustrating. After all, if 1 or 2 percent inflation is O.K. and has not raised inflationary expectations -- as the Fed and most central banks believe -- why not 3 or 4 or even more? Let's try to get business to jump the gun and invest now in the expectation of higher prices later, and raise housing prices (presumably commodities and gold, too) and maybe wages will follow. If the dollar is weakened, that's a good thing; it might even help close the trade deficit. And of course, as soon as the economy expands sufficiently, we will promptly return to price stability.
Well, good luck.
Some mathematical models spawned in academic seminars might support this scenario. But all of our economic history says it won't work that way. I thought we learned that lesson in the 1970s. That's when the word stagflation was invented to describe a truly ugly combination of rising inflation and stunted growth.
My point is not that we are on the edge today of serious inflation, which is unlikely if the Fed remains vigilant. Rather, the danger is that if, in desperation, we turn to deliberately seeking inflation to solve real problems -- our economic imbalances, sluggish productivity, and excessive leverage -- we would soon find that a little inflation doesn't work. Then the instinct will be to do a little more -- a seemingly temporary and "reasonable" 4 percent becomes 5, and then 6 and so on.
What we know, or should know, from the past is that once inflation becomes anticipated and ingrained -- as it eventually would -- then the stimulating effects are lost. Once an independent central bank does not simply tolerate a low level of inflation as consistent with "stability," but invokes inflation as a policy, it becomes very difficult to eliminate.
It is precisely the common experience with this inflation dynamic that has led central banks around the world to place prime importance on price stability. They do so not at the expense of a strong productive economy. They do it because experience confirms that price stability -- and the expectation of that stability -- is a key element in keeping interest rates low and sustaining a strong, expanding, fully employed economy.
At a time when foreign countries own trillions of our dollars, when we are dependent on borrowing still more abroad, and when the whole world counts on the dollar's maintaining its purchasing power, taking on the risks of deliberately promoting inflation would be simply irresponsible.
It is that conviction that underlies Mr. Bernanke's six words. Let's not forget them.
President Obama has now set out new proposals to support economic growth. I hope he will be able to work with a responsible Congress to find the common ground that is urgently needed to deal with the economic challenges before us, restoring a healthy economy "in a context of price stability." I also hope they will reach agreement early next year on a strong program to deal responsibly with our huge budget deficit over the years ahead.

WOTTON-UNDER-EDGE, England
GOVERNMENTS are pushing austerity; bankers are hoarding cash; a recession looms in the United States and Europe. But Adam S. Posen has a solution: a shock-and-awe display of coordinated central bank attacks aimed at reviving sluggish economies.
An American economist on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, Mr. Posen is no academic scribbler or lonely blogger, but someone inside the central banking establishment.
And, as a leading expert on what is often called Japan's lost decade, he is particularly worried that the Federal Reserve in the United States and the European Central Bank are making the same monetary policy mistakes that left Japan's once-robust economy stagnant all through the 1990s and even into the 21st century.
For months now, Mr. Posen -- who got his bully pulpit at the Bank of England by answering an ad in The Economist -- has been warning that policy makers in Washington and in Europe have been too optimistic about how quickly the global economy would recover from the financial crisis.
The joint action by central banks on Thursday to make it easier for weak European banks to borrow dollars is no doubt a policy nod in Mr. Posen's direction, but it is still a far cry from the type of unified bond purchasing program, or quantitative easing, that he is advocating.
When Fed officials meet this week, they are widely expected to take further action to reduce long-term interest rates, a significant turnabout after months of suggesting that a recovery was solidly under way. The European Central Bank has not yet gone so far, but officials have recently signaled a new openness to reducing interest rates or at least to stop raising them.
In simplest terms, Mr. Posen wants central banks to print more money. A lot more money.
There is a certain tilting-at-windmills aspect to his crusade. The Fed will probably stop well short of the aggressive bond buying that Mr. Posen has advocated. Already, some Fed officials -- and most Republican leaders, including the presidential hopefuls Rick Perry and Mitt Romney -- believe that the Fed is at risk of rekindling inflation.
But that hasn't stopped Mr. Posen from pressing his case. Earlier this month, he had lunch with Kiyohiko Nishimura, a deputy governor at the Bank of Japan, and Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. And, last Tuesday, he traveled to this small hamlet in southwest England to issue his most passionate cry yet "I am here to warn policy makers in the United States, Europe, everywhere that we cannot take our foot off the pedal," Mr. Posen said before a roomful of small-business leaders and bankers. "The outlook is grim -- the right thing to do now is engage in more monetary stimulus."
Although a few bubbles of sweat appeared on his forehead, Mr. Posen argued his brief here with aplomb -- mixing self-deprecating remarks that touched on the oddity of a 44-year-old American prescribing monetary policy in Britain ("I get paid in pounds and pay rent in pounds," he assured his audience) with a trenchant analysis of the economy's various ills (stagnant growth, increasing unemployment and banks that will not lend).
His listeners hailed his proposal that the Bank of England and the British Treasury form a government-backed bank to make small-business loans. But on a day when inflation ticked up to 4.5 percent, among the highest annual rates in Europe, his call to monetary arms received a muted response.
"I am very worried about the consequences of quantitative easing," said John Thurston, chairman of Watts, a local company that supplies parts and services to commercial vehicles. Watts has felt the effect of the business slump, but the inflationary impact of more government bond buying worried him.
"I just don't know how you unwind it," he said.
Mr. Thurston is not alone in his concern.
On the Bank of England's nine-member monetary policy committee, Mr. Posen was the only one to vote last month for the bank to resume its bond purchasing program, according to minutes of the meeting.
IN addition to the Fed's reluctance to start another bond-buying effort, the European Central Bank is also not expected to continue its current program of purchasing the bonds of weak euro zone economies for much longer.
Mr. Posen's central premise is that governments in Japan, Europe and the United States are running the risk of repeating the policy mistakes of the 1930s, when the conventional wisdom called for strict monetary policy and budget cutting, only deepening the Depression.
Not that central bankers have exactly been sitting on their hands.
Their efforts clearly helped prevent the sharp recession of 2008-9 from turning into something much worse, and the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have all bought large amounts of government bonds to help push down interest rates.
Now, with rates touching zero, the view has taken hold that to do more would risk stoking inflation and damage the credibility of central bankers.
But for Mr. Posen, such hand-wringing over inflation when unemployment is spiking in developed countries is not just misguided but irresponsible.
"I am really angry -- we are getting these incredibly wimpy excuses for inaction," Mr. Posen said, speaking broadly of central bank attitudes.
"My proposal is that the Bank of England buy $:50 billion in gilts, although a good case can be made for doing more," he said, referring to British government bonds.
Amid the secretive world of central banking, Mr. Posen strikes an arresting contrast. He is voluble, eager to please and, not being immune to a bit of gossip, has to restrain himself from revealing market-sensitive details about the bank's inner workings.
More policy entrepreneur than wonk, Mr. Posen used his perch at the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington to push his core, Keynes-colored notion that governments and central banks must jump-start economies stuck in a slump when banks and the private sector show that they cannot.
A spate of papers on this topic that pointed to policy dithering in Japan brought him a measure of renown. He also showed an ability to ally himself with name-brand economists and policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic. Early supporters include the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, while he was at Princeton, as well as Mervyn King, before he became governor of the Bank of England.
But it was not until 2009, when Mr. Posen joined the Bank of England, that he was given a chance to advance his views from inside the temple. Unlike the Fed or the European Central Bank, the Bank of England reserves several slots on its policy-making panel for outsiders.
He has an office at the bank's grand headquarters on Threadneedle Street, is expected to show up there no more than three days a week and has the use of two trained economists to assist him in his big thinking and speech-making.
"It's like being a governor of the Federal Reserve, only better because you are not stuck with the crap work," Mr. Posen said. He is also very adept at explaining the dry arcana of monetary policy in a way that is understandable and offers up good guys (those in favor of quantitative easing) and bad guys (those who are not).
"Adam is very confident that inflation will come down, and he has said he will eat his hat if that does not happen," said Charles Goodhart, an expert on central banks at the London School of Economics and an early mentor to Mr. Posen. "He may well be right -- but many of his colleagues do not share this belief."
While it is expected that economists become policy advocates, it is unusual for central bankers to fly their philosophical colors with the ardor that Mr. Posen has shown. "Amid a culture of group-think, Adam sticks his neck out," said Hans-Helmut Kotz, a former board member at the Bundesbank of Germany.
Mr. Posen acknowledges late-night rants on his Facebook page earlier this year when his core thesis -- that extraordinary action was needed to keep Britain from slipping into a second recession -- was not being accepted by his colleagues on the bank's monetary policy committee.
"It was agonizing. I mean I have been doing this for 25 years and here was the possibility that I could be fundamentally wrong," he said. "I was lying awake at night -- ask my wife."
Even now, with signs of global weakness increasing by the day, it is unclear whether Mr. Posen will win the day.
In fact, many economists argue that with Europe and the United States burdened with a huge overhang of debt, with banks undercapitalized and reluctant to lend and with the American and British housing markets still in the doldrums, central banks are largely powerless to revive growth on their own.
"My position is that once interest rates come to zero, there is not much more a central bank can do to stimulate the economy," said Kazuo Ueda, an economist in Tokyo who served on the monetary policy board of the Bank of Japan as it struggled, unsuccessfully, to inject life into the Japanese economy.
In his recent paper, "The Effectiveness of Nontraditional Monetary Policy Measures: The Case of the Bank of Japan," Mr. Ueda suggests that in Japan, structural economic defects and deflation were too powerful for even the most creative monetary policy interventions.
ECONOMISTS who share his view say that what is happening in Europe reinforces the point. Radical monetary easing, they argue, is no substitute for wrenching, yet necessary, structural changes like cutting wages and government spending and recapitalizing zombie banks. If anything, it's an excuse not to put such reforms in place. But to Mr. Posen, those arguments are a poor excuse for inaction.
"The Austrians would say you just have to suffer through it," he said, referring to a school of laissez-faire economic thought popularized by Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises. "But suffering is not good for the soul -- monetary policy won't solve all your problems, but it can make things easier."
Correction: September 25, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the American economist Adam S. Posen, who serves on the Bank of England's policy committee, misspelled part of the name of the town in the dateline and referred incorrectly to its location. Mr. Posen recently spoke in Wotton-Under-Edge in southwest England -- not Wooten-Under-Edge in the southeast of the country.

Full text: David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.
Besides President Obama, the biggest villain in the early Republican debates has been a Republican: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who was first appointed by George W. Bush and previously served as a Bush adviser.
"I'd be looking for someone new," said Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.
"I would not be reappointing Ben Bernanke," Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota said.
"I am not a fan of the current chairman," added Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who had even harsher words on the campaign trail.
Just as striking as the intra-party criticism, though, was the content of that criticism. Mr. Perry and Mr. Romney accused Mr. Bernanke of devaluing the dollar through inflation. Newt Gingrich, former House speaker, called Mr. Bernanke "the most inflationary" chairman ever.
This chart ranks the six Fed chairmen of the past 60 years on the two issues in its dual mandate: inflation and unemployment. Under Mr. Bernanke, inflation has been lower than under any other Fed chairman in the past 40 years -- and lower than in the five years before he took over. Unemployment has been well above average and has risen sharply.
The candidates would say that Mr. Bernanke's actions have set the stage for future inflation. Maybe so. But there is a long way to go before he sets any records.

Full text: Sylvia Nasar is the author of "Grand Pursuit: The Story of Economic Genius."
FOR someone who's been dead for 65 years, John Maynard Keynes has amazing presence. Open a paper, click on a blog or TV, and, voila, like Waldo, he's everywhere. The British economic oracle -- whose boyhood nickname Snout should tell you that a pretty face isn't why he's hot -- gets more Google hits than Leonardo DiCaprio. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas apparently got so fed up with the old scene stealer that he interrupted a recent Republican debate to flash his rivals the news that Keynes was, well, deceased.
For some, Keynes is the hero who rescued the West from the Great Depression, for others the villain to blame for the current mess. To me, he's neither, but rather the Winston Churchill of economics, radiating optimism when things looked bleakest, never so happily engaged as in a national or global emergency.
An emergency is what we're having now, of course. Unemployment has been stuck around 9 percent for more than two years. Business is treading water. Families have less cash to spend. Markets are in turmoil. All our old anxieties have us by the throat again: the American Dream is dead; the middle class is disappearing; our children won't live as well as we do. Never mind that similar fears proved groundless in the past. When you're scared in the middle of the night, it's almost impossible to imagine morning.
Keynes could, though. He had a surprising ability to see beyond the grim present to better days -- especially for someone who famously noted that "in the long run we are all dead."
Keynes's sunny optimism was most striking in the midst of one of the darkest chapters of modern economic history. If we think of the recession of 2007-9 as a Category 1 hurricane, the Great Depression would qualify as a Category 5. Income, per person, was one-fifth of what it is today, adjusted for inflation. Unemployment was nearly three times as high. More than a third of the population was destitute. There were virtually no government benefits.
Preachers talked of Armageddon, and pundits contemplated "the possibility that the Western system of society might break down and cease to work." Keynes, however, reassured fellow citizens, in a silvery, seductive voice that was one of his sexiest features, that what came before "was not a dream. This is a nightmare, which will pass away with the morning."
Admittedly, Keynes had no more seen the hurricane coming than his counterparts predicted the crises of 1893 or 1907 or those of the 1990s or 2008. Irving Fisher's ill-timed pronouncement, just before the crash of 1929, that "stocks have reached a permanently high plateau" will never be forgotten. Keynes was equally surprised and forced to put his two favorite Impressionist paintings up for sale. Still, he wasn't about to waste time ruing past failures when panic was in the air. Instead, he quickly began reassuring the British public that "we are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic pessimism." Boldly, he predicted that by the time his great-nieces and great-nephews were adults, mankind would have solved its "economic problem." At least in the West, the material requisites for a good life would be available to all.
He did not dismiss the dangers of 25 percent unemployment, nor advocate that government embrace nature's cure and wait it out. But he disagreed vehemently with those who called for draconian or dictatorial measures. He insisted that the Western economies were suffering from a mechanical breakdown for which there was a relatively easy fix. (For someone who didn't drive, he was inordinately fond of vehicular metaphors.)
There was, moreover, a solution. Breaking the vicious circle that deflation was creating for farmers and businessmen was well within the power of governments. All the monetary authorities had to do was lower interest rates by creating more money until business could raise prices and would find it worthwhile to begin investing again.
When the Depression failed to respond to monetary policy but instead deepened and spread, Keynes went back to the drawing board. By 1936 he had worked out a new theory of slumps resistant to the usual cures of easy money and low interest rates, calling it, with his trademark lack of modesty, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money."
What never changed during the Depression and the Second World War was Keynes's positive mind-set.
On what, exactly, did Keynes's faith in the future rest, apart from his upbeat temperament and can-do British spirit? Confidence in the "apparatus of the mind," his term for thinking like an economist. His great innovation was to create -- in parallel with America's Fisher -- an "economics of the whole" that was useful for understanding and treating temporary but dangerous economic breakdowns.
KEYNES straddled the Old World notion that the best a member of the working classes could do was to accept his station in life, and the New World order in which it was accepted that nations and people could make their own destinies. By the time he settled on economics, the once dismal science had become, if not exactly gay, then no longer grim, hopeless or resigned.
Alfred Marshall, the man most responsible for Keynes's career choice, was also the one most responsible for the new way of thinking. To paraphrase a great American economist, Paul Samuelson: before Marshall, economics was about what you couldn't change. The new economics was about what you could.
Consider the dismal science when Marshall took it up. There was no cheering up Karl Marx, who, landing in London in 1849, witnessed the Victorian economic miracle and, to quote Gladstone, 20 years of improvement in the "average condition of the British laborer ... unexampled in the history of any country and of any age." The British founders of political economy were scarcely less glum. John Stuart Mill, a libertarian, socialist and supporter of unions and women's rights, doubted whether democratic reforms or technological progress could have much effect on how the average Briton lived.
When he published "Das Kapital" in 1867, Marx claimed that he was revealing society's "law of motion." Yet he had never bothered to visit a single factory. Marshall devoted months every year to touring factories in virtually every major industry, interviewing businessmen, trade union leaders and workers. A trip to America confirmed that competition was the ingenious mechanism that compelled managers to constantly improve their operations, then to share the gains with workers. If wages depended on productivity, workers themselves -- and their elected representatives -- could influence their prospects by pursuing or promoting mobility, education and public health.
The new, cheerful social science that Marshall pioneered and Keynes and others innovated was a genuine revolution in human thinking that changed the lives of everyone on the globe. What would Keynes say if he were, say, to appear on CNBC tomorrow? That we've overcome a dozen challenges as bad or worse, that the tenfold rise in standards since Jane Austen's lifetime shows that we've done more things right than wrong, and that the "apparatus of the mind" -- which demands that we let facts change our minds, engage our critics and see common ground -- is infinitely more helpful in a crisis than ideology or raw emotion.
And what would Keynes do now? Go shopping, I suspect. This was the "incorrigible optimist," his biographer Robert Skidelsky relates, who made a big bet on the United States recovery in 1936 and hung on when it collapsed again in 1937. It may have looked like midnight but Keynes knew that morning would come again.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank still has plenty of ammunition left in its monetary policy bandoleers. The question is whether it will use it.
The bank provided a clue Thursday when it said it would join with the United States Federal Reserve and three other major central banks in ensuring that hard-pressed European banks have a steady supply of dollar credit.
It was a more cooperative hands-across-the-water attitude than Europe's main finance ministers displayed on Friday, when they reacted coolly to a bailout policy suggested by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. (American money speaks louder these days than American advice, evidently.)
The bank by agreeing Thursday to let euro zone banks borrow as many dollars as they want, indicated its willingness to deploy "nonstandard measures," as the bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, likes to call them.
The deeper issue is how far the bank will be willing to depart from precedent as it tries to hold the euro together. The departure would require the central bank to act much less cautiously than it has so far during the long-running euro debt crisis.
"The E.C.B. can stop this crisis in a minute if they want to," said Guntram B. Wolff, deputy director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. The bank, he said, could simply overwhelm bond markets by buying huge quantities of debt from Greece, which is effectively insolvent, as well as other countries that have come under attack, like Italy. End of crisis.
Some economists have argued that the bank could buy more than $1 trillion in sovereign debt if it needed to.
But such an action would provoke howls from Germany and countries like Finland, where the bank is seen as having gone rogue because of its relatively modest purchases of debt from a list of countries that also includes Spain, Portugal and Ireland. In those beleaguered countries, meanwhile, the bank is regarded as insufficiently supportive.
The bank is "in a very awkward position of trying to please everybody, which is impossible," Mr. Wolff said.
Even though Europe's sovereign debt crisis has mushroomed into a perceived threat to the world economy, the bank has so far been much more conservative than its peers. Worried about the prospect of inflation, the bank has raised interest rates this year, while the Fed and the Bank of England have kept theirs at rock-bottom levels.
The bank also stood on the sidelines while its counterparts in the United States and England flooded their economies with cash by way of so-called quantitative easing.
And the bank's purchases of sovereign bonds for 143 billion euros, or $197 billion, so far, as part of a program to keep the recipient governments' borrowing costs under control, is less than asset purchases by the Bank of England -- which represents one country while the euro zone has more than 20 nations.
Right or wrong, the restrained policy means that the bank still has considerable firepower in reserve.
"If there is a risk of severe economic fallout, you could see the E.C.B. do more," said Nick Matthews, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. "There are more options it has not used up."
The most obvious is the classic central bank tool: manipulating interest rates. The bank has raised its benchmark rate twice this year, bringing it to 1.5 percent from 1 percent. The increases were widely criticized as treating the wrong symptom -- incipient inflation rather than depressed growth -- especially after euro zone growth promptly slowed almost to nothing.
Some economists are now forecasting that the bank will reverse course on interest rates before the end of the year. And some think that Mr. Trichet may deliver a cut in October, his last month on the job before he retires.
The reasoning is that Mr. Trichet will want to make life easier for his successor, Mario Draghi, currently the governor of the Bank of Italy. Mr. Draghi might have trouble overseeing a rate cut soon after taking office in November because he will be eager to establish his credentials as a hard-liner on inflation.
But apart from interest rates, the bank has other tools it can use, Mr. Matthews pointed out in a recent research note:

To help banks raise money to lend to consumers and businesses, it could resume purchases of commercial banks' so-called covered bonds, which are generally considered low risk because they are backed by packages of loans as well as the guarantee of the issuing bank. That measure, already used by the bank in 2009, would make sense if banks in France or other countries ran into trouble selling bonds because of worries about creditworthiness.

The central bank could encourage national central banks to expand so-called emergency lending assistance, which is already being used in Greece and Ireland to help banks that can no longer borrow easily on the open market.

It could lengthen the time period for its loans to banks. The central bank already lends banks in the euro area as much as they want for up to six months at the benchmark interest rate, provided the banks supply collateral. It could provide more certainty by resuming one-year loans, and it could expand the list of securities that it accepts as collateral.
None of those measures would be extremely controversial. The screaming would start if the bank did anything that looked like it was printing money or rewarding irresponsible behavior.
In Germany, which as the largest economy in the euro area has significant power to shape the debate, politicians have catered to fears of inflation mixed with resentment at having to bail out southern European countries, which they see as fiscally irresponsible.
Anxiety about the bank's direction was further enflamed last week when Jurgen Stark, a German on its executive board, said he would resign. Analysts interpreted his departure as a protest against increasing purchases of government bonds.
The German government nominated Jorg Asmussen, a deputy finance minister, to replace Mr. Stark on the six-member board. Both men spring from German establishment economics, with its reverence for price stability.
But Mr. Asmussen, a generation younger, may prove more pragmatic after spending several years in the thick of efforts to design a coordinated European approach to the debt crisis.
It is possible that Mr. Stark, who has not explained his resignation in detail, stepped down because he recognized that more aggressive action by the bank was imminent and did not want to be part of it.
And yet, the powers of the bank are not unlimited.
The bank cannot make Greeks pay taxes, force Spain to loosen its labor market regulations or recapitalize French banks. Nor can it otherwise solve by itself the underlying problem in the overly indebted countries: slow growth caused by poor economic policy-making.
As Mr. Trichet said this month, "We are not in a position to replace economic agents, governments or any of the other elements of economic policy."

Full text: The rate of inflation in the United States slowed slightly in August, when a rise in food prices was tempered by easing prices for gasoline and automobiles, according to government statistics released Thursday.
The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, a slight deceleration compared with the 0.5 percent rise in July. The index, although it reflects just one month of data, is a closely watched indicator that guides analysts in assessing the economy. Other reports released Thursday showed weakness in the jobs market and an uncertain outlook for manufacturing.
"The story is very much the same: that economic growth is slow," said Kurt J. Rankin, economist for PNC Bank, about the day's data.
The inflation figures for August reflected the volatility in prices for items such as food and energy. Prices for gasoline moderated, with a 1.9 percent rise in August after a 4.7 percent jump in July. Food prices rose 0.5 percent compared with 0.4 percent in July.
When those components were stripped from the index, the core C.P.I. showed that prices rose in August at the same rate as in July, 0.2 percent. That was in line with analysts' forecasts in a survey compiled by Bloomberg News.
On a year-over-year basis, the core C.P.I. was up 2 percent in August compared with 1.8 percent in July.
Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist and now chief economist at Nationwide, said that the August C.P.I. number was consistent with expectations set earlier by such things as automobile prices, which were basically flat in August.
"Those pockets of weakness were in areas already expected and known," he said.
Of more importance to investors were events in the European debt crisis and speculation as to what Federal Reserve policy makers would say after a meeting next week, Mr. Ballew said. Although the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, has given no sign that there would be fresh stimulus measures, market watchers were weighing the possibility of any measures that would promote the economic recovery in the United States.
With the year-over-year core C.P.I. at 2 percent, it was bumping up against the top limit of the Fed's unofficial target rate. But the Fed also relies on another closely watched measure of inflation, the price index for personal consumption expenditures, which was up 1.6 percent in the 12 months that ended in July, the latest government data shows.
"It definitely gives him room under the ceiling, if they want to ease policy," said Kevin Logan, senior economist at HSBC. One such move would be for the Fed to shift bonds in its portfolio to bring down longer-term interest rates. But the central bank cannot raise rates, Mr. Rankin of PNC Bank said, because it would slow economic activity.
In addition, the latest figures show that inflation is set to outpace wage growth, which would be a "significant blow" to potential economic growth because 70 percent of the economy is based on consumer spending, Mr. Rankin said.
"Even those with jobs are not able to put that money back into the economy in a way that would create jobs," he said. "Now we are getting to the point with this inflation number, even those with jobs are less capable of driving economic activity."
Steve Blitz, the senior economist for ITG Investment Research, also said that the latest data did not add any impetus to notions that the Fed would respond with policy action at its meeting on Sept. 20-21.
"I think because of the headline number and all of the conservative politics behind it, this certainly does not give Bernanke any cover towards doing anything big," Mr. Blitz said. "The only thing that is going to give him the cover is what is going on in Europe."
Mr. Blitz said the C.P.I. data reflected more of a shift in prices rather than inflation, because there was no accompanying rise in wages, and some elements of the data suggest the possibility of future economic activity in specific sectors as capital is directed more efficiently.
For example, rents are a factor pushing the index higher, Mr. Blitz said, but that could be positive for the economy if it continues because it can spur construction in multifamily homes and rental housing.
In addition, a weaker dollar is also pushing up the C.P.I., which means imported goods are more expensive. Domestic producers might see an opening to compete with imported products.
"Here what you have is an interesting mix of price signals that could very well help growth going forward," Mr. Blitz said.
A weekly report from the Labor Department showed that for the second consecutive week, initial claims for jobless benefits rose, increasing by 11,000 in the week ended Sept. 10 to 428,000. That was up from the previous week's 417,000, which was revised up from 414,000.
Economists generally take any level over 400,000 as a continued sign of weakness in the labor market.
In addition, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production increased 0.2 percent in August after having advanced 0.9 percent in July.
Total industrial production for August was 3.4 percent above its level of a year ago, the Fed said.

Full text: The more banks a country has, the less political power they have.
At least that is the way it seems to be shaking out as countries develop new rules on bank capital.
In countries where the financial sector is not an overwhelming presence in the economy, banks seem to be faring better in their lobbying efforts to keep rules relatively gentle.
But the toughest rules in Europe seem to be coming in Britain and Switzerland, the two countries with the largest financial sectors -- relative to the size of their economies -- left in the world.
That attitude is in sharp contrast to the one that seems to prevail in much of continental Europe. There, regulators seem to be trying to water down at least some of the Basel III standards adopted around the world; France in particular seems to have encouraged its banks to minimize write-offs on Greek debt. Many European banks missed a chance to recapitalize before the sovereign debt mess made that impossible, at least for now. They are hoping to muddle through.
In the United States, which has the largest financial sector but also a huge economy, the picture is not as clear. But it appears regulators are well on the way to much stricter capital rules for all banks, and even harsher rules for the biggest banks.
If that is the way it ends up, it will be a complete reversal of the picture before the financial disaster of 2008.
Then Britain boasted of its "light touch" regulation, an attitude that was said to contrast with the enforcement approach prevalent in the United States. The American financial sector was mounting a big deregulation campaign, saying American institutions were at an international disadvantage that was hurting the United States by moving financial activity to other countries.
Then came the Lehman Brothers collapse.
Countries felt forced to bail out their banks. It was a manageable burden for the United States, but it was a closer call for Britain. The real casualties were Ireland and Iceland, which had seemed to prosper because of rapidly growing financial industries. Basically, the banks bankrupted the countries.
In Britain this week, a commission appointed to set new banking rules issued its final report, which was endorsed by the government and seems likely to go into effect. The new rules seek to "ring fence" really important banking activities to protect them from losses elsewhere in the enterprise, and they set capital standards that seem to be higher than those mandated in the new Basel III rules. In some ways, the reasons the banks needed help in 2008 are less important than the reasons the failures threatened to be so devastating. Those particular mistakes will not be made again anytime soon, and probably not at all. We won't see Triple-A mortgage-backed securities where no one took the trouble to review the mortgages before the paper was sold.
But one of these days many banks will make some big mistake, and they are likely to do it in a group. That was true of the loans to Latin American countries that precipitated the crisis of 20 years ago, and it was true of foolish real estate lending decades before that.
It would be nice if regulators could prevent those huge errors without also preventing banks from taking reasonable risks. But that will not be easy, and we should not have a financial system dependent on regulator wisdom.
The British commission, led by Sir John Vickers, an Oxford economist, instead calls for a system that will not be a public disaster if the banks do blow it again. That is one of the crucial points to be considered in reviewing regulatory approaches.
The commission does a good job of laying out what failed. First, the banks had too little equity capital in relation to the risks they were running. All those equity percentages that banks brag about are ratios of capital to "risk-weighted assets," not overall assets. That makes sense in principle, but assets deemed to be low risk -- like AAA mortgage securities -- turned out to be high risk.
As the Vickers commission put it, "the supposed 'risk weights' turned out to be unreliable measures of risk: they were going down when risk was in fact going up."
Banks also had borrowed money. If an industrial company goes broke, the lenders suffer, and that presumably leads them to be careful in making loans. But that did not happen to bank bond holders. In the words of the Vickers commission, "banks' debt proved poor at absorbing losses. Debt holders might have borne substantial losses in insolvency, but fears of the wider consequences of insolvency -- not only interruptions to ordinary banking services, but also contagion to other banks and disruption of financial markets more generally -- forced governments to make taxpayers bear the contingent liabilities of bank failures."
In the future, ways must be found to make those lenders take losses, without at the same time causing lenders to be unwilling to lend money to banks. That is not going to be easy -- as Europe has learned from its effort to force private lenders to bear part of the cost of rescuing Greece -- but it is critical.
To force bondholders to feel the pain requires a credible willingness to allow an institution to fail. The United States is trying to come up with "living wills" to allow big banks to fail without threatening the system. It would be wonderful if that worked, but in the meantime the answer seems to be to force the important players -- called SIFIs in the jargon, for systemically important financial institutions, to hold more capital. That has some big banks furious.
They are also angry at little details in the Basel rules, like how to treat financial instruments more popular in one country than another. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, created a stir by telling The Financial Times that some Basel provisions were "blatantly anti-American." He also allowed that some rules were anti-European, but that got less attention.
In an interview, Mr. Dimon also voiced concern that some regulations were encouraging what amounted to "new shadow banks" that would compete with banks without facing either comparable rules or capital requirements. He cited mortgage real estate investment trusts, which lend money to real estate developers, as an example.
As a group, the big global banks are trying to reduce regulation, warning that they need looser rules to resume lending. "The balance of risks has clearly shifted," said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, a trade group. He wants more leverage, not less, and says the Group of 20 nations should step in to cut through regulations in the name of economic growth.
The Vickers commission report has a response to that argument: "Reduced bank leverage is not detrimental to economic growth in the medium term. The inflation of leverage in the past decade led to recession, not growth. Earlier decades saw growth without high leverage."
In the end, the answer may simply be that some financial activities should be conducted by companies that do not have the advantage of deposit insurance and implied government backing -- and whose failure would not leave taxpayers holding the bag. The Volcker rule in the United States -- barring so-called proprietary trading -- is one such effort, although defining just what is not allowed is far from easy. The Vickers proposal to ring-fence banks is another. The parent company could still be in more risky businesses, but with a separate board and separate capital the bank would be protected if the holding company got into trouble through other activities.
It will be interesting to see how the "level playing field" arguments play out, with bankers in every country worried that other bankers are being treated more leniently and thus may be at a competitive advantage. There will be threats that financial activities -- and jobs -- will move to other countries.
Such arguments used to work very well. But now regulators in the countries most at risk -- the ones with the largest financial sectors -- have good reason to stick to their guns. If they forget, a tour of Iceland and Ireland might help them to remember.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Worried that Europe's debt impasse posed a growing threat to the global financial system, the world's major central banks moved Thursday to assure that European banks would not run short of cash as troubled nations like Greece and Italy sought to stabilize their economies.
The central banks, in a coordinated action intended to restore market confidence, agreed to pump United States dollars into the European banking system in the first such show of force in more than a year. Some banks have found it hard to borrow dollars as American lenders grew nervous about their financial condition.
Thursday's action, coming almost exactly three years after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, lifted global stock markets, sharply increasing the value of shares in banks heavily exposed to debt from Greece and the other struggling members of the euro zone. The euro, which had been falling in recent days, rebounded.
The central bank action came as European finance ministers and other policy makers were gathering in Wroclaw, Poland, for meetings on Friday and Saturday. The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who was scheduled to attend, was expected to urge European officials to act more aggressively to contain the sovereign debt crisis, which has already begun to undercut growth in Europe.
While the move will relieve some pressure on troubled banks, it does not address the underlying problems that made it difficult for the banks to borrow dollars on their own.
The central banks seemed determined to demonstrate that they would not hesitate to deploy their combined weight to keep the crisis from leading to a collapse of the euro zone.
"They are getting together and acting together," Christine Lagarde, the president of the International Monetary Fund, said in Washington on Thursday. "To me, that is the most important message."
But Ms. Lagarde also warned that policy makers had not done enough and suggested more action was needed. "We have entered into a dangerous phase of the crisis," she said. There is still a path to recovery, she said, but it is "a narrow one."
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, called the move "a clear illustration of our very close cooperation at the global level." Noting that the collapse of Lehman three years ago could have provoked a depression, Mr. Trichet said, "We still have a long way to go to move beyond this crisis."
The European Central Bank said it would allow banks to borrow dollars for up to three months, instead of just for one week as before, giving them breathing room for the rest of the year. The E.C.B. said it was acting in cooperation with the Federal Reserve of the United States, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank.
In recent days some European banks have faced difficulties in borrowing dollars, whether from other banks or from money market funds in the United States. There was fear that if they could not borrow dollars, they would be forced to cut off loans to American companies or sell dollar-denominated assets, perhaps forcing prices down in already unsteady markets.
The move was possible under deals between the central banks that were already in existence, and the Fed saw no need to make an announcement on Thursday.
While there now is more certainty that banks will have access to funds, deeper issues remain unresolved, including whether they have enough capital to withstand a possible default by Greece on its government debt.
An official forecast warned Thursday that growth in Europe would come "to a virtual standstill" toward the end of the year. It predicted, though, that Europe would just barely avoid a double-dip recession.
The euro system, established in 1999, created a common currency for 11 countries, a number that has grown to more than 20. But it did not unify national finances. Over time, inflation and a failure to reform labor markets left most countries in the group uncompetitive with Germany but unable to regain competitiveness through devaluation.
That is a problem that some say Europe has yet to deal with.
"The lesson of 2008 and earlier crises is that the later you act, the more you have to do, and the more painful it becomes," said Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, in a speech Wednesday. "It is not responsible for the euro zone to pledge fealty to a monetary union without facing up to either a fiscal union that would make monetary union workable or accepting the consequences for uncompetitive, debt-burdened members."
Analysts said they expected Mr. Geithner to press European ministers in Wroclaw to increase the resources available to their bailout fund for the euro zone countries. But even the expansion of the fund to 440 billion euros ($611 billion), agreed to in July, has yet to be ratified. There is some worry that countries guaranteeing the bailout fund might themselves face doubts about their own credit.
"Part of the problem for policy makers is that they are still waiting for last big initiative to get off the ground," said Peter Westaway, chief European economist in London for Nomura. "We're all kind of on hold until then."
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said Thursday during a visit to the Frankfurt Motor Show that her nation has "a duty and responsibility to make its contribution to securing the euro's future." But she added, stabilizing the euro area "won't happen overnight or with any one-time thunderbolt."
United States money market funds and other institutions have cut European banks' access to about $700 million in short-term loans over the last year, according to research by JPMorgan Chase and CreditSights.
European banks have only rarely used an existing one-week dollar credit line offered by the E.C.B. On Thursday, two banks borrowed $575 million from the facility. The E.C.B. does not disclose the identity of the borrowers. The two banks were the first to tap the dollar credit line since August.
By making dollars available for a longer three-month period, the central banks are providing reassurance that ailing banks will not be dependent on the more fragile one-week funding. The E.C.B. will offer the dollars in three operations, starting on Oct. 14 and again in November and December. The other central banks will follow similar schedules. The Fed will not offer loans directly, but will provide dollars to the E.C.B. by way of a swap agreement. The borrowing banks must supply collateral in the form of bonds or other securities.

Full text: BY now, you may have accepted, with grim reluctance, that you must delay taking your retirement benefits.
But even if you're looking at diminished balances from persistent market volatility, the news isn't all that dour. Planning a two-step retirement will actually bolster your total retirement income.
The best part of such a plan is that the longer you wait to collect Social Security, the higher the lifetime benefit. Once you retire, your monthly benefit will normally increase with annual inflation adjustments (except for in 2009 and 2010).
The earliest you can collect Social Security is age 62, and the highest-possible benefit comes at age 70. The Social Security Administration provides an incentive to wait, reducing the retirement benefit by as much as 30 percent at 62 (compared with "normal" retirement age) and incrementally increasing it the longer you wait.
Since the government will pay you a "delayed retirement credit" in the form of a higher monthly payment for each year you defer collecting benefits, you'll need to use its calculator to plot the best strategy. The step-up in annual payments depends on when you were born, starting at 3 percent (for people born from 1917 to 1924) and increasing to 8 percent (for those born in 1943 and later).
When you take Social Security, of course, depends upon your health, additional savings and debt situation.
"You have to look at your health and financial resources first," said Gary Gilgen, a certified financial planner with Rehmann Financial in Troy, Mich. "If your health is poor, it makes sense to draw out Social Security at younger ages. Managing debt is another concern."
What if you can afford to wait to collect Social Security? The second leg of the strategy is to fill the income gap until your government benefits begin. You can start withdrawing money from other savings, and you could also generate immediate cash by buying an fixed annuity from an insurance company that guarantees monthly payments.
Most defined-benefit retirement plans, if you're lucky enough to have one, include a feature that will pay out a fixed annuity benefit. If you have a defined-contribution plan like a 401(k), you'll have to take a lump sum from your plan and buy the annuity on your own.
In a study looking at household total net wealth from $349,000 to $1.5 million, the Government Accountability Office found that "delaying Social Security payments and buying an annuity" maximizes retirement income for nearly every income group. The one situation in which it did not was when one spouse was in poor health, in which case taking early Social Security benefits was recommended.
"Some people may be inclined to want more guaranteed income," said Christine Fahlund, a financial planner with T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company. "There isn't one best answer because people may have different goals."
In one retirement model she prepared, Ms. Fahlund showed that if a couple with $100,000 in combined preretirement income and $500,000 in investable assets each took Social Security at 67 and combined annuity income for the first five years with savings withdrawals, it would wind up with $1.76 million in lifetime income -- if both partners lived to be 95. About 80 percent of this income would be guaranteed.
Which asset you draw down first -- savings, Social Security or annuities -- affects your total income over time. You also have to consider risk and return. Ms. Fahlund's assumptions are based on guaranteed, five-year fixed-rate annuities, which are paying in the low single digits these days, and a balanced mutual fund (55 percent in stocks, 45 percent in bonds) averaging 7 percent in annual growth.
When you buy an annuity, make sure that the issuer is a top-rated insurer. Ratings are provided by companies like A.M. Best and Weiss. The higher the letter grade, the better the financial health of the company.
And keep in mind that annuities have no federal guarantees; they are generally covered by weaker state guarantee funds.
You can take on more risk with a variable annuity indexed to the stock market, but the return is not guaranteed, and income won't be either, unless you pay for a costly rider that will lock in a certain withdrawal benefit. And Congress is continuing to discuss reductions of Social Security benefits and raising the retirement age to receive benefits, so keep an eye on that as well.
To make this strategy work, you'll have to customize it. What if you want more guaranteed income at a younger age? What if you're single? What if you or your spouse's health suddenly declines? And factor in the tax considerations, because nearly all retirement withdrawals and annuity income are subject to federal and state income taxes.
At the least, you'll need to be flexible. If you don't want to do it yourself, get help from an adviser -- one who does not receive a commission on products clients buy. Consider working with a certified, fee-only financial planner to devise the optimal plan.
The stock markets are volatile. Interest rates are extremely low. The economic outlook in the United States and abroad is uncertain. And proposals are circulating in Washington to make changes to Social Security and to Medicare. It is a stressful time to contemplate retirement and what income (and expenses) await.

Full text: JUST as you caught your breath after the stock market mayhem of 2008 and 2009, it has become increasingly clear that this ride isn't over just yet.
This is particularly worrisome for people who are nearing retirement, as well as those who have already left the work world, many of whom are probably spending a fair bit of time wondering if the world markets have suddenly become a riskier place.
When you need to begin withdrawing savings, the stock market valleys can appear deeper and more turbulent than the ones you experienced earlier in your career because there is often little time to recoup your losses.
"What changes, and very radically, is risk perception," said Dave Yeske, a financial planner in San Francisco. "The scariness of short-term volatility disproportionately blinds us to the long-term scariness of inflation," he added, saying that the recent inflation rate of 3.6 percent would erode your purchasing power by half in 20 years.
The latest bout of volatility is no exception. The summer was punctuated by rounds of dysfunctional politicking and then, on Aug. 5, the unprecedented downgrade of the United States credit rating. Concerns about a double-dip recession continue to linger, while the debt crisis in Europe is another wild card.
Not surprisingly, the markets reacted. Look at a stock chart during the week after the downgrade: the zigs and zags form a distinct W, which took shape when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index plummeted nearly 7 percent, and then, in the days following, rose about 4.7 percent, gave up 4.4 percent, then rose 4.6 percent once again.
Further market gyrations are inevitable. So to protect your portfolio from yet another risk -- your emotional impulses-- during these unsettling times, you might consider reassessing whether your money is invested in a way that you can truly handle for the long haul. Start by trying to answer these questions:
HOW MUCH RISK CAN I TOLERATE? Though the most recent downturns are painful, they have served a purpose. "It did provide a nice stress test for investors," said Fran Kinniry, a principal at Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group.
How did you do? Were you able to ride out the crash in 2008 and 2009 (or perhaps even the debt ceiling debate) without touching your investments -- or did you fold and go to cash? If it's the latter, then you were invested too aggressively, experts said.
"If they were at 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds going into the bear market, and sold during the downturn, then that is above their tolerance for risk and they shouldn't go back to the level," said Rick Ferri, author of "All About Asset Allocation" and founder of the money management firm Portfolio Solutions. "Perhaps 50-50 or 40-60 is more appropriate, that is if they need to take that much risk based on their situation."
At financial planning firms across the country, advisers have been re-evaluating their clients' stomach for volatility. "We moved a lot of our retirees that exhibited lower risk tolerance during the last crash to lower equity exposures once the recovery was well under way," said Rick Kahler, a financial planner in Rapid City, S.D. "In the last year, many wanted to return to their previous portfolio that had the higher equity exposure, and we discouraged them."
That sort of flip-flopping can be attributed to a behavioral phenomenon known as recency bias -- the tendency of investors to weigh recent events more heavily than those in the past.
Though advisers say that many of the risk tolerance questionnaires available on the Web are an overly simplistic gauge, many of them use FinaMetrica, a 25-question tool that combines psychology and statistics and generates an investor risk profile illustrating where they stand relative to others. While it is geared for advisers (and costs $45 for consumers), it could prove to be an educational exercise, or serve as a conversation starter for couples with different outlooks.
HOW MUCH STOCK DO I NEED? The amount of stock funds you can tolerate may not necessarily match what's recommended to reach your retirement goals. (But you generally want to take as little risk as you need to reach those goals.) The optimal allocations will vary depending on your specific circumstances and how much money you need to withdraw for annual expenses not covered by Social Security, pensions and other income sources. Because retirement does not come with a do-over option, it often pays to visit a certified financial planner, particularly one that charges an hourly rate or a flat fee, to help you sort this out.
Still, even among investment professionals, the recommended allocations tend to differ. Consider the varying allocations of target-date funds -- whose investment mix becomes more conservative as you age -- for people who recently retired or are nearing retirement.
Schwab's Target 2010 fund, for example, holds slightly more than 38 percent in domestic and foreign stocks, while Vanguard's 2010 target-date fund is nearly 46 percent in stocks. Fidelity's Freedom 2010 has 47 percent, and T. Rowe Price's Retirement 2010 fund has 53 percent. Meanwhile, a Vanguard fund for people who have already retired or are over the age of 69 has a stock allocation of 30 percent.
Mr. Ferri, the author and money manager, suggests some investment mixes in his book that could serve as a starting point. For example, a person who is about three to five years from retirement and has a moderate tolerance for risk may consider a diversified portfolio evenly split between stocks and bonds, he said, while a conservative investor may keep only 30 percent of the portfolio in stocks.
Once retired, moderate investors may dial down their stock allocation to 40 percent, Mr. Ferri said, while more aggressive investors may still decide to keep 60 percent in stocks. "These examples probably cover 80 percent of retirees," he said. "There are some people who can and should be more aggressive, and those that should be more conservative. It all depends how much they have saved and whether that's enough, or if they have much more than enough and are really investing for someone else."
HOW MUCH SHOULD I HAVE IN CASH? People nearing or in retirement might consider setting aside anywhere from one to five years of their expenses in a safe and cashlike account, experts said. This may help you rest easier since you know that your immediate needs will be met.
Alan Moore, a financial planner at Kahler Financial Group in Rapid City, S.D., said some investors did not like seeing a sizable chunk of money sitting on the sidelines, but he called it market insurance. "We set up direct deposits into their checking account for their monthly expenses," he said, "and each year we replenish the cash reserve." If the market is on the decline, and a retiree isn't comfortable selling, they wait.
AM I KEEPING MY RISK LEVEL IN CHECK? Over time, market swings will inevitably throw your portfolio out of balance, so you need to establish a strategy to periodically recalibrate your investment back to your targets. For most investors, it usually makes sense to rebalance either annually or semiannually, when a particular investment category -- say, large-cap stocks or bonds -- deviates about five percentage points from your target, according to a study by Vanguard based on historical market returns.
It's a counterintuitive strategy: you are generally selling your winning investments and buying the laggards. The study, however, found that investors who rebalanced after big market drops had typically been rewarded over the long term. Increasing your stock allocation (especially when stocks are cheap) can position you for an eventual rebound, which can help returns over time. But at its core, rebalancing is not about maximizing your returns.
"Rebalancing is about maintaining risk tolerance and objectives of the portfolio," Mr. Kinniry said. "What we do know is that over long holding periods, the portfolios that are allowed to drift have slightly higher returns, as expected, as the average equity position is larger. But it has significantly more risk."
AM I FOCUSING ON THE BIG PICTURE? This is admittedly hard to do during periods of uncertainty. But consider the recent performance of a diversified portfolio. Since the market peaked in October 2007, a portfolio split evenly between stocks and bonds had a cumulative return of 5.9 percent through Sept. 6, while a portfolio with 30 percent stocks and 70 percent bonds had a cumulative return of 15.8 percent. An all-stock portfolio, meanwhile, lost 18.9 percent over the same period, according to calculations by Vanguard.
Rewind 30 years, and the same evenly split portfolio returned an annualized 10.3 percent from July 31, 1981, through the same date this year, while the 30 percent stock portfolio earned 9.9 percent, and the 100 percent stock portfolio yielded 10.9 percent annualized.
WHAT'S MY CONTINGENCY PLAN? If your retirement date happens to coincide with a significant market downturn, it can do long-term damage to your plan because the money you withdraw will not be invested for a potential recovery. "A person considering retirement should determine how much of a contraction he or she could withstand and still be able to meet their retirement spending goals," said Troy Sapp, a financial planner at Commencement Financial Planning in Tacoma, Wash.
For Chris Gruber, a 63-year-old research psychologist in Long Beach, Calif., and his wife, Diane, a retired surgeon, the market swings have underscored their need to remain flexible. The couple finished paying off their son's college bills and her medical debt a little more than a decade ago.
They saved aggressively in the years that followed, and they both planned to work part-time for a year or so after they gave up their full-time positions. But when his wife's retirement date rolled around two and a half years ago, he said her employer eliminated many part-time slots -- just as the market crashed.
"My wife and I say we chose the worst time in 75 years to retire," he said.
Fortunately, his part-time prospects were much better, and he discovered that he enjoyed working part time, especially because he was able to give up many administrative duties. But in light of the market swings, he said they've already done some belt-tightening.
His wife's pension and their Social Security will cover about 60 percent of their annual expenses once they're fully retired, with the remainder coming from their savings, which is largely invested in stock funds. "On any given day, I can tell you how much I have over my nut to spend," said Mr. Gruber, who has created a spreadsheet tracking how close their funds match their spending goals. Right now, they're about 30 percent below their targets, which is well below his comfort zone.
"I manage my risk by readjusting what I can do for the rest of my life," he said. The couple's goal was to keep their four-bedroom ranch for 10 years, but now they may stay only five, which will allow them to spend more time in Colorado, where they have an apartment near their son's family. "We are willing to downsize as it becomes necessary."

Abstract: Ned Davis Research found recently that through June 30, dividend payers in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of large-company stocks outperformed nondividend stocks. Since 1972, the dividend payers returned 8.92 percent on average, compared with 1.83 percent for nondividend stocks.

Full text: DESPITE the gyrations in the stock market this year, one sweet spot has been dividends. These cash payments from mature, profitable companies have been a welcome addition to retirement portfolios.
Dividends strengthen income and provide a bulwark against global economic problems that roil securities prices from New York to Hong Kong. The key to building a dividend-rich portfolio, whether you buy individual stocks, mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, is to find companies that will pay consistently and increase their payments over time. This dividend growth strategy can partly offset inflation and dismal savings rates. Many dividend yields are three times or more what you'll find in insured vehicles like money market accounts or certificates of deposit, albeit with some market risk.
Investors can do this research themselves. Almost every company posts its dividend history on its Web site, somewhere under "investor relations." The information may also be on Yahoo Finance and Morningstar.com.
Over time, this strategy has rewarded long-term investors. In a notable study by Robert D. Arnott, then the editor of The Financial Analysts Journal, dividends contributed five percentage points of the 7.9 percent total return in holding stocks from 1802 through 2002.
More recent experience shows an even more important role for dividends. They contribute to total return and reduced exposure to risk. Ned Davis Research found recently that through June 30, dividend payers in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of large-company stocks outperformed nondividend stocks. Since 1972, the dividend payers returned 8.92 percent on average, compared with 1.83 percent for nondividend stocks.
The dividend payers are also less volatile, nearly nine percentage points lower in standard deviation for those companies paying dividends and almost a percentage point lower than the entire S.& P. 500.
Many of the steadiest dividend payers have been paying for decades. The 3M Company, for example, has paid for 59 consecutive years.
"Dividend growth stocks that raise payments every year fly under the radar," said Dave Van Knapp of sensiblestocks.com, author of "The Top 40 Dividend Growth Stocks." He said the market's recent hypervolatility had only reinforced the dividend strategy.
When building a portfolio, you can assemble it one stock at a time or buy exchange-traded funds, pools of securities that trade on stock exchanges.
Many mature companies that offer dividends reward investors with no- or low-fee purchase plans and dividend reinvestment plans, known as DRIPs. Still, if you're building a portfolio with individual stocks, you'll need to buy a variety of companies to avoid concentrating too much in a particular industry, like utilities or health care. You'll also need to pay attention to whether high dividends are sustainable, whether share prices are too dear and whether the company is stable.
Charles B. Carlson, whose Horizon Publishing has specialized in dividend selection for decades, said a "reasonably diverse portfolio should consist of 25 to 30 stocks" from different industries. Horizon's stock-picking system employs about 80 variables to a universe of 4,000 stocks to find the most consistent payers and growth prospects.
If you're not a stock picker, consider exchange-traded funds like the SPDR Dividend (SDY), which invests in a pool of top dividend payers; the Vanguard High-Yield Dividend Index (VYM); or the Dividend Appreciation Index (VIG). Managers will be constantly monitoring the market and selecting the best stocks.
Of course, with your own portfolio, you control which stocks are chosen and their tax consequences. Unless you sell shares, you don't generate any capital gains taxes. And if held within an Individual Retirement Account or other plan with a brokerage window, all taxes can be deferred until you take withdrawals.
No matter which dividend vehicle you choose, keep in mind that you have to monitor your investment, because even companies perceived as secure can suspend their dividends or depreciate quickly -- BP, for example, after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and financial stocks after the 2008 crisis. There's always market risk in holding stocks, and even more risk if you try to time your purchases around market movements.
"This is a buy-and-hold strategy," Mr. Van Knapp said, "not a buy-and-forget strategy."
The stock markets are volatile. Interest rates are extremely low. The economic outlook in the United States and abroad is uncertain. And proposals are circulating in Washington to make changes to Social Security and to Medicare. It is a stressful time to contemplate retirement and what income (and expenses) await.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
BEIJING -- In the name of fighting pollution, China has sent the price of compact fluorescent light bulbs soaring in the United States.
By closing or nationalizing dozens of the producers of rare earth metals -- which are used in energy-efficient bulbs and many other green-energy products -- China is temporarily shutting down most of the industry and crimping the global supply of the vital resources.
China produces nearly 95 percent of the world's rare earth materials, and it is taking the steps to improve pollution controls in a notoriously toxic mining and processing industry. But the moves also have potential international trade implications and have started yet another round of price increases for rare earths, which are vital for green-energy products including giant wind turbines, hybrid gasoline-electric cars and compact fluorescent bulbs.
General Electric, facing complaints in the United States about rising prices for its compact fluorescent bulbs, recently noted in a statement that if the rate of inflation over the last 12 months on the rare earth element europium oxide had been applied to a $2 cup of coffee, that coffee would now cost $24.55.
A pack of three 11-watt G.E. compact fluorescent bulbs -- each the lighting equivalent of a 40-watt incandescent bulb -- was priced on Thursday at $15.88 on Wal-Mart's Web site for pickup in a Nashville, Ark., store. The average price for fluorescent bulbs has risen 37 percent this year, according to the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.
Wal-Mart, which has made a big push for compact fluorescent bulbs, acknowledged that it needed to raise prices on some brands lately. "Obviously we don't want to pass along price increases to our customers, but occasionally market conditions require it," Tara Raddohl, a spokeswoman, said. The Chinese actions on rare earths were a prime topic of conversation at a conference here on Thursday that was organized by Metal-Pages, an industry data firm based in London.
Soaring prices are rippling through a long list of industries.
"The high cost of rare earths is having a significant chilling effect on wind turbine and electric motor production in spite of offsetting government subsidies for green tech products," said one of the conference attendees, Michael N. Silver, chairman and chief executive of American Elements, a chemical company based in Los Angeles. It supplies rare earths and other high-tech materials to businesses.
But with light bulbs, especially, the timing of the latest price increases is politically awkward for the lighting industry and for environmentalists who backed a shift to energy-efficient lighting.
In January, legislation that President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007 will begin phasing out traditional incandescent bulbs in favor of spiral compact fluorescent bulbs and other technologies. The European Union has also mandated a switch from incandescent bulbs to energy-efficient lighting.
Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota is running for the Republican presidential nomination on a platform that includes strong opposition to the new lighting rules in the United States and has been a leader of efforts by House Republicans to repeal it.
China says it has largely shut down its rare earth industry for three months to address pollution problems. By invoking environmental concerns, China could potentially try to circumvent international trade rules that are supposed to prohibit export restrictions of vital materials.
In July, the European Union said in a statement on rare earth policy that the organization supported efforts to protect the environment, but that discrimination against foreign buyers of rare earths was not allowed under World Trade Organization rules.
China has been imposing tariffs and quotas on its rare earth exports for several years, curtailing global supplies and forcing prices to rise eightfold to fortyfold during that period for the various 17 rare earth elements.
Even before this latest move by China, the United States and the European Union were preparing to file a case at the W.T.O. this winter that would challenge Chinese export taxes and export quotas on rare earths.
Chinese officials here at the conference said the government was worried about polluted water, polluted air and radioactive residues from the rare earth industry, particularly among many small and private companies, some of which operate without the proper licenses. While rare earths themselves are not radioactive, they are always found in ore containing radioactive thorium and require careful handling and processing to avoid contaminating the environment.
Most of the country's rare earth factories have been closed since early August, including those under government control, to allow for installation of pollution control equipment that must be in place by Oct. 1, executives and regulators said.
The government is determined to clean up the industry, said Xu Xu, chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce of Metals, Minerals and Chemicals Importers and Exporters, a government-controlled group that oversees the rare earth industry. "The entrepreneurs don't care about environmental problems, don't care about labor problems and don't care about their social responsibility," he said. "And now we have to educate them."
Beijing authorities are creating a single government-controlled monopoly, Bao Gang Rare Earth, to mine and process ore in northern China, the region that accounts for two-thirds of China's output. The government is ordering 31 mostly private rare earth processing companies to close this year in that region and is forcing four other companies into mergers with Bao Gang, said Li Zhong, the vice general manager of Bao Gang Rare Earth.
The government also plans to consolidate 80 percent of the production from southern China, which produces the rest of China's rare earths, into three companies within the next year or two, Mr. Li said. All three of these companies are former ministries of the Chinese government that were spun out as corporations, and the central government still owns most of the shares.
The taxes and quotas China had in place to restrict rare earth exports caused many companies to move their factories to China from the United States and Europe so that they could secure a reliable and inexpensive source of raw materials.
China promised when it joined the W.T.O. in 2001 that it would not restrict exports except for a handful of obscure materials. Rare earths were not among the exceptions.
But even if the W.T.O. orders China to dismantle its export tariffs and quotas, the industry consolidation now under way could enable China to retain tight control over exports and continue to put pressure on foreign companies to relocate to China.
The four state-owned companies might limit sales to foreign buyers, a tactic that would be hard to address through the W.T.O., Western trade officials said.
Hedge funds and other speculators have been buying and hoarding rare earths this year, with prices rising particularly quickly through early August, and dipping since then as some have sold their inventories to take profits, said Constantine Karayannopoulos, the chief executive of Neo Material Technologies, a Canadian company that is one of the largest processors in China of raw rare earths.
"The real hot money got into the industry building neodymium and europium inventories in Shanghai warehouses," he said.

Full text: European leaders have at last begun edging, haltingly and reluctantly, toward the only realistic solution to the continent's debt and banking crises: refinancing unpayable government debts and reinforcing weakened banks. If their monetary and political union is to survive, all members must start acting more like a union and less like a collection of jealous sovereign states.
Unless they quickly convince stock and bond markets that they are truly ready to stand together, Europe risks a spiral of disasters, including a Greek default and the failure of one or more major debt-weakened banks. If things get bad enough, the euro zone could fracture, and that could lead to the fracturing of the entire European Union.
The United States would not escape. A collapse in Europe would sap confidence in global markets and shrink demand for American exports when Washington is struggling to avoid a double-dip recession.
President Obama and his aides must keep their public comments upbeat to avoid further spooking the markets. But we hope that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner -- who is now on his second trip to Europe in just over a week -- is being blunt in closed-door sessions that there is no more time to waste.
What is most urgently needed is a demonstration that Europe will lend as much as necessary to debtor countries and weakened banks that find themselves shut out of private credit markets. That was supposed to be the job of a new, strengthened bailout fund, but all 17 euro zone countries must still give formal approval. For now, the lending must continue to come from the European Central Bank.
German politicians, who are happy to pocket the many benefits that Germany draws from an economically united Europe, are objecting to the rising costs. With Greece sinking, panic spreading and banks -- including German banks -- buffeted by losses from past careless lending, it is a little late for that. If Chancellor Angela Merkel means what she says about standing by the euro, she must face down these critics.
Europe also needs to rethink its demands for punitive austerity as the price for bailout loans. Athens needs to pare down its bureaucracy, improve tax collection and liberalize its labor markets. But Greece will never be able to work off its debt if its economy keeps shrinking.
What would help a lot more right now is for Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, to temporarily cut taxes. That would increase domestic demand and imports, including from Greece and other indebted countries that need to find new markets. But fearing the ghosts of long-ago inflation more than the spread of present-day depression, Germany is resisting.
A lasting solution will also require restructuring unpayable debts by writing down principal, lowering interest rates and extending maturities. Common European bonds, taking advantage of the lower interest rates available to Europe as a whole, should be part of the process.
That is more European unity than the rich northern European countries want. The truth is that nothing less will get Europe out of this mess.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The discouraging numbers spilling from the Census Bureau's poverty report this week were a disquieting reminder that a weak economy continues to spread broad and deep pain.
And so it does. But not evenly.
The Midwest is battered, but the Northeast escaped with a lighter knock. The incomes of young adults have plunged -- but those of older Americans have actually risen. On the whole, immigrants have weathered the storm a bit better than people born here. In rural areas, poverty remained unchanged last year, while in suburbs it reached the highest level since 1967, when the Census Bureau first tracked it.
Yet one old problem has not changed: the poor have rapidly gotten poorer.
The report, an annual gauge of prosperity and pain, is sure to be cited in coming months as lawmakers make difficult decisions about how to balance the competing goals of cutting deficits and preserving safety nets.
Its overall findings -- income down, poverty up -- are hardly surprising in the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Of equal interest, with fiscal knives in the air, are the looks at who has suffered the most and who has largely escaped.
"Certainly in a recession we want to put resources where they're most needed," said Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, who served as a Treasury official under Democratic and Republican presidents. "And in a recession, needs change dramatically from group to group."
Perhaps no households have weathered the downturn better than those headed by people 65 and older, whose incomes rose 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010. By contrast, household income for every other age group fell. Among people ages 15 to 24, it plunged 15.3 percent.
Partly that is because older Americans get more of their income from pensions and investments, so a job shortage hurts them less. Also, the generation now retiring has been the most prosperous in history, so as poorer Americans die off, the income of the age group grows.
Such data is likely to feed longstanding debates about generational equity, since the largest portion of safety net spending goes to those 65 and older, through Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.
"We are spending too much of our limited resources on the elderly, and not investing enough in programs for younger Americans, such as job training and education," said Isabel V. Sawhill, a budget expert at the Brookings Institution.
Another noteworthy finding comes from the suburbs, which have traditionally had the lowest rates of poverty. Suburban dwellers experienced a sharp increase toward the end of the past decade. Nearly 12 percent of them were living in poverty in 2010, the highest level ever recorded, up from just 8 percent in 2001. (The rate in cities was 19 percent, but rose less sharply.)
"There's been a suburbanization of poverty," said Alan Berube, a Brookings demographer, who cited the growth of service, retail and construction jobs that lured low-income Americans to the suburbs before the recession. "The notion of poverty being only in inner cities and isolated rural areas is increasingly out of step with reality."
Household income fell in every region of the country from 2007 to 2010. But it fell much less in the Northeast (3.1 percent) than in the South (6.3 percent), the West (6.7 percent) or the Midwest (8.4 percent). And the Northeast was the only region where household income did not fall last year.
The declines in the West have been fueled in part by the collapse of the housing industry, especially in Arizona and Nevada. And the Midwest has suffered idled factories. Its status as the hardest-hit region is likely to come into play next year as presidential candidates hunt such big Electoral College prizes as Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio.
"The big hurt has been in the manufacturing and construction industries, which were big in the Midwest and West," said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
The census findings present two competing stories of immigrants -- a reminder of just how economically diverse that group has become. From 2007 to 2010, they have fared both better and worse than the native born.
Among people born in the United States, household incomes declined 6.1 percent. Among non-citizens, the decline was steeper -- 8 percent. But for immigrants who had attained citizenship, the decline was only 3.9 percent.
That latter group may disproportionately include the highly educated professionals who increasingly fill the new Americans' ranks. A recent study by Audrey Singer, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that the number of immigrants with college degrees now exceeds those who lack a high school education.
"The high-skilled people are starting to dominate," she said
Two worrisome numbers in the report raise questions about the recent response of the safety net. Poverty has risen especially fast among single mothers. More than 40 percent of households headed by women now live in poverty, which is defined as $17,568 for a family of three.
That is the first time since 1997 that figure has been so high. Analysts attribute the rise in part to changes in the welfare system, enacted in the mid-1990s, which make cash aid much harder to get. Those changes were credited with encouraging recipients to work in good times, but may leave them with less protection when jobs disappear.
"The business cycle is going to hurt them a lot more than it used to," said Robert Moffitt, a Johns Hopkins University economist.
Poor people not only grew more numerous -- 46.2 million -- but also poorer. Among the poor, the share in deep poverty (defined as having less than half the income to escape poverty) rose to the highest level in 36 years: 44.3 percent.
The census data may overstate hardship by failing to count some benefits the needy receive, like tax credits and food stamps. But it also may also understate their needs by failing to adjust for health care expenses and variations in the cost of living.
About 20.5 million people are in deep poverty, with food stamps increasingly replacing cash aid as the safety net of last resort. More than 45 million people get food stamps, an increase of 64 percent since January 2008. About one in eight Americans, and one in four children, receives aid. Using an alternative definition of income, the Census Bureau found that food stamps lifted 3.9 million people above the poverty line.
"Given that poverty and hardship are likely to continue for some time, it's imperative that we protect the program," said Stacy Dean, an analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which aids in food stamp outreach campaigns.

Abstract: The bureau's findings were worse than many economists expected, and brought into sharp relief the toll the past decade -- including the painful declines of the financial crisis and recession --had taken on Americans at the middle and lower parts of the income ladder. According to the Census figures, the median annual income for a male full-time, year-round worker in 2010 -- $47,715 -- was virtually unchanged, in 2010 dollars, from its level in 1973, when it was $49,065, said Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- Another 2.6 million people slipped into poverty in the United States last year, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday, and the number of Americans living below the official poverty line, 46.2 million people, was the highest number in the 52 years the bureau has been publishing figures on it.
And in new signs of distress among the middle class, median household incomes fell last year to levels last seen in 1996.
Economists pointed to a telling statistic: It was the first time since the Great Depression that median household income, adjusted for inflation, had not risen over such a long period, said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.
"This is truly a lost decade," Mr. Katz said. "We think of America as a place where every generation is doing better, but we're looking at a period when the median family is in worse shape than it was in the late 1990s."
The bureau's findings were worse than many economists expected, and brought into sharp relief the toll the past decade -- including the painful declines of the financial crisis and recession --had taken on Americans at the middle and lower parts of the income ladder. It is also fresh evidence that the disappointing economic recovery has done nothing for the country's poorest citizens.
The report said the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line last year, 15.1 percent, was the highest level since 1993. (The poverty line in 2010 for a family of four was $22,314.)
The report comes as President Obama gears up to try to pass a jobs bill, and analysts said the bleak numbers could help him make his case for urgency. But they could also be used against him by Republican opponents seeking to highlight economic shortcomings on his watch.
"This is one more piece of bad news on the economy," said Ron Haskins, a director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution. "This will be another cross to bear by the administration."
The past decade was also marked by a growing gap between the very top and very bottom of the income ladder. Median household income for the bottom tenth of the income spectrum fell by 12 percent from a peak in 1999, while the top 90th percentile dropped by just 1.5 percent. Overall, median household income adjusted for inflation declined by 2.3 percent in 2010 from the previous year, to $49,445. That was 7 percent less than the peak of $53,252 in 1999. Part of the income decline over time is because of the smaller size of the American family.
This year is not likely to be any better, economists said. Stimulus money has largely ended, and state and local governments have made deep cuts to staff and to budgets for social programs, both likely to move economically fragile families closer to poverty.
Minorities were hit hardest. Blacks experienced the highest poverty rate, at 27 percent, up from 25 percent in 2009, and Hispanics rose to 26 percent from 25 percent. For whites, 9.9 percent lived in poverty, up from 9.4 percent in 2009. Asians were unchanged at 12.1 percent.
An analysis by the Brookings Institution estimated that at the current rate, the recession will have added nearly 10 million people to the ranks of the poor by the middle of the decade.
Joblessness was the main culprit pushing more Americans into poverty, economists said.
Last year, about 48 million people ages 18 to 64 did not work even one week out of the year, up from 45 million in 2009, said Trudi Renwick, a Census official.
"Once you've been out of work for a long time, it's a very difficult road to get back," Mr. Katz said.
Median income fell across all working-age categories, but was sharpest drop was among the young working Americans, ages 15 to 24, who experienced a decline of 9 percent.
According to the Census figures, the median annual income for a male full-time, year-round worker in 2010 -- $47,715 -- was virtually unchanged, in 2010 dollars, from its level in 1973, when it was $49,065, said Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.
Those who do not have college degrees were particularly hard hit, he said. "The median, full-time male worker has made no progress on average," Mr. Danziger said.
The recession has continued pushing 25-to-34-year-olds to move in with family and friends to save money. Of that group, nearly half were living below the poverty line, when their parents' incomes were excluded. The poverty level for a single person under the age of 65 was $11,344.
"We're risking a new underclass," said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
"Young, less-educated adults, mainly men, can't support their children and form stable families because they are jobless," he added.
But even the period of economic growth that came before the recession did little for the middle and bottom wage earners.
Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the period from 2001 to 2007 was the first recovery on record where the level of poverty was deeper, and median income of working-age people was lower, at the end than at the beginning.
"Even before the recession hit, a lot of people were falling behind," he said. "This may be adding to people's sense of urgency about the economy."
The suburban poverty rate, at 11.8 percent, appears to be the highest since 1967, Mr. Sherman added. Last year more Americans fell into deep poverty, defined as less than half the official poverty line, or about $11,000, with the ranks of that group increasing to 20.5 million, or about 6.7 percent of the population.
Poverty has also swallowed more children, with about 16.4 million in its ranks last year, the highest numbers since 1962, according to William Frey, senior demographer at Brookings. That means 22 percent of children are in poverty, the highest percentage since 1993.
The census figures do not count noncash assistance, like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, and economists say that as a result they tend to overstate poverty numbers for certain groups, like children. But rises in the cost of housing, medical care and energy are not taken into account, either.
The report also said the number of uninsured Americans increased by 900,000 to 49.9 million.
Those covered by employer-based insurance continued to decline in 2010, to about 55 percent, while those with government-provided coverage continued to increase, up slightly to 31 percent. Employer-based coverage was down from 65 percent in 2000, the report said.

Correction: September 15, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the rise in the poverty rate misstated the year in which the median income, which fell last year, was at a similar level. It was 1996, not 1997. The article also gave an incorrect figure for the number of people the Census Bureau found to be in poverty in the United States. The number is 46.2 million people, not 56.2 million.

Abstract: The bureau's findings were worse than many economists expected, and brought into sharp relief the toll the past decade -- including the painful declines of the financial crisis and recession --had taken on Americans at the middle and lower parts of the income ladder. According to the Census figures, the median annual income for a male full-time, year-round worker in 2010 -- $47,715 -- was virtually unchanged, in 2010 dollars, from its level in 1973, when it was $49,065, said Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- Another 2.6 million people slipped into poverty in the United States last year, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday, and the number of Americans living below the official poverty line, 46.2 million people, was the highest number in the 52 years the bureau has been publishing figures on it.
And in new signs of distress among the middle class, median household incomes fell last year to levels last seen in 1996.
Economists pointed to a telling statistic: It was the first time since the Great Depression that median household income, adjusted for inflation, had not risen over such a long period, said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard.
"This is truly a lost decade," Mr. Katz said. "We think of America as a place where every generation is doing better, but we're looking at a period when the median family is in worse shape than it was in the late 1990s."
The bureau's findings were worse than many economists expected, and brought into sharp relief the toll the past decade -- including the painful declines of the financial crisis and recession --had taken on Americans at the middle and lower parts of the income ladder. It is also fresh evidence that the disappointing economic recovery has done nothing for the country's poorest citizens.
The report said the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line last year, 15.1 percent, was the highest level since 1993. (The poverty line in 2010 for a family of four was $22,314.)
The report comes as President Obama gears up to try to pass a jobs bill, and analysts said the bleak numbers could help him make his case for urgency. But they could also be used against him by Republican opponents seeking to highlight economic shortcomings on his watch.
"This is one more piece of bad news on the economy," said Ron Haskins, a director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution. "This will be another cross to bear by the administration."
The past decade was also marked by a growing gap between the very top and very bottom of the income ladder. Median household income for the bottom tenth of the income spectrum fell by 12 percent from a peak in 1999, while the top 90th percentile dropped by just 1.5 percent. Overall, median household income adjusted for inflation declined by 2.3 percent in 2010 from the previous year, to $49,445. That was 7 percent less than the peak of $53,252 in 1999. Part of the income decline over time is because of the smaller size of the American family.
This year is not likely to be any better, economists said. Stimulus money has largely ended, and state and local governments have made deep cuts to staff and to budgets for social programs, both likely to move economically fragile families closer to poverty.
Minorities were hit hardest. Blacks experienced the highest poverty rate, at 27 percent, up from 25 percent in 2009, and Hispanics rose to 26 percent from 25 percent. For whites, 9.9 percent lived in poverty, up from 9.4 percent in 2009. Asians were unchanged at 12.1 percent.
An analysis by the Brookings Institution estimated that at the current rate, the recession will have added nearly 10 million people to the ranks of the poor by the middle of the decade.
Joblessness was the main culprit pushing more Americans into poverty, economists said.
Last year, about 48 million people ages 18 to 64 did not work even one week out of the year, up from 45 million in 2009, said Trudi Renwick, a Census official.
"Once you've been out of work for a long time, it's a very difficult road to get back," Mr. Katz said.
Median income fell across all working-age categories, but was sharpest drop was among the young working Americans, ages 15 to 24, who experienced a decline of 9 percent.
According to the Census figures, the median annual income for a male full-time, year-round worker in 2010 -- $47,715 -- was virtually unchanged, in 2010 dollars, from its level in 1973, when it was $49,065, said Sheldon Danziger, professor of public policy at the University of Michigan.
Those who do not have college degrees were particularly hard hit, he said. "The median, full-time male worker has made no progress on average," Mr. Danziger said.
The recession has continued pushing 25-to-34-year-olds to move in with family and friends to save money. Of that group, nearly half were living below the poverty line, when their parents' incomes were excluded. The poverty level for a single person under the age of 65 was $11,344.
"We're risking a new underclass," said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research and Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
"Young, less-educated adults, mainly men, can't support their children and form stable families because they are jobless," he added.
But even the period of economic growth that came before the recession did little for the middle and bottom wage earners.
Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the period from 2001 to 2007 was the first recovery on record where the level of poverty was deeper, and median income of working-age people was lower, at the end than at the beginning.
"Even before the recession hit, a lot of people were falling behind," he said. "This may be adding to people's sense of urgency about the economy."
The suburban poverty rate, at 11.8 percent, appears to be the highest since 1967, Mr. Sherman added. Last year more Americans fell into deep poverty, defined as less than half the official poverty line, or about $11,000, with the ranks of that group increasing to 20.5 million, or about 6.7 percent of the population.
Poverty has also swallowed more children, with about 16.4 million in its ranks last year, the highest numbers since 1962, according to William Frey, senior demographer at Brookings. That means 22 percent of children are in poverty, the highest percentage since 1993.
The census figures do not count noncash assistance, like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, and economists say that as a result they tend to overstate poverty numbers for certain groups, like children. But rises in the cost of housing, medical care and energy are not taken into account, either.
The report also said the number of uninsured Americans increased by 900,000 to 49.9 million.
Those covered by employer-based insurance continued to decline in 2010, to about 55 percent, while those with government-provided coverage continued to increase, up slightly to 31 percent. Employer-based coverage was down from 65 percent in 2000, the report said.
Correction: September 15, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the rise in the poverty rate misstated the year in which the median income, which fell last year, was at a similar level. It was 1996, not 1997. The article also gave an incorrect figure for the number of people the Census Bureau found to be in poverty in the United States. The number is 46.2 million people, not 56.2 million.
Chart Falling Income, Higher Poverty Rate: The Median Household Income Adjusted for Inflation Fell to $49,445 in 2010, a 7 Percent Decrease From a Peak in 1999. The Last Time American Households Earned Less Than a Median of $50,000 Was in 1996. (Source: Census Bureau) (A21)

Abstract: Three of them were identified by the Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction commission: reforming Social Security and Medicare by increasing ages of eligibility and shifting to an appropriate formula for indexing benefits to inflation; phasing out "tax expenditures" like the deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and employer-provided health care; and lowering the marginal income-tax rates for individuals.

Full text: Robert Barro is a professor of economics at Harvard University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Cambridge, Mass.
THE United States is in the third year of a grand experiment by the Obama administration to revive the economy through enormous borrowing and spending by the government, with the Federal Reserve playing a supporting role by keeping interest rates at record lows.
How is the experiment going? By the looks of it, not well.
The economy is growing much more slowly than in a typical recovery, housing prices remain depressed and the stock market has been in a slump -- all troubling indicators that another recession may be on the way. Most worrisome is the anemic state of the labor market, underscored by the zero growth in the latest jobs report.
The poor results should not surprise us given the macroeconomic policies the government has pursued. I agree that the recession warranted fiscal deficits in 2008-10, but the vast increase of public debt since 2007 and the uncertainty about the country's long-run fiscal path mean that we no longer have the luxury of combating the weak economy with more deficits.
Today's priority has to be austerity, not stimulus, and it will not work to announce a new $450 billion jobs plan while promising vaguely to pay for it with fiscal restraint over the next 10 years, as Mr. Obama did in his address to Congress on Thursday. Given the low level of government credibility, fiscal discipline has to start now to be taken seriously. But we have to do even more: I propose a consumption tax, an idea that offends many conservatives, and elimination of the corporate income tax, a proposal that outrages many liberals.
These difficult steps would be far more effective than the president's failed experiment. The administration's $800 billion stimulus program raised government demand for goods and services and was also intended to stimulate consumer demand. These interventions are usually described as Keynesian, but as John Maynard Keynes understood in his 1936 masterwork, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money" (the first economics book I read), the main driver of business cycles is investment. As is typical, the main decline in G.D.P. during the recession showed up in the form of reduced investment by businesses and households.
What drives investment? Stable expectations of a sound economic environment, including the long-run path of tax rates, regulations and so on. And employment is akin to investment in that hiring decisions take into account the long-run economic climate.
The lesson is that effective incentives for investment and employment require permanence and transparency. Measures that are transient or uncertain will be ineffective.
And yet these are precisely the kinds of policies the Obama administration has pursued: temporarily cutting the payroll tax rate, maintaining the marginal income-tax rates from the George W. Bush era while vowing to raise them in the future, holding off on clean-air regulations while promising to implement them later and enacting an ambitious overhaul of Wall Street regulations while leaving lots of rules undefined and ambiguous.
Is there a better way? I believe that a long-term fiscal plan for the country requires six big steps.
Three of them were identified by the Bowles-Simpson deficit reduction commission: reforming Social Security and Medicare by increasing ages of eligibility and shifting to an appropriate formula for indexing benefits to inflation; phasing out "tax expenditures" like the deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and employer-provided health care; and lowering the marginal income-tax rates for individuals.
I would add three more: reversing the vast and unwise increase in spending that occurred under Presidents Bush and Obama; introducing a tax on consumer spending, like the value-added tax (or VAT) common in other rich countries; and abolishing federal corporate taxes and estate taxes. All three measures would be enormously difficult -- many say impossible -- but crises are opportune times for these important, basic reforms.
A broad-based expenditure tax, like a VAT, amounts to a tax on consumption. If the base rate were 10 percent, the revenue would be roughly 5 percent of G.D.P. One benefit from a VAT is that it is more efficient than an income tax -- and in particular the current American income tax system.
I received vigorous criticism from conservatives after advocating a VAT in an essay in The Wall Street Journal last month. The main objection -- reminiscent of the complaints about income-tax withholding, which was introduced in the United States in 1943 -- is that a VAT would be a money machine, allowing the government to readily grow larger. For example, the availability of easy VAT revenue in Western Europe, where rates reach as high as 25 percent, has supported the vast increase in the welfare state there since World War II. I share these concerns and, therefore, favor a VAT only if it is part of a package that includes other sensible reforms. But given the likely path of government spending on health care and Social Security, I see no reasonable alternative.
Abolishing the corporate income tax is similarly controversial. Any tax on capital income distorts decisions on saving and investment. Moreover, the inefficiency is magnified here because of double taxation: the income is taxed when corporations make profits and again when owners receive dividends or capital gains. If we want to tax capital income, a preferred method treats corporate profits as accruing to owners when profits arise and then taxes this income only once -- whether it is paid out as dividends or retained by companies.
Liberals love the idea of a levy on evil corporations, but taxes on corporate profits in fact make up only a small part of federal revenue, compared to the two main sources: the individual income tax and payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.
In 2009-10, taxes on corporate profits averaged 1.4 percent of G.D.P. and 8.6 percent of total federal receipts. Even from 2000 to 2008, when corporations were more profitable, these taxes averaged only 1.9 percent of G.D.P. and 10.3 percent of federal receipts. If we could get past the political fallout, we could get more revenue and improve economic efficiency by abolishing the corporate income tax and relying instead on a VAT.
I had a dream that Mr. Obama and Congress enacted this fiscal reform package -- triggering a surge in the stock market and a boom in investment and G.D.P. -- and that he was re-elected.
This dream could become reality if our leader were Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton -- the two presidential heroes of the American economy since World War II -- but Mr. Obama is another story. To become market-friendly, he would have to abandon most of his core economic and political principles.
More likely, his administration will continue with more of the same: an expansion of payroll-tax cuts, short-term tax credits, promises to raise future taxes on the rich, and added spending on infrastructure, job training and unemployment benefits. The economy will probably continue in its sluggish state, possibly slipping into another recession. In that case, our best hope is for a Republican president far more committed to the principles of free markets and limited government than Mr. Bush ever was.

Abstract: [...] feeling as though she has been ejected from her family, Mrs. Barraza has joined some 130 former Livermore workers in suing the lab's management company, claiming that extensive layoffs were illegally aimed at senior staff members who earned the highest salaries and were closest to reaching retirement. Few argue that the nation's network of federal government research laboratories -- and especially Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the two flagship nuclear weapons labs -- were not in need of change after the cold war ended.

Full text: Marian Barraza, like many who have worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, considered Livermore more than just an employer. Mrs. Barraza, a soft-spoken administrator, worked at Livermore, the federal weapons research lab, for 38 years. She met her husband there. One of the couple's two daughters and many of Mrs. Barraza's friends still work there.
"The lab has been my life," Mrs. Barraza, 59, said. "I started there when I was 17 years old."
But in 2008, after the United States Department of Energy stripped a contract to run the lab from the University of California and handed it to a mostly private-sector coalition led by Bechtel, the contracting giant based in San Francisco, Mrs. Barraza was laid off.
Now, feeling as though she has been ejected from her family, Mrs. Barraza has joined some 130 former Livermore workers in suing the lab's management company, claiming that extensive layoffs were illegally aimed at senior staff members who earned the highest salaries and were closest to reaching retirement. Damages could exceed $100 million.
The lawsuit is a symptom of a troubled, multiyear effort to make Livermore, once among the crown jewels of the nation's science establishment, relevant and cost-effective in a post-cold-war world.
Privatization of the lab's management was supposed to lead to greater efficiency and increased employment, but instead it led to cutbacks that have left the lab with around 6,800 permanent employees, down from some 9,400 in 2005.
Some scientists at the lab contend that the quality of scientific research has suffered, as evidenced by a sharp drop in the number of peer-reviewed research papers produced by lab employees.
Security risks, which had helped prompt the Energy Department to overhaul lab management, have remained a problem. And Livermore's biggest project, the National Ignition Facility, a giant array of lasers designed to fuse hydrogen atoms, has been plagued by delays, cost overruns, and heath and safety concerns.
"Everybody thought that with privatization we could save money and get more transparency," said Peter Stockton, a senior investigator at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight who has studied the national laboratories since the 1970s. "It's done pretty much the opposite."
Bechtel officials blame inflation, increased tax obligations and a $100 million decline in federal appropriations between 2007 and 2008 for the abrupt decision to replace hiring plans with firing plans. The promised greater efficiency, they say, is still in the works.
Lawyers for the management company declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Few argue that the nation's network of federal government research laboratories -- and especially Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the two flagship nuclear weapons labs -- were not in need of change after the cold war ended.
Livermore was founded in 1952 by the University of California to provide competition for the nuclear bomb builders at Los Alamos, which the university also managed. The lab cultivated a quasi-academic atmosphere in which basic research and the esoteric engineering needed to build nuclear weapons were considered worthy ends in themselves. Budgets were rarely an issue.
But without an arms race, Livermore and Los Alamos were institutions without a mission. The federal government was still interested in the basic science, but pressure mounted for the labs to prove themselves worthy of billions in taxpayer funds.
Meanwhile, university officials who oversaw the laboratories' management contracts drew criticism for a laissez-faire approach to operational issues.
"The management of the labs was, well, my God, they just had one travesty after another," Mr. Stockton said. "The arrogance oozed from them."
Even liberal critics of Livermore's management -- including the peace activists who operate its neighborhood watchdog, Tri-Valley CAREs, one of the groups hoping to see the weapons laboratory reinvented as a civilian science center -- agreed that opening up the management contract to competition was a good idea.
In 2006, the Department of Energy solicited bids from contractors interested in running Livermore. It received three bids, rejected one of them, and eventually awarded the contract to Lawrence Livermore National Security L.L.C., a partnership led by Bechtel and the University of California that also includes the URS Corporation, an engineering design firm, and the Babcock & Wilcox Company, an energy and services products provider. The same group was awarded the Los Alamos management contract.
Warning flags were raised at the time about the bidding process. David Hobson, an Ohio Republican who was chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, told the Energy Department in a 2006 letter that many potential competitors had declined to bid because they believed the fix was in.
"Unfortunately, the Department of Energy's national laboratories are not viewed as a competitive marketplace but as a playground for political patronage," Mr. Hobson wrote.
The department declined to comment. The new management company took over Livermore in October 2007, with the promise that it would improve efficiency, bolster security and increase the lab's work force from 9,411 full-time employees in 2005 to as many as 11,500.
But by 2009, the number of permanent full-time workers at Livermore had fallen to 6,900.
Meanwhile, problems that were supposed to have been addressed by the privatization effort persisted. A 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said, for instance, that security flaws lingered at the laboratory.
Bechtel's spokesman, Jason Bohne, acknowledged that problems persisted at Livermore, but he said the management company was reducing operating costs and improving accountability through new purchasing processes, consolidation of business functions and other measures common to businesses.
"Making changes to these large, complex laboratories with firmly entrenched cultures was expected to be difficult, as change often is," Mr. Bohne said. "Some of the change is still in progress."
Since 2008, federal funds appropriated for laboratory operations have crept back up almost to the 2007 level of more than $1.2 billion, but the Livermore head count remains drastically below what it was four years ago. Lynda Seaver, a lab spokeswoman, said spending on staff and operations had fallen because of a substantial increase in management fees.
Since 2008, the companies and the Department of Energy have not disclosed details of the fees paid to the management company.
A union representing Livermore workers says the scientists who remain are fearful and are prevented from discussing problems with their research publicly. Under the terms of the management contract, such problems could limit performance bonuses payable to the management company.
"Scientists raising any issues that would put the performance bonus at risk is strongly frowned upon," said Jeff Colvin, a computational physicist and union representative at the laboratory.
Ms. Seaver said that was not the case. "Scientists have never been restricted in what they can say," she said. "Academic freedom is why many of them choose to work here."
Mr. Colvin told a National Academy of Sciences working group investigating the impacts of privatization on the national laboratories that the number of peer-reviewed articles published by laboratory scientists, which he says is a measure of productivity among scientists, fell from approximately 1,400 in 2005 to about 800 in 2010. The academy plans to publish a report to Congress in November.
As for the laid-off employees, they lament what once had been. "It was a great place to work until the contract changed," Mrs. Barraza said, weeping during a recent interview in her lawyers' Oakland office as she recalled her surprise layoff. "It's not the same place that it used to be."

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Discord over the handling of Europe's debt crisis spilled into full view on Friday when an influential member of the European Central Bank's executive board unexpectedly resigned. The news intensified fears over the euro currency union's ability to cooperatively resolve its problems.
Stock markets swooned in Europe and the euro fell against the dollar after the bank announced the resignation of Jurgen Stark, a German who is the central bank's de facto chief economist and also a member of its policy-setting governing council, and the sell-off continued in the United States, with the major indexes all falling more than 2 percent.
Although the central bank said that Mr. Stark was leaving for personal reasons, the impression was that Mr. Stark's departure was connected to his well-known opposition to the bank's buying of government bonds to ease pressure on countries like Greece, Italy and Spain.
Mr. Stark's resignation, nearly three years before his term was up, is widely viewed as another fissure in the edifice of European unity, which has suffered as wealthier countries like Germany have been asked to underwrite poor performers like Greece.
"It's a very bad sign," said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. "It means that the split within the E.C.B. that we thought was far down the road is here now.
"It puts a shadow over the E.C.B. and risks financial markets asking, 'How long can they go on buying these Italian bonds?' This indicates that the answer is, 'Not as long as I had thought.' "
The government debt crisis among the 17-nation euro union's weaker members continues to weigh on markets, and any sign of a deepening in the rift between rich and poor countries could further spook investors.
There is a chance that Mr. Stark's departure could give the central bank a freer hand. Mr. Stark was an inflation hard-liner very much in the German tradition, and his dissent created an impression that the bank suffered internal divisions. Mr. Stark declined a request for comment.
But if, as expected, a German replaces him, that new member of the bank board is very likely to be as mindful as Mr. Stark of the fierce opposition that the bank's policy has generated in Germany.
Germany's finance minister declined to comment on reports that his country would recommend Jorg Asmussen, a deputy finance minister, to replace Mr. Stark, who was the only German on the six-member executive board. Mr. Asmussen has been a central figure in negotiations with other euro zone countries on how to deal with the sovereign debt crisis.
While Mr. Asmussen's views on monetary policy are not well known, he comes from the same tradition of German economics as Mr. Stark -- one that puts an emphasis on price stability and is skeptical of efforts to help countries that run up too much debt. So it is not clear if he would be any more receptive to the central bank's bond buying than Mr. Stark has been.
When the Bundesbank, the German central bank, was Europe's most powerful monetary authority before the advent of the euro union in 1999, it made controlling prices its mission. There are mounting concerns in Germany and elsewhere that the European Central Bank has overstepped its bounds in trying to fight the current crisis by acting as the buyer of last resort for Italian and Spanish bonds to prevent those countries from slipping closer to insolvency.
In a statement Friday, Kurt Lauk, president of the economic council for the Christian Democrats -- the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- called the resignation "a dramatic alarm bell for the fact that the E.C.B. must be led back to the right path."
As the debt crisis continues, the future of the euro union has become increasingly uncertain. Lawmakers and citizens in countries like Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, which are known for fiscal responsibility, are watching events in Athens and Rome with growing skepticism and even alarm.
Mr. Stark had warned of rising danger from public spending in a column to be published Monday in the Handelsblatt newspaper, Reuters reported. "We are in a situation in which the massive sustainability risks in public sector budgets are undermining financial stability," he wrote.
The unexpected departure of Mr. Stark comes at a time of transition for the European Central Bank, whose presidency will change hands at the end of October. That is when Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, succeeds Jean-Claude Trichet, whose eight-year term is ending.
The bank has often been the main institution holding the euro zone together in the face of relentless market pressure, especially in the bond market. Last month, the bank began buying Spanish and Italian bonds on the open market, as prices plummeted and yields rose to potentially ruinous levels.
But the bond-buying program is risky because investors are likely to continually test the central bank's resolve -- and financial ability -- to bolster the weaker countries.
Mr. Stark is the second prominent German this year to leave the bank's policy-making governing council, a broader panel consisting of the executive board and the heads of the central banks of the 17 euro countries. Axel Weber, who was president of the German Bundesbank, announced his resignation from that post in February, which resulted in his leaving the central bank council.
Mr. Weber, who until his resignation had been the front-runner to succeed Mr. Trichet, was displeased along with Mr. Stark about the bank's foray into bond markets, which he argued was an improper involvement in member nations' fiscal policies.
Jens Weidmann, Mr. Weber's successor as president of the Bundesbank, is also known as an opponent of the bond buying.
The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said at the Group of 7 meeting in Marseille that Germany would propose a replacement for Mr. Stark, but he would not comment on whether it would be Mr. Asmussen.
Although nationality officially plays no role in the selection process, Germany would customarily have the privilege of naming the replacement for Mr. Stark, the only German on the board. The nomination also requires the ratification of other euro zone governments.

Full text: First things first: I was favorably surprised by the new Obama jobs plan, which is significantly bolder and better than I expected. It's not nearly as bold as the plan I'd want in an ideal world. But if it actually became law, it would probably make a significant dent in unemployment.
Of course, it isn't likely to become law, thanks to G.O.P. opposition. Nor is anything else likely to happen that will do much to help the 14 million Americans out of work. And that is both a tragedy and an outrage.
Before I get to the Obama plan, let me talk about the other important economic speech of the week, which was given by Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve of Chicago. Mr. Evans said, forthrightly, what some of us have been hoping to hear from Fed officials for years now.
As Mr. Evans pointed out, the Fed, both as a matter of law and as a matter of social responsibility, should try to keep both inflation and unemployment low -- and while inflation seems likely to stay near or below the Fed's target of around 2 percent, unemployment remains extremely high.
So how should the Fed be reacting? Mr. Evans: "Imagine that inflation was running at 5 percent against our inflation objective of 2 percent. Is there a doubt that any central banker worth their salt would be reacting strongly to fight this high inflation rate? No, there isn't any doubt. They would be acting as if their hair was on fire. We should be similarly energized about improving conditions in the labor market."
But the Fed's hair is manifestly not on fire, nor do most politicians seem to see any urgency about the situation. These days, the best -- or at any rate the alleged wise men and women who are supposed to be looking after the nation's welfare -- lack all conviction, while the worst, as represented by much of the G.O.P., are filled with a passionate intensity. So the unemployed are being abandoned.
O.K., about the Obama plan: It calls for about $200 billion in new spending -- much of it on things we need in any case, like school repair, transportation networks, and avoiding teacher layoffs -- and $240 billion in tax cuts. That may sound like a lot, but it actually isn't. The lingering effects of the housing bust and the overhang of household debt from the bubble years are creating a roughly $1 trillion per year hole in the U.S. economy, and this plan -- which wouldn't deliver all its benefits in the first year -- would fill only part of that hole. And it's unclear, in particular, how effective the tax cuts would be at boosting spending.
Still, the plan would be a lot better than nothing, and some of its measures, which are specifically aimed at providing incentives for hiring, might produce relatively a large employment bang for the buck. As I said, it's much bolder and better than I expected. President Obama's hair may not be on fire, but it's definitely smoking; clearly and gratifyingly, he does grasp how desperate the jobs situation is.
But his plan isn't likely to become law, thanks to Republican opposition. And it's worth noting just how much that opposition has hardened over time, even as the plight of the unemployed has worsened.
In early 2009, as the new Obama administration tried to come to grips with the crisis it inherited, you heard two main lines from critics on the right. First, they argued that we should rely on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy -- that is, that the job of fighting unemployment should be left to the Fed. Second, they argued that fiscal actions should take the form of tax cuts rather than temporary spending.
Now, however, leading Republicans are against tax cuts -- at least if they benefit working Americans rather than rich people and corporations.
And they're against monetary policy, too. In Wednesday night's Republican presidential debate, Mitt Romney declared that he would seek a replacement for Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, essentially because Mr. Bernanke has tried to do something (though not enough) about unemployment. And that makes Mr. Romney a moderate by G.O.P. standards, since Rick Perry, his main rival for the presidential nomination, has suggested that Mr. Bernanke should be treated "pretty ugly."
So, at this point, leading Republicans are basically against anything that might help the unemployed. Yes, Mr. Romney has issued a glossy, well-produced "jobs plan," but it might best be described as 59 bullet points with nothing there -- and certainly nothing to justify his assertion, bordering on megalomania, that he would create no fewer than 11 million jobs in four years.
The good news in all this is that by going bigger and bolder than expected, Mr. Obama may finally have set the stage for a political debate about job creation. For, in the end, nothing will be done until the American people demand action.

Abstract: When China reports this week that the consumer price index rose at an annualized rate of about 6 percent in August, economists may say inflation has peaked. [...] neither of those things is likely in the short term, and the Federal Reserve's commitment to a zero-rate policy through 2013 could even at some point put pressure on the Bank of Canada to reduce rates.

Full text: When China reports this week that the consumer price index rose at an annualized rate of about 6 percent in August, economists may say inflation has peaked. They said the same last year, when the C.P.I. was running half as fast. The problem isn't bad forecasting: China's headline inflation measure is flawed.
Headline inflation is easily bent by volatile prices. Take pork, which rose 57 percent year on year in July. Vegetable prices are increasing more than 5 percent a week, and the effect is magnified because food composes a third of the C.P.I. basket. Conversely, some prices are artificially low, like energy and transport. A ticket on Beijing's subway has cost a flat 2 renminbi for three years.
China's size creates another problem. While Shanghai urbanites lament the price of their lattes, farmers in the hinterland have different concerns. Perhaps it would be better to have one C.P.I. for the city and one for the country. New tailored bank rules for low-income Xinjiang Province make that not so far-fetched.
Finding the genuine inflation number isn't easy. One insight comes with the difference between nominal and real reported gross domestic product, the so-called G.D.P. deflator. By that measure, 2010's inflation was around twice the C.P.I.'s reported 3.3 percent rise. If that's a guide, today's inflation could be in double digits.
Savers, who are robbed by rising prices, are giving a strong signal. They have flocked to real estate and high-yielding wealth products to beat the measly 3.5 percent mandated one-year deposit rate. That makes inflation harder to fight, since money pushed into informal lending channels isn't affected by monetary policy tools like bank credit quotas. Allowing deposits to be set by the market would draw more back into the banks. But the fear of eroding banks' margins seems to stand in the way of what would be a potent inflation-fighting tool.
And then there are the dog whistles from politicians. Premier Wen Jiabao wrote in a state magazine on Sept. 1 that price stability was his priority, and warned of "unstable" conditions. Whatever the numbers say, when savers and politicians worry, investors should, too.
Proximity Blues
Canada's economic comfort is suffering at the hands of its troubled southern neighbor. The Bank of Canada on Wednesday stopped raising interest rates at 1 percent, largely because of deteriorating conditions in the United States. That's a pity -- Canada would benefit from rates above inflation. But sluggishness and policy-wrangling south of the border sap growth and make its currency less competitive.
That makes the central bank's decision understandable. Canadian short-term rates are already 1 percentage point higher than America's zero rates, while the Canadian dollar has strengthened 5 percent against the greenback in the last year. The prevailing near parity between the two currencies hurts Canadian exports, slows growth and hampers job creation, even though the country's resources sectors remain competitive.
A pick-up in growth in the United States would help Canada's exports, while higher interest rates in the United States would reduce the upward pressure on the Canadian dollar. But neither of those things is likely in the short term, and the Federal Reserve's commitment to a zero-rate policy through 2013 could even at some point put pressure on the Bank of Canada to reduce rates.
Yet Canadian inflation approached 3 percent in the year to July, and the nation's savings rate, at 4.1 percent in the second quarter, is uncomfortably low and has fallen by 2.7 percentage points in the last year. Higher rates could help on both counts. Increased savings could also help the government as it chips away at the budget deficit and tries to balance its books.
Not that inflation, let alone growth, can be said to be overheating. But that, like the Bank of Canada's rates policy, has a lot to do with the cold wind from the south. The United States represented 73 percent of exports in 2010 and the hobbled European Union and Japan a further 11 percent.
A push to build closer ties with faster-growing developing countries could help long term. Location makes that diversification challenging and, if a United States diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks is to be believed, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's foreign travel -- for instance, to Brazil last month -- isn't especially to his liking. But it's a worthy goal. In the meantime, Canada's erstwhile geographical advantage is, for now, its millstone.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, warned Thursday that the risk of slower growth in Europe had intensified amid a climate of "enormous" economic uncertainty, and signaled that the bank was unlikely to raise rates again soon.
The E.C.B. joined the Bank of England and several Asian central banks in leaving benchmark interest rates unchanged Thursday, as they wait to see if the global economy deteriorates.
Nearly stagnant growth in the euro zone has raised questions whether the E.C.B. acted prematurely when it raised rates twice earlier this year, to 1.5 percent from 1 percent.
While warning that the euro zone economy was "subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks," Mr. Trichet defended the E.C.B.'s earlier policy moves as necessary to hold down prices.
"We think what we did was appropriate," he said at a news conference, which also included a rare outburst against his critics. Asked about complaints about E.C.B. policy in the German Parliament, Mr. Trichet said, with obvious irritation, "We do our job, it's not an easy job."
Mr. Trichet normally suffers the financial press corps with remarkable equanimity. But, with less than two months to go before retirement, he seemed to vent frustration at the lack of appreciation the central bank has received during the sovereign debt crisis, when it has effectively held the euro zone together while political leaders appeared to dither.
"We have delivered price stability impeccably -- impeccably!" he said loudly, reminding his German critics that inflation under the E.C.B. had been lower than when the Bundesbank, the German central bank, oversaw the Deutsche mark.
As Mr. Trichet nears the end of his term leading the E.C.B., the bank is on the front lines of the most acute crisis the euro has seen. Some European banks are struggling to borrow on the interbank market because of questions about their solvency; the E.C.B. is keeping them afloat by providing them with emergency low-cost loans. The E.C.B. is also buying Spanish and Italian bonds on the open market to stem pressure on their borrowing costs, which have threatened to reach ruinous levels.
Mr. Trichet gave no clear sign that the E.C.B. was poised to dial back rates soon, as some economists have urged. But he said the bank's economists expected inflation to decline next year, suggesting there would be room to cut rates if growth deteriorated further.
The E.C.B. "has effectively left the door open to a change of stance should the situation demand it, but in our view this is far from imminent," Janet Henry, an analyst at HSBC in London, wrote in an analysis. "It would take a significant recession" before the E.C.B. changes direction, she wrote.
Dirk Schumacher, an economist in Frankfurt for Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research note: "The E.C.B. is keeping its options open."
The Bank of England decided to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5 percent to help the weakening British economy, amid concerns that Europe's debt crisis might become more of a drag on growth.
The central banks of South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia all kept rates unchanged at their policy meetings Thursday, as they waited to see how their economies would be affected by slower growth and debt concerns in Europe and the United States.
Mr. Trichet will cede the E.C.B. presidency to Mario Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy, at the end of October. The news conference Thursday was Mr. Trichet's last at E.C.B. headquarters in Frankfurt. Next month's governing council meeting, Mr. Trichet's last, will be in Berlin, where concern is growing that Greece will not be able to fulfill conditions for further aid, raising the possibility it will have to default on its debt and exit the euro. "Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is serious in Greece," Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, told members of the Bundestag, or Parliament.
Asked about Greece, Mr. Trichet said only that he still assumed the country would fulfill conditions set by the International Monetary Fund and European Commission. He also sought to calm alarm about tensions in the interbank lending market, which have made it more difficult for some institutions to raise funds from their peers and made them reliant on emergency loans from the E.C.B. He acknowledged that interbank lending had tightened, but said banks were not borrowing nearly as much from the E.C.B. as they could.
"Liquidity is a false problem and I can prove it," he said.
Some analysts argue that the bank needs to go further and aggressively cut rates to avert recession, even though it only recently raised rates. "The E.C.B. is the only policy making institution with any room to maneuver. It should use it to the full," Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, wrote in an e-mail. "But there is a risk that due to divisions within the governing council, the E.C.B. will not take such steps."
Several members of the council, including Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, are known to oppose E.C.B. intervention in bond markets, arguing that the bank has exceeded its mandate by becoming involved in government fiscal policy.
The Bank of England, in addition to keeping its main interest rate at a record low, also left its asset purchasing program at $:200 billion, or $319 billion. Some economists had said earlier that the British central bank could resume its bond purchasing program, or so-called quantitative easing, as early as this week, to try to stimulate the economy by injecting more money into the market.
In Britain, inflation has put the squeeze on consumers, who in turn have curbed spending because of concern about rising unemployment and cuts in public spending. Businesses also became more reluctant to invest and more recently exports have been hurt as economies in the country's biggest market -- the euro zone -- slowed.
"One by one, Britain's engines of growth are coming to a halt," Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London, said. "If indicators continue on that path it's feasible we'll see more quantitative easing soon."
Goldman Sachs said Monday that it believed the Bank of England could resume buying bonds in the coming months, most likely in November.
Other central bank policy makers also have discussed the need for more stimulus. In the United States, some Federal Reserve policy makers said last month that the current economic slowdown would justify "a more substantial move." Fed officials have discussed the option of buying more government bonds and other tools, and were to take the issue up again at their next meeting later this month.
Adam Posen was the only member of the Bank of England monetary policy committee who repeatedly voted in favor of more quantitative easing, arguing that the economic recovery was not strong enough to withstand the large public spending cuts under way, the biggest since World War II.
George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, acknowledged in a speech Tuesday evening that the economy was growing slower than predicted in March. But he said it was still flexible enough to withstand the government's wide-ranging austerity measures.
Mr. Osborne said that Britain's economy was "not immune from events around the world" and that "these are very unsettling times for the global economy."
Signs that Britain's economy is weakening have mounted. House prices fell in August, the first decline in four months, and consumer sentiment declined. Dixons, the electronic goods retailer, said Wednesday that sales fell 7 percent in the three months through July 23, and Thorntons, the British chocolate maker, reported a full-year loss compared with a profit a year earlier.
Britain's economic growth slowed to 0.2 percent in the second quarter, and manufacturing increased just 0.1 percent in July from the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some economists predict the Bank of England will keep interest rates at a record low for another year.

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the turmoil that shook the financial markets last month, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that its 12 bank regions grew this summer because consumers in many parts of the country spent more.
The Fed said five of its regions, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, San Francisco and St. Louis. reported modest or slight growth in late July and August. The seven other regions described growth as subdued, slow or sluggish.
The survey, known as the beige book, offers mostly anecdotal information on economic conditions. Its findings were a slight improvement from the previous survey, which said growth slowed in eight of the 12 regions in June and early July.
Consumer spending increased in most regions from the previous survey. But the gains were mostly a result of stronger auto sales. Demand for other products was flat or fell in several regions during late July and August.
The report offered little guidance about future hiring. It noted that several districts had said the volatile stock market and economic uncertainty had led many businesses to lower expectations for the near future. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1,962 points, or roughly 15 percent, from July 22 through Aug. 10.
Although far from upbeat, the overall tone from the anecdotal evidence "wasn't all doom and gloom," said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The regional outlook will help shape the discussion at the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 20-21.
The economy barely grew in the first half of the year, and the government said last week that employers stopped adding jobs in August.
Consumers and businesses are feeling less confident after a turbulent summer. Lawmakers fought over raising the federal borrowing limit, Standard & Poor's downgraded long-term United States debt, and stocks have fluctuated wildly after plunging in late-July and early August.
Manufacturing slowed in many parts of the country, including New York, Philadelphia and Richmond, the survey noted. Textile makers in Richmond said that their markets had grown weaker because of declines in consumer confidence.
Home sales slowed in many districts, although Atlanta, Boston, Dallas and Minneapolis said sales had improved slightly compared to last summer's weak levels.
Some economists say the Fed must act to help the economy avoid another recession.
On Aug. 9, the Federal Reserve said it planned to keep interest rates very low until at least mid-2013, assuming the economy remained weak. Minutes from that meeting showed some Fed officials had pushed for more aggressive steps.
One possibility is the Fed could increase the percentage of long-term Treasury securities it keeps in its mix of holdings. That approach would have the advantage of exerting downward pressure on long-term interest rates without adding to the Fed's already record-level of securities.
Still, three regional bank presidents dissented from the Aug. 9 decision. They expressed concerns that the Fed's policies were contributing to higher inflation.
The worsening jobs outlook has also put pressure on President Obama. He is expected on Thursday to introduce a $300 billion jobs package before a joint session of Congress. The plan is likely to include extensions of the payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits, tax incentives for businesses that hire and money for public works projects.
The effort faces strong opposition from Republicans in Congress, who say Mr. Obama's previous stimulus program failed.

Abstract: The federal government also undertook its own construction programs, but, with few shovel-ready projects, it could only increase infrastructure spending by an immaterial 0.05 percent of G.D.P. In my estimation, those interventions and most others -- cash for clunkers, the first-time homebuyers' tax credit, quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve and the sharp increase in federal spending -- have not only been ineffective but have also lowered investment and consumption demand by increasing concern about the federal debt, another financial crisis and threats of inflation or deflation.

Full text: WHEN he introduced Alan B. Krueger, his new economic adviser, in the Rose Garden last week, President Obama offered a few hints about his new economic plan. So far it sounds much like the old plan, which is too bad because that plan didn't work very well.
One part of the new plan, the president said, is to "put more money in the pockets" of people. That was tried in the 2009 stimulus, when the federal government borrowed money and gave it to people in the form of one-time payments or temporary refundable tax credits. The temporary transfers created little or no increase in aggregate consumption or, in turn, in jobs.
Another part of the new plan would "put construction crews to work rebuilding our nation's roads and railways and airports." That too was tried in the 2009 stimulus. My colleague John F. Cogan and I found that state and local governments put most of the money in their coffers. The federal government also undertook its own construction programs, but, with few shovel-ready projects, it could only increase infrastructure spending by an immaterial 0.05 percent of G.D.P.
In my estimation, those interventions and most others -- cash for clunkers, the first-time homebuyers' tax credit, quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve and the sharp increase in federal spending -- have not only been ineffective but have also lowered investment and consumption demand by increasing concern about the federal debt, another financial crisis and threats of inflation or deflation. Most businesses have plenty of cash to invest and create jobs. They're sitting on it because of those concerns.
Rather than more of such temporary interventions, the American economy needs a new comprehensive economic strategy. A natural starting place is the debt-limit cum spending-control agreement reached this summer. It reduces projected increases in spending over 10 years by $2.1 trillion to $2.4 trillion. The agreement reduces spending growth in a very gradual way, which is appropriate in a weak economy.
But it does not fully deal with the debt and the deficit problem, which is why it needs to be embedded in a broader economic strategy with the goal of closing the rest of the budget gap through pro-growth reforms.
There are of course sharp differences of opinion about the reforms needed to achieve that goal. The biggest differences of opinion will probably have to be hammered out in the 2012 election. Entitlement reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, monetary reform -- indeed, the fundamental role of government in the economy -- should be part of that debate, but with a clear commitment to America's living within its means.
That strategy will take us toward a more stable and predictable economic policy with less uncertainty about the future. It will thereby increase both demand and supply and cause the economy to grow and create jobs again.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes is a scourge in the Valley. Since Type 2 diabetics can be asymptomatic for years, many don't buy medicine; as time passes, they become severely ill, often losing sight or a limb.

Full text: Cambridge, Mass.
ON Thursday, President Obama will deliver a major speech on America's employment crisis. But too often, what is lost in the call for job creation is a clear idea of what jobs we want to create.
I recently led a research team to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, where Gov. Rick Perry, a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, has advertised his track record of creating jobs. From January 2000 to January 2010, employment in the Valley grew by a remarkable 42 percent, compared with our nation's anemic 1 percent job growth.
But the median wage for adults in the Valley between 2005 and 2008 was a stunningly low $8.14 an hour (in 2008 dollars). One in four employed adults earned less than $6.19 an hour. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas reported that the per capita income in the two metropolitan statistical areas spanning the Valley ranked lowest and second lowest in the nation.
These workers aren't alone. Last year, one in five American adults worked in jobs that paid poverty-level wages. Worker displacement contributes to the problem. People who are laid off from previously stable employment, if they are lucky enough to find work, take a median wage hit of over 20 percent, which can persist for decades.
To understand the impact of low wages, in the Valley and elsewhere, we interviewed a wide range of people, including two directors of public health clinics, three priests, a school principal and four focus groups of residents. Everyone described a life of constantly trying to scrape by. One month they might pay for the phone, another, for utilities. Everyone knew how long each company would carry unpaid bills before cutting service. People spoke not only of their fear of an unexpected crisis -- an illness, a broken car -- but also of the challenge of paying for basic needs like school supplies. Many used the phrase "one paycheck away from homelessness."
Because their parents cannot afford child care, children move among relatives and neighbors. They watch too much TV. They don't finish their homework. Older children grow up too fast from parenting their younger siblings. As one person observed, "All you think about is which bill is more important."
Economic stress strains marriages. Parents cannot afford quinceaneras for their daughters. In church youth groups, teenagers ask why they should stay in school if all they can get are low wages.
Many children are latchkey kids. Accidents are frequent; we heard of an elementary school student who badly burned himself in a science experiment, with his older brother watching. Their father couldn't take time off from work to visit his son in the hospital. Children come to school sick. Parents miss teacher conferences because they can't afford time off. Type 2 diabetes is a scourge in the Valley. Since Type 2 diabetics can be asymptomatic for years, many don't buy medicine; as time passes, they become severely ill, often losing sight or a limb.
The director at one clinic, with nearly 70,000 visits a year, estimated that half of its patients had anxiety or depression. Often people can't get to the clinic because they cannot afford to lose work time or because gas costs too much. When they go, they take their families, because they have no child care.
And yet the Valley is not hopeless. Teachers stay late to help with homework. They make home visits to meet parents. Health clinic employees work overtime. The community organization Valley Interfaith has pushed for training opportunities and living-wage jobs. There is no "culture of poverty," but the low-wage economy has corrosive and tragic consequences.
Must we choose between job quality and quantity? We have solid evidence that when employees are paid better and given more opportunities within a company, the gains outweigh the costs. For example, after a living wage ordinance took effect for employees at the San Francisco International Airport, in 1999, turnover fell and productivity rose.
Contrary to the antigovernment rhetoric, there is much that the public sector can do to improve the quality of jobs.
A recent analysis by the Economic Policy Institute reported that 20 percent of federal contract employees earned less than the poverty level for a family of four, as opposed to 8 percent of traditional federal workers. Many low-wage jobs in the private sector (notably, the health care industry) are financed by taxpayers. The government can set an example by setting and enforcing wage standards for contractors.
When states and localities use their zoning powers to approve commercial projects, or offer tax incentives to attract new employers, they can require that workers be paid living wages; research shows this will not hurt job growth.
Labor standards have to be upgraded and enforced, particularly for those employers, typically in low-wage industries, who engage in "wage theft," by failing to pay required overtime wages or misclassifying workers as independent contractors so that they do not receive the benefits to which they are entitled.
Americans have long believed that there should be a floor below which job quality does not fall. Today, polls show widespread support for upgrading employment standards, including raising the minimum wage -- which is lower, in inflation-adjusted terms, than it was in 1968. It's time for the federal government to take the lead in creating not just more jobs, but more good jobs. The job-growth mirage of the Rio Grande Valley cannot be our model.

Full text: The United States Postal Service has long lived on the financial edge, but it has never been as close to the precipice as it is today: the agency is so low on cash that it will not be able to make a $5.5 billion payment due this month and may have to shut down entirely this winter unless Congress takes emergency action to stabilize its finances.
"Our situation is extremely serious," the postmaster general, Patrick R. Donahoe, said in an interview. "If Congress doesn't act, we will default."
In recent weeks, Mr. Donahoe has been pushing a series of painful cost-cutting measures to erase the agency's deficit, which will reach $9.2 billion this fiscal year. They include eliminating Saturday mail delivery, closing up to 3,700 postal locations and laying off 120,000 workers -- nearly one-fifth of the agency's work force -- despite a no-layoffs clause in the unions' contracts.
The post office's problems stem from one hard reality: it is being squeezed on both revenue and costs.
As any computer user knows, the Internet revolution has led to people and businesses sending far less conventional mail.
At the same time, decades of contractual promises made to unionized workers, including no-layoff clauses, are increasing the post office's costs. Labor represents 80 percent of the agency's expenses, compared with 53 percent at United Parcel Service and 32 percent at FedEx, its two biggest private competitors. Postal workers also receive more generous health benefits than most other federal employees.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the agency's predicament on Tuesday. So far, feuding Democrats and Republicans in Congress, still smarting from the brawl over the federal debt ceiling, have failed to agree on any solutions. It doesn't help that many of the options for saving the postal service are politically unpalatable.
"The situation is dire," said Thomas R. Carper, the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees the postal service. "If we do nothing, if we don't react in a smart, appropriate way, the postal service could literally close later this year. That's not the kind of development we need to inject into a weak, uneven economic recovery."
Missing the $5.5 billion payment due on Sept. 30, intended to finance retirees' future health care, won't cause immediate disaster. But sometime early next year, the agency will run out of money to pay its employees and gas up its trucks, officials warn, forcing it to stop delivering the roughly three billion pieces of mail it handles weekly.
The causes of the crisis are well known and immensely difficult to overcome.
Mail volume has plummeted with the rise of e-mail, electronic bill-paying and a Web that makes everything from fashion catalogs to news instantly available. The system will handle an estimated 167 billion pieces of mail this fiscal year, down 22 percent from five years ago.
It's difficult to imagine that trend reversing, and pessimistic projections suggest that volume could plunge to 118 billion pieces by 2020. The law also prevents the post office from raising postage fees faster than inflation.
Meanwhile, the agency has had a tough time cutting its costs to match the revenue drop, with a history of labor contracts offering good health and pension benefits, underused post offices, and laws that restrict its ability to make basic business decisions, like reducing the frequency of deliveries.
Congress is considering numerous emergency proposals -- most notably, allowing the post office to recover billions of dollars that management says it overpaid to its employees' pension funds. That fix would help the agency get through the short-term crisis, but would delay the day of reckoning on bigger issues.
The agency's leaders acknowledge that they must find a way to increase revenue, something that will prove far harder than simply slicing costs.
In some countries, post offices double as banks or sell insurance or cellphones. In the United States, the postal service is barred from entering many areas. Still, the agency is considering ideas, like gaining the right to deliver wine and beer, allowing commercial advertisements on postal trucks and in post offices, doing more "last-mile" deliveries for FedEx and U.P.S. and offering special hand-delivery services for correspondence and transactions for which e-mail is not considered secure enough.
Mr. Donahoe's hope is to cut $20 billion of the $75 billion in annual costs by 2015. To do that, he wants to close many post offices and slash the number of sorting facilities to 200 from 500 and trim the agency's work force by 220,000 people, from its current 653,000. (A decade ago, the agency employed nearly 900,000.)
The postal service has the legal authority to close facilities, although community opposition can make the process difficult. To placate critics and cut costs, officials say they would seek to run some postal operations out of stores like Wal-Mart or to share space with other government offices.
Cutting the work force is more difficult. The agency's labor contracts have long guaranteed no layoffs to the vast majority of its workers, and management agreed to a new no layoff-clause in a major union contract last May.
But now, faced with what postal officials call "the equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy," the agency is asking Congress to enact legislation that would overturn the job protections and let it lay off 120,000 workers in addition to trimming 100,000 jobs through attrition.
The postal service is also asking Congress for permission to end Saturday delivery.
Given the vast range of stakeholders, getting consensus on a rescue plan will be difficult.
Senator Susan Collins of Maine, like many lawmakers from rural states, vigorously opposes ending Saturday delivery, which would trim only 2 percent from the agency's budget. Ms. Collins, the ranking Republican on the committee overseeing the postal service, said the cutback would be tough on people in small towns who receive prescriptions and newspapers by mail.
"The postmaster general has focused on several approaches that I believe will be counterproductive," she said. "They risk producing a death spiral where the postal service reduces service and drives away more customers."
The post office's powerful unions are angry and alarmed about the planned layoffs. "We're going to fight this and we're going to fight it hard," said Cliff Guffey, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents 207,000 mail sorters and post office clerks. "It's illegal for them to abrogate our contract."
Senators Carper and Collins do back several of the postal service's main ideas to avoid default, including recovering around $60 billion that some actuaries say the agency has overpaid into two pension funds. Although the Obama administration is working closely with the senators to find a solution, it has signaled discomfort with the pension proposals, questioning whether the postal service really overpaid.
Meanwhile, Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Oversight Committee, says the pension proposals would amount to an unjustifiable bailout that would not solve the agency's underlying problems. He is pushing a bill that would create an emergency oversight board that could order huge cost-cutting and void the postal service's contracts -- a proposal that not just the unions, but Senators Carper and Collins oppose.
Fredric V. Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, warned of disaster if partisanship keeps Congress from acting.
"This is about one of America's oldest institutions," he said. "It survived the telegraph, it survived the telephone, and we have to do everything we can to preserve it and adapt."

Abstract: Even if by some miracle President Obama gets support for a second big stimulus while Ben S. Bernanke's Fed keeps interest rates near zero, neither will do the trick without a middle class capable of spending. With the continued gains from economic growth, the nation could have enabled more people to become problem solvers and innovators -- through early childhood education, better public schools, expanded access to higher education and more efficient public transportation.

THE 5 percent of Americans with the highest incomes now account for 37 percent of all consumer purchases, according to the latest research from Moody's Analytics. That should come as no surprise. Our society has become more and more unequal.
When so much income goes to the top, the middle class doesn't have enough purchasing power to keep the economy going without sinking ever more deeply into debt -- which, as we've seen, ends badly. An economy so dependent on the spending of a few is also prone to great booms and busts. The rich splurge and speculate when their savings are doing well. But when the values of their assets tumble, they pull back. That can lead to wild gyrations. Sound familiar?
The economy won't really bounce back until America's surge toward inequality is reversed. Even if by some miracle President Obama gets support for a second big stimulus while Ben S. Bernanke's Fed keeps interest rates near zero, neither will do the trick without a middle class capable of spending. Pump-priming works only when a well contains enough water.
Look back over the last hundred years and you'll see the pattern. During periods when the very rich took home a much smaller proportion of total income -- as in the Great Prosperity between 1947 and 1977 -- the nation as a whole grew faster and median wages surged. We created a virtuous cycle in which an ever growing middle class had the ability to consume more goods and services, which created more and better jobs, thereby stoking demand. The rising tide did in fact lift all boats.
During periods when the very rich took home a larger proportion -- as between 1918 and 1933, and in the Great Regression from 1981 to the present day -- growth slowed, median wages stagnated and we suffered giant downturns. It's no mere coincidence that over the last century the top earners' share of the nation's total income peaked in 1928 and 2007 -- the two years just preceding the biggest downturns.
Starting in the late 1970s, the middle class began to weaken. Although productivity continued to grow and the economy continued to expand, wages began flattening in the 1970s because new technologies -- container ships, satellite communications, eventually computers and the Internet -- started to undermine any American job that could be automated or done more cheaply abroad. The same technologies bestowed ever larger rewards on people who could use them to innovate and solve problems. Some were product entrepreneurs; a growing number were financial entrepreneurs. The pay of graduates of prestigious colleges and M.B.A. programs -- the "talent" who reached the pinnacles of power in executive suites and on Wall Street -- soared.
The middle class nonetheless continued to spend, at first enabled by the flow of women into the work force. (In the 1960s only 12 percent of married women with young children were working for pay; by the late 1990s, 55 percent were.) When that way of life stopped generating enough income, Americans went deeper into debt. From the late 1990s to 2007, the typical household debt grew by a third. As long as housing values continued to rise it seemed a painless way to get additional money.
Eventually, of course, the bubble burst. That ended the middle class's remarkable ability to keep spending in the face of near stagnant wages. The puzzle is why so little has been done in the last 40 years to help deal with the subversion of the economic power of the middle class. With the continued gains from economic growth, the nation could have enabled more people to become problem solvers and innovators -- through early childhood education, better public schools, expanded access to higher education and more efficient public transportation.
We might have enlarged safety nets -- by having unemployment insurance cover part-time work, by giving transition assistance to move to new jobs in new locations, by creating insurance for communities that lost a major employer. And we could have made Medicare available to anyone.
Big companies could have been required to pay severance to American workers they let go and train them for new jobs. The minimum wage could have been pegged at half the median wage, and we could have insisted that the foreign nations we trade with do the same, so that all citizens could share in gains from trade.
We could have raised taxes on the rich and cut them for poorer Americans.
But starting in the late 1970s, and with increasing fervor over the next three decades, government did just the opposite. It deregulated and privatized. It cut spending on infrastructure as a percentage of the national economy and shifted more of the costs of public higher education to families. It shredded safety nets. (Only 27 percent of the unemployed are covered by unemployment insurance.) And it allowed companies to bust unions and threaten employees who tried to organize. Fewer than 8 percent of private-sector workers are unionized.
More generally, it stood by as big American companies became global companies with no more loyalty to the United States than a GPS satellite. Meanwhile, the top income tax rate was halved to 35 percent and many of the nation's richest were allowed to treat their income as capital gains subject to no more than 15 percent tax. Inheritance taxes that affected only the topmost 1.5 percent of earners were sliced. Yet at the same time sales and payroll taxes -- both taking a bigger chunk out of modest paychecks -- were increased.
Most telling of all, Washington deregulated Wall Street while insuring it against major losses. In so doing, it allowed finance -- which until then had been the servant of American industry -- to become its master, demanding short-term profits over long-term growth and raking in an ever larger portion of the nation's profits. By 2007, financial companies accounted for over 40 percent of American corporate profits and almost as great a percentage of pay, up from 10 percent during the Great Prosperity.
Some say the regressive lurch occurred because Americans lost confidence in government. But this argument has cause and effect backward. The tax revolts that thundered across America starting in the late 1970s were not so much ideological revolts against government -- Americans still wanted all the government services they had before, and then some -- as against paying more taxes on incomes that had stagnated. Inevitably, government services deteriorated and government deficits exploded, confirming the public's growing cynicism about government's doing anything right.
Some say we couldn't have reversed the consequences of globalization and technological change. Yet the experiences of other nations, like Germany, suggest otherwise. Germany has grown faster than the United States for the last 15 years, and the gains have been more widely spread. While Americans' average hourly pay has risen only 6 percent since 1985, adjusted for inflation, German workers' pay has risen almost 30 percent. At the same time, the top 1 percent of German households now take home about 11 percent of all income -- about the same as in 1970. And although in the last months Germany has been hit by the debt crisis of its neighbors, its unemployment is still below where it was when the financial crisis started in 2007.
How has Germany done it? Mainly by focusing like a laser on education (German math scores continue to extend their lead over American), and by maintaining strong labor unions.
THE real reason for America's Great Regression was political. As income and wealth became more concentrated in fewer hands, American politics reverted to what Marriner S. Eccles, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, described in the 1920s, when people "with great economic power had an undue influence in making the rules of the economic game." With hefty campaign contributions and platoons of lobbyists and public relations spinners, America's executive class has gained lower tax rates while resisting reforms that would spread the gains from growth.
Yet the rich are now being bitten by their own success. Those at the top would be better off with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than a large share of one that's almost dead in the water.
The economy cannot possibly get out of its current doldrums without a strategy to revive the purchasing power of America's vast middle class. The spending of the richest 5 percent alone will not lead to a virtuous cycle of more jobs and higher living standards. Nor can we rely on exports to fill the gap. It is impossible for every large economy, including the United States, to become a net exporter.
Reviving the middle class requires that we reverse the nation's decades-long trend toward widening inequality. This is possible notwithstanding the political power of the executive class. So many people are now being hit by job losses, sagging incomes and declining home values that Americans could be mobilized.
Moreover, an economy is not a zero-sum game. Even the executive class has an enlightened self-interest in reversing the trend; just as a rising tide lifts all boats, the ebbing tide is now threatening to beach many of the yachts. The question is whether, and when, we will summon the political will. We have summoned it before in even bleaker times.
As the historian James Truslow Adams defined the American Dream when he coined the term at the depths of the Great Depression, what we seek is "a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone."
That dream is still within our grasp.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve aren't new. For years I've received a well-organized volley of vitriolic e-mails every time I mention Ben Bernanke. I dismissed them as missives from the lunatic fringe, at least until recently.
On Aug. 16, while speaking in Iowa, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a Republican presidential candidate, took the demonization of Mr. Bernanke to a new level. He declared in much-quoted remarks -- and to appreciative laughter from the crowd -- that "we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas," and that Mr. Bernanke's monetary policy was "almost treacherous -- or treasonous, in my opinion."
The next day, in New Hampshire, Mr. Perry was less inflammatory but more pointed. "They should open their books up," he said of the Fed. "They should be transparent so that the people of the United States know what they are doing."
Despite getting in "trouble" for calling Mr. Bernanke a traitor, as Mr. Perry subsequently put it, Mr. Perry vaulted to the top of polls and is now the unofficial Republican front-runner. Representative Michele Bachmann, the winner of the Iowa straw poll, has been burnishing her anti-Bernanke credentials, too, criticizing the Fed as "opaque" and reminding voters in South Carolina that she's against "printing" money.
Nor are such sentiments confined to Republican presidential candidates looking for quick political gain. Last week, I bumped into an acquaintance I've always considered thoughtful and intelligent. He, too, lit into Mr. Bernanke and the Fed with great fervor. He quoted the Austrian School, the once-obscure but newly vocal group of zealous free-market economists who trace their roots to the Hapsburg Empire, disdain the scientific method in economics and blame the Fed for the financial crisis and the faltering recovery.
No one in government, including the quasi-independent Federal Reserve chairman, should be above criticism. But if Mr. Bernanke is going to be the centerpiece of such a heated debate, it should be conducted on the facts. And in that respect, "The level of ignorance among some of the Republican presidential candidates about monetary policy is stunning," Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University, said this week. "Mr. Perry has been taken to task for his choice of language, but not for the substance of his remarks, which is outrageous." (Mr. Gertler said he was a political independent but considered himself a friend of Mr. Bernanke, a Republican.) Even President Obama was curiously restrained in coming to Mr. Bernanke's defense, saying in a CNN interview only that Mr. Perry should be "a little more careful about what you say." Although the Fed only belatedly identified the banks that received many billions of dollars of emergency loans during the crisis -- for which it has rightly been taken to task -- the Fed could hardly have been more transparent than it was recently about monetary policy.
It's hard to believe the Fed's critics have read the minutes of the Aug. 9 Fed Board and Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which were released this week. They may not read like a Robert Ludlum thriller, but they're nothing if not transparent. They spell out in great detail the Fed's reaction to the latest discouraging unemployment data, tepid economic growth and stock market volatility, including specific measures that might be used to address these problems.
Some members thought none of these measures would do any good. A majority nonetheless thought that something needed to be done, and chose to announce that the Fed would keep interest rates low for at least two years -- "forward guidance," in Fed-speak -- as a "possible way to reduce interest rates." Others wanted to peg the duration of low rates to a specific unemployment target, something the board deferred to a two-day meeting in September, when it will also consider other policy options.
The minutes provide a detailed portrait of a well-intentioned group of economists struggling to eke the maximum benefit from a dwindling and largely untested arsenal of monetary options, hardly a treasonous cabal bent on secretly conspiring to inflate its way to -- what? World domination?
The Fed has never in its history provided such explicit forward guidance, and so far that has had exactly the effect the Fed hoped for. Longer-term interest rates have dropped, with 10-year rates dipping below 2 percent for the first time in over half a century. This is significant, since it reduces borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. The stock market seems to have stabilized, at least for the moment. Though the Fed has been moving toward more openness for some time, Mr. Bernanke "has been the most open and transparent Fed chairman in history," Mr. Gertler asserted.
It's also hard to fathom what Mr. Perry means when he calls for the Fed to "open its books up." It publicly releases its current balance sheet every Thursday at approximately 4:30 p.m., and it's available on the Fed's Web site. Mr. Perry's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.
The charge that the Fed is "printing money" seems to be shorthand for recklessly risking or even seeking inflation. That notion "is complete nonsense," Robert E. Hall, a senor fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution and professor of economics at Stanford, told me. "But it must be exciting to accuse him of things he hasn't done."
As Mr. Bernanke noted in his recent policy speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., "we expect inflation to settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit less." Inflation in July was 3.63 percent, almost double the optimal rate, but this was largely because of higher oil prices stemming from turmoil in the Middle East and supply shortages from the earthquake in Japan, both transitory events. Inflation was barely over 2 percent before the earthquake and was negative for nine months in 2009.
If the inflation rate doesn't drop in the next six months or so, Mr. Bernanke should be held accountable. But meanwhile, "the candidates have been trying to tie low rates to higher inflation, but the facts just aren't there," Mr. Gertler said. "With short-term rates near zero, there's been no inflation to speak of for the past three years."
As for economic growth and employment, Mr. Bernanke has said repeatedly that they have been disappointing. If anything, that's an argument for further monetary stimulus, a subject the Fed said it would revisit in September. No one on the Fed's board, not even the three members who dissented from the more explicit forward guidance, proposed that the Fed actually tighten monetary policy. "No one I consider a serious economist favors tightening" now, Mr. Hall said.
"Our economy is suffering today from an extraordinarily high level of long-term unemployment, with nearly half of the unemployed having been out of work for more than six months," Mr. Bernanke stressed at Jackson Hole -- something worth pondering this Labor Day weekend.
He also cautioned that the Fed could do only so much: "Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank. To achieve economic and financial stability, U.S. fiscal policy must be placed on a sustainable path that ensures that debt relative to national income is at least stable or, preferably, declining over time."
In other words, our political leaders and those who aspire to replace them should be debating the fiscal policies that will put Americans to work in the short term and reduce the deficit in the long term -- not bashing the Fed.
I fear it's going to get uglier as the presidential campaign intensifies. Many voters seem determined to find a scapegoat for the financial crisis and its aftermath, and some candidates are only too willing to pander by serving up Mr. Bernanke. He hasn't commented publicly, and friends say he's taking the attacks in stride. Still, "as a human being, this has to be exasperating," Mr. Gertler said. "What he cares about is his place in history as a central banker."
While debate continues about the Fed's role preceding the collapse of Lehman Brothers, during the crisis that followed "all serious economists think he did a brilliant job in trying circumstances like no one else had ever seen," Mr. Gertler said, and Mr. Hall agreed with that assessment. "At the height of the crisis he slept in his office," Mr. Gertler continued. "He was working around the clock. Can you imagine what it feels like now being called a traitor?"
Correction: September 7, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Common Sense column on Saturday, about criticism of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, misstated the effect of the Fed's recent interest rate guidance on Treasury note yields. It was the yield on the 10-year note -- not the two-year note -- that dipped below 2 percent for the first time in over half a century. (The yield on the two-year note is hovering around 0.2 percent.)

Full text: News that the economy added zero jobs in August raises the chances that the Federal Reserve will announce another round of stimulus when it meets in two weeks, Fed-watchers say, most likely by pushing down long-term interest rates.
Cheaper credit could give the economy a boost -- and prompt more hiring -- by encouraging more borrowing, so companies and consumers have more money to spend. But with interest rates already low, it isn't certain how much this might help the economy, though proponents of more action by the Fed argue that this is better than not trying.
The central bank has already undertaken a spate of unprecedented measures to reinvigorate growth, including two large rounds of asset purchases. At its August meeting, many Fed policy makers expressed interest in engaging in further easing measures, but could not agree what to do.
This dismal job report may spur them to action.
"I just don't think the Fed will sit idly as momentum fizzles in this recovery," said Dana Saporta, a United States economist at Credit Suisse. "We fully expect some more action from the committee later this month."
The Fed is running low on ammunition, though, and given political attacks on its accommodative measures thus far, its options are especially constrained.
As a result, economists predict that the Fed will change the composition of the assets on its balance sheet, instead of expanding its size as it has in the past. Right now the Federal Reserve holds about $1.7 trillion in United States Treasury securities, of a vast array. Some mature in a few days, and others in more than 10 years. Many economists are guessing that the central bank will start selling off the ones that mature soon, and buying up more Treasuries that mature later.
Buying more longer-term Treasuries increases the demand for longer-term issues. And as their prices rise, the interest rates on those securities fall, as do many other interest rates across the economy that are pegged to the Treasury rate.
In addition to stimulating the economy with cheaper credit, lower long-term interest rates could encourage investment in riskier assets, like stocks. After all, if 10-year Treasuries don't offer much in the way of returns, investors will seek higher returns elsewhere. If investors do start buying up riskier assets, those asset prices rise. Consumers then see that their portfolios are worth more, causing them to feel richer and so more comfortable with spending. This is known as the wealth effect.
There are limits to how aggressive the Fed can be in swapping out short-term securities for longer-term ones. If it sells too many shorter term notes, then short-term interest rates will rise, and the Fed has already promised markets that it will keep short-term rates near zero for the next two years.
Plus, after two rounds of quantitative easing and a worldwide flight to safety, longer term interest rates are already at historical lows of about 2 percent. It is not clear that lowering them further would do much to encourage more investment in riskier assets, or to increase lending.
"The cost of borrowing is not the problem," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics. "The problem is that there are not creditworthy borrowers, and that businesses don't want to invest because they're concerned about the economic outlook."
Additionally, if investors do start increasing their investments in assets with higher returns, they may pour more money into commodities like oil. And commodity prices are already higher today than they were a year ago; pushing energy and food prices further up could actually discourage consumers from spending.
Other options that Fed might consider include lowering the interest rate it pays banks on excess reserves to encourage them to lend more, but many economists doubt that this would have substantial effects on growth. A more aggressive option would be to raise its medium-term target for inflation.
If prices are expected to rise, banks, businesses and consumers will be more eager to spend their money before it loses value. That could have positive effects throughout the economy, since spending means more demand for goods and services, which means companies need to hire more employees, which means more spending, and so on.
Additionally, inflation would lower the value of many people's debt burdens and so help with the painful process of deleveraging.
The problem, though, is that inflation has some major downsides, too -- especially if coupled with sluggish growth, as seen during the "stagflation" of the 1970s. Not having a good sense of how much your next gallon of milk or gas will cost is stressful, particularly if your wages aren't rising to match the higher prices. And some economists contend that raising inflation would only defer, not eliminate, the nation's problems.
"People who say we should get the inflation rate up to 5 percent forget that there's a second half of that policy: bringing it back down again," said Allan H. Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon and a Fed historian. "Raising it, that's the fun part. Lowering it, that's the painful part. At some time in the future you're going to have that pain. Why is it better later than now?"
Mr. Meltzer, like many other economists, argues that any further Fed actions will have little effect on the economy.
Even Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, stated in a speech last week that most of the tools that could be used to increase growth are "outside the province of the central bank."
In other words, said Ms. Saporta, "the Fed is putting the ball back in Congress's court."

Full text: Buenos Aires
ARGENTINA may seem like one of the last countries on earth to offer lessons for dealing with economic malaise. Once the eighth-largest economy in the world, it steadily slid through the 20th century, thanks to decades of repressive dictatorships and inconsistent market experiments. This ended ignominiously in 2001, when it defaulted on $100 billion in sovereign debt, plunging over half its 35 million people into poverty.
That, at least, is the Argentina people know. Since then, it has performed an economic U-turn -- an achievement largely unnoticed outside Latin America, but one that President Obama and Congress should look to for inspiration.
Argentina is not without problems, but its recent economic record speaks for itself: the economy has grown by over 6 percent a year for seven of the last eight years, unemployment has been cut to under 8 percent today from over 20 percent in 2002, and the poverty level has fallen by almost half over the last decade. The streets of Buenos Aires are choked with cars as Argentines are on track to buy some 800,000 new vehicles this year; the wine mecca of Mendoza is full of high-end tasting rooms, hotels and restaurants offering regional haute cuisine; and plasma TVs and BlackBerrys have become household staples among the urban middle class.
Argentina has regained its prosperity partly out of dumb luck: a commodity price boom has vastly benefitted this soy, corn and wheat producer. But it has also prospered thanks to smart economic measures. The government intervened to keep the value of its currency low, which boosts local industry by making Argentina's exports cheaper abroad while keeping foreign imports expensive.
It then taxed those imports and exports, using the money to pay for a New Deal-like public works binge, increasing government spending to 25 percent of G.D.P. today from 14 percent in 2003. As a result, the country has 400,000 new low-income housing units, as well as a long-delayed, 235-mile highway between the northern cities of Rosario and Cordoba.
It has also strengthened its social safety net: the Universal Child Allowance, started in 2009 with support from both the ruling party and the opposition, gives 1.9 million low-income families a monthly stipend of about $42 per child, which helps increase consumption. Because the amount depends in part on how often the child attends school, it is also likely to improve the country's long-term educational performance.
The results have also paid off politically: President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner recently won about 50 percent of the vote in an open primary against nine other presidential candidates.
Why have Argentines embraced bigger government? In part because the preceding era showed how poorly austerity measures -- the sort now being pushed by conservatives in the United States -- promote growth. In the late 1990s, Argentina cut government spending drastically on the order of its lenders at the International Monetary Fund. Predictably, between 1998 and 2002, Argentina's economy shrank by almost 20 percent. It was only after Argentina turned its back on these austerity demands, and defaulted on its debt, that it began to recover.
Of course, Argentina is far from perfect: the import and export taxes have scared away some foreign investment, while high spending has pushed inflation well over 20 percent. There are also problems with the way Argentina is run: corruption, government opacity, authoritarian tendencies, confiscatory taxes and a temptation to tweak unpleasant inflation statistics. And it would be laughable to suggest that the United States follow its lead and default on its debt.
But Argentina still offers valuable lessons. For one thing, extreme cost-cutting during a stagnant economic period will only inhibit growth. And government spending to promote local industry, pro-job infrastructure programs and unemployment benefits does not turn a country into a kind of Soviet parody. It puts money in the pockets of average citizens, who then spend it and spur the economy. Spending cuts need to be made when times improve -- an imperative Argentina is struggling with now -- but not before.
Argentina is hardly a perfect parallel for the United States. But the stark difference between its austere policies and low growth of the late 1990s and the pro-government, high-growth 2000s offers a test case for how to get an economy moving again. Washington would do well to pay attention.

Full text: 7:45 p.m. Updated When Representative Michele Bachmann hits the campaign trail, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas is He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
Mrs. Bachmann never mentions her rival Mr. Perry, who in a matter of weeks since he entered the Republican race for the 2012 nomination has captured a fair share of her Tea Party base.
But a political action committee that supports Mrs. Bachmann is not nearly so discreet. An advertisement it has created attacks Mr. Perry for raising spending in Texas and borrowing to cover deficits. "There is an honest conservative," the ad concludes, "and she's not Rick Perry."
Bob Harris, a founder of Keep Conservatives United, an independent group that created the spot, said it will begin airing Wednesday on television stations in South Carolina. The ad opens with an image of Gov. Perry in a cowboy hat and the question, "Tea Party Guy?"
Mr. Harris, who said he has no connection with the Bachmann campaign, said he acted because Mr. Perry had upstaged Mrs. Bachmann's victory in the much-watched Iowa straw poll Aug. 13. "He hurt her momentum coming out of Iowa, and I don't think anyone responded to it until now," he said.
Mr. Perry's campaign hit back hard Thursday afternoon, disputing point by point what it called false claims in the ad. "Gov. Perry is a proven fiscal conservative," his spokesman, Ray Sullivan, said in a statement.
The ad asserts that state spending in Texas doubled since Mr. Perry became governor in 2000.
The governor's campaign responded that the state budget passed for the for the two-year period 2012-13 is $80.5 billion, up from $55.7 billion in 2000-01. But those figures, it said, are not adjusted for inflation and population growth.
The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that using adjusted figures, state spending under Mr. Perry has increased 4.2 percent every two years, faster than inflation and population increases -- but the portion of the budget over which the governor has most influence, general revenue spending, did fall over the past decade, adjusted for inflation and population growth.
The attack ad is evidence that the Republican race is entering a new phase as the field -- particularly the most conservative candidates all seeking Tea Party support -- attempt to sharp draw distinction with their rivals. The sparks will no doubt continue flying when Mr. Perry makes his first appearance in a national debate of the candidates Sept. 7.
The ad is also a sign of things to come, as such so-called super PACs, which can raise unlimited funds, ramp up their activity and begin spending the millions of dollars they have already raised for this presidential campaign.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: TOKYO -- As Japan's fiscally conservative finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda long sounded the alarm on the nation's ballooning government debt. It is more than twice the size of its $5 trillion economy -- and rated more risky than that of Italy and Spain.
Now, after Mr. Noda was elected Japan's prime minister this week in response to the nation's natural and nuclear disasters, the question is whether he can administer his prescription: raise taxes while reining in spending.
"We will no longer spend wastefully as if we are pouring buckets of water into a sieve," Mr. Noda declared in a speech on Monday just before Japan's ruling Democratic Party elevated him to the top job.
But that political resolve could prove hard to sustain -- and not simply because of the systemic weaknesses that have resulted in six prime ministers in the last five years.
This is a country that was already addicted to its public spending, even before the huge needs of the postquake reconstruction. The last time the Japanese government ran a budget surplus was in 1992, almost two decades ago. Tax income now covers less than half of Japan's annual budget.
Mr. Noda's call for fiscal restraint is timely, given the global context. Last month, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's stripped the United States of its top credit ranking, saying political paralysis in Washington was making the country less creditworthy. In Europe, bond investors make daily sport of handicapping the relative risks of the debt loads shouldered by members of the euro monetary union.
"Sovereign risk is spreading to, and starting to engulf, large economies that were previously unaffected," Hideo Kumao, chief economist at the Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said in a recent research note.
For years, Japan has managed its gargantuan debt load, and bond buyers have been willing to lend the government money at some of the world's lowest interest rates. But for various reasons -- including that low tax rate and Japan's aging, shrinking population -- the borrowing binge is looking unsustainable.
On July 23, Moody's Investors Service lowered Japan's credit rating by one notch, to a level two grades below the top rating, saying weak prospects for economic growth, as well as its recent disasters, made it difficult for the government to tackle its debt.
In the near term, though, Mr. Noda's government has little choice but to spend on postquake reconstruction. The government estimates that losses could reach as much as 20 trillion yen ($260 billion) just for the natural disasters, excluding costs from the continuing nuclear crisis at Fukushima.
That means spending on a scale unprecedented even for Japan, whose decades of public works projects are a big reason that the national debt is expected to reach 228 percent of its gross domestic product this year. That is far higher than even debt-saddled Italy, at 118 percent, and the United States, at 92 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.
And in trying to raise taxes, Mr. Noda must contend with a painful historical precedent: an increase in the consumption tax meant to help finance rebuilding after the 1995 earthquake in Kobe snuffed out a nascent economic recovery. The consumption tax has not been raised since.
That is probably why in his speech on Monday, he shied away from using the word "tax" entirely. "If there is a revenue shortfall, we may have to ask the public for help," was the closest he ventured.
The precarious standing of the ruling Democratic Party, whose ratings have slumped after two unpopular prime ministers, has made politicians adverse to any move that might anger voters.
A particular headache for Mr. Noda is a party heavyweight who has turned rebel: Ichiro Ozawa, a longtime advocate of robust government spending to prop up growth, and a fierce opponent of raising taxes.
Mr. Ozawa backed the second-place candidate in the party ballot, and to appease him Mr. Noda is expected to tone down the fiscal hawkishness and hand out cabinet posts to some of Mr. Ozawa's allies. The new cabinet may be named as soon as Friday in Tokyo.
"We expect that, unless economic uncertainty is wiped out completely, a tax rate increase will be quite difficult next year to finance reconstruction projects," said Masaaki Kanno, an economist for JPMorgan Securities.
Why does Japan's debt burden matter? After all, despite Japan's highest debt-to-gross-domestic- product ratio, and less-than-stellar debt ratings -- a couple rungs below even the downgraded United States -- Japanese bond yields remain the lowest among advanced economies. This signals that bond buyers, far from seeing Japan on the fiscal brink, regard the Japanese government as exceptionally creditworthy.
"Japan is not Greece, or even the United States," Akira Kojima, a senior fellow at a Tokyo-based private policy research organization, the Japan Center for Economic Research, said in a research note. "Japan can finance its deficit on its own."
Mr. Kojima referred to the current-account surplus Japan has run for most of the last three decades, selling and investing more overseas than the other way round. And Japan's notably thrifty households sit on 1,500 trillion yen ($20 trillion) in savings. The Japanese government is in deep debt, but the rest of Japan has ample money to spare.
And Japanese investors have long been happy to buy up government bonds. In contrast to Greece and other afflicted economies in the euro zone that are heavily indebted to foreign creditors, 60 percent of Japan's government bonds are held by Japanese banks, insurance companies and pension funds. An additional 20 percent or so is owned by governmental organizations and the Bank of Japan.
Throw in individual investors, and 95 percent of Japan's debt is held domestically. That makes the country less vulnerable to outside pressures that might cause it to default. And in theory, it gives the government plenty of leeway to print money -- a spendthrift's prerogative it holds in common with the United States.
"Unlike the peripheral euro zone countries, where bond yields can easily spike without official support, Japan still boasts the luxury of being able to issue debt in a market full of willing buyers," said Cameron Umetsu, Tokyo-based economist at UBS Securities. "This is one luxury the government should exploit while it can."
While it can. That is the crucial caveat.
After the collapse of its boom of the 1970s and '80s, Japan has since the 1990s poured yen after yen into stimulus programs trying to revive the economy, while letting tax revenue atrophy.
And now, demographics are taking a toll. Social security and pension costs have soared as Japan's baby boomers reach retirement, while the birth rate is so slow that the population is actually shrinking.
Not only are there going to be fewer taxpayers, but Japan's savings rate is falling, as more pensioners start dipping into their nest eggs, shrinking the pool of money available for government bond purchases.
And it is unclear, analysts say, how much longer Japanese banks and pension funds will keep up their appetite for government bonds that bring in little interest.
The Bank of Japan could buy up more government bonds to make up for a slack in demand, but within the bank there is strong opposition to such moves, which many fear could fuel inflation.
All of which is why analysts see little chance of any bold fiscal moves from Mr. Noda's new government. "It's as if the crisis that faces Japan's finances has been completely forgotten," Masataka Nakajima, a special researcher at the Japan Securities Research Institute wrote in a recent report.
Mr. Noda, as evident from his "sieve" speech, hasn't forgotten. But he had a big distraction right now: putting together yet another emergency budget for Japan's crippled economy.

Full text: Manufacturing unexpectedly grew in August and fewer Americans filed new claims for jobless benefits last week despite a slump in confidence that threatened to push the economy back into recession, economic reports showed on Thursday.
Other data on Thursday showed a drop in second-quarter productivity and an unexpected decline in construction spending. But those reports were counterbalanced by solid sales from automakers and retailers.
Taken together, the reports were the latest to suggest the economy remained on a slow-growth path and offered hope it would dodge a recession.
"I am breathing a little sigh of relief that the bit of data that we have had over the course of August is weak but not giving the recessionary type of signal," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh.
More light will be shed on the health of the economy when the government releases its closely watched employment report for August on Friday.
The Institute for Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity edged down to 50.6 from 50.9 in July, confounding economists' expectations of a drop to 48.5. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in the nation's factory sector.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000, to 409,000. The drop in claims offered no sign layoffs have picked up because of slumping business and consumer confidence after a steep plunge in the stock market last month and Standard & Poor's decision to strip the nation of its AAA credit rating.
But claims are still above the 400,000 usually associated with a stable labor market, and crucial details of the I.S.M. survey, including production, new orders and employment, were weak.
"The I.S.M. survey is consistent with an economy staggering forward at a weak pace of growth. When the economy tips into recession, the I.S.M. index usually drops into the low 40s," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.
Lingering weakness in the economy was underscored by nonfarm productivity falling at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2008.
Normally, a slowdown in productivity suggests businesses have to add workers to meet production. But against the backdrop of slow economic growth, it implies businesses might have to cut costs to protect profits.
Businesses could already be facing some cost pressures. Unit labor costs grew at a 3.3 percent rate in the second quarter, a puzzling development given the high unemployment rate.
"In our view, the rise reflects a labor market that has less spare capacity than may be commonly perceived, in which case, rising labor costs are likely to continue," said Troy Davig, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
But the pace is still slower than the 6.2 percent rate in the first quarter, indicating wage pressures remain too contained to stoke a broader rise in inflation.
Finally, construction spending fell unexpectedly in July as public construction outlays dropped to their lowest level since December 2006 and private spending also sagged, the Commerce Department said.
Construction spending fell 1.3 percent, to an annual rate of $789.5 billion, the largest drop since January. However, June's construction spending was revised to a 1.6 percent increase rather than the previously reported 0.2 increase.
Economists had expected construction spending to rise 0.2 percent in July.

How to Deflate a Gold Bubble (That Might Not Even Exist)

Abstract: According to Professor Shiller, a crucial driver of a bubble in today's modern age is the Internet and media. Is gold still being driven by fundamentals or is it a speculators' delight? Because of this uncertainty, regulators have acted as hesitantly as they did in the case of the Internet and housing bubbles.

Full text: Gold is caught in a frenzy.
The price of gold reached a record high of $1,917.90 an ounce last week, not adjusted for inflation, and then promptly plummeted by about $120 an ounce. The volatile trading is again spurring claims that gold is in a bubble, one that will pop badly.
As with past booms in housing prices and Internet stocks, the four-year surge in gold prices raises the same fundamental questions for market regulators. How should they react? Should they react at all? How do they even know if a bubble exists?
It is clear that speculation has been driving gold's rise. People are buying gold as either a hedge against inflation or economic calamity or solely because they think the price will rise. As evidence of this speculation, the World Gold Council reports that demand for gold bullion bars more than doubled from 2009, to about 850 metric tons a year. This is largely gold that is bought and sits there as people wait for price increases. Indeed, demand for gold in industry and for jewelry has actually declined by 18 percent from 2004, to about 2,500 metric tons a year, according to the World Gold Council.
This speculation is aided by the financial revolution. Previously, gold could be bought by retail investors only through dealers and street shops. Now anyone can go on the Internet, click and buy gold in the market through exchange traded funds. These funds will buy gold on the investor's behalf, and now hold about 2,250 metric tons of gold - or nearly a year's worth of output.
Speculation alone doesn't necessarily mean that gold is in a bubble. Gold is historically viewed as a protection against inflation and tumultuous economic times. It is a way to diversify a portfolio and hedge these risks. The price rise can be explained by people's rational betting that these phenomena will occur. This is particularly true in light of the heightened risks to the economy because of events in Europe and the still-lingering effects from the financial crisis in the United States.
But like paper money, gold is worth only what people believe it is worth, and because of this, it is sometimes referred to as the barbarous relic. You can't eat gold. Its industrial uses are limited. If someone else doesn't assign the same value to gold that you do, you are out of luck. For those who predict it will be valuable if society completely collapses, guns and canned goods might come in handier.
Gold's relative uselessness has helped spur talk of a bubble. The problem for regulators is whether this speculation is natural, prudent hedging or people irrationally piling ever more into a bubbly asset.
After all, Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, speculated that the stock market might be "irrationally exuberant" in 1996, well before the actual bubble took hold. As with the Internet bubble, we will know if a bubble truly existed only if and when gold falls.
In his book "Irrational Exuberance," Robert J. Shiller of Yale University tried to set forth a test for spotting bubbles. Bubbles are created when people buy in to the next great thing. They accept that this is a game-changing asset - like housing or the Internet - that cannot fail. As more people buy the asset, the speculation and frenzy increase.
According to Professor Shiller, a crucial driver of a bubble in today's modern age is the Internet and media.
If you watch cable television, it would certainly appear that gold is in a bubble. Commercials abound for buying gold. Commentators on CNBC talk about gold hitting $2,400 an ounce, which would be a genuine record (the previous high of $850 in 1980 would be about $2,300 today, adjusted for inflation). In fairness, other CNBC commentators have said that this is foolish and that gold prices are too high. Still, the marketing of gold to the masses is an ominous sign.
Even after the downturn in prices last week, it is not clear if gold has hit its peak. Is gold still being driven by fundamentals or is it a speculators' delight?
Because of this uncertainty, regulators have acted as hesitantly as they did in the case of the Internet and housing bubbles. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange recently raised margin requirements for gold, the amount of money you can borrow to buy gold. The Singapore exchange also raised margin requirements last week. Other exchanges in other countries have not acted similarly, leading to differences that will drive gold trading to those markets.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the primary regulator of the gold market in the United States, does not appear to want to act. The agency is following form, as it also refused to act forcefully when oil jumped to more than $145 a barrel in 2008. It seems hesitant to quash speculation. The commodities regulator, though, could force American exchanges to further raise margin requirements, reducing leverage and the ability of investors to buy more gold. The agency would also have to act to limit the gold acquired individually and by the E.T.F.'s. All of these measures would have to be coordinated and put into effect on a global basis.
Those would also be very aggressive acts to attack a problem that some say doesn't even exist. This analysis could be applied to other commodities that have had huge run-ups in past years, including oil, food and other metals like silver.
In other words, not only is it hard to spot a bubble, but the measures to fight it, like restrictions on leverage and holdings, are hard and controversial to put into effect. Limiting the type of media barrages we see is also impossible in a free society.
Yet if regulators are going to stop the next bubble, they will need to act aggressively. Of course, they shouldn't act in every circumstance, but when we see volatility and speculation as is the case of gold, acting to curb these forces through limiting leverage in cooperation with international regulators would be a prudent course. This would ensure that if a crash does come, it does not have aftereffects on banks and other institutions. Even if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is hesitant to take such steps, it could, as an initial foray, take to the media to try to "talk down" the speculation.
Otherwise, we're left hoping, without much basis, that people have learned that this time will not be different, something not much in evidence in the case of gold.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: No one knows what to do to fix the economy.
At their meeting this month, Federal Reserve policy makers were in strong disagreement, with some advocating aggressive options to stimulate the economy and others pressing to do nothing, according to minutes released on Tuesday.
At the time of the Aug. 9 meeting, the Fed disclosed three dissenting votes -- unusual given that most decisions are reached by consensus -- but it was not known until Tuesday that there was such a broad array of disagreement and such vigorous debate about the options.
In the end, the Federal Open Market Committee took a middle ground, agreeing to keep interest rates near zero through mid-2013.
In addition to debate about the Fed's approach to aiding the recovery, the meeting was dominated by sobering assessments of the economy's disappointing performance this summer and downgrades for growth in the next few months. Since the meeting, the government reported that the economy expanded only 0.7 percent in the first six months of the year.
The meeting minutes for the most part do not identify the members or their views. But some members wanted to engage in another round of so-called quantitative easing, or huge asset purchases, which has become a charged topic in the Republican presidential primary campaign. Some wanted merely to change the composition of the assets the Fed already has. Some wanted to reduce the interest rate the Fed pays banks for their excess reserve balances.
And some wanted to do nothing.
"Some participants judged that none of the tools available to the committee would likely do much to promote a faster economic recovery," the minutes said.
This broad array of proposals may shed some light on why Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, spent so much of his long-awaited speech last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., talking about what Congress, rather than the Fed, should do to help the economy: because even within the Fed there is no consensus on the correct course.
At the Aug. 9 meeting, the members ultimately decided to stretch out their next gathering, in September, to a two-day meeting in part because there was so much disagreement, and Fed officials wanted more time to debate their options.
Officials also came to a temporary policy compromise by giving markets clearer guidance on how long interest rates would continue to hover around zero. Some committee members said they wanted to set a calendar deadline, and others preferred to instead peg interest rates to a specific rate of unemployment or inflation.
The calendar-deadline version won out, and in its public statement the Fed pledged to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate at "exceptionally low levels," for "at least through mid-2013."
There were three dissenters: Richard W. Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota and Charles I. Plosser.
Not only did they disagree with the mid-2013 language, they all disagreed for slightly different reasons.
Mr. Fisher said he did not think further monetary easing would do much, since he "felt that it was chiefly nonmonetary factors, such as uncertainty about fiscal and regulatory initiatives, that were restraining domestic capital expenditures, job creation and economic growth."
Mr. Kocherlakota said he did not believe more easing was appropriate because unemployment had fallen and inflation had risen over the previous year.
And Mr. Plosser worried that the "until at least mid-2013" language might indicate that the Fed's actions were "no longer contingent on how the economic outlook evolved," that the Fed's outlook was "excessively negative" and that the measure would be ineffective at stimulating growth in any case.
The minutes also said that policy makers had expected economic conditions over the summer to have been much better than they turned out and that the Fed was downgrading its projections for economic growth for 2011 and 2012.
Even though some temporary factors might be weighing down the economy, the minutes said, there was worry that "the underlying strength of the economic recovery remained uncertain."
The participants at the recent Fed meeting did not believe the economy was on the brink of another recession, but some unnamed members indicated that, "with the recovery still somewhat tentative, the economy was vulnerable to adverse shocks."
Fed officials voiced particular concern about "a deterioration in labor market conditions," and debated what the longer-term consequences of such high and sustained levels of unemployment might be.
Staff members slightly raised their forecasts for inflation for the rest of this year, indicating that the central bank might be especially unlikely to engage in another round of major asset purchases. These purchases generally raise prices, and the Fed has previously engaged in such quantitative easing in part because policy makers worried that prices might otherwise start falling.

Full text: Europe weighed in at the central bankers conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Saturday, with the president of the European Central Bank and president of the International Monetary Fund calling on governments to do more to address the deteriorating world economy.
"The downside risks to the global economy are increasing," Christine Lagarde, president of the I.M.F. and former French minister of finance, said during a joint appearance with Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank.
In the blunter of the two presentations, Ms. Lagarde said that economic risks "have been aggravated further by a deterioration in confidence and a growing sense that policymakers do not have the conviction, or simply are not willing, to take the decisions that are needed."
Mr. Trichet avoided any mention of the European debt crisis that threatens the stability of the global financial system and may define his eight-year tenure, which ends on Oct. 31. Nor did he mention the extraordinary measures that the central bank has undertaken recently, buying Italian and Spanish bonds on the open market to contain runaway borrowing costs.
Instead, Mr. Trichet suggested that Europe's problems are fundamentally a question of which governments have taken steps to become competitive and which have not.
"Greece, Portugal and Ireland, in particular, had progressively lost competitiveness vis-a-vis their main trading partners in the euro area," Mr. Trichet said. "Germany is now an example of how big the dividends of reform can be if structural adjustment is made a strategic priority and implemented with sufficient patience."
Mr. Trichet and Ms. Lagarde were speaking at the annual central bankers conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Their calls for governments to take more responsibility for fixing the economic crisis were in line with comments Friday by Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who on Friday blamed politicians for disrupting the financial system.
Ms. Lagarde, who perhaps has more freedom to speak her mind than a central banker, chastised political leaders for not doing more since the financial crisis began in 2008. Countries need to find a balance between cutting debt and promoting growth, she said.
"Developments this summer have indicated that we are in a dangerous new phase," she continued. "The stakes are clear: we risk seeing the fragile recovery derailed."
She said central banks should continue to pursue a loose monetary policy. "The risk of recession outweighs the risk of inflation," she said.
She also said that banks, whose fragility is a key element of the crisis in Europe, should be recapitalized, forcibly and with public funds if need be. "They must be strong enough to withstand the risks of sovereigns and weak growth," she said. "This is key to cutting the chains of contagion. If it is not addressed, we could easily see the further spread of economic weakness to core countries, or even a debilitating liquidity crisis."
She also complained about European political fractiousness. "The current economic turmoil has exposed some serious flaws in the architecture of the euro zone, flaws that threaten the sustainability of the entire project," she said.
Mr. Trichet, in a scholarly discourse on the elements of economic growth, defended the beleaguered euro project, rejecting criticism that its 17 nations are too diverse to perform well together. He argued that Europe has grown almost as fast and created more jobs in the last decade than the United States.
"Adjusted for population growth, there has been virtually no difference between U.S. and euro area growth over the first decade since the introduction of the single currency," Mr. Trichet said. "The euro area, though, has created more jobs: 14 million compared with 8 million in the U.S." He acknowledged, however, that Europe lags in deregulating its labor market.
Though too polite to criticize his hosts directly, Mr. Trichet said that income inequality is ultimately a threat to society. While the gap between rich and poor has also widened in countries like Germany, tax policies and more generous social programs mean that European countries still tend to be more economically egalitarian than the United States.
"Extremes of income inequality and restricted opportunity challenge our values and strain the fabric of our societies," Mr. Trichet said. "Growth skewed towards the few (or absent for a large minority) risks social tensions, undermines institutions and encourages policy failures of one kind or another."
Mr. Trichet was making his last appearance at Jackson Hole as European Central Bank president. He will hand the post in October to Mario Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy.

Unrest Builds as India Adds a Slowing Economy to Its Corruption Woes

Full text: MUMBAI, India -- For much of the last month, India has been gripped by a raging public debate about how to tackle corruption, which is seen by many here as the country's most important challenge. But a slowing economy may soon overtake corruption as a more pressing problem.
On Thursday, for instance, as the Indian government negotiated with a fasting anticorruption crusader, the country's central bank issued a blunt warning: economic growth could soon fall below 8 percent.
Most countries would be thrilled to have a growth rate of more than 7 percent, but for India, which strode at a 9 percent pace before the financial crisis of 2008 and hit 8.5 percent last year, it would be a significant letdown. Slower growth would mean fewer Indians climbing out of poverty and could help spur greater social unrest.
And it would pose yet another challenge to the global economy, which is increasingly depending on emerging markets like India and China to make up for stagnation in the West.
The Indian slowdown was in the making long before most analysts were concerned about a double-dip recession in industrialized nations. Private investment has been sliding since late last year and once-robust car sales have decreased in recent months. Indian stocks began falling in November and are now down more than 24 percent from their high. Moreover, inflation has been hovering at nearly 10 percent even after the Reserve Bank of India raised interest rates 11 times in less than two years.
"Today, the economy is running on the engine speed achieved some time ago," said R. Gopalakrishnan, an executive director at the Tata Group, India's largest business conglomerate. Stressing that he was speaking for himself and not his company, he added, "It's not sputtering to an end, but it's slowing down."
The new economic worries are occurring while the Indian government has been preoccupied with the biggest protests the country has seen in nearly two decades.
The demonstrations are led by an activist, Anna Hazare, who has been on a hunger strike since Aug. 16. He says he will not eat until the Indian Parliament creates a powerful anticorruption agency known as a Lokpal. His movement has gained a large following in big cities like New Delhi and Mumbai, especially among the middle class and the young.
While corruption, especially in day-to-day dealings between public officials and ordinary citizens, is the primary focus of most protesters, many of Mr. Hazare's supporters have also complained about high inflation and a lack of job opportunities. Some of them say corrupt practices have driven up the price of goods and services and distorted the economy.
"If the Lokpal bill passes, the economic issue will be good," said Sagar Bekal, a 25-year-old construction manager in Mumbai who has organized protest rallies for Mr. Hazare's group, India Against Corruption. "There will be a change -- good social life, things getting much cheaper with corruption being curbed."
Such sentiments, analysts say, reflect the middle class's growing conviction that Indian leaders seem more concerned about reaping the rewards of economic growth for themselves than about improving the country. India has endured a series of large corruption scandals in the last year, involving the auctioning of wireless licenses, the Commonwealth Games of last year and various real estate deals.
"People are so dissatisfied that they want a change," said Harsh Goenka, chairman of RPG Enterprises, a Mumbai-based conglomerate involved in several businesses. "They want a change in governance."
Still, he and others say that the broader economic problems are unlikely to dissipate even if lawmakers agree to create a new anticorruption agency, which is not expected to become an active watchdog for a couple of years. Rather, these people say, the government needs to move quickly to put in place changes to enhance growth, create jobs, tame inflation and improve public services.
That task, of course, has become more urgent and difficult in recent weeks because of rising fears of a double-dip recession in the United States and Europe. But because it is not a big exporter, India is more insulated from global shocks than other developing countries. Still, it relies significantly on foreign capital to meet investment needs.
In a report published on Friday, analysts at Deutsche Bank said India's growth rate could even slip below 7 percent if the United States and European Union fell into a recession.
Some economists worry that the movement to establish a corruption watchdog, which has been fueled by disgruntled youth, may ironically hamper the chances for the kind of changes that would help bolster the economy and the prospects of young Indians. The protests could make the government reluctant or unable to take on politically difficult reforms because it will fear opposition from activists and other political parties.
"What I fear is that this will eat up whatever energy they have," said Ila Patnaik, a senior fellow at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi.
Even before the protests, many analysts had complained that the government, which has been in power for seven years, was doing little to address India's entrenched problems: low agricultural productivity, poor infrastructure, a weak education system that produces graduates with few skills and real estate laws that shortchange farmers and other landowners.
But some business executives and analysts had become more hopeful in recent weeks because policy makers had introduced a bill to give farmers more bargaining power in land deals and suggested that foreign retailers might soon be allowed to open stores in India to help improve farm-to-market logistics. Earlier this month, citing policy changes under way, Goldman Sachs upgraded its rating for India.
Now, analysts said, the government is unlikely to act on the land and retail measures for several months, if not longer. Even as markets elsewhere were relatively stable, India's benchmark Nifty stock index fell 1.9 percent on Friday, to its lowest level in 14 months.
Furthermore, many analysts say the government is unlikely to push big reforms next year because India's largest and one of its poorest states, Uttar Pradesh, will go to the polls in 2012. Federal elections are due in 2014.
Still, some business leaders say the corruption movement has demonstrated that the government, which is run by a coalition led by the Congress Party, may no longer be able to postpone difficult policy decisions. Many of the most vocal protesters at Mr. Hazare's rallies have been people 25 or younger -- a group that makes up about half India's population.
"The middle class has been created; it wasn't there 30 years ago," said Mr. Gopalakrishnan, the Tata executive. "And their aspirations have been created. There is an energy there that has come out of human passion. Being standstill and letting this putter out is not an option."

Fed Chief Says Politics Hurt Markets and Nation

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke said he remained optimistic about future growth -- he gave no indication that the Fed would increase its economic aid programs, though he said the central bank's policy-making board would revisit the issue at a scheduled meeting in September -- but he warned that the government had emerged as perhaps the greatest threat to recovery. A deal reached earlier this month to raise the amount the government can borrow, in exchange for spending cuts of at least $2.1 trillion, would not reduce the debt to a level most economists consider sustainable, and the political brinksmanship preceding the deal led Standard & Poor's to remove long-term Treasury securities from its list of risk-free investments.

Full text: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Friday that the political battle this summer over the federal government's borrowing and spending had disrupted financial markets "and probably the economy as well."
In remarks that went well beyond his previous calls for Congress and the White House to address the nation's long-term fiscal challenges, Mr. Bernanke suggested the process itself was broken.
"The country would be well served by a better process for making fiscal decisions," he said.
Mr. Bernanke said he remained optimistic about future growth -- he gave no indication that the Fed would increase its economic aid programs, though he said the central bank's policy-making board would revisit the issue at a scheduled meeting in September -- but he warned that the government had emerged as perhaps the greatest threat to recovery.
"The quality of economic policy-making in the United States will heavily influence the nation's long-term prospects," Mr. Bernanke said in the much-anticipated speech, delivered at a policy conference held each August here at a resort in Grand Teton National Park.
The turn toward stronger language was welcomed by some lawmakers and observers of the partisan battle that has pitted Republicans seeking to reduce the federal debt through spending cuts against Democrats arguing for a mix of cuts and increases in revenue.
Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, described Mr. Bernanke's remarks as "an emergency intervention."
"It was great to hear him weigh in so strongly," said Ms. MacGuineas. "He's saying what needs to be said, and hopefully people will listen because of the messenger."
But the Fed chairman has no authority over fiscal policy. While he has advised Congress and the administration to make hard choices to bring down spending and deficits, his comments have held little sway in the deliberations.
A deal reached earlier this month to raise the amount the government can borrow, in exchange for spending cuts of at least $2.1 trillion, would not reduce the debt to a level most economists consider sustainable, and the political brinksmanship preceding the deal led Standard & Poor's to remove long-term Treasury securities from its list of risk-free investments.
The battle now is shifting to a special Congressional committee that will negotiate the details of those cuts. President Obama plans to deliver a speech after Labor Day detailing proposals for job creation and spending cuts intended to influence the work of that committee.
On Capitol Hill, Democrats seized on the Fed chairman's remarks to criticize Republicans for what they described as intransigence during the debt ceiling negotiations.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, said in a statement, "I believe that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke was correct today when he observed that partisan brinksmanship over the debt limit damaged financial markets and the American economy."
The White House, while declining to address Mr. Bernanke's remarks specifically, chimed in. "The president has repeatedly expressed in his own right his frustration with the dysfunction and the partisan rancor that we've seen on Capitol Hill that has interfered with the government's ability to address these challenges," said Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman.
Republicans, however, offered little response. And market reaction was muted. Stocks fell in early trading, then gradually recovered. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2 percent to close at 11,284.54. Friday's speech was eagerly anticipated because Mr. Bernanke and his predecessors have made a habit of coming to this conference, hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, to clarify their views on the economy and monetary policy.
The Fed announced earlier this month that it intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero until at least the middle of 2013, a reflection of its forecast that growth will not be fast enough during that period to drive up wages and prices. Many investors had viewed that announcement as a potential prelude to further steps. More than 25 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs, and the government said Friday that the economy expanded at an annual pace of 0.7 percent during the first half of the year, down from an earlier estimate of 0.8 percent.
But Mr. Bernanke, while noting those economic challenges, returned to the language of speeches he gave earlier this year, arguing that the Fed had largely exhausted the power of its monetary policy. "Most of the economic policies that support robust economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank," he said.
While offering his standard disclaimer that the Fed would take any steps necessary, he notably omitted his usual description of those possible measures. He did say, however, that a scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in late September would be extended to two days from one day "to allow a fuller discussion."
Instead, Mr. Bernanke focused on fiscal policy, reiterating his frequent call for fiscal measures that focus on long-term reductions in the federal debt, while avoiding short-term cuts or tax increases that might impede recovery. He also said the government could help to speed recovery through steps that include "good, proactive housing policy."
"Notwithstanding the severe difficulties we currently face, I do not expect the long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to be materially affected by the crisis and the recession if -- and I stress if -- our country takes the necessary steps to secure that outcome," he said.
Mr. Bernanke did not lay blame for the debt ceiling battle on either political party. But his recommendations for future fiscal policy-- particularly the emphasis on the need for continued investment and reducing unemployment -- generally hews closer to Mr. Obama's position than to the views of Congressional Republicans.
Mr. Bernanke elaborated only briefly on his suggestion for a different process to address these issues, suggesting that politicians should consider the establishment of "clear and transparent budget goals, together with budget mechanisms to establish the credibility of these goals."
Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues remain more optimistic about the health of the American economy than forecasters like the International Monetary Fund, one important reason the Fed is reluctant to consider additional measures.
The central bank also maintains an overriding focus on inflation, aiming to keep wages and prices rising no more than about 2 percent a year. The Fed expects inflation to exceed that pace in 2011, then to settle around that level. Additional stimulus could increase the pace above its comfort level.
A growing chorus of economists argues that the Fed should allow higher inflation. Some say that doing so would help to reduce unemployment. Others say that the inflation itself would be beneficial by easing the burden of household debt. Borrowers benefit from inflation because their loans can be repaid with cheaper dollars. But the Fed's leaders so far have not given any indication that they find these arguments compelling.
Concern about inflation contributed to the decisions by three members of the policy-making committee to dissent from the August announcement that rates would likely remain low for at least two more years. The central bank also has become a popular punching bag in the early stages of the Republican presidential primary. Mr. Bernanke opened the conference Thursday night with a brief speech, during which he mentioned that he had attended a rodeo with his wife earlier this week. The announcer, he said, asked the crowd to sing the national anthem even though many were angry about decisions made in Washington.

Full text: Understanding what is happening in the economy is essential in hard times. Yet House Republicans have proposed budget cuts that could cripple or end government surveys. The surveys are used to generate timely and accurate data and answer such basic questions as: Is the economy descending into another recession?
Without such data, business leaders, investors and policy makers would be flying blind.
Every five years, the Census Bureau conducts an Economic Census -- a detailed survey of nearly five million businesses that serves as the benchmark for measuring economic growth and other important indicators, like inflation, productivity and consumer spending. The next Economic Census begins in 2012. House Republicans propose cutting the bureau's budget to $855 million (President Obama requested $1.02 billion).
The Republicans have not said what the bureau should cut. But the Economic Census, which costs $124 million, would almost certainly be hit. Otherwise, the bureau would have to stop core functions already under way, like the resolution program for the 2010 decennial census, by which local governments challenge undercounts.
Representative Hal Rogers of Kentucky, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, has said that given the budget deficit, the bill containing the cuts to the census and other programs is necessary "to move our country in the right direction." He has it backward.
The Census Bureau cuts would increase uncertainty about the state of the economy, the drivers and drags on growth and the effectiveness of business and government policy. Precisely because the data are vital, the United States Chamber of Commerce has called for full financing of the Census Bureau.
The House is expected to take up the bill next month. Other business leaders and groups should join the chamber's call. The Obama administration should raise the alarm, and the Senate must be prepared to provide full financing. Less data on the economy won't do any good.

Abstract: [...] I'm using Mr. Perry -- who has famously threatened Mr. Bernanke with dire personal consequences if he pursues expansionary monetary policy before the 2012 election -- as a symbol of the political intimidation that is killing our last remaining hope for economic recovery. Two weeks ago, the committee that sets monetary policy declared that conditions "are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013" -- that is, it didn't even promise to keep rates low, it just offered an observation about what the state of the economy is likely to be.

Full text: As I write this, investors around the world are anxiously awaiting Ben Bernanke's speech at the annual Fed gathering at Jackson Hole, Wyo. They want to know whether Mr. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, will unveil new policies that might lift the U.S. economy out of what is looking more and more like a quasi-permanent state of depressed demand and high unemployment.
But I'll be shocked if Mr. Bernanke proposes anything significant -- that is, anything likely to make any serious dent in unemployment or offer any serious boost to growth.
Why don't I expect much from Mr. Bernanke? In two words: Rick Perry.
O.K., I don't mean that Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, is personally standing in the way of effective monetary policy. Not yet, anyway. Instead, I'm using Mr. Perry -- who has famously threatened Mr. Bernanke with dire personal consequences if he pursues expansionary monetary policy before the 2012 election -- as a symbol of the political intimidation that is killing our last remaining hope for economic recovery.
To see what I'm talking about, let's ask what policies the Fed actually should be pursuing right now.
Obviously, the U.S. economy remains deeply depressed, and under normal conditions we would expect the Fed to pump it up by cutting interest rates. But the interest rates the Fed normally targets -- basically rates on short-term U.S. government debt -- are already near zero. So what can the Fed do?
Well, in 2000 an economist named Ben Bernanke offered a number of proposals for policy at the "zero lower bound." True, the paper was focused on policy in Japan, not the United States. But America is now very much in a Japan-type economic trap, only more acute. So we learn a lot by asking why Ben Bernanke 2011 isn't taking the advice of Ben Bernanke 2000.
Back then, Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Bank of Japan could get Japan's economy moving with a variety of unconventional policies. These could include: purchases of long-term government debt (to push interest rates, and hence private borrowing costs, down); an announcement that short-term interest rates would stay near zero for an extended period, to further reduce long-term rates; an announcement that the bank was seeking moderate inflation, "setting a target in the 3-4% range for inflation, to be maintained for a number of years," which would encourage borrowing and discourage people from hoarding cash; and "an attempt to achieve substantial depreciation of the yen," that is, to reduce the yen's value in terms of other currencies.
Was Mr. Bernanke on the right track? I think so -- as well I should, since his paper was partly based on my own earlier work. So why isn't the Fed pursuing the agenda its own chairman once recommended for Japan?
Part of the answer is internal dissension. Two weeks ago, the committee that sets monetary policy declared that conditions "are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013" -- that is, it didn't even promise to keep rates low, it just offered an observation about what the state of the economy is likely to be. Yet, even so, the statement faced serious internal opposition, with three inflation hawks on the committee voting against it and calling it a mistake.
The larger answer, however, is outside political pressure. Last year, the Fed actually did institute a policy of buying long-term debt, generally known as "quantitative easing" (don't ask). But it faced a political backlash out of all proportion to its modest effect on the economy, culminating in Mr. Perry's declaration that any further monetary easing before the 2012 election would be "almost treasonous," and that if Mr. Bernanke went ahead and did it, "we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas."
Now just imagine the reaction if the Fed were to act on the other and arguably more important parts of that Bernanke 2000 agenda, targeting a higher rate of inflation and welcoming a weaker dollar. With prominent Republicans like Representative Paul Ryan already denouncing policies that allegedly "debase the dollar," a political firestorm would be guaranteed.
So now you see why I don't expect any substantive policy announcements at Jackson Hole. Back in 2000, Mr. Bernanke accused the Bank of Japan of suffering from "self-induced paralysis"; well, now the Fed is suffering from externally induced paralysis. In effect, it has been politically intimidated into standing by while the economy stagnates. And that's a very, very bad thing.
Political opposition has already crippled fiscal policy; instead of helping to create jobs, the federal government is pulling back, acting as a drag on output and employment.
With the Fed also intimidated into inaction, it's hard to see any end to the ongoing economic disaster.

Abstract: The findings of the poll of Chinese purchasing managers, published by HSBC and with a final figure due next week, showed a reading of 49.8 for August, a touch below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, as Beijing's efforts to cool down the pace of growth began to bear fruit.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Surveys of industrial managers released Tuesday showed that growth could be slowing in China and Germany, raising questions about whether two of the world's most dynamic economies could continue to underpin global output and compensate for weakness in the United States and the rest of Europe.
The data do not yet point to a recession in the fragile euro zone, economists said, and indicate only a moderate cooling of torrid Chinese growth. And several analysts noted that the economic indicators were actually less negative than many had expected. Nonetheless, it has become increasingly clear that Europe cannot expect to grow its way out of the sovereign debt crisis, which has become a weight on the world economy.
"A return to recession is possible," Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, wrote in a note, referring to the European data. "This is bad news for governments' ability to rein in public deficits."
Germany has Europe's most powerful economy, and has been helping the euro zone to grow despite the burden caused by excessive debt in countries like Greece and Italy. China is a crucial market for German machinery and cars, so a slowdown there will also be felt in Europe.
While not expecting a recession, Violante Di Canossa, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note that the data "remains consistent with sluggish growth." She said that the industrial survey for Europe pointed to a slowdown similar to the one in 2003, when there were several quarters of minimal economic improvement, rather than a sharp downturn.
A survey of manufacturers in China showed Tuesday that factory activity had probably contracted slightly in August, as concerns mounted that the country's exports might decline because of high debts and slowing economies in Europe and the United States. The findings underpin the widely held perception that the giant Chinese economy is growing at a more moderate, yet still robust, pace.
The findings of the poll of Chinese purchasing managers, published by HSBC and with a final figure due next week, showed a reading of 49.8 for August, a touch below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, as Beijing's efforts to cool down the pace of growth began to bear fruit.
For the past year and a half, Chinese policy makers have been working to rein in booming growth and the sharp price rises that have accompanied it. Formerly free-flowing bank credit has become harder to obtain, for example, as banks have been instructed to lend less.
Despite being below 50 for the second consecutive month, the HSBC index indicated that China's economy remained on a firm footing. The August reading was an improvement from the 49.3 recorded in July, while a subindex measuring new export orders rose to a three-month high.
The data suggest that China will not suffer a hard landing akin to the sharp slowdown seen in late 2008, Qu Hongbin, a China economist at HSBC, wrote in a note Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a survey of purchasing managers' expectations for output in the euro zone was unchanged at a nearly two-year low, according to preliminary estimates, but was not as bad as analysts had expected.
A separate poll of economists also showed a sharp deterioration in expectations for the euro zone and Germany.
Official statistics last week showed that growth in the second quarter came nearly to a standstill in the euro zone as well as in Germany and France, the region's two largest economies.
Fear that Europe is headed for another slowdown, which would compound the sovereign debt crisis, was responsible for driving down stock markets last week. On Tuesday, by contrast, many of Europe's main stock indexes gained for a second straight day.
A preliminary reading of the euro zone P.M.I. composite output index, compiled by Markit, an information provider in London, was unchanged from July at 51.1. The euro zone manufacturing P.M.I., a gauge of the mood among manufacturers, fell to 49.7 from 50.4 in July, a 23-month low. A reading below 50 suggests that the economy is stalling.
"This drop does not compare with the collapse seen in late 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers," Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. "Nevertheless, the purchasing managers' index does confirm that the euro zone economy is hardly growing now."
Ms. Diron of Ernst & Young said the slowing growth exposed how vulnerable Europe and especially Germany were to foreign markets.
The survey "suggests that core Eurozone countries are still very dependent on demand from the rest of the world," Ms. Diron wrote. "At a time when the outlook for the U.S. economy is darkening and emerging markets are slowing, such a dependence on the external environment is a source of weakness."
Concerns about slowing growth in the United States and Europe, both important markets for goods made in China, have clouded the outlook for Chinese exporters.
Rising wages across the country have also added to manufacturing costs, eroding some of the competitive advantage that China has long had over manufacturers in other parts of the world.
"Debt crises in developed countries are bringing rising pressure and challenges to the vast emerging market countries, including China," Jiang Yaoping, the Chinese deputy commerce minister, said in a statement Tuesday.
Mr. Qu of HSBC, however, emphasized that the drag on overall growth would probably be limited, given that China's growth was increasingly driven by domestic demand.
"We are still expecting the economy to grow by around 9 percent for the year as a whole, despite Beijing's ongoing credit tightening at home and turmoil in markets overseas," Mr. Qu wrote Tuesday.
One consolation from the data is that they point to easing inflationary pressure at the same time that oil prices are declining. If inflation is less of a worry, the European Central Bank will not feel as compelled to continue raising official interest rates. In addition, the E.C.B. may find it easier to sustain measures intended to support weaker banks and hold down borrowing costs for countries like Spain and Italy.
Separately, the ZEW indicator of economic sentiment, a survey of analysts by the Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany, also showed a sharp drop in expectations for growth in the euro zone and Germany.
"The fear of a recession in the United States together with the downgrade of the credit rating of U.S. bonds has further increased macroeconomic uncertainty," the center said in a statement.
The German central bank argued Monday that much of the recent deceleration in Germany and Europe was due to exceptional factors, like the earthquake and tsunami in Japan that temporarily disrupted supplies of auto parts. The central bank said in its monthly bulletin that, although growth is clearly slowing, there was no evidence of a recession ahead.
"All in all there are still many signs that the global recovery is intact and that growth in the coming year will be robust," the central bank said.
The data were released as investors remained skeptical whether European government leaders had a handle on the debt crisis.
The finance ministers from France and Germany, Francois Baroin and Wolfgang Schauble, met Tuesday in Paris to work out details of a European tax on financial transactions. The tax reflects the leaders' determination to make banks share the cost of the debt crisis, but may be ill timed given that investors worry another financial crisis is in the making.
Money market indicators show that banks are reluctant to lend to each other, because they fear for each others' solvency.

Addressing the Justice Gap: The poor need representation and thousands of law school graduates need work

Abstract: State bar associations could help address these needs by requiring lawyers to report their pro bono service -- such disclosure would likely increase many lawyers' service to the recommended 3 percent to 5 percent of their paid work.

Full text: Most low-income Americans cannot afford a lawyer to defend their legal interests, no matter how urgent the issue. Unless they are in a criminal case, most have no access to help from government-financed lawyers either.
In civil proceedings like divorces, child support cases, home foreclosures, bankruptcies and landlord-tenant disputes, the number of people representing themselves in court has soared since the economy soured. Experts estimate that four-fifths of low-income people have no access to a lawyer when they need one. Research shows that litigants representing themselves often fare less well than those with lawyers. This "justice gap" falls heavily on the poor, particularly in overburdened state courts.
There is plenty the government, the legal profession and others can do to improve this shameful state of affairs. With the economic downturn, only around two-thirds of law school graduates in 2010 got jobs for which a law degree is required, the lowest rate since 1996. That leaves the other third -- close to 15,000 lawyers -- who, with financial support from government and the legal profession, could be using their legal expertise to help some of those who need representation.
While the Constitution requires that defendants in criminal cases be provided a lawyer, there is no such guarantee in civil cases. The Legal Services Corporation, created by Congress, gives out federal grants that provide the bulk of support for legal aid to the poor. Over the decades, that budget has shrunk -- it was $404 million in 2011, about one-third less than it was 15 years ago, adjusted for inflation. The House Appropriations Committee has proposed reducing that to $300 million for 2012. The cut would be devastating; the budget should, instead, be increased.
Half of the people who seek help from legal aid offices are already turned away. Some offices are so understaffed that they must engage in triage, so that in, say, domestic abuse cases, they will only assist someone seeking a restraining order against a violent partner if that person is in immediate danger of being hurt again.
State bar associations could help address these needs by requiring lawyers to report their pro bono service -- such disclosure would likely increase many lawyers' service to the recommended 3 percent to 5 percent of their paid work. Another step is to allow nonlawyers into the mix. The American Bar Association has insisted that only lawyers can provide legal services, but there are many things nonlawyers should be able to handle, like processing uncontested divorces.
Legal education must also change. The Carnegie foundation recommends that all law students be given experience in public advocacy, of which providing legal services is one kind. At the same time, law schools should expand loan forgiveness programs for legal services lawyers. A few have such programs, but most schools do not -- and not enough schools view tuition as a source to help support future legal-services lawyers.
The justice gap is widening. Government, law schools and the profession need to work together to redesign and fortify the grossly deficient legal services system.

Full text: When the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at an annual gathering in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this Friday, markets will be searching for something, anything, that indicates whether more stimulus is on the way.
It was just a year ago, after all, that the economy was in almost exactly the same position: pitifully slow job and output growth, fears about another financial shock from Europe's debt crisis, warnings of a double-dip recession. And a year ago, at this same conference, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, pointedly described all the weapons the Fed had available to rescue the economy -- you know, just in case.
Several months later, the Fed opened its arsenal and began a major asset-purchasing program intended to stimulate growth.
Given Congress's unwillingness to engage in more fiscal stimulus -- in fact, it plans to pull back on spending -- analysts and investors are wondering whether history will repeat itself, especially if the economy deteriorates further. Stock markets have been rallying this week, partly on hopes that Mr. Bernanke may signal more monetary stimulus is on the way, or at least under what conditions more stimulus would be likely. Broad stock indexes gained 3 percent or more on Tuesday, with the Dow industrial average pushing back above 11,000.
Among the options Mr. Bernanke is expected to lay out on Friday would be engaging in another round of major asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, which is meant to lower long-term interest rates; lowering the interest rate the Federal Reserve pays banks on their reserves; and extending the maturity structure of the Fed's current portfolio of Treasuries, which analysts expect to be the most likely course of action. All these potential strategies would be intended to encourage more lending, among other goals, and thereby increase growth. The Fed might also raise its medium-term target for inflation, which would discourage banks, businesses and consumers from sitting on their cash, and so induce them to spend more.
But beyond such potential options, the announcement of a clear monetary policy road map seems unlikely. Fed speeches are constructed to cause minimal market excitement -- either good or bad -- and there are reasons to think Mr. Bernanke's speech may be especially noncommittal.
First, only two weeks ago the board's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets benchmarks on interest rates, severely dimmed its economic forecasts and took the unusual step of pledging to keep short-term interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013. It seems unlikely that the Fed would make major news so soon after that announcement, economists say.
"I don't think the picture has changed all that much from two weeks ago," said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. "Suggesting more is in the pipeline already would smack of panic."
Moreover, Mr. Bernanke could not unilaterally make a major policy change; he would need to seek approval from other Fed officials. Such consensus has become more challenging, since the composition of voting members on the Federal Open Market Committee has changed since last year.
Last year there was one steady dissenter, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City president, Thomas M. Hoenig. Mr. Hoenig consistently voted against keeping short-term interest rates near zero for so long, and voted against the second round of quantitative easing begun by the Fed last November.
The voting members of the committee rotate each year, and now there is not one but three strongly hawkish voices: Narayana Kocherlakota, Charles I. Plosser and Richard W. Fisher, who are the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Dallas, respectively. These three voted against the Aug. 9 announcement keeping short-term interest rates low through mid-2013, and so seem unlikely to endorse further easing measures.
There is also mounting political pressure from outside the Fed -- on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail -- against expanding the central bank's balance sheet.
Another reason Mr. Bernanke may be especially reluctant to signal commitment to further monetary stimulus is that inflation has picked up. Monetary stimulus, after all, generally increases inflation since it pumps more money into the economy and chases prices higher.
Last year, when economists gathered at Jackson Hole, the most recent consumer price index report had shown prices to have risen over the previous year by 1.2 percent. With inflation so low -- and below the Fed's target rate of inflation -- many economists worried that the country could descend into a deflationary spiral akin to the one seen during the Great Depression, and more recently in Japan. With the threat of deflation, another round of quantitative easing seemed prudent, or at least less risky.
Today, though, consumer prices are 3.6 percent higher than a year ago, softening the case for further monetary stimulus. The Fed has a dual mandate, maximum employment and stable prices; even if Fed policy makers believe further easing might help employment, they may be reluctant to compromise the other half of their mandate.
The final reason Mr. Bernanke may be reluctant to go further is that it is not clear how powerful more monetary stimulus would be. And it is not just anti-Fed types like the presidential candidate Rick Perry who doubt the usefulness of more easing; Ph.D. economists are skeptical too.
"At this point you're really pushing on a string," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight.
Economists are still debating the effectiveness of the quantitative easing program begun last November, raising questions about the potency of yet more asset purchases.
Quantitative easing is supposed to help lending (and thereby growth) by pushing down long-term interest rates, which are already quite low. It is not clear that lowering them further would do much to encourage lending, especially since many companies do not see a need to borrow primarily because demand is so weak, and not because credit is expensive.
The other way that quantitative easing is intended to help spur growth is by encouraging investment in riskier assets, like stocks, because the return is so low on long-term Treasuries. If investors flee to these assets -- as they did last year, following the Jackson Hole speech -- that could raise the price of these assets, causing consumers to feel richer and so more comfortable with spending.
Commodity prices are higher today than they were a year ago, though, and policy makers may worry about pushing them even further up. If energy and food prices rise again, that would actually discourage consumers from spending.
For these reasons, many economists say they believe that, should the Fed engage in more stimulus, it will be unlikely to select quantitative easing as its weapon. But the other options, too, present their own hurdles, and many are still untested.
In the end, economists say, any additional Fed action may depend on what seems most politically palatable, even though the central bank is officially an independent entity. And that logic seems to point to changing the maturity of the assets on the Fed's balance sheet.

Abstract: A week and a half ago, the 10-year Treasury note was yielding only 2.10 percent, after Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating. Since the yield of a bond moves in the opposite direction of its price, this meant demand for 10-year Treasuries was high.

Full text: AS Europe's debt troubles intensified earlier this month and United States debt was downgraded, many people rushed into gold and Treasury securities as a safe haven. It was the latest sign that in uncertain times, investors act in ways that can hurt them in the long run.
"They fled the perceived risk of falling stock prices right into the assured risk of overvalued assets," said G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist for the wealth management division at Brown Brothers Harriman.
What drove those decisions was not logic but fear -- fear of a repeat of September 2008. And that fear may only have intensified when markets dropped again late this week, sending yields on 10-year Treasury notes to record lows and the price of gold above $1,800 an ounce.
Even if the fear is understandable, however, acting on it may not be the best long-term strategy.
"If you were right about the timing decision to get out, you're going to have to be right again about when to get back in," said Joseph W. Spada, managing director at Summit Financial Resources in Parsippany, N.J. "Even professionals have trouble doing it. If that's not going to be your strategy, then don't do it once."
But now that people have done it once, what are the risks of holding on to large positions in gold and Treasuries?
TREASURIES While the economy may seem bad to many people, it would not take much improvement for investors to lose money quickly on their investment in Treasury bonds.
A week and a half ago, the 10-year Treasury note was yielding only 2.10 percent, after Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating. Since the yield of a bond moves in the opposite direction of its price, this meant demand for 10-year Treasuries was high.
If over the next six months, the yield were to move up another half of a percentage point to 2.60 percent, however, investors owning those bonds would have a negative 6.25 percent return, said Barbara Reinhard, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse Private Banking in New York. If the yield curve were to move up a full percentage point during that time, the loss would be 14 percent.
She said such a quick increase could easily happen, as it did from October 2010 to January 2011 when the Federal Reserve began its second round of large-scale purchases of government debt, the program known as quantitative easing.
Now, plenty of people buy bonds with the intention of holding them until maturity. In doing that, it would seem that they would earn a return of 2.10 percent. But they would actually lose 1.5 percent, when the most recent inflation rate of 3.6 percent is factored in.
"That's assuming inflation doesn't rise," Ms. Reinhard said. "Right now, you're betting inflation will fall below 2.10 percent. You're betting against history because inflation has been around 3 to 4 percent historically."
This is not the brightest picture for people who added to their allocation of Treasury bonds. But many felt it was the only safe place.
J. D. Montgomery, a managing director at Canterbury Consulting, an investment consulting firm in Newport Beach, Calif., said he had a client who wrestled with where to put $5 million that he needed to keep safe. The client chose a three-month Treasury note, even though the interest was only $1,000.
There was at least some logic behind this. Most people who bought Treasuries were abandoning their investment strategy, and wealth advisers say that is more troubling than paltry returns.
"The risk of changing your strategy when it's being tested as opposed to changing it when it's not being tested is you risk derailing your long-term investment plan," said Gregg Fisher, president and chief investment officer of Gerstein Fisher, a wealth management firm in New York.
So what should nervous investors have done? Selling Treasury bonds when everyone else was buying them would have been a start. But that might have taken too much discipline. Moving to cash was the top option because at least investors would have money ready when they felt comfortable returning to the markets.
GOLDInvestors in gold are a different breed. They often have a passion for the metal that goes beyond returns. And they are not going to be swayed by arguments that gold, hovering around $1,800 an ounce, is overvalued.
"When you buy gold you're saying nothing is going to work and everything is going to stay ridiculous," said Mackin Pulsifer, vice chairman and chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust International in New York. "There is a fair cohort who believes this in a theological sense, but I believe it's unreasonable given the history of the United States."
As for the nonbelievers who piled into gold, they need to think practically now. Only about 11 percent of gold has an industrial use. While gold can get lost or buried, it does not get used up like oil or natural gas. And its actual cost is between a third and half of where it is trading. Dan Denbow, co-manager of the USAA Precious Metals and Minerals Fund in San Antonio, said it cost about $600 to produce an ounce of gold, but that rises to about $1,000 when all the costs of mining are factored in.
Yet a bigger risk may come from exchange-traded funds for gold. While they let small investors buy gold easily -- the price of one share of the GLD exchange trade fund is roughly one-tenth the price of an ounce of gold -- that same ease of buying means investors can just as quickly sell their shares in a panic.
No one I spoke to would venture a guess as to how high gold would rise before it hit its peak. But most stressed that people forgot that gold's value was driven by sentiment.
"Gold doesn't have any intrinsic value," said Larry M. Elkin, president of the Palisades Hudson Financial Group in Scarsdale, N.Y. "It's this era's wampum. At one point you could buy Manhattan for beads."
(Mr. Elkin said what bothered him the most about investing in gold was how irrational it was, unlike buying a blue-chip stock whose value rises and falls based on what the company produces.)
That said, having gold in a portfolio is still a good buffer against swings in other markets. Mr. Fisher calculated that over a 43-year period ending in June 2011, the average annual increase for gold, accounting for inflation, was 3.82 percent compared with 4.92 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Gold, however, was 28 percent more volatile.
"The smoother the ride, the more likely the investor is going to stay in his strategy," Mr. Fisher said. "That produces a better result."
He said that from the perspectives of both return and volatility, a better strategy would have been to put 10 percent in gold and split the rest 60-40 between stocks and five-year Treasury bonds. Rebalancing the portfolio to maintain those ratios would have meant an average annual return of 4.66 percent, with more than half of the volatility of gold alone.
For those who fled to gold and Treasuries, the hardest part will be deciding when to get back into other securities. The best way in uncertain markets may be to go slowly in small chunks -- a practice known as dollar-cost averaging.
"There are real and psychological benefits to it, because getting someone to take that first step is the hardest," said Christopher Wolfe, chief investment officer for the private bank and investment group at Bank of America. "With a five-year time horizon, it makes a big difference. You might get one of those wicked big down days you could benefit from. But if you have a 30-year time horizon it doesn't matter."
Of course, if people had thought on such a long time horizon they might not have rushed to buy gold and Treasuries in the first place.

Full text: After starting out the week with hopes of newfound stability, stock market investors ended up experiencing another ugly week as worries about the global economy resurfaced.
On Monday, stock indexes had finally recovered from the huge sell-off of the previous week, after the downgrade of United States long-term debt by Standard & Poor's late on Aug. 5 unleashed days of painful market turmoil.
But by midweek, stocks were falling again, as investors worried about Europe's debt crisis, and the possibility of recession in the United States intensified. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 1.5 percent on Friday, and closed down more than 4 percent for the week.
It was the fourth consecutive week of market declines as investors remained rattled. The latest signs of strain came from some European banks laden with debt from the region's troubled economies -- strains that could spread across the Atlantic.
Despite a meeting in Paris earlier in the week between the leaders of Germany and France to pledge greater economic coordination between nations sharing the euro, confidence quickly eroded in the markets over whether Europe's policy makers have solutions to the Continent's debt crisis.
In the United States, dismal economic data on Thursday pointed to an unexpectedly abrupt slowdown in manufacturing and a pickup in inflation.
Next week, the market's attention will turn to the Federal Reserve's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for signs of how confident the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, is about the strength of the American recovery.
At last year's symposium, faced by a similar midyear slowdown, Mr. Bernanke paved the way for a second round of large-scale bond purchases, or quantitative easing.
But after the Fed this month already promised to keep short-term interest rates close to zero for the next two years, few economists expect further stimulus from the Fed.
On Friday, markets closed sharply lower in Asia and Europe, and that sentiment then carried over into the United States. Stocks had been briefly higher in the morning hours, but then slipped. Some analysts attributed the slide to technical factors and thin volume.
At the close, the S.& P. 500 was down 17.12 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,123.53. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 172.93 points, or 1.57 percent, to 10,817.65. The Nasdaq composite index lost 38.59 points, or 1.62 percent, to 2,341.84.
For the week, the S.& P. was down 4.6 percent, the Dow fell 4 percent and the Nasdaq slid 6.6 percent. The steepest declines were on Thursday, when the indexes slipped more than 3 percent on persistent worries about the economy and Europe's debt problems.
Stocks of companies most susceptible to slow growth and those related to banks have been hit. Technology, financials and industrials were among the sectors down more than 1 percent on Friday.
"You are still seeing a lot of the economically sensitive names leading us on the way down," said Seth Setrakian, co-head of United States equities at First New York.
Some of the downturn on Wall Street was attributed to technical reasons. Friday, for example, was a day when options contracts expire, an event that can fuel volatility or market moves.
Analysts were also quick to point out that on a day before a summer weekend, low volumes could unfold into a "bleed" toward the end of the trading session -- and indeed, what had been a relatively placid session in New York turned downward in the final hours.
"Just as importantly, any important policy makers that can come up with anything constructive are on vacation," said Mr. Setrakian. "So what good news can come over the weekend?"
"So everyone is playing much lighter and much tighter," he said. "It is very simply the data that has been coming out economically has not been constructive."
Gold continued the sharp ascent it has seen over the last months, demonstrating that nervousness remained intense. Gold futures were up $30, to $1,848.90 an ounce.
Europe's major stock indexes ended the day lower. The FTSE 100 in London fell 1 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of European blue-chip stocks, pulled back 2.15 percent.
Asian markets were also lower. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan lost 2.51 percent, and the major market indexes in Singapore and Hong Kong closed down more than 3 percent.
Tension on money markets, which some analysts said was overblown, awoke unpleasant memories of the seizure in interbank lending that came after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
"Everybody is taking risk off the table," said George Rusnak, national director of fixed income for Wells Fargo. "This is probably going to be a trend over the next several weeks. There is not a lot of robust trading going on right now."
Mr. Rusnak and other analysts again noted that concerns had mounted about the banking sector, especially with respect to the exposure of American banks to their European counterparts.
One drag on the American markets, and specifically the tech sector, on Friday was Hewlett-Packard, which is considering plans to spin off the company's personal computer business into a separate company and is spending $10 billion on Autonomy, a business software maker. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell 20 percent, or $5.91, to $23.60.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged, and the yield remained at 2.07 percent. It had touched record lows below 2 percent in intraday trading on Thursday.
"The growth outlook being hurt in Europe, and the ongoing sluggish data we have seen in the United States is the underlying issue the stock market is trying to grapple with," said Robert S. Tipp, a managing director and chief investment strategist for Prudential Fixed Income.
He said the crisis of confidence was evident as investors parked money in cash and short-term fixed-income assets.
One thing to worry about next week will be whether the European Central Bank can continue to hold down yields on Italian and Spanish bonds. If not, Italian and Spanish borrowing costs might reach the point where they became too expensive, raising the risk of default.
On Friday, Italian bonds and Spanish bonds dipped to 4.96 percent.

Full text: Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slumped to a nearly two-and-a-half-year low in August, and home resales unexpectedly dropped in July.
Other data released on Thursday also showed that consumer inflation rose at its fastest rate in four months in July and that more Americans than expected filed claims for jobless benefits last week.
Stock markets worldwide tumbled on the weak economic data, which stoked concerns that the recovery was on the rocks.
Still, economists said they did not believe that the sharp drop in manufacturing activity signaled that the nation's economy was sliding back into recession.
"Without a strong rebound in the coming months, this will be taken as a very worrying development for policy makers charting the outlook for the second half of the year," said Peter Newland, a senior economist at Barclays Capital in New York.
"That said, 'hard' data so far available for the third quarter have taken a clearly stronger tone and timely jobless claims data are not indicative of a dramatic weakening in the economy," he added.
Data including retail sales and industrial production suggested the economy found some momentum early in the third quarter after barely growing in the first half of the year.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, said on Thursday that the risk of a double-dip recession was "quite low."
"The risks have risen a little bit, but I think we very much still expect the economy to recover." The agency expects growth to be significantly firmer than it was during the first half of the year, he told New Jersey business leaders.
In one positive report, the Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.5 percent in July. The increase, which followed a gain of 0.3 percent in June, was lifted by the money supply and interest rate components, the board said.
Ken Goldstein, an economist at the board, said that growth was modest, especially in nonfinancial indicators.
Despite the risks, he said, "the economy should continue to expand at a modest pace through the fall."
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index fell to minus 30.7 in August, the lowest level since March 2009 when the economy was in recession, from 3.2 in July.
That was much worse than economists' expectations for a reading of plus 3.7. Any reading below zero indicates a contraction in the region's manufacturing.
"This report clearly reflects the fact that businesses cut their outlook as a result of the debt limit crises and the resulting downgrade of the U.S. credit rating," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities in New York.
"I would not read too much into this in terms of the outlook on the economy since manufacturing had been on the rebound in autos and exports and the economy was stuck in first gear for two years."
A second report showed sales of previously owned homes fell 3.5 percent in July, to an annual rate of 4.67 million units, the lowest in eight months. Economists had expected home resales to rise to a 4.9 million-unit pace.
Separate data from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000, to 408,000. Another report from the department showed the Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent in July, the largest gain since March, after falling 0.2 percent in June.
Gasoline, which rose 4.7 percent after falling 6.8 percent the previous month, accounted for about half of the rise in C.P.I. last month.
But core C.P.I. -- excluding food and energy -- rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in June.
Morgan Stanley cut its global growth forecast and said that the United States and its major export partner the euro zone were "dangerously close to recession." In a research note that spooked investors, it lowered its United States estimate to 1.8 percent growth in gross domestic product for 2011 from 2.6 percent and for next year to 2.1 percent from 3.0 percent.
The jobless claims data covers the survey week for August nonfarm payrolls. Claims dropped by 14,000 between the July and August survey periods, but there are fears that turbulence in the financial markets could have slowed hiring this month.
Despite the spike in consumer inflation last month, which also reflected a 0.4 percent rise in food prices, inflation generally remains contained.
In the 12 months to July, core C.P.I. increased 1.8 percent -- the largest increase since December 2009. This measure has rebounded from a record low of 0.6 percent in October, and the Fed would like to see that closer to 2 percent.
Overall consumer prices rose 3.6 percent year-on-year, rising by the same amount for a third consecutive month.

Full text: NEW DELHI -- In a "new" India often obsessed with wealth and status, where cricket batsmen and Bollywood movie stars are wildly idolized, Anna Hazare is a figure from an earlier, seemingly discarded era. His pointed white cap and simple white cotton clothes evoke a Gandhian simplicity. His rural, homespun demeanor ordinarily might elicit snickers from India's urban elite.
Yet Mr. Hazare, 74, has emerged as the unlikely face of an impassioned people's movement in India, a public outpouring that has coalesced around fighting corruption but has also tapped into deeper anxieties in a society buffeted by change.
His arrest on Tuesday, made while he was en route to a park in New Delhi where he intended to commence a hunger strike as part of his anticorruption campaign, drove thousands of people onto city streets across India. Under public pressure, government officials tried to release him within hours, but Mr. Hazare refused to leave jail unless the government released him unconditionally. On Thursday, the two sides reached a compromise, and Mr. Hazare is expected to leave jail on Friday to lead a hunger strike and mass protest in central New Delhi to push his demand that the government create a powerful, independent anticorruption agency.
The popular outpouring he has set off has inevitably drawn comparisons with the democratic uprisings of the Arab Spring. Most analysts agree, though, that India's moment is a different one. But in its own way it may prove to be no less important.
India already has the democratic freedoms sought by protesters in the Middle East and North Africa and has enjoyed rising global influence after two decades of fast economic growth. Yet India is also experiencing what one observer has called a "churning" period, as public frustrations are boiling over about poor roads, shoddy schools, inflation, rising inequality and the pervasive reach of official corruption.
Running through each of these issues is a deepening public disillusionment with India's political process and a growing disconnectedness between the governing class and the governed, making the corruption issue especially explosive. As the crowds supporting Mr. Hazare grew larger and more passionate this week, person after person seemed to arrive on the New Delhi streets carrying their own tale of official graft.
"It is the middle class who is worst affected by corruption," said Asha Bhardaaj, a woman who traveled more than 30 miles from the suburbs to join a rally. "The upper class is not affected. The upper classes can get what they need by paying money."
Mr. Hazare's appeal seems partly rooted in the traditional values he embodies. He is a longtime social activist who has campaigned against corruption for nearly two decades in the state of Maharashtra, living off a military pension and financing charitable work through donations. If his clothes evoke Mahatma Gandhi, India's founding father, then so do his protest tactics of nonviolent hunger strikes and peaceful marches.
Yet Mr. Hazare and his advisers have also proved adept at the necessities of modern politics: they have adroitly outmaneuvered the police and government officials who sought to defuse the anticorruption movement, after the decision to arrest him backfired dramatically. They also have exploited the nonstop, often sensationalistic coverage on India's television news outlets to build public support for their cause. Mr. Hazare's face is now visible in almost every corner of India.
Mr. Hazare and his advisers -- a group of prominent lawyers and social activists nicknamed Team Anna -- have spent months campaigning across the country. His aides distribute a flurry of daily e-mail updates to journalists, and his close advisers have used social media to connect with young followers. Early Thursday, one adviser, Kiran Bedi, used Twitter to announce a breakthrough in negotiations with the authorities.
Later on Thursday, Ms. Bedi released a video of Mr. Hazare made inside Tihar Jail, where he is being held. "I got my energy after seeing the young protesters," he said. "Today is only the third day of protest. I can continue like this for another 10 or 12 days more."
The governing Indian National Congress Party, by contrast, has seemed rattled, unprepared for the public anger against the government and incapable of delivering a consistent counterargument. One party spokesman personally attacked Mr. Hazare, describing him as a corrupted figure, while another spokesman blamed the United States for supporting the anticorruption movement.
"This is a moral moment," said Jayaprakash Narayan, a social activist in the city of Hyderabad. "Everybody is sick and tired of corruption. And in dealing with this, the government has shown no political sense at all. There is a lot of anger in the country, not only to end corruption but to end politics as it is conducted today."
Mr. Hazare was born Kisan Baburao Hazare in 1937 in rural Maharashtra. He still speaks Marathi as his primary language and eventually assumed the name Anna. Beyond his admiration of Gandhi, Mr. Hazare drew inspiration from Swami Vivekananda, a prominent reformer during the 19th century. Having stumbled across the teachings of Vivekananda while serving in the Indian Army, Mr. Hazare decided to dedicate his life to public service after narrowly escaping death while posted on the Pakistan border, according to his official biography.
He served 15 years in the military, qualifying for a pension, and retired to Maharashtra to take up social work. He was awarded two of India's highest civilian awards for his work, which includes drought-relief efforts and working to create a sustainable Gandhian "model village."
By the 1990s, Mr. Hazare had begun staging hunger strikes in Maharashtra to pressure state officials linked to corruption. Several were ultimately removed from office. At one point, countercharges against him claimed that money from one of his trusts had been used to pay for his birthday celebration. A government-appointed commission concluded that the money was improperly spent, but Mr. Hazare was never implicated in any personal corruption.
His national profile has risen sharply since this spring, when he came to New Delhi to begin a hunger strike demanding that the government introduce a bill in Parliament to create the anticorruption agency, known as a Lokpal. When thousands of people unexpectedly came out in support, government officials invited Team Anna to join a special committee drafting the Lokpal bill.
For several weeks during the early summer, Mr. Hazare was a periodic visitor at a government guesthouse in New Delhi while attending committee meetings. During an interview in early June, he often spoke with dramatic flourish about the need to eliminate corruption, while also predicting that people would support him again, if necessary.
"I'm confident that people will stand up again," he said. He had been traveling the country, appearing at rallies to gather support for a Lokpal. "Yes, I feel empowered," he said in June. "It happens because a large number of people are standing with you. Otherwise, what do I have? I'm a beggar. I live in a temple. I do not have a bankbook. I have only a plant and a bed."
His methods and goals have not impressed everyone. Critics accused him of trying to hijack the democratic process through protest pressure tactics. Others warned that the type of Lokpal he envisioned could upset the balance of the country's democratic institutions and accused his group of refusing to compromise.
Ultimately, negotiations broke down in June on the Lokpal legislation. The government has since introduced a bill in Parliament during the current session, but Mr. Hazare has criticized it as too weak. This week, he came to New Delhi to begin another hunger strike when the police arrested him.
Under the compromise reached for his release, Mr. Hazare agreed to limit his hunger strike to 15 days, and the police said they would remove their original restrictions on the number of supporters allowed to attend the protest.
Outside Tihar Jail and elsewhere in the city, people have chanted Mr. Hazare' s name and voiced anger over the pervasiveness of corruption in daily life. One college student complained that rich families are able to buy admission for their children to top colleges. A man who has a trucking business complained that he had to pay a 10 percent bribe to a petty official in order to get a certificate proving he paid a transport tax on his vehicle.
"Today, when we were coming, a traffic cop stopped our vehicle and suggested that we shell out some money," said Ajab Singh Gujar, the owner of the trucking business. "I shouted, 'Victory to Anna Hazare!'
"The cop immediately allowed us to pass through without any bribe."

Full text: FOR generations of children, the idea of saving first became real when a savings bond landed in a birthday or holiday card, the image of a famous American staring out from the elaborate, earth-tone etching on a stately certificate. These fond memories may explain why this year nearly 50,000 Americans -- the vast majority of them modest wage-earners -- decided, under a new I.R.S. policy, to buy savings bonds with a portion of their precious tax refunds.
But taking advantage of this crucial form of savings is about to get much harder. The Treasury Department announced last month that in January it would end over-the-counter sales of savings bonds. While paper bonds will still be available at tax time and electronic bonds will still be sold online, bonds will no longer be sold at banks, savings-and-loan institutions and credit unions.
Given the continuing debate over fiscal policy, now hardly seems like the time for Treasury to make it harder for Americans to support their country by buying its debt. The savings bond program, which began in 1935, has helped millions of Americans save for a home, for college tuition or for a first car. More than a financial instrument, savings bonds are an instrument of hope. Pamela Sinclair, a 48-year-old Baltimore mother who works in health care, told us that she bought bonds for her children, using her tax refund, because "they could be president of the United States someday."
Moreover, the tried-and-true savings bond is a universal product. Where else can someone with as little as $50 invest in a virtually risk-free, inflation-protected, giftable, fee-free savings product with returns that often exceed the meager interest on savings accounts?
Savings and financial literacy are particularly critical for working families with limited assets. The nonprofit group Doorways to Dreams Fund, which encourages low-income families to save (and which we serve as board members), found that up to 10 percent of low-income tax filers ordered savings bonds with their tax refunds, when offered the opportunity in pilot tests conducted between 2006 and 2009. Most said they saved for their children and grandchildren; nearly a third developed a savings habit, buying bonds year after year.
In the past decade, opportunities for saving money at tax time have improved. Under President George W. Bush, the I.R.S. introduced a "split refund" feature -- an option for filers to send their refunds directly to more than one account. Last year, the Obama administration added the option to use refund money to buy savings bonds. As a result, all taxpayers now have the option to save, even if they do not have bank accounts.
The decision to eliminate the sale of paper bonds at banks is only the latest of several actions that have blunted the impact of these positive developments. The federal government has for years done little to support the savings bond program -- eliminating its marketing budget, ending a program that allowed employees to buy savings bonds through payroll deduction, lowering annual purchase limits and making savings bond terms less favorable for small investors. Despite these obstacles, Americans still buy more than $1 billion in paper savings bonds every year.
It's true that Americans will still be able to buy savings bonds electronically, through a Web-based platform known as TreasuryDirect. But the system isn't user-friendly, and it presupposes ready Internet access, which about 35 percent of all Americans and 65 percent of low-income Americans do not have. And the system requires a user to have a bank account, effectively excluding the 17 million American adults who are "unbanked." This may explain why less than 1 percent of the 55 million people who own savings bonds have TreasuryDirect accounts.
Rather than making savings bonds less accessible, the government should encourage thrift by reinventing the bond program for the 21st century. The option to buy a savings bond at tax time is a wonderful first step. Another promising opportunity is to offer savings bonds in retail stores via a savings-bond card, similar to the gift cards and prepaid bank cards in ever wider use. (Imagine if you could "buy savings" in a checkout line.) And the TreasuryDirect site should be updated and made more accessible, particularly for those who are less adept at navigating financial information.
While we applaud the Obama administration for retaining paper savings bonds at tax time, we urge the Treasury Department to reverse its decision to eliminate their sale, year-round, at financial institutions. We must not take away one of the few proven tools -- one born during the Depression -- that empowers working people to save for themselves and their children.

Abstract: The big stock plunge, though, came around 10 a.m., when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported a sharp drop in regional manufacturing activity in its monthly survey, deepening worries that the economy may dip back into recession. According to data from Bloomberg, that low during the day was the lowest yield since at least 1962.

Full text: After just a few days of calm, stock markets heaved again on Thursday, sending major American indexes down as much as 5 percent on persistent worries about the economy and Europe's debt problems.
The turmoil of last week returned with a vengeance as investors dumped stocks of companies that would suffer if worldwide growth slowed and the United States, in particular, broached another recession.
But the declines began in Asia and in Europe, where an unidentified bank had resorted to borrowing from the European Central Bank, hinting of strains in the banking system that some fear could ripple to the United States. Europe's chronic debt problem continues to plague the Continent's banks because so many of their assets are invested in the region's troubled countries.
Investors rushed into United States Treasuries as a safe haven, despite unease about how the government will address its deficit and economic slowdown. Bond prices rose and the yield on the 10-year bond fell below 2 percent for the first time since at least the early 1960s.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 419.63 points on the day, or 3.7 percent, to 10,990.58. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.5 percent to 1,140.65. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite fell the most, ending down 5.2 percent at 2,380.43.
Gold rose along with Treasuries as investors sought safety. Oil prices fell on expectations that demand would be tempered in a slowdown.
The S.& P. 500 has now fallen more than 16 percent from its April 29 peak. It is once again near bear market territory, defined as a fall of 20 percent.
Analysts said the fear stalking markets was not going away. "We took a little break for a couple days, and it is reinstating itself and I just think that this should probably be expected," said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global in New York.
After the sell-offs in Asia and Europe on Thursday, stock prices opened lower in the United States on a spate of dismal economic data. Consumer prices suggested inflation was picking up, and jobless claims rose, defying hopes that the nation's high unemployment rate might slide.
The big stock plunge, though, came around 10 a.m., when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported a sharp drop in regional manufacturing activity in its monthly survey, deepening worries that the economy may dip back into recession.
That report came a day after Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts for both worldwide and domestic economic growth, partly because it expected cuts in government spending in Europe and the United States to damp recoveries. It described the United States and the euro area as "hovering dangerously close to a recession" and said it would not take much in the form of additional shocks to tip the balance.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds dropped to 1.97 percent on the Philadelphia Fed news before recovering to close at 2.07. According to data from Bloomberg, that low during the day was the lowest yield since at least 1962. Global Financial Data, a supplier of historical financial and economic statistics, said it was the lowest since 1950.
"What freaked me out today was that Philly Fed number," said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. "That was the first number that says recession."
That sentiment was echoed by Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities. "When you have an economy operating at stall speed facing these headwinds, it does not take much to tip it over the edge," he said. "You read a report like this and you think we are going over the edge."
Credit Suisse said in a note that if the Philadelphia numbers proved a national barometer, and that was unknown, "then a recession likely began in August."
The latest worries about Europe's banks flared after an unnamed lender tapped an emergency borrowing program, which was established by the European Central Bank to ensure that firms had ample money in dollars.
The bank borrowed $500 million, a relatively modest sum. But it was the first time a bank had turned to the special program since February, and it set off worries that at least some banks might be struggling to find dollars to finance their operations.
Regulators and bank executives played down the possibility that it could lead to a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when credit markets froze virtually around the world.
But that news, combined with a report that the New York Federal Reserve has in recent weeks been more closely monitoring the American subsidiaries of European banks, pushed down bank shares in Europe and then in the United States.
The shares of Dexia, a large Belgian bank, fell 14 percent. Societe Generale fell 12.3 percent. Shares in two British banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank, fell sharply. In the United States, Citigroup fell 6.3 percent to $27.98, and Bank of America fell 6 percent to $7.01.
American banks are probably in better financial shape than they were on the eve of the 2008 crisis. But the sell-off reflects fears that the troubles brewing among European lenders could spread across the Atlantic.
"It is just a measure of the whole negative sentiment in the markets," said Mr. Green of TD Securities.
Asian Pacific stock markets, which missed the worst of the selling on Thursday, fell sharply in early trading on Friday. The Nikkei 225 in Japan was 2.15 percent lower midday. Stocks in South Korea sagged 4.3 percent, and the major index in Australia was down 2.64 percent.
Gold rose to a non-inflation adjusted record of more than $1,837 an ounce. Futures on the S.& P. 500 index were o.4 percent lower in Asia.
The United States stock market began to gyrate wildly this month after Standard & Poor's decision late on Aug. 5 to downgrade America's long-term credit rating. There were alternating gains and losses of more than 4 percent on four subsequent trading days -- which had never before happened in the history of the S.& P. index, which dates to 1928.
Stocks were buoyed by the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would keep short-term interest rates close to zero for the next two years. This week, corporate profits spurred some optimism. So did a $12.5 billion deal by Google.
On Thursday, the sell-off was broad, with all 10 sectors of the S.& P. 500 finishing lower; most rattled were industrial and material companies. So far this month, financial stocks are the worst performers.
Extreme volatility is likely to continue, market analysts say, as long as there is uncertainty about how the chronic debt crisis in the euro zone will be resolved and about whether the global economy is slipping. Policy makers in Europe and the United States have yet to demonstrate the kind of forceful leadership that would instill confidence, they assert.
The VIX, a measure of stock market volatility, which eased last week, snapped back by about one-third on Thursday, to a reading of 42.67, suggesting that investors had grown more fearful.
So far, at least, credit markets in the United States have shown few signs of stress, bolstered by the cheap financing supported by the Federal Reserve.
But the European credit markets are signaling some increased levels of strain, though still far from that experienced nearly three years ago.
For example, interbank lending rates in Europe -- a measure of banks' willingness or reluctance to lend to each other -- have risen. Swap rates in the foreign exchange market, which allows banks to swap euros for dollars, have doubled from a few months ago. They remain less than half the levels reached during the financial crisis.

Full text: Federal regulators and the generic drug industry are putting the final touches on an agreement that would help speed the approval of generic drugs in this country and increase inspections at foreign plants that export generic drugs and drug ingredients to the United States.
The agreement calls for generic drug manufacturers to collectively pay $299 million in annual fees (adjusted for inflation in succeeding years) under a program that would have to be approved by Congress. The fees would allow the Food and Drug Administration to hire more reviewers to speed up the processing of applications to market new generics and reduce a large current backlog. That would help lower health care costs by giving patients and doctors quicker access to inexpensive generics.
The money would also allow the F.D.A. to inspect foreign manufacturing plants that produce generic drugs or the ingredients for them every two years, the same rate at which American plants are inspected. At the current pace, government investigators estimated three years ago that it would take more than 13 years to inspect all foreign plants that export drugs or drug ingredients to this country, whether for brand-name or generic use. Many foreign plants have never been inspected.
Lawmakers ought to welcome this carefully negotiated agreement and quickly approve the fee legislation when it is introduced next year. It would lower consumer costs and increase consumer safety -- and industry would rightly foot much of the bill.

Full text: Google was willing on Monday to pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in no small part because of its stockpile of 17,000 patents. The patent portfolio, some analysts estimate, could represent more than half of the value of the deal, or more than $400,000 a patent.
If so, it was a relative bargain. In June, Apple and Microsoft teamed up with four other companies to pay $4.5 billion for the 6,000 patents held by the bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker Nortel Networks. That works out to $750,000 a patent or nearly four times the average price for computer, software and telecommunications patents over the last few years, patent experts say.
In a stumbling economy, stocks languish in a skittish funk and real estate remains depressed. But technology patents look downright bubbly.
This patent gold rush has a darker side. It is diverting money for innovation from industries crucial to the economic future of the United States, analysts say. Patents were created as an incentive for innovation, giving inventors a temporary right to commercialize their ideas, without others copying them. While the recent blockbuster patent deals may make sense for the companies, analysts say, they are fed largely by legal considerations -- asserting patent claims or defending against claims -- rather than economic ones.
So the very innovation patents were intended to encourage, they say, suffers in the patent wars. "You'd much rather see Apple spend some of that $4 billion on new inventions, and Google invest that $12 billion to generate new knowledge," said Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard Business School. "It's a transfer of wealth from innovators to bondholders and stockholders who have no motivation to innovate. It's disturbing."
Patent investment firms, lawsuits, weakened patent overhaul legislation and the fierce competition among well-heeled rivals have also fanned this inflation. The patent legislation that emerged from the House and Senate, and which may well be enacted in the new session of Congress, has been scaled back. It no longer includes proposals that would have sharply curbed damage awards and the freedom of patent-holding companies to file patent infringement lawsuits. Another provision that was dropped would have limited the ability to file patent claims in known plaintiff-friendly courts, notably those in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, which includes Tyler, Texarkana and Marshall.
Large technology companies championed those patent suit restrictions. But they were cut from the legislation after resistance from interests that rely on strong patent protection, like pharmaceutical companies, individual inventors and patent-buying firms like Intellectual Ventures, a multibillion-dollar fund run by Nathan Myhrvold that owns more than 35,000 patents.
Without tougher legislation, said Mr. Lerner of Harvard, companies are left to settle disputes on their own in the courts and at the bargaining table, which tends to lift prices.
The result is that it now pays to sue over patents as a routine business practice. The smartphone business, for one, is rife with suit and countersuit. The better-known cases involve large companies. Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, in different cases, have accused Google or the companies that use its Android smartphone operating system, like Motorola and HTC, a Taiwan handset maker, of infringing on their patents.
But there are other suits by small patent-holding companies that have aimed at developers of software applications that run on Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS, which powers its iPhones. So the larger companies, like Google and Apple, are often forced to step in with legal assistance to help their business partners, even single-person applications developers.
The result, said Brian Kahin, a senior fellow at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group, and a White House technology policy adviser in the Clinton administration, is "a huge surge in the monetization of these patents."
Some industry executives doubt whether the recent high prices amount to a patent bubble. John A. Amster, chief executive of RPX, a start-up founded in 2008, which has bought more than 1,600 patents, said the Nortel and Motorola deals were mainly special cases. The high prices, he said, reflected not only an assessment of the value of the patents, but the much larger objective of trying to gain the upper hand in the smartphone business.
In the Nortel auction, RPX worked with a group of companies that came up with a bid of more than $1 billion, Mr. Amster said. That level, according to RPX, was the estimated value of the patents -- but far below the $4.5 billion Apple, Microsoft, Research in Motion and their partners were willing to pay.
In the case of Motorola, Google was under pressure from its big handset partners, including HTC and Samsung, to protect them from patent-infringement suits based on their use of Google's Android software. And Motorola has an impressive collection of mobile phone patents, a powerful weapon in patent negotiations.
"What you're seeing in Nortel and Motorola are prices determined by broad strategic interests, and there aren't many of those deals," said Mr. Amster. His company, RPX, charges clients yearly fees for licensing its patent portfolio, which reduces the companies' risk of being sued.
Handset makers and mobile carriers are certainly hoping that Google's purchase of Motorola will ease tensions in the smartphone market -- a patent armistice among rival powers. Verizon on Tuesday welcomed the deal as a move that might well "bring some stability to the ongoing smartphone patent disputes," John Thorne, senior vice president and deputy general counsel, said in a statement. Verizon Wireless, owned by the Vodafone Group and Verizon Communications, sells both Android-powered phones and iPhones.
Fierce patent disputes in young, fast-growing industries are anything but new. In 1895, George B. Selden, a patent lawyer and inventor, was granted a broad patent on the automobile, covering a machine with four wheels powered by a gasoline engine. Henry Ford and other early automakers fought the patent for years, and it was eventually pruned back in 1911.
The early patent battles over the airplane were so bitter and complex that the government stepped in during World War I and negotiated an agreement that required the companies to cross-license their patents, opening the door to innovation in the aircraft industry.
Patents, experts note, work well when an invention can be clearly defined, as in the patents that cover new chemical compounds -- a new drug or petrochemical, for example. But a smartphone, they add, is a bundle of information technology, including hardware, software and techniques for sending and receiving voice, data and video.
In a recent blog post, David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote that a modern smartphone might be susceptible to as many as 250,000 potential patent claims, depending on how broadly those patents and claims were interpreted.
"The trouble is that in this industry so often a patent is not a clearly defined property right, but a lottery ticket of uncertain value," said Scott Stern, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "That uncertainty can carry a lot of risk and cost."

Abstract: Domestic mines produced 266 tons at a value of 12 billion Australian dollars ($12.42 billion) in 2010, the consulting firm Surbiton Associates said in its latest survey of the Australian gold mining industry. The global financial crisis and a general rise in commodity prices -- oil and food, in particular -- are the major factors propping up gold prices, analysts say.

Full text: SYDNEY, Australia -- Four years ago, Marco Nero was on top of the world. He was earning more than $1 million working as a film effects designer for some of the world's most prestigious digital animation houses.
His mind, however, was elsewhere.
Mr. Nero, 40, was increasingly spending his office hours poring over Web sites for anything he could find about an unlikely subject: gold. Like Humphrey Bogart's character in the classic 1948 film "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre," he realizes now, he was developing a full-blown case of gold fever, a condition whose genesis he traces to a trip to a prospecting supply shop in the Sydney area.
"I happened to talk to the gentleman that was behind the counter, and he showed me a 2-ounce gold nugget he had and it was a beautiful piece. I held that in my hand," he said. "I was probably hooked at that point."
Shortly thereafter, despite protests from friends and family, he quit his job to hunt for gold.
Last week, as concerns about the health of the global economy widened, gold hit a nominal high of $1,813 an ounce after a steady three-year climb. (Adjusting for inflation, gold prices would have to reach $2,300 an ounce to set a record.)
Gold prices are up 23 percent since the beginning of this year alone. As a result, more and more people are giving up lucrative jobs in cities in Australia for a chance at the quick riches and adventure offered by old-fashioned prospecting.
Australia is the world's second-biggest producer of gold, after China. Domestic mines produced 266 tons at a value of 12 billion Australian dollars ($12.42 billion) in 2010, the consulting firm Surbiton Associates said in its latest survey of the Australian gold mining industry. By comparison, the United States produced 240 tons in 2010.
An influx of out-of-towners to prospect in Australia has been a boon for small-business owners in former gold rush towns, many of which have fallen on hard times in recent years.
Take, for example, the tiny outback hamlet of Mudgee, about 170 miles northwest of Sydney. In 1851 it had a population of just 200, before ballooning to 20,000 after the discovery of gold in nearby Hargraves, which was ground zero for the first gold rush in the history of New South Wales.
But the fortunes of Mudgee flagged along with gold prices in the last century. Young people moved to the cities in search of steady work, while punishing droughts drove away farmers. Today, there are just 8,000 people spread sparsely along lonely streets built for more than twice that many inhabitants.
Slowly but surely that has begun to change, said Kim Ellis, 47. She and her partner, Lincoln Parsons, are the proprietors of Nuggets From Down Under, a prospecting supply shop in Mudgee. Ms. Ellis says that she has seen more new arrivals walk through her shop in the last six months than in the previous five years -- and that is without counting the huge number of weekend warriors and hobbyists.
"As gold prices are increasing, that's increasing the interest in gold because of the monetary value but also because of the lifestyle," she said. "In the last six months I've seen probably four people -- that's just involved with my store -- four people that are quitting their jobs, selling up and going prospecting full time."
Four may not sound like a lot, but for a town like Mudgee, every new addition is noticed -- and welcome.
"People have never been really game enough to let go of their security of having their job and their home," Ms. Ellis said. "But what I'm seeing is lifestyle change and that this is something where you can actually make money. It can be a life-changing event. All you need is a nugget, and it's a life-changing event."
For some, the look and feel of prospecting has changed little since the great gold rushes of the 19th century: stick a corrugated pan in a shallow creek, sift and hope.
But for the more discerning prospector, high-technology metal detectors like the Minelab GPX 4800 -- about $6,000 -- provide that extra advantage when hunting for the gold that may be just below the surface of the rough soil in the outback.
The global financial crisis and a general rise in commodity prices -- oil and food, in particular -- are the major factors propping up gold prices, analysts say. Recently, the dispute in the United States over the deficit ceiling and the downgrading of the debt rating by Standard & Poor's have prompted an increase in the price of gold as investors have sought out an investment that is a traditional haven. Volatile stock markets and the debt crisis in Europe are also giving a lift to the metal.
"The bull market is still very much intact," said James Steel, chief commodities analyst for HSBC in New York.
One defining feature of the current gold rush, many say, is the age of those joining up. Whereas prospecting for gold has traditionally been a hobby associated with the elderly, many of those moving out to the country are well below retirement age.
"It used to be mostly old folks at the club, but these days I've noticed there's quite a few younger fellows showing up, and I think that's mainly because of the price of gold," said Dean Eisler, vice president of the Prospector's Home Prospecting Club in Sydney, which runs package tours to prospect for gold.
Brian Dumesny, a 46-year-old military contractor from the city of Townsville, Queensland, in the northern Australian tropics, certainly fits that bill. A breakup with a partner helped him decide on a change of scenery, but it was the price of gold that gave him the confidence to change professions as well.
"I've always liked it," he said. "Even since I was a young boy I did a little bit of panning and such, just messing around, but I guess now that in the last few years the price of gold has increased so much that it's become so much more viable."
Mr. Dumesny said the last nugget he had found weighed 0.3 ounce.
"Four or five years ago that was worth only a hundred bucks, and now it's worth a bit over three hundred dollars," he said. "So you don't have to find a lot to be comfortable, if you know what I mean."
That logic appeals to Mr. Steel, the HSBC analyst. Is he surprised to hear that ordinary people in Australia have been throwing in the towel on city life to prospect full time? Not at all, he says. It is a phenomenon he has seen across the world, in places like Brazil, the United States and Australia.
"What I'd like to do is go to Australia and open up my own outback saloon," he said with a laugh.

Abstract: When Congress added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, it prohibited the government from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and stipulated that outpatient drug coverage should be provided entirely through private insurers like UnitedHealth and Humana, under contract with Medicare.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Medicaid gets much deeper discounts on many prescription drugs than Medicare, in part because Medicaid discounts are set by law whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private insurers and drug companies, federal investigators said Monday in a new report.
The report, from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, could be used by lawmakers trying to cut drug prices as Congress looks for ways to rein in the cost of Medicare under the new deficit-reduction law.
Under existing law, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of Medicare's outpatient drug benefit will increase an average of nearly 10 percent a year, to $175 billion in 2021, from $68 billion this year.
Medicaid and Medicare receive discounts in the form of rebates, which are paid by drug manufacturers when their products are dispensed to people enrolled in the programs.
The inspector general, Daniel R. Levinson, found that rebates reduced spending on 100 widely used brand name drugs by 19 percent in Medicare and by 45 percent in Medicaid. After taking account of the rebates, Mr. Levinson said, Medicaid paid significantly less than Medicare for the same drugs.
Federal law specifies how the discount, or rebate, is calculated under Medicaid, the program for low-income people. The minimum rebate for a brand-name drug was increased last year to 23 percent of the average price that manufacturers receive for sales of the product to retail pharmacies.
Drug companies must pay additional rebates to Medicaid if a drug's price rises faster than general inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index. The inspector general said these added rebates accounted for slightly more than half of all rebates paid to Medicaid on the top 100 drugs. Prices for many of these drugs have been rising at a brisk pace.
"The inflation-based additional rebate is the primary reason Medicaid rebates are substantially higher" than Medicare rebates, Mr. Levinson said.
"Manufacturers for virtually all brand name drugs under review paid inflation-based rebates" to Medicaid because their prices rose faster than inflation, the report said.
For 68 of the 100 brand-name drugs examined in the study, the Medicaid rebate was at least twice as large as the rebate paid to Medicare.
About 30 million older Americans and people with disabilities receive drug coverage through Part D of Medicare. More than 50 million low-income people have drug coverage through Medicaid.
When Congress added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, it prohibited the government from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and stipulated that outpatient drug coverage should be provided entirely through private insurers like UnitedHealth and Humana, under contract with Medicare.
Insurers have aggressively negotiated with pharmaceutical companies, so Medicare's prescription drug program has cost the government less than originally predicted. But the private insurers have not obtained discounts or rebates as large as those secured by Medicaid, the inspector general said.
The study comparing Medicare and Medicaid was required by the new health care law.
Drug companies oppose the type of discounts required by Medicaid, seeing them as government price controls. Drug makers say they prefer Medicare's market-oriented approach, in which discounts are negotiated by drug plans and manufacturers.
Two Democrats, Representative Henry A. Waxman of California and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, recently introduced bills that would require drug manufacturers to pay the higher Medicaid rebates for drugs provided to Medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicaid. President Obama's deficit-reduction commission has endorsed the proposal, saying it could save $49 billion over 10 years.

Abstract: If years of ultra-cheap cash give rise to serious inflation or an accelerated retreat of the American currency, the gold standard, however erratic and deflationary, could start to appeal again. The true gold standard, in which gold coins circulated freely as legal tender, was started in Britain in 1717 and lasted for just under 200 years, interrupted only during the Napoleonic wars.

Full text: Fiat money has worked well since Richard Nixon ended the dollar's peg to gold 40 years ago this week, but this latest recession must gnaw at believers. If years of ultra-cheap cash give rise to serious inflation or an accelerated retreat of the American currency, the gold standard, however erratic and deflationary, could start to appeal again.
The arrangement born at Bretton Woods and used for nearly three decades was not a true gold standard, as it was entirely intergovernmental and the private holding of gold was illegal in America. It thus lacked the virtue of independence from political meddling, failed to provide anti-inflationary benefits and collapsed once its American sponsors no longer controlled the world economy.
The true gold standard, in which gold coins circulated freely as legal tender, was started in Britain in 1717 and lasted for just under 200 years, interrupted only during the Napoleonic wars.
Compared with an ideal, stable and noninflationary monetary system, free from influence by elected officials, the gold standard has two flaws. The metal's supply is erratic. It can soar unexpectedly with new discoveries, thus causing currency values to fluctuate. Conversely, new deposits tend to be found slowly, making a gold standard excessively deflationary when population growth is rapid. That is what contributed to the standard's breakdown after 1900.
World population growth is now declining after its annual peak of 2.2 percent in the early 1960s. By 2030, it is forecast to fall below the 0.72 percent rate of 1900. That would make a gold standard practicable and not too deflationary.
That doesn't make it any more likely that central bankers would embrace it, despite advocacy from critics of quantitative easing and the Federal Reserve like Steve Forbes and Ron Paul. For one thing, it would drastically undercut the banks' influence.
But further chipping at the dollar's credibility, further downgrades of United States credit or other harmful results from years of very low interest rates could bring more people around to the idea of a new reserve currency. A return to the gold standard remains unlikely, but it's no longer unthinkable.
China's Speed Demons
China's high-speed railways may create a debt crisis. The government plans to spend 2.8 trillion renminbi ($438 billion) in the next five years improving the system, at least half of which is likely to come from borrowing. It has already spent about 2.1 trillion renminbi. It's hard to see how it will all be paid back.
The proposed 16,000 kilometers of lines due by 2020 is more than exist in the world today. China is ideally suited to building high-speed rail. Whereas such lines typically cost at least $35 million per kilometer, China's cost about $15 million.
Financing has so far been easy. The ministry of railways uses the proceeds of bond issues, freight surcharges and past ticket sales to provide equity. Local governments add more equity, while the remainder comes from bank loans. The typical project is 50-50 equity and debt, though the debt share has risen.
The trouble is that most Chinese passengers aren't prepared to pay high prices to save a little time. Tickets on China's new lines work out at 6 cents a kilometer, or about half the fares elsewhere in Asia, according to the World Bank. Construction delays and more safety checks after the fatal collision in July in the coastal city of Wenzhou will probably push costs up, and demand down.
That makes an eventual debt problem more likely. Railways are notorious for creating debt overhangs, even in rich countries. That said, even a cash-burning rail system brings benefits.
It will free up clogged freight lines, create growth in deprived rural areas and reduce high-polluting air travel. So it is likely that the government will stand behind the some 2.1 trillion renminbi of outstanding ministry of railways debts.
But that's little comfort to private investors in banks. China Construction Bank, for one, has lent the equivalent of 2.8 percent of its regulatory capital to a single railway operator. Lending for "transportation" has grown more than 60 percent in two years at the four biggest banks, with collateral backing as little as 30 percent. When payday comes, bank shareholders may be the ones taken for a ride.

Full text: If the first fear is global recession, the second is that central banks have run out of fixes. They do have means to respond, but only with radical and possibly dangerous policies whose efficacy is dubious. These nuclear monetary weapons might be better kept locked away.
Printing money -- or quantitative easing -- has always been seen as the last resort. Now, it seems to be the only option. It has various manifestations, and recent weeks have shown some of its limitations.
The Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan tried to reverse the appreciation of their respective currencies by increasing liquidity to banks and striving for still lower short-term interest rates. Japan also intervened directly in the currency market by selling yen. But it remains close to its peak, and the Swiss franc has pushed on to new highs. This type of involvement has not proved effective.
The European Central Bank has shunned Q.E. outright. Being bold has meant buying euro zone government debt in the secondary market, while neutralizing the monetary effect by sucking in bank deposits. This big gun has worked. Yields on 10-year Italian and Spanish government debt have tumbled by over one percentage point.
The question for the central bank is whether it should go further by buying large amounts of euro zone sovereign debt without any offsetting moves that take money out of the system. This might seem an easy solution to the region's debt crisis. But the risk is that the central bank becomes a holder of debt that requires restructuring -- as is probably the case now with Greece.
The central bank then faces real losses that it must pass on to European governments. Again, it could just print more money to fill the hole, monetizing the debt, as economists say. Numerous irresponsible central banks in Latin America and elsewhere have done so in the past. But the usual result has been high inflation. Germany, which remembers Weimar, sees this as the ultimate risk.
The Bank of England has so far taken a conservative Q.E. course -- buying $:200 billion of British government bonds. Growth there remains weak. The bank may well decide in coming months to start a second round of Q.E. But it's doubtful how effective more gilt purchases would be. The bank might be tempted to be bolder and buy corporate bonds. The risk is that this is like pushing on a piece of string, as the real problem is a lack of demand in the real economy.
By far the boldest exponent of Q.E. has been the Federal Reserve. Its second round of money printing financed purchases of $600 billion of Treasuries. The question is how much QE2 has achieved and, as markets panic, if QE3 will soon be required. But when the yield on the American 10-year note is already hovering around 2.4 percent, would more Treasury purchases be useful?
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, has said that more radical options are available. Cooperation between monetary and fiscal authorities, he wrote in 2002, could permit a "money-financed tax cut" equivalent to a "helicopter drop" of money, to use a phrase from the economist Milton Friedman. Politicians would certainly balk at that -- as would most Fed governors, three of whom have rejected the bank's new commitment to keep rates low till 2013.
Congress sought to tie the government's hands on conventionally financed spending, and is politically miles away from using printed money to finance looser fiscal policy.
The reality is that bolder Q.E. would bring risks for the dollar and for inflation worldwide. QE2 coincided with a surge in global commodity prices, increasing inflation in emerging economies and, now, in America to 3.6 percent. Gasoline prices are up 36 percent in the last year. Consumer purchasing power has been harmed. If more Q.E. means higher prices, the policy risks obstructing growth.
But if recession returns to the United States, the world economy slows and the markets' worst fears are realized, then the Fed and other central banks would have no other option. The world isn't desperate yet, even though America's recovery is slow. Central banks do have an arsenal. They just should not rush to use it. IAN CAMPBELL

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Economists may still be debating whether Europe is headed for a sharp slowdown or even a recession, but Steve Knott, who installs home heating systems in Barrow-in-Furness, a port town in northwest England once known for its iron mills, is convinced he already knows the answer.
Mr. Knott, 53, who runs Furness Heating Components, has cut his work force to 18 people from 25 and said business was tougher than he had ever seen it. "There's a lot of competition, and people are just not building that many houses anymore," Mr. Knott said.
Data released on Friday leaves little doubt that the European economy is losing momentum before most countries have even recovered to the level of output they had in 2008, when the recession hit.
But the larger question is whether an increasingly bitter brew of flagging output and a sovereign debt crisis -- along with the market downturn -- will create something more sinister than a mere slowdown, and lead more businesses to cut jobs and investment as Mr. Knott has.
In France, the second-largest economy in the European Union after Germany, growth came to a standstill in the three months through June, according to official figures. Meanwhile, industrial production in the 17-nation euro area fell 0.7 percent in June compared with May, more than analysts had forecast.
On Tuesday, economists expect a report on euro area economic activity to show that gross domestic product slowed to 0.3 percent in the second quarter, from 0.8 percent in the first three months of the year.
If there is less economic growth, governments will collect less tax revenue. They will have more trouble paying their debts. That could make investors even more nervous and add to turmoil in the stock and bond markets, which will undercut business and consumer confidence, which will lead to yet slower growth, and so on.
"There is a real risk that there is a self-enforcing cycle under way here," said Martin Lueck, an economist at UBS in Frankfurt.
Mr. Lueck says he believes the most likely prospect is less dire, but even his more optimistic view calls for a brief slowdown on the way to a "new normal" of weaker growth in Europe and the United States. And he acknowledged that, in 2008, many economists underestimated how quickly and severely the financial crisis would spill into the broader economy.
"We learned the hard way," Mr. Lueck said. "The links between the financial world and the world economy are very strong."
Another recession is already well under way in Greece and Portugal, while growth in countries like Spain, Italy and Britain has been very slow since last year. But now Germany, which has been remarkably strong, hauling the rest of the Continent along with it, seems to be decelerating. The Ifo Business Climate Index, considered a reliable predictor of German growth, fell in July as executives became less optimistic about exports.
"It is more than a soft patch," said Eric Chaney, chief economist at a French insurer, the AXA Group. "The business cycle is really coming to a quasi-standstill in Europe."
Worse-than-expected results from companies like Daimler, Deutsche Bank and Siemens in the last month have reinforced the feeling that Germany's extraordinary boom is near an end. E.On, Germany's largest utility, said on Wednesday that it might need to cut as many as 11,000 jobs after experiencing the first loss since it was created a decade ago from a group of state-owned utilities.
E.On attributed the loss chiefly to the government's decision to force some of the company's nuclear power plants to close early, but sales declines in foreign markets like Britain and Hungary also played a role.
Even companies that have done well are warning about risks ahead. "The coming months will be challenging for us," Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in late July after the carmaker reported that profit more than tripled, to 4.8 billion euros ($6.8 billion).
A big problem for Europe is that domestic demand is weak and growth has become primarily dependent on sales from abroad, where the signals are flashing yellow. The United States, still the largest foreign market for companies like BMW, is slowing and could slip into recession. The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster in Japan had a greater impact on global trade than economists expected. And demand from China and emerging markets is slackening.
"Germany is so leveraged in global trade that if something happens, then Germany slows immediately," Mr. Chaney said. "That makes the recovery more fragile. It depends on the good health of the rest of the world."
Some German exporters are still smarting from the severe recession that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and must now gird for another retrenchment. An association that represents makers of construction machinery said last Wednesday that it expected a sales increase of more than 10 percent this year, but that sales were still one-third below their 2008 peak.
Many German companies are still not operating at capacity, while they worry about debt problems in the United States and Europe as well as unrest in the crucial Middle East market, said Christof Kemmann, chief executive of BHS-Sonthofen, a maker of machinery for processing building materials.
"Even when some sectors are reporting good numbers, there is no reason for euphoria," Mr. Kemmann said.
And it looks increasingly unlikely that demand from home will recover in time to offset fading exports. Government austerity measures have cut into consumption in countries like Ireland and Italy, and the belt-tightening is spreading. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in attempt to reassure bond investors that the country can service its debt, last week told his budget and finance ministers to come up with new measures to cut the budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, from a projected 5.7 percent this year.
Britain, where unrest in the streets is only adding to uncertainty among consumers and businesses, provides a prime example.
Britain's economy grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, but disposable income in the 12-month period through March fell 2.7 percent for the average British family as a result of inflation and higher interest rates. As consumers avoid the stores, several retailers, including Jane Norman, a women's fashion retailer; TJ Hughes, a discount department store; and the wine and spirits retailer Oddbins have been forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
Despite the risk of another recession, the British government has vowed to stick with its $:80 billion ($130 billion) austerity program, which is expected to cost 300,000 public sector jobs.
"It's pretty harsh times," said Dave Knight, secretary for the Unison trade union, which represents workers for the Waltham Forest Council in the North of London, an area hit by unrest. Of four council offices, three will close, he said. A team of five psychologists who counseled troubled students will lose their jobs.
Many economists warn that the austerity measures could be counterproductive by making people fearful of unemployment and afraid to spend. "Austerity has become the problem, not the solution," said Ian Harnett, a managing director at Absolute Strategy Research. "Me saving is great. You saving is great too. But if we all save it's not good."
For all the economic angst, many economists say that risk of a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis has been overblown. Banks have more capital in reserve than they did then, the argument goes, and central banks have shown they are ready to step in at the first hint of trouble. This month, signs of stress in the interbank lending market prompted the European Central Bank to expand cheap loans to banks in the euro area, to ensure that none run short of cash.
Further, some economists say, investors have a much better understanding of where the risks lie than they did in 2008, when no one knew which banks were sitting on heaps of bad assets. Under pressure from regulators, European banks disclosed their holdings of government debt last month. The abundance of information makes a panic less likely, these analysts argue.
"Global financial markets are not headed for a second meltdown," Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland and former chief economist at the United States International Trade Commission, said in a note. "But growth is going to be slow," he added, "until Western leaders correct the imbalance in demand between Asia and the West, and work off all the debt."

Full text: ONE of the most harrowing stretches in Wall Street history began with the loss of the AAA credit rating of the United States and ended with fears of a new recession. In between, the wild swings in the financial markets captivated the nation, and the world.
Even financial professionals were grasping for answers. Many were selling -- and many were buying as fast as they could. Each was making a bet on whether last week was a hiccup, or the start of something worse.
9:45 p.m. Friday, Aug. 5: Waterbury Center, Vt.
As she watched her beloved Red Sox battle the Yankees, Karissa McDonough opened her laptop to check e-mail.
Jumping off the screen was a subject line from a news alert at 9:03 p.m.: "U.S. Long-Term Debt Downgraded by Standard & Poor's."
She stared at her screen in disbelief. Ms. McDonough, the chief bond strategist at People's United Bank in Connecticut, had spent her working life analyzing the debt of companies and governments. This news, however, was surreal. This happened in other countries. Not here.
"We were just downgraded!" she exclaimed to her husband.
"Who's we?"
"The United States!"
She had to react swiftly. Clients might panic. Money managers at People's United would need to know what to say. She began tapping on her laptop. At 11:02 p.m. she sent an e-mail to more than 100 colleagues. The downgrade, she told them, was "historic but not catastrophic."
Ms. McDonough went on: "The U.S. Treasury market remains the safest, largest, most liquid investable asset class in the world." Governments like China's, she said, would be hard-pressed to find a better alternative.
She collapsed into bed. She had a sinking feeling that her vacation on Cape Cod, scheduled for the coming week, was about to be downgraded, too.
Noon Saturday, Aug. 6: Pasadena, Calif.
Stephen Walsh, the chief investment officer of Western Asset, had been expecting the e-mail all day.
"How do you think the markets will respond on Monday?" a worried official from the United States Treasury asked him.
A few weeks earlier, Western Asset, one of the nation's largest bond fund managers, had asked Standard & Poor's for a private briefing about America's credit rating. S.& P. had already announced that there was an even chance that the nation's AAA rating might be lowered.
The S.& P. analysts were prohibited from saying more. But when they met with Western Asset, it was clear that the odds had worsened. "You could tell a lot by their body language, how carefully they answered certain questions," said one of the people in those meetings. The analysts didn't say anything specific, but they didn't have to. Afterward, Mr. Walsh took his top lieutenants into his office, one by one. A downgrade is inevitable, he told them. We need a plan.
Now, it had happened. The previous night, the once unthinkable had occurred. The Treasury official from Washington wanted to know how Mr. Walsh -- a man who indirectly controls half a trillion dollars in assets -- thought the markets would respond. The Treasury was planning to sell billions of dollars of new bonds in the coming week. If buyers didn't materialize at the auctions, it could be disastrous for the government, the financial markets and the entire global economy.
"I think investors understand it's not that big a deal," Mr. Walsh told the Treasury official.
It was the same thing he had been saying all day to colleagues, hedge funds and investment banks seeking his advice. "U.S. Treasuries are still the most high-quality instrument out there," he told them. People need a safe place to put their money, and if the downgrade unsettled the stock market, as he suspected it would, investors would flock to safe investments like Treasuries, regardless of S.& P.'s opinions.
"World investors didn't downgrade U.S. debt; S.& P. did," he told one caller. "It's just one opinion."
When he hung up, his wife turned to him.
"What if you're wrong?" she asked.
"That's the great thing about Wall Street," he replied. "We'll know Monday morning if I'm a genius or an idiot."
11:30 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 7: East 66th Street, Manhattan
It looked like a sell-off. Not a panic like the one that had struck in 2008, but something different.
Michael Warlan, who heads equity trading for Third Avenue, a mutual fund company in Manhattan, sat in his home office on the Upper East Side, fielding calls and sending instant messages to brokers around the globe.
Amid the turbulence, he smelled opportunity.
Third Avenue, with $15 billion in assets under management, had in recent months moved about 12 percent of its money into cash. Its strategy is to invest in undervalued stocks -- and in May, June and July, there had been precious few good deals to be found. Now, Mr. Warlan sat with a list of stocks he had been eyeing for months. Many were dropping close to the target prices that Third Avenue had been seeking. His colleagues were calling.
The consensus: it was time to buy.
Mr. Warlan started executing trades in foreign markets, pausing for a nap around 2 a.m., then waking at 4 a.m. for the opening of European markets. Without stopping to sleep any more, he went to his office that morning, at the corner of Third Avenue and 41st Street, a few blocks from Grand Central Station. By close of business on Monday, he had spent $110 million to buy stocks around the world.
"It was adrenaline," he would later say. "Pure adrenaline."
4:30 a.m. Monday, Aug. 8: Pasadena
Working in California, Mr. Walsh started his day before sunrise -- to be ready for the opening bell in New York. It was the first day of United States trading after the debt downgrade.
The stock market opened down, and then grew worse. The sell-off had actually started the day before. Mideast markets had nosedived on Sunday. Futures contracts in Chicago had tumbled. As stocks and corporate bonds fell, Mr. Walsh walked over to one of his traders, a young man with a shaved head, facial scruff and the posture of a man who spends a lot of time sitting in front of a Bloomberg terminal.
They had worked up a list of companies that they suspected would suffer from a spooked market. Ford. HCA. Energy stocks. As the trader watched his screens, he saw that those companies' bond prices were trading 8 percent to 10 percent below their expected range. It didn't make any sense: Ford's finances hadn't changed over the weekend. HCA -- a large hospital chain -- hadn't stopped admitting patients. It was as if investors were dumping anything with a hint of risk, and, paradoxically, rushing to Treasuries, the very securities that S.& P. had just downgraded.
"You see opportunities?" Mr. Walsh asked.
"Yup," said the trader, Walter Kilcullen. "Stuff is being offered, and no one wants to bid."
Western Asset had set aside $700 million for just such an opportunity. It was a one-time fire sale -- as long as their instincts were right. And no one would know for at least a month, maybe longer. "Let's do it," Mr. Walsh said.
Mr. Kilcullen punched a button on his keyboard, picked up the phone and started bidding on bonds that, seemingly, no one else wanted to touch.
Even as the market panicked, Western Asset wasn't selling. Mr. Walsh was convinced that the future of the American economy was as strong as it had been on Friday.
4 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 9: Broad and Wall Streets
As the closing bell sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, traders glanced at the Dow: after plunging 635 points the day before, it closed up 430 points, one of the wildest swings in recent memory. At Third Avenue and Western Asset, traders bided their time, waiting for the panic to strike again.
10 a.m. Wednesday, Aug. 10: Bridgeport, Conn.
On the wall of the People's United in downtown Bridgeport, the flat-screen television broadcasts CNBC. The news is that the Dow had plummeted more than 300 points in less than an hour.
Thirteen floors above, in a spare corner office overlooking the Connecticut Turnpike, John Traynor, the bank's chief investment strategist, prepared for an hourlong call with his team. A bronze sculpture of a bull and bear wrestling sat on his desk.
"There are seven participants on the call, including you," said the computerized operator.
Ms. McDonough, the strategist, had dialed in from Cape Cod, where she had sent her husband outside to chase around their children.
Mr. Traynor told his colleagues that by Friday he wanted a memo sent to clients detailing the bank's thoughts on the market turmoil. He peppered them with questions. Was there a risk that the other two big ratings agencies might strip the United States of its AAA status? What would prompt People's to reduce its exposure to equities? Are financial stocks a buy at these prices? Should the money managers adjust their bond allocations after the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates until mid-2013?
"We're in the preservation-of-capital business, and I don't want to make a quick trade," Mr. Traynor said.
Forty-five minutes into the call, Albert Brenner, a senior portfolio manager, brought up Europe. During the discussion, concerns about French and Italian banks had set off a fresh wave of selling, driving the market down 420 points.
"I'm worried about Europe, and worried about the way that the market is worried about Europe," Mr. Brenner said. Another portfolio manager agreed and suggested that the problems overseas were of even greater concern than the issues facing the United States.
"We've seen a flight to quality rearing its head as money has come out of weaker sovereigns and into U.S. treasuries," this manager said.
Mr. Traynor looked up from his notes. It wasn't just Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain that were in trouble, he said. Maybe big European banks were exposed to all that debt.
"That's a situation no financial institution wants to be in and could have serious consequences."
Noon Wednesday, Aug. 10: Midtown Manhattan
Third Avenue spent another $110 million on Tuesday, and the pace of buying then slowed a bit. At a series of meetings, analysts had the chance to present their "pound-your-fist ideas," trades so appealing that you're willing to pound the table to convince the company to buy.
In the oval conference room, Jakub Rehor, a senior research analysts, was extolling Allianz, the huge German insurer and owner of the bond giant Pimco. A handful of colleagues were ready to challenge him, mostly to test the strength of his convictions.
Deflation would be toxic for Allianz, argued Amit Wadhwaney, who leads the group. Could Europe handle deflation as stoically as the Japanese? he asked.
"It happened in Switzerland," Mr. Rehor answered. "Switzerland has been living with it. Twice in the last decade."
"But Switzerland is one country. Germany, France, Italy, Spain -- there are these divergent interest groups," Mr. Wadhwaney said. The European economy, bound by a currency but not much else, seemed to be fraying. Wealthy countries like Germany were beginning to chafe at demands that they bail out their poorer neighbors.
"Yes, so it's not even clear who has their hands on the steering wheel," Mr. Rehor said. "This is a car with 15 steering wheels."
Which led to another question: Will the Europeans start printing money, as an alternative to further bailouts? The consequence of that could be rampant inflation. On the other hand, it would be almost impossible for some nations to reclaim their former prosperity without turning on their printing presses.
"They probably will print the money," Mr. Rehor said. "Once it looks like one of the big guys -- Italy, France, Spain -- is in trouble, they'll look at the size of the problem and say, 'We can't fix it with the bailout fund.' "
8 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 10: Pasadena
That night, Mr. Walsh watched the news with his daughter, who had just received her first paycheck as a kindergarten teacher. Scenes of rioting in England flashed on the screen. The two had been talking about the week's financial upheavals. The United States, Mr. Walsh told her, was fundamentally secure.
But Europe was a different matter. The stability of some European banks was unclear, he worried. As much as Congress was bickering in the United States, the politics were even worse in Greece, Italy and Britain. It was hard for Mr. Walsh to get his arms around European politics, to understand who was ultimately in charge. It wasn't clear that anyone had a plan for how to react if another crisis took hold.
"Could that ever happen here?" his daughter asked, pointing to the images of Britons setting cars on fire and looting stores.
"I don't think anything like that could happen here anytime soon," Mr. Walsh replied. But there were reasons for concern. Social services were likely to be cut further in many states as governments grappled with a slow recovery and declining tax revenue, he said.
"If we can't get our act together, it could come here," he told her. "I worry that what we're seeing in Europe is coming to a theater near us."
11:43 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 11: Pasadena
As President Obama's face appeared on the giant TV screens at the front of the room, traders stood up from their desks to watch. The president was speaking at a battery company in Holland, Mich., his words intended to calm jittery investors.
His voice came from small speakers on each trader's desk. Except for the television and the cricket chirps of ringing phones, the room was quiet. Someone had installed a large smiley face along one of the rafters.
"There's nothing wrong with our country," the president said. "There's something wrong with our politics."
Walter Kilcullen, the trader who was buying up bonds for Western Asset during the fire sale, glanced at his neighbor. Mr. Kilcullen hadn't shaved that morning. He looked exhausted. He had been getting up at 3:30 a.m. every day, buying everything he could find at the right price -- deploying hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then hitting the gym to blow off steam, then staying up late at home to re-analyze his trades.
His girlfriend kept telling him to come to bed. He was too tired to explain why this was not the week to catch up on his sleep.
Back at the office, he thought to himself that he had made some good purchases. He had bought one class of bonds when they were 10 percent below normal prices, and then watched them climb 5 percent, a multimillion-dollar profit in a few days.
But it didn't matter. His overall portfolio was down for the week, battered by the downgrade. Over time, it would probably climb again. But he would end the week at a loss.
He rubbed his eyes and pointed to the president on the screen. "At least he didn't say the bond market is oversold," he told his neighbor. They laughed.
"Blah blah blah blah," someone at the back of the room said to Mr. Obama's image.
Mr. Kilcullen switched off his speaker and turned back to his screen. There were more bonds to buy.
12:30 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 11: Midtown Manhattan
With the market lurching both up and down, David Barse, the chief executive of Third Avenue, asked about conversations that one of his investment groups, called the credit and distressed team, had been having with clients concerned enough to call and check in.
"They really want to hear the inside story," said Tom Lapointe, a member of the team. "Because they read the paper and everyone's drawing graphs that say: 'My God, it's just the beginning of 2008. Look at how this correlates. If that's the case don't we have 80 percent more downside?' "
"What are you telling them?" Mr. Barse asked.
"If risk reprices, risk reprices across the board," Mr. Lapointe answered. "I can't give them the surety of knowing because I don't know. I know it's different this time, and I also tell them, 'By the way, every time someone tells me something is different this time, I always hold my wallet.' "
3:50 p.m. Friday, Aug. 12: Midtown Manhattan
Michael Warlan, the Third Avenue trader, sat in front of a half-dozen computer monitors and watched the market drift to a quiet close -- a modest gain for the day. As the minutes ticked away, he was still shopping, having spent close to $400 million on stocks in the span of five days.
He scoured his screens one last time. Nothing. The closing bell rang through a television that was tuned to CNBC. He slapped a palm on his desk. Time to head home.
Looking back on the hundreds of trades he made this week, was he happy?
"I'm happy we had a plan in place for these very circumstances," he said.
And the trades themselves? "Talk to me in 6 to 12 months."

A Growing Gloom for States and Cities: The Republican-led debt crisis will only add to budget cutbacks in capitols and city halls

Abstract: In the space of just a few weeks, the Republican-led standoff on spending and taxes brought them a triple dose of bad news: a budget deal that will probably lead to a significant reduction in federal aid; a bond downgrade that could eventually trickle down to the local and state level, making borrowing more expensive; and a stock market plunge that is bleeding state employee pension funds.

Full text: States and cities had already endured a harrowing three-year financial slide when the debt-ceiling crisis darkened their outlooks even further. In the space of just a few weeks, the Republican-led standoff on spending and taxes brought them a triple dose of bad news: a budget deal that will probably lead to a significant reduction in federal aid; a bond downgrade that could eventually trickle down to the local and state level, making borrowing more expensive; and a stock market plunge that is bleeding state employee pension funds.
Washington should have been trying to find a way to help states avoid the layoffs and cutbacks that have contributed heavily to the high unemployment rate. Instead, it seems to be doing everything possible to make the situation worse in state capitals around the country.
States have been cutting frantically for the last four years because of declining tax revenues, but the 2012 budget year will have the deepest cuts to education, health care and other services since the recession began. A recent report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities showed that nearly all states will spend less on vital services in 2012 than they did in 2008, after inflation, even though there are more children in public schools and more poor people on the Medicaid rolls.
That means that 100,000 low-income people will be kept out of Medicaid in Arizona, which has frozen enrollment. New Jersey plans to cancel Medicaid coverage for 23,000 parents. Texas eliminated prekindergarten money for 100,000 children. Ohio and Pennsylvania are each cutting school aid by more than 7 percent this year, which in Ohio is equivalent to more than 14,000 teachers' salaries.
More layoffs are also likely in many states, on top of the 577,000 jobs eliminated by state and local governments since 2008. (More than a dozen states facing shortfalls have inexcusably cut taxes, or, as in New York, plan to let tax surcharges expire.)
And now comes the Budget Control Act of 2011, the deal reached in Congress to cut $2.4 trillion over the next decade in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. Although the deal could have been worse and was structured by White House negotiators to reduce the impact on safety-net programs like Medicare and Medicaid, it will do real damage at the state and local level.
The act will cut $917 billion out of domestic discretionary programs, about 60 percent of which will come from nondefense spending. That will inevitably reduce transportation, education and environmental aid sent to the states.
Any kind of grand bargain to raise revenues by the "super-committee" that was formed by the debt ceiling deal will probably affect Medicaid, which is shared between the states and Washington. If the committee fails, an automatic trigger mechanism would cut $1.2 trillion -- not from Medicaid and the other social-insurance programs, which are protected in the deal, but from the military (whose bases are important to many state and local budgets) and from discretionary programs.
The credit downgrade that resulted from the debt crisis has yet to directly affect state and city bonds, many of which are now absurdly rated higher than Treasury bonds, but credit scrutiny will only get stricter for already weakened states and cities.
If investors start to get nervous about the public sector, borrowing costs could go up. Stock volatility is also taking a toll on state pension funds, which are often heavily invested in the market. Last Monday, when the Dow Jones fell by more than 600 points, the California retirement system lost $6 billion. Declines in the market also lower income tax revenues for state coffers.
The Republicans who produced this artificial crisis, and are responsible for its effects, say they would like nothing more than to see a reduction in state as well as federal spending. That is where government hits closest to home, affecting the size of classrooms, the bulbs in streetlights, the asphalt in potholes, and the lines in emergency rooms.
They are well on their way to achieving their goal, making life more difficult in every city and town.

America's Economic Woes Cast a Pall On the Vice President's Talks in China

Abstract: Europe's continuing sovereign debt miseries, the specter of a possible double-dip recession in the United States, and the turmoil in global markets last week have only heightened anxiety in China, whose economic growth depends to a large measure on its vast export sector. The efforts of Chinese leaders to maintain social stability have been challenged this summer by ethnic violence in the western region of Xinjiang and a remarkable surge of public criticism over the government's handling of a deadly high-speed rail crash in Zhejiang Province.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Over the winter, officials in China and the United States were trying to turn a new page in relations. In January, during a state visit to Washington by President Hu Jintao, leaders worked hard to dispel the rancor that had been slowly building. Soon after, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. committed to an earlier proposal to meet this summer with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, who is expected to succeed Mr. Hu next year.
But as Mr. Biden prepares to depart for China on Tuesday, a new uncertainty looms over relations.
Chinese leaders are asking sharp questions about the strength of the American economy and American leadership, because of the government's struggle to meet its debt obligations and the partisan schisms and political paralysis that turned a problem into a crisis. Mr. Biden postponed his original departure date in July to help hammer out the agreement that forestalled default on some obligations but failed to avert a downgrade of America's AAA credit rating by Standard & Poor's. Xinhua, the state news agency, published a commentary demanding that the United States "cure its addiction to debts" and "live within its means."
The uncertainty about America goes straight to China's pockets: it holds more than $1.1 trillion in United States Treasury securities, making it the country's largest foreign creditor. Some ordinary Chinese have publicly criticized the Chinese leadership for investing so much in American government securities.
Europe's continuing sovereign debt miseries, the specter of a possible double-dip recession in the United States, and the turmoil in global markets last week have only heightened anxiety in China, whose economic growth depends to a large measure on its vast export sector.
Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Peking University, said he attended a meeting at the Ministry of Finance last week where officials were wringing their hands.
"The feeling of everyone was that the world economy has just suddenly become very unpredictable," he said. "No one wants to see the U.S. economy keep going downhill and a new financial crisis. China and the U.S. are very important in keeping the global economy stable."
As they get to know each other, Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi will no doubt discuss some of the security issues that have divided the two countries -- American arms sales to Taiwan, North Korea's nuclear program and tensions over the South China Sea. But the economic issues have moved to the fore.
"The primary purpose of the trip, which was planned before recent economic problems, was to build the relationship with Xi Jinping," said Jeffrey A. Bader, who until April was the senior director for East Asian affairs on the National Security Council. "Recent events in the economic sphere have undoubtedly put the U.S. economy and U.S. currency on the agenda."
Da Wei, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, said, "U.S. Treasury debt is the biggest concern since it's about the safety of China's financial investment."
As in the United States, domestic troubles in China have been taking precedence over foreign relations. The efforts of Chinese leaders to maintain social stability have been challenged this summer by ethnic violence in the western region of Xinjiang and a remarkable surge of public criticism over the government's handling of a deadly high-speed rail crash in Zhejiang Province.
Perhaps most unsettling for the country's leaders is the creeping rise in the inflation rate; China's consumer price index went up 6.4 percent year-on-year in June, the steepest rise in three years. Analysts say average inflation for the year is certain to surpass the 4 percent benchmark Chinese leaders had set. Though it may be peaking, "inflation is likely to remain the policy priority well into the fourth quarter," Alistair Thornton, a China analyst at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a report last week.
Inflation puts China in much more of a policy bind if the West gets mired in another deep slump. In 2008, when the global financial crisis hit, China relied on stimulus spending and loose lending by state banks to pump up infrastructure building and other capital-intensive projects to maintain economic growth. Now, Chinese officials are concerned about rampant spending and are trying to tighten bank lending.
One point of tension between the United States and China has faded into the background in recent months: China's valuation of its currency. The Obama administration had long pushed China to appreciate its currency to correct trade imbalances and help restructure the world economy. The Chinese government was reluctant to do so, fearing the cost to exports. But an undervalued renminbi contributes to inflation, so China has been slowly letting the renminbi rise against the dollar.
The issue may also be losing some of its weight in American politics. The International Monetary Fund pointed out in a report last month that a stronger renminbi would not necessarily bolster job creation in the United States.
So instead of Mr. Biden pressing the Chinese on their currency, Chinese officials are likely to be pressing him about the stability of the dollar. All the while, they will be trying to gauge the strength of President Obama, having witnessed the difficulties he faced in persuading Republicans in Congress to raise the debt ceiling.
"It always encourages good behavior in China when they think they're dealing with a strong U.S. president," said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution who served on the National Security Council in the Clinton administration. "It's hard to see how recent events would have created an impression that he's a strong leader."

Full text: ONE of the most harrowing stretches in Wall Street history began with the loss of the AAA credit rating of the United States and ended with fears of a new recession. In between, the wild swings in the financial markets captivated the nation, and the world.
Even financial professionals were grasping for answers. Many were selling -- and many were buying as fast as they could. Each was making a bet on whether last week was a hiccup, or the start of something worse.
9:45 p.m. Friday, Aug. 5: Waterbury Center, Vt.
As she watched her beloved Red Sox battle the Yankees, Karissa McDonough opened her laptop to check e-mail.
Jumping off the screen was a subject line from a news alert at 9:03 p.m.: "U.S. Long-Term Debt Downgraded by Standard & Poor's."
She stared at her screen in disbelief. Ms. McDonough, the chief bond strategist at People's United Bank in Connecticut, had spent her working life analyzing the debt of companies and governments. This news, however, was surreal. This happened in other countries. Not here.
"We were just downgraded!" she exclaimed to her husband.
"Who's we?"
"The United States!"
She had to react swiftly. Clients might panic. Money managers at People's United would need to know what to say. She began tapping on her laptop. At 11:02 p.m. she sent an e-mail to more than 100 colleagues. The downgrade, she told them, was "historic but not catastrophic."
Ms. McDonough went on: "The U.S. Treasury market remains the safest, largest, most liquid investable asset class in the world." Governments like China's, she said, would be hard-pressed to find a better alternative.
She collapsed into bed. She had a sinking feeling that her vacation on Cape Cod, scheduled for the coming week, was about to be downgraded, too.
Noon Saturday, Aug. 6: Pasadena, Calif.
Stephen Walsh, the chief investment officer of Western Asset, had been expecting the e-mail all day.
"How do you think the markets will respond on Monday?" a worried official from the United States Treasury asked him.
A few weeks earlier, Western Asset, one of the nation's largest bond fund managers, had asked Standard & Poor's for a private briefing about America's credit rating. S.& P. had already announced that there was an even chance that the nation's AAA rating might be lowered.
The S.& P. analysts were prohibited from saying more. But when they met with Western Asset, it was clear that the odds had worsened. "You could tell a lot by their body language, how carefully they answered certain questions," said one of the people in those meetings. The analysts didn't say anything specific, but they didn't have to. Afterward, Mr. Walsh took his top lieutenants into his office, one by one. A downgrade is inevitable, he told them. We need a plan.
Now, it had happened. The previous night, the once unthinkable had occurred. The Treasury official from Washington wanted to know how Mr. Walsh -- a man who indirectly controls half a trillion dollars in assets -- thought the markets would respond. The Treasury was planning to sell billions of dollars of new bonds in the coming week. If buyers didn't materialize at the auctions, it could be disastrous for the government, the financial markets and the entire global economy.
"I think investors understand it's not that big a deal," Mr. Walsh told the Treasury official.
It was the same thing he had been saying all day to colleagues, hedge funds and investment banks seeking his advice. "U.S. Treasuries are still the most high-quality instrument out there," he told them. People need a safe place to put their money, and if the downgrade unsettled the stock market, as he suspected it would, investors would flock to safe investments like Treasuries, regardless of S.& P.'s opinions.
"World investors didn't downgrade U.S. debt; S.& P. did," he told one caller. "It's just one opinion."
When he hung up, his wife turned to him.
"What if you're wrong?" she asked.
"That's the great thing about Wall Street," he replied. "We'll know Monday morning if I'm a genius or an idiot."
11:30 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 7: East 66th Street, Manhattan
It looked like a sell-off. Not a panic like the one that had struck in 2008, but something different.
Michael Warlan, who heads equity trading for Third Avenue, a mutual fund company in Manhattan, sat in his home office on the Upper East Side, fielding calls and sending instant messages to brokers around the globe.
Amid the turbulence, he smelled opportunity.
Third Avenue, with $15 billion in assets under management, had in recent months moved about 12 percent of its money into cash. Its strategy is to invest in undervalued stocks -- and in May, June and July, there had been precious few good deals to be found. Now, Mr. Warlan sat with a list of stocks he had been eyeing for months. Many were dropping close to the target prices that Third Avenue had been seeking. His colleagues were calling.
The consensus: it was time to buy.
Mr. Warlan started executing trades in foreign markets, pausing for a nap around 2 a.m., then waking at 4 a.m. for the opening of European markets. Without stopping to sleep any more, he went to his office that morning, at the corner of Third Avenue and 41st Street, a few blocks from Grand Central Station. By close of business on Monday, he had spent $110 million to buy stocks around the world.
"It was adrenaline," he would later say. "Pure adrenaline."
4:30 a.m. Monday, Aug. 8: Pasadena
Working in California, Mr. Walsh started his day before sunrise -- to be ready for the opening bell in New York. It was the first day of United States trading after the debt downgrade.
The stock market opened down, and then grew worse. The sell-off had actually started the day before. Mideast markets had nosedived on Sunday. Futures contracts in Chicago had tumbled. As stocks and corporate bonds fell, Mr. Walsh walked over to one of his traders, a young man with a shaved head, facial scruff and the posture of a man who spends a lot of time sitting in front of a Bloomberg terminal.
They had worked up a list of companies that they suspected would suffer from a spooked market. Ford. HCA. Energy stocks. As the trader watched his screens, he saw that those companies' bond prices were trading 8 percent to 10 percent below their expected range. It didn't make any sense: Ford's finances hadn't changed over the weekend. HCA -- a large hospital chain -- hadn't stopped admitting patients. It was as if investors were dumping anything with a hint of risk, and, paradoxically, rushing to Treasuries, the very securities that S.& P. had just downgraded.
"You see opportunities?" Mr. Walsh asked.
"Yup," said the trader, Walter Kilcullen. "Stuff is being offered, and no one wants to bid."
Western Asset had set aside $700 million for just such an opportunity. It was a one-time fire sale -- as long as their instincts were right. And no one would know for at least a month, maybe longer. "Let's do it," Mr. Walsh said.
Mr. Kilcullen punched a button on his keyboard, picked up the phone and started bidding on bonds that, seemingly, no one else wanted to touch.
Even as the market panicked, Western Asset wasn't selling. Mr. Walsh was convinced that the future of the American economy was as strong as it had been on Friday.
4 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 9: Broad and Wall Streets
As the closing bell sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, traders glanced at the Dow: after plunging 635 points the day before, it closed up 430 points, one of the wildest swings in recent memory. At Third Avenue and Western Asset, traders bided their time, waiting for the panic to strike again.
10 a.m. Wednesday, Aug. 10: Bridgeport, Conn.
On the wall of the People's United in downtown Bridgeport, the flat-screen television broadcasts CNBC. The news is that the Dow had plummeted more than 300 points in less than an hour.
Thirteen floors above, in a spare corner office overlooking the Connecticut Turnpike, John Traynor, the bank's chief investment strategist, prepared for an hourlong call with his team. A bronze sculpture of a bull and bear wrestling sat on his desk.
"There are seven participants on the call, including you," said the computerized operator.
Ms. McDonough, the strategist, had dialed in from Cape Cod, where she had sent her husband outside to chase around their children.
Mr. Traynor told his colleagues that by Friday he wanted a memo sent to clients detailing the bank's thoughts on the market turmoil. He peppered them with questions. Was there a risk that the other two big ratings agencies might strip the United States of its AAA status? What would prompt People's to reduce its exposure to equities? Are financial stocks a buy at these prices? Should the money managers adjust their bond allocations after the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates until mid-2013?
"We're in the preservation-of-capital business, and I don't want to make a quick trade," Mr. Traynor said.
Forty-five minutes into the call, Albert Brenner, a senior portfolio manager, brought up Europe. During the discussion, concerns about French and Italian banks had set off a fresh wave of selling, driving the market down 420 points.
"I'm worried about Europe, and worried about the way that the market is worried about Europe," Mr. Brenner said. Another portfolio manager agreed and suggested that the problems overseas were of even greater concern than the issues facing the United States.
"We've seen a flight to quality rearing its head as money has come out of weaker sovereigns and into U.S. treasuries," this manager said.
Mr. Traynor looked up from his notes. It wasn't just Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain that were in trouble, he said. Maybe big European banks were exposed to all that debt.
"That's a situation no financial institution wants to be in and could have serious consequences."
Noon Wednesday, Aug. 10: Midtown Manhattan
Third Avenue spent another $110 million on Tuesday, and the pace of buying then slowed a bit. At a series of meetings, analysts had the chance to present their "pound-your-fist ideas," trades so appealing that you're willing to pound the table to convince the company to buy.
In the oval conference room, Jakub Rehor, a senior research analysts, was extolling Allianz, the huge German insurer and owner of the bond giant Pimco. A handful of colleagues were ready to challenge him, mostly to test the strength of his convictions.
Deflation would be toxic for Allianz, argued Amit Wadhwaney, who leads the group. Could Europe handle deflation as stoically as the Japanese? he asked.
"It happened in Switzerland," Mr. Rehor answered. "Switzerland has been living with it. Twice in the last decade."
"But Switzerland is one country. Germany, France, Italy, Spain -- there are these divergent interest groups," Mr. Wadhwaney said. The European economy, bound by a currency but not much else, seemed to be fraying. Wealthy countries like Germany were beginning to chafe at demands that they bail out their poorer neighbors.
"Yes, so it's not even clear who has their hands on the steering wheel," Mr. Rehor said. "This is a car with 15 steering wheels."
Which led to another question: Will the Europeans start printing money, as an alternative to further bailouts? The consequence of that could be rampant inflation. On the other hand, it would be almost impossible for some nations to reclaim their former prosperity without turning on their printing presses.
"They probably will print the money," Mr. Rehor said. "Once it looks like one of the big guys -- Italy, France, Spain -- is in trouble, they'll look at the size of the problem and say, 'We can't fix it with the bailout fund.' "
8 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 10: Pasadena
That night, Mr. Walsh watched the news with his daughter, who had just received her first paycheck as a kindergarten teacher. Scenes of rioting in England flashed on the screen. The two had been talking about the week's financial upheavals. The United States, Mr. Walsh told her, was fundamentally secure.
But Europe was a different matter. The stability of some European banks was unclear, he worried. As much as Congress was bickering in the United States, the politics were even worse in Greece, Italy and Britain. It was hard for Mr. Walsh to get his arms around European politics, to understand who was ultimately in charge. It wasn't clear that anyone had a plan for how to react if another crisis took hold.
"Could that ever happen here?" his daughter asked, pointing to the images of Britons setting cars on fire and looting stores.
"I don't think anything like that could happen here anytime soon," Mr. Walsh replied. But there were reasons for concern. Social services were likely to be cut further in many states as governments grappled with a slow recovery and declining tax revenue, he said.
"If we can't get our act together, it could come here," he told her. "I worry that what we're seeing in Europe is coming to a theater near us."
11:43 a.m. Thursday, Aug. 11: Pasadena
As President Obama's face appeared on the giant TV screens at the front of the room, traders stood up from their desks to watch. The president was speaking at a battery company in Holland, Mich., his words intended to calm jittery investors.
His voice came from small speakers on each trader's desk. Except for the television and the cricket chirps of ringing phones, the room was quiet. Someone had installed a large smiley face along one of the rafters.
"There's nothing wrong with our country," the president said. "There's something wrong with our politics."
Walter Kilcullen, the trader who was buying up bonds for Western Asset during the fire sale, glanced at his neighbor. Mr. Kilcullen hadn't shaved that morning. He looked exhausted. He had been getting up at 3:30 a.m. every day, buying everything he could find at the right price -- deploying hundreds of millions of dollars -- and then hitting the gym to blow off steam, then staying up late at home to re-analyze his trades.
His girlfriend kept telling him to come to bed. He was too tired to explain why this was not the week to catch up on his sleep.
Back at the office, he thought to himself that he had made some good purchases. He had bought one class of bonds when they were 10 percent below normal prices, and then watched them climb 5 percent, a multimillion-dollar profit in a few days.
But it didn't matter. His overall portfolio was down for the week, battered by the downgrade. Over time, it would probably climb again. But he would end the week at a loss.
He rubbed his eyes and pointed to the president on the screen. "At least he didn't say the bond market is oversold," he told his neighbor. They laughed.
"Blah blah blah blah," someone at the back of the room said to Mr. Obama's image.
Mr. Kilcullen switched off his speaker and turned back to his screen. There were more bonds to buy.
12:30 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 11: Midtown Manhattan
With the market lurching both up and down, David Barse, the chief executive of Third Avenue, asked about conversations that one of his investment groups, called the credit and distressed team, had been having with clients concerned enough to call and check in.
"They really want to hear the inside story," said Tom Lapointe, a member of the team. "Because they read the paper and everyone's drawing graphs that say: 'My God, it's just the beginning of 2008. Look at how this correlates. If that's the case don't we have 80 percent more downside?' "
"What are you telling them?" Mr. Barse asked.
"If risk reprices, risk reprices across the board," Mr. Lapointe answered. "I can't give them the surety of knowing because I don't know. I know it's different this time, and I also tell them, 'By the way, every time someone tells me something is different this time, I always hold my wallet.' "
3:50 p.m. Friday, Aug. 12: Midtown Manhattan
Michael Warlan, the Third Avenue trader, sat in front of a half-dozen computer monitors and watched the market drift to a quiet close -- a modest gain for the day. As the minutes ticked away, he was still shopping, having spent close to $400 million on stocks in the span of five days.
He scoured his screens one last time. Nothing. The closing bell rang through a television that was tuned to CNBC. He slapped a palm on his desk. Time to head home.
Looking back on the hundreds of trades he made this week, was he happy?
"I'm happy we had a plan in place for these very circumstances," he said.
And the trades themselves? "Talk to me in 6 to 12 months."

Full text: Military spending has soared by 35 percent in the past decade -- and that is not even counting the more than $1 trillion spent on the Iraq and Afghan wars, which are budgeted separately. This year's $537 billion basic Pentagon budget is $140 billion higher, in inflation-adjusted terms, than in 2001.
Pumping up those budgets was easy; slimming them back down will be a lot harder. Multiyear weapons contracts for tens of billions of dollars have been signed, tens of thousands of additional troops have been recruited for long-term operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and health care costs have escalated. Insufficient oversight of military contractors and the Pentagon's weakness for excessive bells and whistles have raised costs on almost every major weapons system.
Just finding the roughly $400 billion that President Obama and Congress have agreed to shave off projected spending over 10 years will require a lengthy review of budgets and strategies, even though that would only bring basic annual spending down to about the same level as in 2009.
The first chart shows the growth of the basic budget, along with the costs of the two wars, which have been financed mainly through supplementary budgets.
The second chart shows that the spending mix has also changed in the last 10 years. We're spending substantially more on personnel in salaries for troops and health care. Training, equipment maintenance and administrative support costs have risen 20 percent, adjusted for inflation, and spending on new weapons and research has gone up 30 percent.
The cuts we propose here focus on containing personnel costs, which now account for almost half of non-war-related spending; cutting back troubled weapons systems that the military can function without; and reducing maintenance and administrative costs. Health care alone is nearly 10 percent of the budget. Raising the Tricare premium for employed working-age military retirees by $50 per month could save $6 billion a year. Cutting the Pentagon's civilian work force, now 749,000, by roughly 10 percent could save $7 billion a year.
Significantly deeper savings would probably require scaling back military commitments, which have grown somewhat indiscriminately over the years, not always shaped by cost-benefit analyses or overall military strategy. There was little pressure in the past decade to decide what undertakings were truly essential when the White House and Congress gave the Pentagon almost everything it asked for. Unless policy makers engage in that debate, it's unlikely future military spending growth can be kept in check.

Abstract: With compensation rivaling that on Wall Street, so many foreign bankers, hedge fund managers, oil executives, lawyers and engineers have moved here that prices for prime office space surpassed those in New York this year, making Rio the costliest city in the Americas to lease it, according to the real estate company Cushman & Wakefield.

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO -- Pondering the financial storms lashing Europe and the United States, Seth Zalkin, a casually dressed American banker, sipped a demitasse and seemed content with his decision to move here in March with his wife and son.
"If the rest of the world is cratering, this is a good place to be," said Mr. Zalkin, 39.
For those with even the dimmest memories of Brazil's own debt crisis in the 1980s, the global order has been turned on its head. The American economy may be crawling along, but Brazil's grew at its fastest clip in more than two decades last year and unemployment is at historic lows, part of the nation's transformation from inflationary basket case into one of Washington's top creditors.
With compensation rivaling that on Wall Street, so many foreign bankers, hedge fund managers, oil executives, lawyers and engineers have moved here that prices for prime office space surpassed those in New York this year, making Rio the costliest city in the Americas to lease it, according to the real estate company Cushman & Wakefield.
A gold rush mind-set is in full swing, with foreign work permits surging 144 percent in the past five years and Americans leading the pack of educated professionals putting down stakes.
Businessmen have long been drawn to Brazil, along with get-rich-quick confidence men, dreamers of Amazonian grandeur and even outlaws like Ronald Biggs, the Briton who absconded here after his 1963 Great Train Robbery.
But now schools catering to American and other English-speaking families have long waiting lists, apartments can cost $10,000 a month in coveted parts of Rio and many of the newcomers hold Ivy League degrees or job experience at the pillars of the global economy.
Once here, they find a country facing a very different challenge than do the United States and Europe: fears that the economy is getting too hot.
One particular shock for newcomers is the strength of Brazil's currency, the real. That may help Brazilians snapping up apartments in places like South Beach in Miami, where properties cost about a third of their equivalents in Rio's exclusive districts. But it also hurts the country's manufacturers and exporters.
So in a bid to prevent it from going even higher, Brazil is now one of the biggest buyers of United States Treasury securities, becoming a larger stakeholder in the ailing American economy. That is a sharp break from the past, when Washington helped cobble together bailout packages for Brazil's financial crises.
"Brazil is doing great, but honestly, every other week I ask myself, 'When is this going to end?' " said Mark Bures, 42, an American executive who moved here in 1999, just in time to see an abrupt devaluation of the currency and other sharp swings in Brazil's fortunes.
A few veteran American expatriates even remember Brazil's last economic "miracle" in the early 1970s, when The Wall Street Journal quoted an ebullient banker at the start of a front-page article who predicted, "In 10 years, Brazil will be one of the five great powers of the world." Instead, the country ended up with daunting levels of foreign debt.
The recent commodities boom and growth in domestic consumption, the result of an expanding middle class, helped turn Brazil into a rising power that bounced back handily from the 2008 global financial crisis. The economy grew 7.5 percent last year and is expected to register about 4 percent growth this year -- slower, but still enviable in the United States.
Yet Brazil offers many challenges to give newcomers pause. Labor legislation favors hiring Brazilians over foreigners, and the lengthy process of obtaining a work visa can surprise those unaccustomed to Brazil's gargantuan bureaucracy.
Some economists consider the Brazilian real the world's most overvalued currency against the dollar and inflation has climbed (as evidenced by $6.16 Big Macs and $35 martinis). Interest rates remain stubbornly high and analysts debate whether a credit bubble is forming as consumers continue a multiyear spree on everything from homes to cars.
Brazil is hardly immune to the turbulence in global markets, and its currency has weakened a bit this month. Rio's real estate has been bustling as soccer's World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016 approach, but its infrastructure is inadequate. Violent crime, though falling in some areas, plagues big parts of the country and Rio, which suffered through a traumatic bus hijacking this month.
Still, foreigners are arriving, and work authorizations for them jumped more than 30 percent in 2010 alone, according to the Labor Ministry.
"I had very basic Portuguese, but I could tell this place was booming," said Michelle Noyes, 29, a New Yorker who organized a hedge fund conference in Sao Paulo. Shortly after, she made the leap to Brazil for a job at a Sao Paulo asset management firm.
"I moved from the periphery of the industry to the center," said Ms. Noyes, citing five other Americans, two from New York and three from Chicago, who are moving to Brazil this month to try their luck.
Americans form the largest group moving here, followed by contingents of Britons and other Europeans. Some are on temporary assignments. Others are starting ventures big and small.
David Neeleman, the American founder of JetBlue Airways, recently created Azul, a low-cost Brazilian airline. Corrado Varoli, an Italian who oversaw Goldman Sachs' Latin American operations from New York, now runs his own Sao Paulo boutique investment bank. New Brazilian dot-coms like Baby.com.br, an online diaper retailer founded this year by two American cousins fresh out of business schools like Wharton and Harvard's, sometimes give Brazil a bubbly feel not unlike that of the United States in 1999.
Others foreigners take jobs at Brazilian companies thriving from a boom partly created by Brazil's trade with China.
"Our salaries here in Brazil are at least 50 percent more than salaries in the U.S. for strategic positions," said Jacques Sarfatti, country manager for Russell Reynolds, a company that recruits business executives.
Foreigners compete with Brazilians returning home from abroad. "It's really obvious that the labor market is so bad elsewhere," said Dara Chapman, 45, a Californian who is a partner in a Rio hedge fund, Polo Capital. She said she was receiving so many resumes from would-be transplants from the United States that they were a "dime a dozen."
Brazil's huge deep-sea oil discoveries have also drawn investors and foreigners, including thousands of Filipinos working on ships and offshore oil platforms. For its other industries, Brazil needs an estimated 60,000 new engineers, some of whom must come from abroad, given the country's lagging educational system.
"I moved from Beijing a year ago and find the potential for professional development incredible," said Cynthia Yuanxiu Zhang, 27, a Chinese manager at a technology company. "I'm already planning to extend my time here well into this decade."

Abstract: The events of the last few weeks -- gridlock in Washington, brinksmanship over raising the debt ceiling, Standard & Poor's downgrade of long-term Treasuries, renewed fears about European debt and a dizzying plunge in the stock market -- bear an intriguing resemblance to some of the events of 1937-38, the so-called recession within the Depression, with a major caveat: it was a lot worse back then. Faced with strident calls from both Republicans and members of his own party to balance the federal budget, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress raised income taxes, levied a Social Security tax (which preceded by several years any payments of benefits) and slashed federal spending in an effort to balance the federal budget.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Like earthquakes, financial crises seem to be accompanied by aftershocks, like the one we've been living through this week. They can feel every bit as bad as the crisis itself. But economic history and academic research suggest they can set the stage for a sustainable recovery -- and eventual sharp stock market gains.
The events of the last few weeks -- gridlock in Washington, brinksmanship over raising the debt ceiling, Standard & Poor's downgrade of long-term Treasuries, renewed fears about European debt and a dizzying plunge in the stock market -- bear an intriguing resemblance to some of the events of 1937-38, the so-called recession within the Depression, with a major caveat: it was a lot worse back then. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 49 percent from its peak in 1937. Manufacturing output fell by 37 percent, a steeper decline than in 1929-33. Unemployment, which had been slowly declining, to 14 percent from 25 percent, surged to 19 percent. Price declines led to deflation.
"The parallels to what is happening now are very strong," Robert McElvaine, author of "The Great Depression: America, 1929-1941" and a professor of history at Millsaps College, said this week. Then as now, policy makers were struggling with how and when to turn off the fiscal stimulus and monetary easing that had been used to combat the initial crisis.
Are we at similar risk today? David Bianco, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch Bank of America, told me this week that "the market is collapsing faster than any fundamentals would warrant." The possibility that the United States faces a recession as bad as 1937's seems far-fetched. Nonetheless, Mr. Bianco notes that the market is now pricing in an 80 percent chance of recession, one likely to be more severe than in 1991. (He said Merrill Lynch places the odds at 35 percent.) He noted that there had been only three instances when such a steep market decline was not followed by recession: 1966, 1987 (after the October stock market crash) and 1998 (after the implosion of Long Term Capital Management.) "Confidence is shaken and rapidly falling," he said, a problem worsened by falling stock prices.
By 1937 an economic recovery seemed to be in full swing, giving policy makers every reason to believe the economy was strong enough to withdraw government stimulus. Growth from 1933 to 1936 averaged a booming 9 percent a year (rivaling modern-day China's), albeit from a very low base. The federal debt had swelled to 40 percent of gross domestic product in 1936 (from 16 percent in 1929.). Faced with strident calls from both Republicans and members of his own party to balance the federal budget, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress raised income taxes, levied a Social Security tax (which preceded by several years any payments of benefits) and slashed federal spending in an effort to balance the federal budget. Income-tax revenue grew by 66 percent between 1936 and 1937 and the marginal tax rate on incomes over $4,000 nearly doubled, to 11.6 percent from an average marginal rate of 6.4 percent. (The marginal tax rate on the rich -- those making over $1 million -- went to 75 percent, from 59 percent.)
The Federal Reserve did its part to throw the economy back into recession by tightening credit. Wholesale prices were rising in 1936, setting off inflation fears. There was concern that the Fed's accommodative monetary policies of the 1920s had led to asset speculation that precipitated the 1929 crash and ensuing Depression. The Fed responded by increasing banks' reserve requirements in several stages, leading to a drop in the money supply.
The possible causes of the ensuing stock market plunge and steep contraction in the economy provide fodder for just about everyone in the current political debate. Republicans can point to the Roosevelt tax increases. Democrats have the spending reductions, which coincides with Mr. McElvaine's view. "It appears clear to me that the cause was policies put into effect in 1936-37, mainly cutting spending when F.D.R. believed his re-election was secured," he said.
The Nobel-prize winning economist Milton Friedman blamed the Fed and the contraction in the money supply in his epic "Monetary History of the U.S." And the stock market itself may have been a culprit, falling so steeply that it wiped out the wealth effect of rising prices, undermined confidence and brought back painful memories of the crash. But taken together, they suggest that policy makers moved too quickly to withdraw government support for the economy.
In the current context, it's hard to blame the Fed for being too restrictive in its monetary policy, as the Fed was in 1937. If anything, critics fault it for being too accommodating, raising many of the same issues that led the Fed to tighten in 1937. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is a student of Depression history and is well aware of Mr. Friedman's monetary analysis. "He won't make the same mistake," Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said.
The Fed's pledge this week to keep interest rates near zero not just for a vague "extended period" but for a full two years rendered two-year Treasuries virtually risk-free and depressed their yields to a record low of 0.19 percent. This should lead investors to seek income from riskier assets, leading to lower interest rates across the spectrum, including mortgage rates.
Despite a brief stock market rally after the Fed's announcement, Mr. Bianco said he believed investors might be underestimating the significance of the Fed's move. "You will see household funding costs go down. That will be a benefit and should boost confidence." At the least, "The Fed has not abandoned us. They're doing what they can," he said.
But monetary policy can only do so much, especially if fiscal policy is moving in the opposite direction.
Christina Romer, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has written extensively about the Great Depression, declared two years ago while chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors: "The urge to declare victory and get back to normal after an economic crisis is strong. That urge needs to be resisted."
Yet both political parties have strapped themselves to the mast of deficit reduction, one through spending cuts, the other tax increases. The recent market plunge may reflect not the largely symbolic S.& P. downgrade of United States Treasuries or worries about political gridlock, but widespread investor fears that both approaches risk a renewed recession by withdrawing stimulus from a fragile economy too soon. No one seriously disagrees that the budget deficit has to be addressed, either through spending cuts or tax increases or in some combination of the two. The question is when.
The good news about the 1937-38 recession, severe though it was, is that it lasted just a year, from May 1937 to June 1938 by most calculations. The precipitous 1937 stock market decline and surging unemployment jolted Washington into action. The Fed reversed its higher bank reserves policy and cut the discount rate to 1 percent. In April, President Roosevelt announced a $2 billion "spend-lend" program and embraced deficit spending. But the tax increases remained in effect. Economic growth resumed in June 1938 and was stronger than it had been in the 1933-37 period. Stocks surged.
Of course, history never repeats itself exactly, and unfortunately for today's policy makers, the causes of the 1938 economic rebound seem less clear than the causes of the recession. While Keynesians have embraced the Roosevelt stimulus package to support their arguments for government intervention, others argue it came too late and was too small to account for the recovery. A Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago senior economist, Francois Velde, concluded that while traditional monetary and fiscal analyses tended to account for the severity of the 1937 downturn, other still-unidentified factors are needed to explain why the economy "rebounded so strongly."
Still, the sense that Washington was doing something to address the problems may have played a key role by bolstering confidence, which was reinforced by rising stock prices.
Historians can't know if the 1938 recovery, strong as it was, would have been enough to finally end the Great Depression. World War II intervened. But nothing today seems nearly as dire as the problems facing the world in 1938. The 1937 aftershocks had the effect of galvanizing policy makers who had grown complacent about the recovery. The result was renewed economic growth, higher employment, higher wages and productivity -- and higher stock prices. Investors who had the courage to buy stocks at their 1937 lows were looking at a 60 percent gain less than a year later.

Online Correction: August 12, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column published online paraphrased the views of the chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch Bank of America incorrectly. The strategist, David Bianco, said that the market is pricing in an 80 percent chance of a recession; that is not his personal opinion. (He said Merrill Lynch places the odds at 35 percent.)

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Fanned by the financial crisis, a wave of sentencing and parole reforms is gaining force as it sweeps across the United States, reversing a trend of "tough on crime" policies that lasted for decades and drove the nation's incarceration rate to the highest -- and most costly -- level in the developed world.
While liberals have long complained that harsh mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenses like drug possession are unjust, the push to overhaul penal policies has been increasingly embraced by elected officials in some of the most conservative states in the country. And for a different reason: to save money.
Some early results have been dramatic. In 2007, Texas was facing a projected shortfall of about 17,000 inmate beds by 2012. But instead of building and operating new prison space, the State Legislature decided to steer nonviolent offenders into drug treatment and to expand re-entry programs designed to help recently released inmates avoid returning to custody.
As a result, the Texas prison system is now operating so far under its capacity that this month it is closing a 1,100-bed facility in Sugar Land -- the first time in the state's history that a prison has closed. Texas taxpayers have saved hundreds of millions of dollars, and the changes have coincided with the violent crime rate's dipping to its lowest level in 30 years.
"In Texas for the last few years we've been driving down both the crime rate and the incarceration rate," said Marc Levin, the director of the Center for Effective Justice at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which helped draft the state's corrections overhaul. "And it's not just Texas. South Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas and Ohio in the past year or so have done major reforms. These are certainly not liberal states. That is significant."
More than a dozen states in recent years have taken steps to reduce the costs to taxpayers of keeping so many criminals locked up. As crime rates have steadily declined to 40-year lows, draining the political potency from crime fears, the fiscal crunch has started to prompt a broad rethinking about alternatives to incarceration.
The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of stiff new sentencing laws, from mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession to California's three-strikes law imposing an automatic life sentence for a third felony conviction. Partly as a result, the United States, with 5 percent of the world's population, now accounts for 25 percent of the world's inmates. Taxpayers are spending about $50 billion a year on state corrections systems -- nearly twice as much, in inflation-adjusted terms, as expenditures in 1987, according to the Pew Center on the States.
Even before the financial crisis settled in, a handful of states, including NewYork, had begun experimenting with softening mandatory sentences for drug crimes, driven by a mix of concerns about effectiveness, fairness and cost. Texas, an early innovator, mandated probation for low-level possession of many drugs in 2003, before enacting its far more sweeping overhaul of incarceration policies in 2007.
But in the past two years, many more states have enacted -- or are considering adopting in their 2012 legislative sessions -- similar policies, including reducing prison time for low-level drug offenders or diverting them into treatment; granting early release to well-behaved or elderly inmates; expanding job training and re-entry programs; and instituting penalties other than a return to prison for technical violations of parole or probation, like missing a meeting.
At the federal level, Congress last year sharply reduced a steep and racially charged disparity in the sentences handed down for crack cocaine offenses when compared with those for powder cocaine. This summer, the federal Sentencing Commission voted to make some sentence reductions for crack offenses retroactive, allowing about 12,000 federal inmates to apply to a judge to reduce their sentences by an average of three years.
And in May the United States Supreme Court ordered California to reduce severe overcrowding in its prisons, pressuring more states to find ways to lock up fewer people if they do not want to pay what it takes to house swelling inmate populations humanely.
"Over the last few years there has been a dramatic shift in the policy and political landscape on the incarceration issues, and momentum is building," said Adam Gelb, the director of a corrections policy project at the Pew Center on the States.
The movement has attracted the support of several prominent conservatives, including Edwin R. Meese III, the attorney general during the Reagan administration. He is part of a campaign, called "Right on Crime," which was begun last December to lend weight to what it calls the "conservative case for reform."
"I'd call it a careful refining of the process," Mr. Meese said. "Most of us who are involved in this are very much in favor of high incarceration of serious habitual offenders. The whole idea is getting the right people in prison, and for those people for whom there is evidence that chances of recidivism are less, to work with those people."
Other Republican affiliates of the group include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Grover Norquist, an antitax activist; Asa Hutchinson, a former director of the Drug Enforcement Administration; and William J. Bennett, a former White House "drug czar."
The movement has seen some reversals. At least three states -- Washington, Kansas and Delaware -- have cut spending on re-entry programs to help close short-term budget gaps, despite criticism that the cuts could result in higher long-term costs if more parolees returned to prison.
In addition, at least three other states -- Illinois, New Jersey and Wisconsin -- suspended or revoked programs that allowed well-behaved inmates to earn early parole. Earlier this year, for example, New Jersey repealed such a program after two former inmates who had been released early were charged with murders.
Vanita Gupta, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which published a report this week on the corrections overhaul movement, said that such setbacks showed the fragility of the effort. Ms. Gupta said statistics-based arguments had historically fared poorly in the political arena when countered by anecdotes of specific crimes.
She said it had taken the fiscal crisis to persuade a wider scope of policy makers to set aside such fears and examine the arguments that the United States could incarcerate fewer people without causing crime rates to rise.
"This is the first sustained opportunity we've had as a country to look at our incarceration policies, and it could end, so the work is urgent," Ms. Gupta said.

Abstract: The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which is part of the central bank, fixed the initial trading value Thursday morning below 6.4 renminbi to the dollar for the first time in the modern history of the currency.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China's currency staged a small but unexpected rally this week, as the country's central bank allowed it to rise 0.72 percent against the dollar, with most of the move coming Wednesday and Thursday.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which is part of the central bank, fixed the initial trading value Thursday morning below 6.4 renminbi to the dollar for the first time in the modern history of the currency.
Economists and traders interpreted the new trading value, 6.3991 to the dollar, as a signal that the central bank might be willing to tolerate a slightly faster rate of appreciation against the dollar, something the United States and other big industrial nations have long pressed China to do.
Daniel Hui, a senior foreign exchange strategist at HSBC, said in a research note that the recent movement in the daily fixing of the renminbi "indicates something has changed -- the question is why, and if it will last."
Allowing the renminbi to strengthen can help China fight inflation, by making imports cheaper. But a stronger renminbi can also hurt exports and employment at China's many export-oriented factories by making Chinese goods more expensive in foreign markets.
The government's National Bureau of Statistics announced Tuesday that inflation in consumer prices had reached 6.5 percent in July, the highest level in three years. At the same time, China's exports were showing unusual strength despite economic weakness in the West.
China's General Administration of Customs announced Wednesday that exports were up 20.4 percent in July from a year earlier, more than most economists had expected, producing a trade surplus of $31.5 billion, the country's largest in more than two years.
But any sustained acceleration in the appreciation of the renminbi could bring greater speculative inflows of money to China. As a result, many economists have been predicting that China may soon allow the currency to trade in a wider band each day around the initial fixing, which is done in Shanghai. Greater volatility makes it harder for speculators to borrow money to put bets on a rising renminbi.
The Administration of Foreign Exchange sets an initial trading value each day and then keeps the currency within a tight range around that value through the day by buying dollars, frequently on a large scale, and selling renminbi. In theory, the currency can vary during the day by as much as 0.5 percent, but the government has tended to keep the daily trading in a much tighter range, often less than 0.1 percent.
China's foreign exchange reserves swelled by $350 billion in the first half of this year -- equal to one-ninth of the country's economic output in the period -- mostly because of this currency market intervention. The Administration of Foreign Exchange also earns interest on its reserves, which totaled $3.2 trillion at the end of June.

Full text: Has market turmoil left you feeling afraid? Well, it should. Clearly, the economic crisis that began in 2008 is by no means over.
But there's another emotion you should feel: anger. For what we're seeing now is what happens when influential people exploit a crisis rather than try to solve it.
For more than a year and a half -- ever since President Obama chose to make deficits, not jobs, the central focus of the 2010 State of the Union address -- we've had a public conversation that has been dominated by budget concerns, while almost ignoring unemployment. The supposedly urgent need to reduce deficits has so dominated the discourse that on Monday, in the midst of a market panic, Mr. Obama devoted most of his remarks to the deficit rather than to the clear and present danger of renewed recession.
What made this so bizarre was the fact that markets were signaling, as clearly as anyone could ask, that unemployment rather than deficits is our biggest problem. Bear in mind that deficit hawks have been warning for years that interest rates on U.S. government debt would soar any day now; the threat from the bond market was supposed to be the reason that we must slash the deficit now now now. But that threat keeps not materializing. And, this week, on the heels of a downgrade that was supposed to scare bond investors, those interest rates actually plunged to record lows.
What the market was saying -- almost shouting -- was, "We're not worried about the deficit! We're worried about the weak economy!" For a weak economy means both low interest rates and a lack of business opportunities, which, in turn, means that government bonds become an attractive investment even at very low yields. If the downgrade of U.S. debt had any effect at all, it was to reinforce fears of austerity policies that will make the economy even weaker.
So how did Washington discourse come to be dominated by the wrong issue?
Hard-line Republicans have, of course, played a role. Although they don't seem to truly care about deficits -- try suggesting any rise in taxes on the rich -- they have found harping on deficits a useful way to attack government programs.
But our discourse wouldn't have gone so far off-track if other influential people hadn't been eager to change the subject away from jobs, even in the face of 9 percent unemployment, and to hijack the crisis on behalf of their pre-existing agendas.
Check out the opinion page of any major newspaper, or listen to any news-discussion program, and you're likely to encounter some self-proclaimed centrist declaring that there are no short-run fixes for our economic difficulties, that the responsible thing is to focus on long-run solutions and, in particular, on "entitlement reform" -- that is, cuts in Social Security and Medicare. And when you do encounter such a person, you should be aware that people like that are a major reason we're in so much trouble.
For the fact is that right now the economy desperately needs a short-run fix. When you're bleeding profusely from an open wound, you want a doctor who binds that wound up, not a doctor who lectures you on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle as you get older. When millions of willing and able workers are unemployed, and economic potential is going to waste to the tune of almost $1 trillion a year, you want policy makers who work on a fast recovery, not people who lecture you on the need for long-run fiscal sustainability.
Unfortunately, giving lectures on long-run fiscal sustainability is a fashionable Washington pastime; it's what people who want to sound serious do to demonstrate their seriousness. So when the crisis struck and led to big budget deficits -- because that's what happens when the economy shrinks and revenue plunges -- many members of our policy elite were all too eager to seize on those deficits as an excuse to change the subject from jobs to their favorite hobbyhorse. And the economy continued to bleed.
What would a real response to our problems involve? First of all, it would involve more, not less, government spending for the time being -- with mass unemployment and incredibly low borrowing costs, we should be rebuilding our schools, our roads, our water systems and more. It would involve aggressive moves to reduce household debt via mortgage forgiveness and refinancing. And it would involve an all-out effort by the Federal Reserve to get the economy moving, with the deliberate goal of generating higher inflation to help alleviate debt problems.
The usual suspects will, of course, denounce such ideas as irresponsible. But you know what's really irresponsible? Hijacking the debate over a crisis to push for the same things you were advocating before the crisis, and letting the economy continue to bleed.

Full text: Sometimes, you have to unlearn your lessons.
Thirty years ago, it became clear that defeating inflation was crucial, even if the means needed to accomplish that would cause a deep recession. By the time the European Central Bank was created in the 1990s, it seemed so obvious that inflation must be fought that the bank was given only one mandate -- to fight inflation. The other mandate given to its United States counterpart, the Federal Reserve -- to promote employment -- was pointedly not included.
It is time for a new lesson to be learned. Sometimes we need inflation, and now is such a time.
Had the central bankers of the world understood that inflation in asset prices could be just as bad as, if not worse than, inflation in the prices of consumer goods, this would not be necessary. But they did not. So they did nothing to resist soaring home prices, just as they had seen no reason to worry about the Internet stock bubble.
When pressed, they would say they knew what to do if an asset bubble did burst -- ease monetary policy. That seemed to work after the Internet bubble burst, and the ensuing recession was a mild one that did little damage to anyone except foolish investors. But the strategy only worsened the housing bubble and has not done much to revive the debt-choked economy over the last two years.
In 2008, when the credit crisis brought the world economy to a screeching halt, governments and central banks stepped in to bail out large financial firms on the theory that a decently functioning financial system was a prerequisite to economic recovery.
That analysis was correct, but there were at least two problems with the fix:
First, at least some banks were not really made healthy again. That was especially true in Europe, where recapitalization of banks proceeded slowly. They were thus vulnerable to a new round of credit worries, this one based on sovereign debt issues.
Second, this country is full of people whose homes are worth less than they owe. That provides threats to the lenders and to the borrowers. Those borrowers need debt relief, but there are many issues that have prevented any real action.
Simply put, you can't operate an economy where huge numbers of people are desperately in debt and have no real way out. We need to either find a way to reduce what they owe or to raise the value of the homes securing the loans, or some of both.
In a column in The Financial Times this week, Ken Rogoff, the Harvard economist, suggested central bankers consider "the option of trying to achieve some modest deleveraging through moderate inflation of, say, 4 to 6 percent for several years."
Mr. Rogoff conceded that "any inflation above 2 percent may seem anathema to those who still remember the anti-inflation wars of the 1970s and 1980s."
He was right about that.
"I don't think it's a good idea," was one of the milder comments I got from the most celebrated veteran of those wars, Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman.
And anyway, he added, "Right now they probably could not get inflation if they wanted to." People are not spending the money they have, he said, adding that the situation reminded him of an era he studied in college -- the Great Depression.
In an interview, Mr. Rogoff recalled how a parade of economists suggested to Japan that it seek to raise inflation to an announced target after its bubble burst, how Japan did nothing of the kind, and how it never really recovered. The Fed, he said, could make clear that it wanted some inflation and would buy Treasuries until it got that result.
"It has to be open-ended," he said of such a program, not limited to a certain dollar amount of bond purchases, and it needs to be connected to a stated inflation target. The Fed chairman, he said, could say that "If and when inflation starts rising above the path I am aiming for, we will taper back bond purchases and raise interest rates to rein it back in."
As it is, millions of mortgage loans secured by homes are worth far less than the loan amount. That keeps people from moving in search of better opportunities, and it removes an incentive for maintenance spending to preserve the value of the home. Many of those loans will never be paid in full, but there seems to be no route to a quick resolution.
To make things worse, we are still fighting about who should take the losses on those loans, and thus over who is in a position to offer a modification that reduces the amount owed. The banks that packaged the loans in private-label mortgage securitizations are being sued by the buyers of the securities and by insurers who foolishly guaranteed the securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are pursuing similar claims for mortgages they guaranteed.
Moreover, state laws vary. In some states, mortgages are secured only by the value of the home, but in others the buyer is personally liable for paying even if the home's value plummets. In nonrecourse states, it would be easier to argue that banks should be willing to offer reductions in the amounts owed.
The Fed has pushed down interest rates to extremely low levels. That means people who have good credit, and homes worth more than they owe, can refinance and save money. But others cannot. One minor step that the president might be able to take without Congressional action would be to require Freddie and Fannie to offer to refinance mortgages they own or have guaranteed even if the collateral is no longer worth what is owed. That would at least pass on some savings to homeowners in distress.
Another idea tossed around has been to have the government force banks to offer principal reductions to underwater borrowers, perhaps in exchange for a portion of any eventual sales proceeds over the new mortgage amount.
Any such proposal runs into issues of fairness and huge difficulties deciding which borrowers would or would not be covered. Fears of moral hazard did not stop the government from assuring that lenders to overleveraged banks were paid back, but it may prevent any plan that would seem to help homeowners who took foolish risks. After all, is it fair to bail out someone who went in over his head while doing nothing for a neighbor who acted responsibly?
A partial way to deal with that would be to allow bankruptcy judges to reduce the amounts owed to market value. Since that would be available only to homeowners who filed for bankruptcy, it would not be available to those with other assets, and presumably the bank would be no worse off than if it foreclosed. But banks fought the idea and Congress refused to include it in the Dodd-Frank law. Mr. Volcker agrees that something needs to be done to reduce mortgage debt, although he points to a long list of obstacles, starting with moral hazard and including worries that banks do not have enough capital to admit how much they have lost. "But it is going to happen over a period of time," he said. "It would be a good thing if it could be facilitated."
The chaos that has engulfed financial markets, with new rumors of European bank failures, arose as it became apparent that recovery was unlikely until something was done to write down bad debts, whether American mortgages or Greek government loans, or to make them good again by raising asset values and thus increasing the ability to repay.
And yet the anti-inflation warriors continue to fight old battles. There were three dissents from regional Fed presidents when the Fed promised this week to hold down rates for at least two more years. The European Central Bank has been raising rates on the belief that it must vigorously fight any sign of inflation.
In the future, central banks will have to realize that debt-financed expansions in asset prices can be a threat. For now, it would be nice if they would at least recognize that major deflations in asset prices can be much more important than the relatively small gains in commodities that show up in the Consumer Price Index.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, rounded out the membership of a powerful new deficit-reduction panel on Thursday by appointing three of her top lieutenants who have led opposition to cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
The new appointees are Representatives Xavier Becerra of California, the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus; James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the assistant House Democratic leader; and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee.
In announcing her picks, Ms. Pelosi said the new panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, must find ways to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
Mr. Van Hollen articulated the Democrats' theme: "Putting America back to work is the best and most immediate way to reduce our deficit."
Within hours of the announcement, the Investment Company Institute, a trade association for mutual fund companies, sent out invitations to a fund-raiser for Mr. Becerra prominently citing his role on the panel.
"This will be Mr. Becerra's first event since being named" to the panel and "could give all attendees a glimpse into what will most assuredly be the primary topic of discussion between now and the end of the year," said invitations to the Aug. 31 event, sent by James R. Hart, a lobbyist for the institute. The suggested contribution is $1,500 a person.
The event was planned before Mr. Becerra's selection. Ianthe Zabel, a spokeswoman for the institute, said the group "takes full responsibility for the language in the outgoing e-mail and the decision to send it out Thursday afternoon."
The invitations illustrate the lobbying frenzy touched off by the new panel, which will have wide latitude to propose changes in tax policy and spending, including entitlement programs and the Pentagon budget. A bill written by the panel would not be open to amendment and would go onto a fast track intended to guarantee that both houses of Congress vote on it by Dec. 23.
With the 12 panel members now named, lawmakers and lobbyists were trying to calculate its chances for success.
The panel members are all team players. They represent their caucuses and the Congressional leaders who appointed them. Prospects for a deal thus depend on the leadership of both parties. It is difficult to envision an agreement without their support.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, is a loyal lieutenant of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and is unlikely to agree to any compromise that would displease him.
A co-chairwoman of the panel, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, is a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team and is likely to discourage other Democrats on the panel from straying from the party line.
Republicans have criticized the selection of Mrs. Murray because she is also the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is largely focused on helping vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election in 2012.
Among Democratic women, there was some grumbling that the criticism of Mrs. Murray was unfair and smacked of sexism. "There isn't one member who is sitting on that supercommittee that isn't trying to elect their own candidates to the House and Senate," said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California. "The Republicans had the opportunity to name women and minorities to this committee, and they didn't do that. They should ask themselves why their appointees don't reflect the makeup of this country."
Some panel members, like Mr. Becerra and the Republican co-chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, have over the years repeatedly highlighted differences between the parties on issues that will preoccupy the committee for the next 15 weeks.
If a majority of the panel reaches agreement, lawmakers said, it is likely to grow out of a consensus fostered by a handful of potential dealmakers like Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.
Two other panel members who lead the tax-writing committees of Congress could conceivably nudge the group toward a deal that raises revenue without increasing tax rates. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, and Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, have held many hearings on proposals to overhaul the tax code.
Mr. Camp said Thursday that he would not rule out tax changes that generate additional revenue as a result of economic growth.
"I don't want to rule anything in or out," Mr. Camp said in an interview with Reuters. "I am willing to discuss all issues that might help us reduce our short- and long-term debt and grow our economy. Everything is on the table, until we as a group rule it out."
"Economic growth and job creation in the private sector -- that's what we need to use as a benchmark about any policy, but particularly tax policy," Mr. Camp added.
President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress say additional revenue must be part of any deficit-reduction deal. Republicans have adamantly opposed tax increases.
The economic malaise in the United States and the debt crisis in Europe could jolt some panel members out of entrenched positions. Pressure for a deal may also come from investors and credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's, which cited "political risks" and the rising debt burden in the United States when it lowered its rating of long-term Treasury securities last week.
The new deficit-reduction law could also prompt panel members to seek a deal because if they fail to agree, the government would cut spending across the board in a wide range of popular programs.
Mr. Becerra is the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security. He sharply criticized a proposal, advanced by White House officials, to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits by using a different measure of inflation.
Mr. Van Hollen led opposition to the budget blueprint that Republicans pushed through the House in April. He said the Republican plan would savage Medicare by giving each beneficiary a fixed, inadequate amount of money to buy private insurance.
As the House Democratic whip in 2009-10, Mr. Clyburn helped pass Mr. Obama's health care overhaul, which was approved on a party-line vote without Republican support.
In a joint statement on Thursday, 23 Democratic senators said the new panel should "put jobs first" and "explicitly embrace job creation as a part of its mission."
"The single best deficit-reduction strategy is economic growth," the group said in a letter to Mr. McConnell.
The Democratic senators, led by Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said that putting people back to work would reduce federal spending by reducing the demand for unemployment benefits, food stamps, Medicaid and other assistance.

Full text: Financial lifeboats are starting to get crowded. Investors in droves have been seeking safety from sinking stocks. But some vessels of refuge have shown how quickly they can be rocked when too many investors pile in.
Swiss authorities had already signaled displeasure with excessive desire for local money last week when they cut interest rates to zero. Yet investors, prodded by ultralow rates in the United States, kept buying. More stringent measures would be needed to hold off the masses, and media reports about possibly linking the soaring franc to the wobbly euro sent the Swiss currency tumbling.
Gold enthusiasts also were abated. The CME Group, an operator of exchanges, raised margin requirements for gold futures. As a result, doomsayers, inflation hawks and speculators who had sought the ultimate escape watched the price of their precious yellow metal fall more than 3 percent at one point on Thursday.
American debt and government-guaranteed mortgage bonds have also had an influx from investors trying to navigate the current storm despite the country's loss of its AAA credit rating. Though they later sold off, 10-year Treasury notes yielded as little as 2.17 percent on Thursday morning, almost 60 percent lower than their 2011 peak.
Bonds backed by home loans also got a huge lift this week when the Federal Reserve indicated it would keep financing costs extremely low for two years. That locks in easy, and seemingly safe, profit for those borrowing short and investing long. With yields much lower than inflation -- 3.6 percent on an annualized basis -- it's no wonder investors don't feel much buyer's remorse.
There is of course a difference between speculative bubbles caused by greed and psychological ones born of fear. But so-called safety trades can blow up much the same way as risky ones. It's just that policy makers, rather than the invisible hand, are the more likely holders of the pin.
Changing currency pegs in Switzerland, allowing the renminbi to appreciate in China or ongoing bullheadedness in Washington could make today's emergency rafts look less seaworthy. Worse, if inflation turns out to be the real threat, investors may find themselves paddling feverishly to change course.
Short on Logic
The financial fashion is for all things 2008. Bank shares in Europe on Thursday jumped on expectations that some countries were preparing to revive short-selling bans they had introduced in the crisis. The desire to protect financial institutions from a potentially self-fulfilling loss of confidence is understandable. But changing the rules in turbulent times risks damaging markets in the longer term.
Though share prices can be volatile, investors should be prepared. Any leveraged investor with a portfolio consisting entirely of French financial stocks would have been justifiably wiped out by the recent sell-off. By contrast, careful and diversified shareholders will be deterred from being prudent in the future if regulators intervene at the first sign of trouble. An unpredictable regime could in theory prompt all equity investors to demand a higher risk premium for owning stocks, inflating the cost of capital for companies.
To be fair to regulators, equity investors are not their main concern. The goal is to prevent a loss of confidence that can be self-reinforcing when applied to banks. Sharp share-price drops can set off moves in the credit-default swaps of banks, which add to the equity sell-off. This in turn can prompt a strike by providers of short-term wholesale financing, potentially initiating a full-blown liquidity crisis.
But it's hard to think of examples where genuinely healthy institutions have been brought down purely by speculators hunting in packs. The short-sellers who aimed at financial institutions in 2008 were right: those firms genuinely needed large injections of capital.
Though most lenders have been recapitalized, they now face questions about sovereign debt exposures, and the ability of governments to bail them out if necessary. Besides, it's far from clear short-selling is to blame. The proportion of shares of Societe Generale out on loan, for example, is less than the European average.
Previous bans have arrested volatility only temporarily. And there is a natural curb to speculative shorting: a sudden turn in confidence can scar investors. Equity prices are a symptom, not a cause, of the financial contagion. Regulators should not punish the market for doing its job.

Where Will Growth Come From? Developing countries can help, but the big burden falls on the industrialized nations

Abstract: The International Monetary Fund was forecasting 2 percent growth in the euro zone before the financial crisis spread to Italy.

Full text: Never has the world economy depended so much on the success of developing nations. A misguided focus on budget cutting has plunged the European Union and the United States down paths that will prolong their economic stagnation and perhaps tip them into another recession. The International Monetary Fund was forecasting 2 percent growth in the euro zone before the financial crisis spread to Italy. The Japanese economy is shrinking. Some top economists put the odds of a double-dip recession in the United States at 1 in 2.
These dire prospects, along with the realization that economic policy is blocked by political gridlock in the United States and complacency in Europe, have sent spasms through financial markets, which could further sap growth. Fortunately, developing countries, which account for almost half the globe's economic output, are growing faster than the industrialized world: in June the I.M.F. forecast that they would grow some 6.5 percent this year and next. Their growth spares the world utter economic stagnation.
Yet developing countries are not robust enough to keep the global economy from sinking in a morass for long. Their economies remain vulnerable to financial turbulence and economic weakness in wealthy nations.
Even a flood of money moving to developing nations, as investors react to the lack of growth in the industrial world, would create new challenges. It would stoke inflation and asset bubbles in developing economies: annual inflation in Brazil is running at 6.85 percent. And it would push up the value of their currencies, hindering exports.
China, the biggest developing economy, is still more a caboose than a growth engine, dependent on rich countries to buy more than 40 percent of its exports. In 2009, China led efforts to help the global recovery, investing heavily in infrastructure and boosting consumer spending, but today it is taking the opposite tack and trying to combat inflation, which is running at 6.4 percent.
To keep its goods cheap, it has allowed its currency to rise only about 6 percent against the dollar since June 2010, even as the dollar has plunged against other currencies. Last month, the I.M.F. called on China to help global growth by letting the currency appreciate more rapidly, which would make Chinese goods more expensive around the world and give a break to competing manufacturers.
China has so far resisted that advice. It lashed out at economic mismanagement in Washington after the Standard & Poor's downgrade, which could potentially reduce the value of its $1.1 trillion stash of American Treasury bonds. Rather than berate Washington, it should abandon its currency manipulation. China's leaders have said they want to put more money in the hands of consumers through social programs and higher wages, and to rely less on exports. They can do this without stoking inflation by allowing the renminbi to rise significantly.
The burden of global growth cannot be placed on China alone. Germany has the third-largest trade surplus in the world, after China and Japan, sapping growth in its European neighbors. The United States and the European Union must focus more on spurring economic growth. They should have all along.

Full text: LONDON -- The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn A. King, gave a gloomy outlook for the British economy on Wednesday but said he would not make a vow like the one by the Federal Reserve in the United States to keep short-term interest rates near zero for some time.
Mr. King said higher inflation and a deterioration of the British economy had squeezed households' finances more than expected. The central bank cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 1.4 percent, from 1.8 percent. Britain's economy barely grew in the second quarter, and interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009.
"The mood in markets has taken a sharp turn for the worse," Mr. King said in a speech after the publication of the bank's inflation report.
"Headwinds are becoming stronger by the day," he said. "The weakness in underlying activity is likely to be somewhat more persistent than previously expected."
Mr. King attributed the deterioration of the economy to problems faced by some countries that share the euro in repaying their debt, and to the outlook for growth and fiscal policy in the United States.
Some economists said the central bank's new growth forecast was still too optimistic, arguing that an austerity program that freezes public sector pay and pensions and cuts some social benefits would slow down a recovery even more.
Teodor Todorov, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London, said the worsening economic situation may lead the central bank to consider resuming its bond purchasing program, so-called quantitative easing, to increase the supply of money in circulation.
He said the central bank would be pushed to act as the government's public spending cuts began in earnest, consumer demand remained weak and worries circulated concerning Britain's two largest trading partners, the United States and Continental Europe.
"It is likely that pressure will build on the Bank of England to resume its quantitative easing program in order to stimulate a recovery that is quickly losing its legs," Mr. Todorov said.
A deteriorating labor market and a slow economic recovery in the United States prompted the Fed on Tuesday to make a rare promise to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013. The step showed that the Fed, too, saw little prospect of rapid economic improvement.
Mr. King said Wednesday that he saw no reason for a similar step by the Bank of England because it was "dangerous to make a commitment" on interest rates. It was "not very sensible" because the economic and market circumstances could change very quickly, he said. Emphasizing just how unpredictable global markets and economies were at this moment, he said, "Who knows how the conditions would be next month, let alone in one or two years?"
But the governor hinted that the central bank was unlikely to increase interest rates anytime soon. Mr. King said there was little the Bank of England could do to bring down inflation, which reached 4.2 percent in June, because the increase was mainly because of higher oil and commodity prices. He reiterated an earlier forecast for 5 percent inflation in the short term, before falling "quite sharply next year."
The European Central Bank was criticized by some economists for raising interest rates too soon in an attempt to stem inflation. The July rate rise in part led the bank to later buy Spanish and Italian sovereign debt to prevent the European debt crisis from deepening.
Mr. King emphasized that the challenges facing the British economy were "global challenges."
"The outlook for growth in the world economy has deteriorated," he said, "and, largely as a consequence, near-term growth prospects at home are somewhat weaker."

Full text: It came as no surprise on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve said that the economy was in a more precarious state than it had previously believed. It was refreshing that the Fed stopped blaming "transitory" factors like supply-chain disruptions from Japan and acknowledged, in effect, that this year's rising joblessness and slowing growth are more than temporary setbacks.
The Fed announced that it expected to keep short-term interest rates at near zero for another two years "at least." That is a sensible move because it gives markets and businesses a dose of certainty. The stock market, which had plummeted a day earlier, surged to a strong finish. But it's doubtful that the Fed's move will be enough to increase employment and growth.
It is particularly disturbing that three members of the Fed's policy committee view inflation as a bigger threat than a weakening economy and opposed Tuesday's decision to keep rates low into 2013. Judging from earlier statements, they stand prepared to oppose further measures to boost the faltering economy.
That could make it less likely that the Fed will use other effective tools at its disposal to spur demand and hiring. The committee said it was prepared to do more "as appropriate." The danger is that as long as the stock market stays relatively stable, further loosening of monetary policy will never be deemed appropriate. Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at the Fed meeting in June that despite high unemployment, only a heightened risk of deflation would cause further easing by the Fed.
The focus on combating inflation at a time when the economy is clearly not overheating and when oil prices are retreating is akin to Washington's fixation on spending cuts when the economy is weak. Both are a fundamental misreading of what the economy needs.
This misjudgment has led Congress and the Obama administration to pursue budget cuts without additional near-term stimulus, thus increasing the risk of prolonged stagnation or, worse, renewed recession. And it has led the Fed to deliver a grim economic outlook without doing enough to get growth back on track.
For starters, the Fed could take modest steps, like shifting its portfolio toward bonds with longer maturities, which would help to keep long-term rates low and nudge investors into riskier investments. It could reduce the interest it pays on the banks' huge reserves or even tax the reserves to try to encourage more lending. It could also resume buying Treasuries or other securities to provide additional monetary stimulus. A more aggressive strategy would be letting inflation rise above the Fed's comfort level of 2 percent or so to, say, 4 percent. That could help the economy by easing the repayment of debt.
In the absence of stimulative fiscal policy, even assertive moves by the Fed are unlikely to turn the ailing economy around. But they could help, if only the Fed would deploy them.

Full text: HONG KONG -- China's exports and imports both rose faster than expected in July, producing a trade surplus of $31.5 billion, the largest in more than two years, China's General Administration of Customs announced in Beijing on Wednesday morning.
Exports jumped 20.4 percent from a year earlier, to $175.1 billion, as economic weakening in the United States and Europe seemed to have little immediate effect on demand for the wide range of manufactured consumer goods that are the mainstay of Chinese exports.
Imports climbed 22.9 percent from a year earlier, to $143.6 billion.
Exports and imports each grew more in July than June, belying recent corporate surveys in China that have suggested a weakening in export orders over the last three months.
Chinese officials are closely watching trade data for slowing as they try to cool the domestic economy in order to limit inflation, which reached 6.5 percent in July.

Full text: The following is the full text of the statement released Tuesday by the Federal Reserve:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that economic growth so far this year has been considerably slower than the committee had expected. Indicators suggest a deterioration in overall labor market conditions in recent months, and the unemployment rate has moved up. Household spending has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand.
Temporary factors, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan, appear to account for only some of the recent weakness in economic activity. Inflation picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply chain disruptions. More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their earlier peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters than it did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased.
The committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at zero to 1/4 percent. The committee currently anticipates that economic conditions -- including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run -- are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
The committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. The committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
The committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ these tools as appropriate.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen.
Voting against the action were: Richard W. Fisher, Narayana Kocherlakota and Charles I. Plosser, who would have preferred to continue to describe economic conditions as likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.

Stocks Surge as a Fed Statement Sinks In: Central Bank Props Up Spain and Italy, for Now

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank has succeeded at least temporarily in pushing down the effective interest rates on Spanish and Italian government debt. But analysts say the bank must still convince investors that it has the stamina to withstand what could be a long struggle against market turmoil.
Spanish and Italian bond prices rose and their yields fell on Tuesday after the central bank stepped in for a second day to buy their sovereign debt, part of expanded efforts to prevent the European debt crisis from deepening in two of the largest economies in the euro currency zone.
The central bank's move, much more ambitious than its previous forays into the bond market, has set off a debate about how far the bank legally can go under its charter. According to bank insiders and analysts, the answer seems to be: as far as it wants.
But the bigger questions may be how much intervention the central bank's balance sheet can sustain -- and how much help it will get from European governments. The pan-European bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, is politically loaded and months away from having new money brought to a vote by member nations in the euro area.
In late trading Tuesday, the yield on Spain's benchmark 10-year government bonds was down an additional 0.1 percentage point, at 5.019 percent. It had reached a record high of 6.458 percent on Aug. 2. The yield on 10-year Italian bonds, meanwhile, fell Tuesday to a one-month low of 5.143 percent.
To keep Spanish and Italian bond yields at sustainable levels over the long term will be a huge challenge for the European Central Bank, as investors test the bank's resolve.
"Once they have started buying it will be difficult to stop buying," said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
As it has when buying Greek bonds in the past, analysts say, the central bank will probably portray its interventions as a means to maintain control over interest rates and hold down inflation -- not as a rescue of any particular country, which is forbidden by treaty.
And analysts expect the bank to make a show of taking as much money out of circulation as it spends buying bonds, to avoid the appearance the central bank is printing money or flooding the economy with cash through so-called quantitative easing of the sort the United States Federal Reserve has resorted to in recent years.
On Tuesday in Washington, the Federal Reserve stopped well short of such a move, instead indicating it would keep rates low through mid-2013. But it said it might again resort to quantitative easing, if economic conditions did not improve.
The European Central Bank, too, is loath to acknowledge any limitations on its monetary policy arsenal. And, in the worst case, it might even engage in quantitative easing if it saw signs of deflation.
"We do what we judge necessary to be sure that we deliver price stability," Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, said last week, repeating a phrase he has used often.
Confronted by a fundamental threat to the euro or to Europe's banking system, the central bank might have no choice but to take further action.
"They will do whatever it takes because they will be forced to," Mr. Cailloux said. "There are no technical impediments to buying unlimited amounts" of bonds, he added.
But that might require effectively printing money. Previously the central bank has intervened only in the much smaller markets for Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds, spending 74 billion euros ($105 billion).
Some analysts say the bank may need to spend more than 10 times that to maintain control over yields on Spanish and Italian debt. If so, it might have trouble fully offsetting the purchases by paying banks interest to park money at the central bank, as it has done so far.
The bank's purchases of Spanish and Italian bonds on Monday and Tuesday, reported by traders but not officially confirmed by the central bank, came amid broader market turmoil after Standard & Poor's downgrading of American debt late Friday.
The central bank felt forced to respond because last week the cost of borrowing for both Spain and Italy soared to record highs, with yields on their 10-year bonds topping 6 percent -- a level that could raise the countries' interest payments to ruinous levels and threaten to undermine the entire euro union.
And despite the bank's efforts, there were growing signs on Tuesday of heightened tensions in the banking system. Money market indicators showed that European banks' reluctance to lend to one another was approaching levels not seen since the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The central bank has acknowledged these tensions. Last week it expanded the low-cost loans it offers to banks to ensure they have enough cash to conduct operations. Mr. Trichet said last week that he wanted European governments to take over the bond buying, as they had agreed to do through the stability fund. But the fund may not have enough money to intervene successfully in the huge Italian and Spanish bond markets, and it is not clear that all 17 euro area members will provide the necessary authority.
Mr. Trichet also insisted that European governments do more to reduce debt and remove regulations and bureaucracy that impede growth, particularly in countries like Italy and Greece. "The governments have to do their job," Mr. Trichet said at a news conference last week. "This is absolutely fundamental."
Uri Dadush, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, argues, as do several other economists, that the financial crisis is becoming too big for any one central bank or government to manage and that they must coordinate their efforts. There are signs that leaders are poised to act if necessary.
On Sunday, officials from the Group of 7 nations -- including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- held a conference call and issued a statement afterward saying they were ready to "take all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth."
Mr. Trichet has not signaled any impending coordinated effort but often emphasizes his ties to Mr. Bernanke. "We always have a very close relationship with our sister institutions everywhere in the world," Mr. Trichet said last week.
Anemic economic growth data from Spain and Italy has amplified worries that politically weak governments in Madrid and Rome will not manage to clean up their public finances as quickly as previously promised. Spain grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, less than expected.
But Elena Salgado, the Spanish finance minister, insisted Tuesday that Spain was on track to meet its fiscal targets this year. "Spain's fundamentals show we are very far from requiring a bailout," Ms. Salgado told Onda Cero, a Spanish radio station.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve made a rare promise on Tuesday to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, in a sign that it has all but written off the chances of an expansion strong enough to drive up wages and prices.
It is now conventional wisdom among forecasters that the economy will plod along through the end of President Obama's first term in office. Millions of Americans will not find work. Wages will not rise substantially.
By its action, the Fed is declaring that it, too, sees little prospect of rapid growth and little risk of inflation. Its hope is that the showman's gesture will spur investment and risk-taking by convincing markets that the cost of borrowing will not rise for at least two years.
The Fed's statement, with its mix of grim tidings and welcome aid, contributed to wild market oscillations as investors struggled to make sense of the economy and the path ahead. The day ended in a huge upward surge on the New York Stock Exchange -- the second busiest day this year after the record volume on Monday, during a deep sell-off -- that could not be tallied completely until well after the markets had closed.
The Dow swung as much as 600 points in the wake of the Fed statement, at first sinking over 200 points. But after traders absorbed the decision, they quickly reversed course, and the Dow closed the day up 429 points, or 4 percent, to 11,239.77, as some investors expressed hope that the pledge to keep interest rates low could relieve some of the gloom over the economic outlook.
"The economy is in tough shape and the Fed had a difficult job of showing that they understood that without appearing to be alarmist," said Steven Lear, who helps to manage a $150 billion fixed-income portfolio for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. "We think that they've played that hand about as well as they could."
The policy announced Tuesday is an incremental step that economists described as unlikely to drive significant growth. The Fed already has held rates near zero since December 2008, and the economy is awash in cheap money. The great impediment, beyond the Fed's easy reach, is the lack of demand from indebted consumers, nervous businesses and a shrinking public sector.
The Fed demurred, however, from taking stronger steps to aid the struggling economy, a decision that reflected deepening divisions on its policy-making committee, which generally tries to move only by unanimous consent. The vote to promise two more years of low rates passed by a margin of 7 to 3, the first time in almost 20 years that at least three members recorded votes in dissent.
The internal controversy parallels the broader debate in Washington between those pleading for the government to redouble its support for the faltering economy, and those who doubt the utility of additional aid and fear the consequences of the vast efforts already made. The three Fed members in dissent all have expressed concern that the central bank is not paying enough attention to inflation.
The Fed said in a statement that it would continue to consider additional measures to support the economy, but the split vote suggested that the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, may struggle to win sufficient support.
The statement, which includes an assessment of the economy, was a patchwork quilt of discouraging language. The labor market is deteriorating, construction is weak, housing depressed, recovery slow.
"Economic growth so far this year has been considerably slower than the committee had expected," it said. "The committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters."
Twenty-five million Americans cannot find full-time work, a number the Fed said would decline "only gradually."
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment, and increasingly vocal critics have questioned why the central bank is standing still even as the economy shows clear signs of faltering. The modest step announced Tuesday did not satisfy many of those critics.
"The Fed took the least action possible given the circumstances," Sherry Cooper, chief economist at the BMO Financial Group, said in a note to clients. "Bottom Line: Holy Cow!"
In part, the Fed's answer is that it is already engaged in an immense program of economic aid.
The central bank has held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero for more than two years, flooding the financial system with the nearest thing to free money. It already had promised, most recently in June, that it would keep rates near zero "for an extended period" -- at least several months, Mr. Bernanke said earlier this year.
The Fed also has amassed a portfolio of more than $2.5 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The purchases have pushed investors into the stock market and other riskier investments, and reduced the value of the dollar, helping American exporters.
The decision announced Tuesday is intended to put additional pressure on long-term interest rates, although not with the same direct force as buying $600 billion in securities, a program it completed in June. The rates on long-term securities reflect a combination of expectations about short-term rates and a risk premium for holding a long-term note. Buying bonds reduces that risk premium; by promising to keep rates low, the Fed aims to reduce expectations about future short-term rates.
The Fed's statement stopped short of an absolute commitment to provide two years of near-zero rates, preserving some room for movement if economic conditions change drastically. But Vincent R. Reinhart, who headed the Fed's monetary affairs division until 2007, said the meaning was clear.
"It's as close to an unconditional commitment as you can get out of a central banker," said Mr. Reinhart, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "It means that you've handcuffed yourself. You can't change it. You've given up unless there's an overwhelming case to offset inflation risk."
A second reason for the Fed's restraint, it is increasingly clear, is the opposition of a group of Fed officials who are concerned that the central bank is overly discounting the risk of inflation.
The three members who dissented from the majority Tuesday were Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
By law the Fed is responsible for keeping prices steady and unemployment as low as possible. But Mr. Bernanke, like his predecessors, places greater emphasis on prices, in part because the Fed has concluded that slow, steady inflation -- about 2 percent a year -- is the best atmosphere for enduring job growth.
The Fed projected in June that inflation could reach 2.5 percent this year, a crucial reason for its announcement then that it would pause before considering new measures.
There are now signs that inflation is abating, as a temporary spike in commodity prices earlier this year works through the economy, and as growth weakens. Mr. Bernanke and his allies on the committee have predicted as much all year, and the announcement on Tuesday reflects confidence in that judgment.
But conservative members of the policy-making board see evidence in past recoveries that inflation can accelerate quickly, with little warning. Their dissents echo the last time the committee was as deeply divided, in November 1992, when three members pressed to begin raising the short-term interest rate, which then stood at 3 percent.
The Fed's statement, indicating that it will continue to consider additional options despite those internal divisions, sets the stage for Mr. Bernanke's speech later this month at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Last year, he used the opportunity to indicate that the Fed would undertake a new round of asset purchases. "The markets," Mr. Lear said, "will be actively interested to hear what he says."

Abstract: Since the end of last year, for example, Deutsche Bank has slashed its net exposure to Italy -- once seen as a more or less risk-free borrower -- to 996 million euros, down from 8 billion euros. [...] the European Central Bank's decision over the weekend to buy Italian and Spanish bonds pushed bond yields down sharply, their market rates were above 6 percent, generally considered the upper limit for managing a sustainable debt burden.

Full text: ONCE again Europe's leadership has been forced to put up billions in cash to halt the spread of contagion to the Continent's weaker economies, this time in the form of a potentially vast purchase of Italian and Spanish government bonds by the European Central Bank. And once again the condition for rescue is more austerity.
But this time there is a difference. Unlike Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- the patients previously forced into the austerity cure -- Italy and Spain have already made their own substantial strides toward cutting their deficits.
Some economists warn that forcing further cuts could push their teetering economies over the edge. And unlike Greece or Portugal, they are so big that any default might shatter the euro union for good.
"Italy has done everything asked of it -- it has cut left, right and center," said Yanis Varoufakis, an economist in Athens who has written widely on the euro zone's travails. "But if you keep cutting like this you start to cut into muscle, which affects your growth and your tax revenues."
Spain and Italy already have some of the lowest growth rates in the euro zone, with both expected to be below 1 percent this year. And official projections show little improvement coming next year.
Italy has been on target to bring its deficit down to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product this year. And, under further pressure from Germany and the European Central Bank last week, the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said the cutting would be sped up with the aim of Italy's balancing its budget by 2013.
Italy also currently leads the Western industrial world with a budget that is actually in surplus, to the tune of 2 percent of G.D.P., when taking account of its financial position apart from interest on existing debt. This so-called primary budget status is generally considered the most useful way of measuring a government's financial health.
Spain is set to pare its deficit to 6 percent of economic output, down from 9 percent. Yet Spain, too, is under pressure from its European partners to cut even more.
Neither Italy nor Spain has been rewarded for the economic pain their austerity has already imposed, as jittery foreign and local bond investors have rushed for the exits.
Since the end of last year, for example, Deutsche Bank has slashed its net exposure to Italy -- once seen as a more or less risk-free borrower -- to 996 million euros, down from 8 billion euros.
Until the European Central Bank's decision over the weekend to buy Italian and Spanish bonds pushed bond yields down sharply, their market rates were above 6 percent, generally considered the upper limit for managing a sustainable debt burden. Monday, on news of the central bank's buying plan, the yield on Italy's 10-year bond slipped to 5.27 percent and Spain's to 5.12 percent in late-afternoon trading in New York.
Bond investors have had their reasons to be wary of Italy and Spain, of course.
Italy's overall debt level of 126 percent of G.D.P. is one of the highest in the world. And its failure to emerge from a decade-long slump suggests it will be harder than ever for Rome to service that debt.
Spain, meanwhile, is struggling to recover from a devastating real estate bust. And worries persist over the vulnerability of Spanish banks.
But, as Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC, notes, Italy is one of the few nations whose debt level has remained essentially unchanged since the introduction of the euro in 1999. The other nation with a similar pattern is Spain, with a debt level that actually decreased -- down to 66 percent of G.D.P., from 69 percent.
"On the basis of fiscal fundamentals," Mr. King said, "Italy is one of the best in class."
By comparison, Greece's debt exploded to 147 percent of G.D.P. from 101 percent over the same period. The overall debt of France and Germany has also risen significantly. And outside the euro zone, Britain and the United States have also experienced even sharper increases in government debt since 1999.
Britain is now undergoing a program of self-imposed austerity. But while British growth figures continue to be revised downward -- to a bit above 1 percent for this year -- investors have not abandoned the country's bonds which, at 2.6 percent, trade close to those of Germany.
That is largely because Britain controls its own currency and because investors, so far, still think the government is committed to following though on its budget cuts.
In the case of Italy and Spain, it is not clear that the austerity medicine prescribed by the European Central Bank and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, will actually make things better.
Those with a sense of history say Mr. Trichet's outlook is colored by his experience trying to defend an earlier regime of fixed exchange rates -- back in the 1990s when European rates were tied to the Deutsche mark, the precursor to today's monetary union.
Mr. Trichet, then a top French treasury official, forcefully advocated a tough austerity regime in which France pushed to keep its inflation rate below that of Germany, to keep French labor costs on par with Germany's.
Other countries, including Britain and Italy, opted for an easier route by leaving the exchange rate mechanism and devaluing their currencies.
Asked back then what might keep the currency peg experiment from collapsing, Mr. Trichet gave an answer in many ways similar to Europe's current position on how the euro system will survive its current trial. The anchor of the system, Mr. Trichet said at the time, was the system itself.
The currency peg collapsed anyway.
Europe is now far more committed -- politically, financially and economically -- to maintaining the integrity of the euro than it was in preserving the 1990s Deutsche mark exchange rate mechanism.
The open question is, will enforced austerity be any more a successful remedy now than it was back then?

Re "S.&P. Downgrades Debt Rating of U.S. for the First Time" (front page, Aug. 6):
How could any credit rating agency watch the ideological fanaticism and debt-limit hostage taking of the Tea Party Republicans in the House of Representatives and not downgrade its confidence in the ability of the United States government to address our nation's economic needs effectively?
My confidence in Standard & Poor's has returned, while my confidence in President Obama's ability to mobilize our nation against the Tea Party radicals has been shaken.
ALLEN HERSHKOWITZ
Waccabuc, N.Y., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Is this not the same rating agency that gave AAA ratings to the junk mortgage-backed securities that Wall Street peddled to investors, leading to the collapse of the housing market? The hubris of S.&P. is galling, but perhaps more appalling is the failure to hold it responsible for its actions.
S.&P. and Moody's are charged with the enormous obligation to be the unbiased arbiters of risk, and on this central duty they have failed miserably. Why anyone should value their opinions is beyond me.
PETER J. BUGGELN
Boca Raton, Fla., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
Thanks, Republicans, for impairing the creditworthiness of United States securities. S.&P. lost confidence in the "effectiveness, stability and predictability" of American political institutions because the Teapartistas showed that they were willing to cause our government to default on payment of Treasury bonds if they did not achieve their political goals -- weakening the social safety net and protecting the rich from paying even one dollar more in taxes.
Thanks to the party of fiscal irresponsibility, United States bonds have now become riskier securities.
MITCHELL ZIMMERMAN
Palo Alto, Calif., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
The S.&P. debt rating cut is certainly not good news for the United States, as it reflects a dim view of our economy by a respected analyst. However, in general, ratings for bonds and other securities mainly reflect default probabilities, and some research, including my own, shows that S.&P. may systematically err in its assessments. Moreover, the United States, technically, never has to default on its debt.
There is a fundamental difference in that respect between, say, Greece and the United States. Our external debt, as well as all our domestic obligations, are denominated in dollars. And our government can print dollars.
Greece, on the other hand, owes euros both domestically and internationally but cannot print euros. Therefore, Greece may actually not have enough euros to pay off its obligations whereas the United States can always print more dollars.
Of course, I am not advocating wiping out our national debt with runaway inflation (which is the usual consequence of heavy printing of money). This is also not to say that we do not have a recession, a serious debt burden, high unemployment and low growth.
But it is important that we are very clear about what a downgrade means.

To the Editor:
In "After Tumultuous Week, Markets Prepare for Another: A 2nd Recession May Bite Deeper Than the First" (Business Day, Aug. 8), you assert that a second recession could be worse because there is little room left to use fiscal policy. This argument seems to take for granted that there is some threshold value at which the size of the debt rules out fiscal policy. In fact, the United States can borrow right now at near-zero rates (adjusting for inflation), which suggests that we do have the balance sheet capacity to use fiscal stimulus.
It would be a real tragedy if we failed to prevent another economic catastrophe because of widespread misunderstanding about the nature of the public debt.

Abstract: [...] the deal sidesteps the fundamental challenge the country now faces: who will pay to fix what was broken during the past decade by irresponsible tax cuts, ruinously expensive wars, failures of regulation and the resulting housing and financial booms and busts?

Full text: THE Treasury can cry foul all it wants, but the decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade America's credit rating by one notch last Friday, and the subsequent plunge in the stock market, are serious symptoms of a loss of confidence -- an assessment that is fundamentally political, not economic.
There is little question about the technical ability of America to make good on its debts -- but there are grave questions about the political system's ability to resolve our nation's financial problems.
The debt-ceiling deal between President Obama and Congressional Republicans merely staved off a crisis of confidence for the moment. It does not address our immediate need to avoid falling back into recession, or our longer-term need to raise enough revenue to pay for the social spending Americans want.
Moreover, the deal sidesteps the fundamental challenge the country now faces: who will pay to fix what was broken during the past decade by irresponsible tax cuts, ruinously expensive wars, failures of regulation and the resulting housing and financial booms and busts?
In the short term, the plan cuts a bit of discretionary nondefense spending, a category that in fact has not grown particularly rapidly. This is a mistake. With unemployment at 9.1 percent, and long-term joblessness at record levels, we need more spending, not less. But the agreement all but rules out new spending to boost the economy, at a dangerous time. The chances of a double-dip recession are growing -- and a further slowdown will increase, not reduce, the budget deficit.
The longer-term spending and revenue commitments are no better. Certainly spending, in particular on Medicare and Medicaid, needs to be restrained. But the deficits cannot be reined in without tax increases, and the "framework" does little or nothing in this regard. The S. & P. decision to downgrade reflects, in large part, the expectation that Republicans will not allow the Bush tax cuts to expire.
The recent skirmishes all dance around the central issue: the United States is in the midst of the world's largest debt crisis. The Treasury now owes the public almost $10 trillion, including $4.5 trillion to foreigners -- and that doesn't include what households and companies owe. For decades to come, Americans will face the core problem of every heavily indebted nation: who will bear the burden of adjustment?
Countries borrow for many purposes: canals and railroads in the 19th century, factories and highways in the 20th, and in the last decade, a housing and financial boom in Europe and America. When the projects don't pan out and the debtor country falls into crisis, what happens to the accumulated debts? Who pays? Creditors or debtors? Workers or investors? Rich or poor? The European Union is tearing itself apart over this question, which divides creditor nations from debtor nations and which divides groups within nations. The American variant of this conflict is just beginning.
Perhaps, some Americans believe, we can shunt the adjustment costs onto foreigners. Indeed, our creditors worry that the United States will reduce its debt burden the old-fashioned way, by inflating it away. A few years of moderate inflation, and a weaker dollar, would significantly lessen the real cost of servicing the country's debts -- at our creditors' expense.
But adjusting to the reality of America's accumulated debts will inevitably require sacrifices at home. The battle over who will be sacrificing has already begun, albeit under veils of rhetoric. The Republicans seem unconcerned about stimulating recovery, and primarily concerned that none of the long-term costs of balancing our budget be paid by upper-income taxpayers. No surprise: unemployment among the one-third of Americans with the highest incomes is barely 4 percent, while for the lowest third it is more than four times that level.
The Democrats, for their part, seem content to insist that the adjustment burden not fall on beneficiaries of government spending, whether public employees or recipients of social spending. This reflects their base in the labor movement, the public sector and the poor.
We lost the first decade of the 21st century by squandering our wealth and borrowing as if there was no tomorrow. We risk losing this decade to an incomplete recovery and economic stagnation.
An economically responsible, politically feasible distribution of the costs of working our way out of the crisis will require higher taxes, a more efficient tax code, and restrained growth of social spending, particularly Medicare. To ignore these realities, and the contentious choices they entail, is merely to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning -- and probably to make it worse.

Full text: HONG KONG -- It is not just many Americans who are upset about the Standard & Poor's downgrade of United States debt. A lot of people in China are angry, too. But they are aiming their venom at the Chinese government.
Chinese Internet sites lit up over the weekend with criticism of Beijing's management of the country's foreign reserves -- a usually esoteric subject that had attracted little public attention.
But the S.& P. action hit a nerve. The ambitions of the Chinese people, eager to take their part as consumers in their nation's economic success story, have in many ways been stifled by their government's fiscal and monetary policies.
China's stock market plunged Monday, as investors worried that recent events in the United States and Europe would weaken demand for Chinese exports. The Shanghai A-share stock market closed down 3.78 percent and was the third-worst performer in Asia on Monday, trailing only markets in Taiwan and South Korea.
"The United States' sovereign credit rating suffered a downgrade, why did we become the biggest victim?" one microblogger wrote on Sina Weibo, one of the more popular sites, which had hundreds of such postings. "China is always bowing to the United States, when will China really rise up and cast aside its constant fear of the United States' reactions!"
Many of the Internet postings were similarly nationalistic, questioning whether the government had acted in China's best interests by investing about half of the country's $3.2 trillion worth of foreign reserves in United States Treasury securities. No other country's government comes even close to such an outflow.
"On the question of U.S. debt, China's strategic decision makers are pigs, they would rather let the people's money be used by others than let the money be used by their own people," said one posting over the weekend. The comment soon disappeared, presumably removed by censors.
But much of the outcry seemed to be more about venting wounded pride than proposing monetary alternatives.
That may be because, whether the microblogging patriots realize it or not, few other options exist as long as China sees the need to buy tens of billions of dollars each month to keep its currency weak and protect the nation's export machine. Too few substitutes for United States Treasuries are available to absorb China's huge foreign reserves.
Still, the Chinese political establishment does not want to be perceived by the public as too accommodating of American financial policies. That may be why the state-run news media have been harshly critical of the United States' debt management woes. The attacks that started on Saturday with the state-run news agency, Xinhua, blasting America's "addiction to debts," continued Sunday and Monday with critical commentaries in state-owned newspapers.
Just as notably, though, the central bank and other government agencies remained officially silent about the downgrade.
In fact, in a move that could hardly be deemed anti-American the central bank, the People's Bank of China, let its currency, the renminbi, climb 0.23 percent against the dollar Monday morning in the daily fixing of its value. The United States has long pressed Beijing to let the renminbi rise in value.
The new level, 6.4305 renminbi to the dollar, represents the largest single-day jump in the daily fixing since November.
Still, the renminbi has risen only 2.5 percent against the dollar this year. Economists in Beijing and the West are skeptical that Chinese leaders are ready to accept a sharp rise in the renminbi's value. Producing enough renminbi to buy so many dollars has put the central bank on a collision course with consumers and businesses intent on developing the domestic economy.
One policy has been the rapid expansion of China's money supply. The broad money measure known as M2 has soared in China by 64.3 percent since the start of 2009 -- far outpacing the 10.4 percent of M2 in the United States in that period.
The expanding money supply has produced rapid inflation in housing prices, and is starting to affect consumer goods and services. Prices in July were up 6.5 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics announced on Tuesday morning in Beijing.
The other People's Bank policy crimping the domestic economy is the requirement that state-controlled commercial banks lend ever more of their deposits to the central bank instead of to businesses. Chinese commercial banks must now deposit more than a fifth of their assets at the central bank, earning virtually no interest.
That has given the central bank a source of inexpensive financing for its hoard of foreign reserves, but it has left many small and medium-size private businesses unable to obtain loans. Commercial banks are allocating their limited supply of credit disproportionately to state-owned enterprises.
One blogger over the weekend summed up the public frustration: "Chinese people are working so hard, day in and day out, the economic environment is so good, but people's livelihoods are not so great -- turns out it is because the government is tightening people's waist belts to lend money to the United States."

Abstract: From 1975 through 1982, as the state's 51st governor, Mr. Carey led a small group of public servants who vanquished the fiscal crisis that threatened New York City and State -- the direst emergency a governor had faced since the Depression -- by taking on powers over the city's finances that no governor had wielded before and none has wielded since. The brooding, private man, father of more than a dozen children, who mourned the deaths of his wife and, earlier, two sons killed in a car crash, gave way to a man who engaged in an exuberant, very public romance that led to a second marriage.

Full text: Hugh L. Carey, the governor who helped rescue New York from the brink of financial collapse in the 1970s and tamed a culture of ever-growing spending, died Sunday at his summer home on Shelter Island, N.Y. He was 92.
His death was announced by the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. "Governor Carey led our state during a time of great financial turmoil and pulled us back from the brink of bankruptcy and economic ruin," Mr. Cuomo said in the statement.
From 1975 through 1982, as the state's 51st governor, Mr. Carey led a small group of public servants who vanquished the fiscal crisis that threatened New York City and State -- the direst emergency a governor had faced since the Depression -- by taking on powers over the city's finances that no governor had wielded before and none has wielded since.
A liberal Democrat, Mr. Carey reversed the upward spiral of borrowing, spending and entitlement under one of his predecessors, Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican who had presided in an era of limitless government promise. But even after eight years as governor, Mr. Carey remained an enigma. The witty storyteller who could charm an audience alternated with the irascible loner who alienated many of his allies. The brooding, private man, father of more than a dozen children, who mourned the deaths of his wife and, earlier, two sons killed in a car crash, gave way to a man who engaged in an exuberant, very public romance that led to a second marriage.
Hugh Carey rose to power as a Democrat outside his party's machine. He began the 1974 campaign for governor as a recently widowed congressman from Brooklyn, a long shot who was not taken seriously, yet he cruised to one of the most resounding victories in the state's history.
But he spent his final years as governor frustrated. Absent an emergency, he often seemed bored with the job.
The political strategist David Garth, who was one of Mr. Carey's closest associates, once said of him: "Hugh Carey on the petty issues can be very petty. On the big stuff, he is terrific."
Mr. Carey's stature grew in his decades out of office, and he was hailed as a hero by Republicans and Democrats. As he acknowledged, his handling of government finances overshadowed all else he did. In an interview in 1982 in his last days in office, he said, "The objectives I set forth I've achieved in terms of a state that's respected fiscally, a city that's now well on its way back to concrete foundations."
In four terms as governor, Mr. Rockefeller had built a legacy of state universities and highways but also of much higher taxes and enormous debt. The pattern was repeated at the local level; under Mayor John V. Lindsay, a Republican turned Democrat, New York City had to borrow money for day-to-day operations. The 1974-75 recession opened yawning deficits and exposed years of unsound practices.
Cascade of Emergencies
On Jan. 1, 1975, Mr. Carey declared in his inaugural address, "This government will begin today the painful, difficult, imperative process of learning to live within its means."
He immediately faced a cascade of emergencies, as various state authorities, New York City, Yonkers, several school districts and ultimately the state itself flirted with collapse.
New York City lay at the core of the crisis. Mr. Lindsay's successor as mayor, Abraham D. Beame, was taking drastic action, cutting tens of thousands of jobs, but a solution lay beyond the city's grasp. In May 1975, Wall Street firms refused to sell the city's bonds, threatening its ability to pay its bills.
Mr. Carey responded with a series of audacious moves to keep the city afloat. He created the Municipal Assistance Corporation to borrow money for the city. He created and headed the Emergency Financial Control Board, with the power to reject city budgets and labor contracts, giving him vast new authority at Mr. Beame's expense.
By seizing control of the city's finances, and then telling the mayor that he had to fire his closest aide to placate the bankers, Mr. Carey permanently soured his relationship with Mr. Beame, who had helped him get elected. But such tough measures were necessary to keep the enterprise afloat. Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker whom the governor appointed to head the Municipal Assistance Corporation, later said of Mr. Carey, "He was the only one who had any credibility left."
The governor engineered more than $1 billion in state loans to the city and $200 million in new city taxes. He persuaded banks to refinance city debts and accept a moratorium on some debt payments, and he got municipal unions to invest their pension funds in Municipal Assistance Corporation bonds.
Despite those measures, New York City at one point came within hours having to file for bankruptcy.
On Oct. 29, 1975, President Gerald R. Ford vowed that he would veto "any bill that has as its purpose a federal bailout of New York City." The next day, the front page of The Daily News famously proclaimed: "Ford to City: Drop Dead."
A fierce backlash ensued, and a chastened Mr. Ford was persuaded that the governor had the situation under control. The president agreed in early 1976 to $2.3 billion in federal loan guarantees to the city. The greatest peril had passed.
In all, Mr. Carey wrought profound changes, curtailing the entitlements that had been a defining element of New York government. The state wrested primary control of the City University of New York from the city, ending tuition-free education. It took over the city's courts. Subway and bus fares were raised and raised again, and welfare payments were frozen despite high inflation.
In his first five years, Mr. Carey reduced state spending 13 percent when adjusted for inflation, and despite increases forced on him by the Legislature in later years, the budget was smaller in real terms when he left office than when he arrived. He cut state taxes, and city taxes declined over all as well. And most striking, the city and state eliminated more than 100,000 jobs.
Outside the fiscal realm, Mr. Carey promised an era of openness and clean government. He mandated financial disclosure for top state officials, barred party leaders from holding major state posts and signed campaign finance laws that set limits and required disclosure. He secured voter approval of a constitutional amendment providing for appointment, rather than election, of judges to the Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, a change that was viewed as insulating the court from politics.
He ordered an investigation of nursing homes that resulted in the convictions of several nursing-home operators and workers on fraud charges, and the recovery of millions of dollars in government payments. And he helped bring the Democratic National Convention to Madison Square Garden for the first time in a half-century in 1976 and again in 1980.
Like so many New York governors, Mr. Carey harbored presidential ambitions, but trouble at home doomed any hope he might have had. His austerity measures made him unpopular with many voters, and his support for Westway, a proposed highway along the West Side of Manhattan, made more enemies than friends.
Unprecedented Affront
In 1978, when Mr. Carey ran for a second term, he was challenged in the primary by his own lieutenant governor, Mary Anne Krupsak, an unheard-of affront to a sitting governor. He began the general election campaign lagging in polls behind the Republican candidate, Perry B. Duryea, a former Assembly speaker. But capitalizing on Mr. Duryea's refusal to disclose his personal finances, he managed a narrow victory.
Mr. Carey could be remarkably free of egotism, sharing credit liberally with others and readily deferring to his aides. He brought into government an impressive cadre of people who cast long shadows years after he had left office, including Mario M. Cuomo, his second lieutenant governor, who succeeded him as governor (and whose son is the current governor); Richard Ravitch, a lieutenant governor under Gov. David A. Paterson; and Mr. Rohatyn.
But Mr. Carey eventually feuded with nearly everyone around him, beginning with Ms. Krupsak, who felt ignored. In 1977, he helped orchestrate the downfall of his old ally, Mr. Beame, after one term as mayor. He encouraged Mario Cuomo's challenge of Mr. Beame's renomination, but Congressman Edward I. Koch defeated them both and became mayor.
Mr. Carey's relations with the Legislature turned rocky in his second term. A new Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Stanley Fink, asserted his house as an independent force.
The governor let legislators know that he considered them petty and parochial, while they accused him of being distant from the business at hand. Even Mr. Carey's detractors said he was brilliant at sizing up problems and conceiving solutions, but aides and legislators alike agreed that he had little patience for seeing them through.
In 1981 and 1982, the Legislature cut him out of the budget-making process; when he vetoed dozens of spending items, both houses overrode his vetoes. He was the first governor of New York in a century to have a veto overridden.
In 1982, the state approved the most significant legislation of his second term, an $8 billion package to restore New York City's crumbling transit system. But that was largely the doing of legislators and Mr. Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The governor had been reduced to a bystander.
In his second term, Mr. Carey acquired a reputation for erratic behavior, which he attributed to people's misunderstanding his offbeat, deadpan humor. He created a furor by saying that one of New York's seats in the United States Senate had been and should remain "a Jewish seat." He sought state condemnation of a neighbor's property on Shelter Island, on the East End of Long Island, over a private feud. He offered to drink a glass of PCBs to allay fears of contamination at a state office building where an electrical transformer fire had spread soot laden with the toxic chemical.
But it was his marriage to Evangeline Gouletas, a wealthy real estate investor, that made the governor seem, to many people, downright eccentric. They met at the inauguration of Ronald Reagan as president in January 1981 and married less than three months later. Ms. Gouletas said that she had been married twice before and that her first husband had died, but shortly after her wedding to Mr. Carey, reporters discovered that she had three former husbands, all quite alive.
Bon Vivant
To the dismay of his staff, the governor began dyeing his silver hair -- not always quite the same shade -- and including his wife in policy discussions. The newlyweds were often seen out dancing, and they turned up regularly at black-tie events; Mr. Carey suddenly seemed more bon vivant than sober executive.
Finally, it became clear that he would be challenged by other Democrats if he ran for a third term. Although Mr. Carey had been a prime sponsor of Mr. Cuomo's political career, their relationship had so deteriorated that Mr. Cuomo, as Ms. Krupsak had done, was considering running against his political mentor.
In January 1982, Governor Carey announced that at the end of his term later that year, at age 63, he would retire from politics. After leaving office, he became a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Finley Kumble Wagner Heine Underberg & Casey. Later he worked with other law firms and was an executive at the chemicals conglomerate W. R. Grace & Company. He and Ms. Gouletas divorced after several years. Mr. Carey quickly faded from the public eye, though he turned up occasionally at the Capitol in Albany to bask in encomiums for his handling of the fiscal crisis.
"When he focuses and buckles down to a problem, he's effective," Warren M. Anderson, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate, said in 1982 as Mr. Carey's second term was ending. "I don't know why he doesn't do it more uniformly. He almost seemed to need a crisis to motivate him."
Last year, the State Legislature voted to rename the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel after Mr. Carey. Mr. Koch applauded the move, saying: "I have been trying for years to get something named for Hugh Carey. I think he's the greatest governor of the modern era."
Hugh Leo Carey was born on April 11, 1919, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, the fourth of five sons of Margaret and Denis J. Carey, both children of Irish immigrants. Denis Carey founded a successful business delivering fuel oil and kerosene, and the family lived comfortably.
Hugh Carey followed an educational path well worn by Brooklyn's Irish Catholic sons: St. Augustine's Academy and High School, St. John's College. He left school to enlist in a National Guard cavalry unit in 1939, at a time when the cavalry still rode horses. Years later he would regale upstate audiences with tales of his equestrian experiences at Camp Drum, near Watertown, providing a local touch that voters relished. When his unit was activated, he was transferred to the infantry.
He fought with the 104th Division in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, helping to capture Cologne and liberate prisoners at a concentration camp at Nordhausen. At his discharge in 1946, he was a lieutenant colonel, wearing the Bronze Star, the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.
In 1947 he married Helen Owen Twohy, the widow of a Navy flier killed in the war, and adopted her daughter. They had 13 more children together and divided their time between Park Slope and a rambling white house with a wraparound porch on Shelter Island that in time became the family homestead.
Mr. Carey is survived by his daughters, Alexandria McManus, Susan Dempsey, Marianne Hayes, Nancy Cassidy and Helen O'Neill; his sons Christopher, Michael, Donald, Bryan, Kevin and Thomas; his brothers Denis, John and Martin; 25 grandchildren and 6 great grand-children.
After the war, Mr. Carey returned to St. John's, where he finished his undergraduate education and graduated from law school. He then entered the family oil business. His eldest brother, Edward, struck out on his own, creating the New England Petroleum Corporation and amassing a fortune that would help underwrite his brother's political career.
Challenging an Incumbent
In 1960, Hugh Carey ran for Congress in a Brooklyn district that stretched from Park Slope to Bay Ridge, challenging a popular Republican incumbent, Francis E. Dorn. Though Mr. Carey was not one of its own, the Democratic Party organization backed him because no one else wanted what was viewed as a hopeless assignment. Running in a strongly Catholic district in a year when John F. Kennedy was pulling Catholics to the Democratic line, Mr. Carey squeezed out a 1,097-vote victory.
In seven terms in Congress, Mr. Carey ranked high on the scorecards of liberal groups and adhered to positions like opposing the death penalty even when they were unpopular. But in keeping with the tone of his district, he portrayed himself as a moderate, playing up his support for federal aid to parochial schools.
In Congress he became one of the most influential members of the New York delegation. He sat on the House Education and Labor Committee, which handled most of the New Frontier and Great Society social welfare legislation of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, and later on the powerful Ways and Means Committee.
But Mr. Carey became restless, and he and his wife grew tired of commuting to and from Washington with their many children.
In 1969, he ran for mayor of New York as an independent, angering Democratic Party leaders and prompting predictions of his political demise. But his sons Peter and Hugh Jr., both teenagers, were killed in a car accident on Shelter Island, and Mr. Carey abandoned the race. Another son, Paul, died of cancer in 2001.
Mr. Carey considered another run for mayor in 1973 but deferred to a fellow Brooklyn Democrat, Mr. Beame. That year, Helen Carey, who had been treated for cancer three years earlier, learned that the disease had returned, and on a family trip to Ireland, Mr. Carey decided to retire from politics.
In December 1973, however, he saw the political opening he had sought, when Mr. Rockefeller resigned as governor, leaving Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson to serve the year remaining on his term. Democratic Party leaders backed Howard J. Samuels, the president of the Off-Track Betting Corporation, for governor, and Mr. Carey was seen as a long shot.
On March 8, 1974, Helen Carey died. Her husband, with seven school-age children still at home, was expected to bow out of the race. But on March 26, he announced his candidacy. Friends said that as much as anything, he needed the challenge to distract him from his grief.
When he said that his brother would spend $1 million on television advertising to help his candidacy, the boast was viewed with skepticism, but Edward Carey spent that and more.
In September, he defeated Mr. Samuels with 61 percent of the vote. In November, in the national post-Watergate sweep by Democrats, Mr. Carey trounced Governor Wilson, 57 percent to 42 percent.
"All my life, people have been underestimating me," Mr. Carey often said. In rising to power, he repeatedly ignored the conventional wisdom and trusted his own judgment, and he would again as governor.
Years later, he told a reporter: "A mentor long departed told me that the greatest gift in political life, in any life, is to view yourself objectively, at arm's length, to make an assessment of yourself. So whom do I rely on? I rely on myself."

Abstract: [...] the economy is much weaker than it was at the outset of the last recession in December 2007, with most major measures of economic health -- including jobs, incomes, output and industrial production -- worse today than they were back then. [...] growth has been so weak that almost no ground has been recouped, even though a recovery technically started in June 2009. According to newly revised data from the Commerce Department, the economy is smaller today than it was when the recession began, despite (or rather, because of) the feeble growth in the last couple of years.

Full text: If the economy falls back into recession, as many economists are now warning, the bloodletting could be a lot more painful than the last time around.
Given the tumult of the Great Recession, this may be hard to believe. But the economy is much weaker than it was at the outset of the last recession in December 2007, with most major measures of economic health -- including jobs, incomes, output and industrial production -- worse today than they were back then. And growth has been so weak that almost no ground has been recouped, even though a recovery technically started in June 2009.
"It would be disastrous if we entered into a recession at this stage, given that we haven't yet made up for the last recession," said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economist at RDQ Economics.
When the last downturn hit, the credit bubble left Americans with lots of fat to cut, but a new one would force families to cut from the bone. Making things worse, policy makers used most of the economic tools at their disposal to combat the last recession, and have few options available.
Anxiety and uncertainty have increased in the last few days after the decision by Standard & Poor's to downgrade the country's credit rating and as Europe continues its desperate attempt to stem its debt crisis.
President Obama acknowledged the challenge in his Saturday radio and Internet address, saying the country's "urgent mission" now was to expand the economy and create jobs. And Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in an interview on CNBC on Sunday that the United States had "a lot of work to do" because of its "long-term and unsustainable fiscal position."
But he added, "I have enormous confidence in the basic regenerative capacity of the American economy and the American people."
Still, the numbers are daunting. In the four years since the recession began, the civilian working-age population has grown by about 3 percent. If the economy were healthy, the number of jobs would have grown at least the same amount.
Instead, the number of jobs has shrunk. Today the economy has 5 percent fewer jobs -- or 6.8 million -- than it had before the last recession began. The unemployment rate was 5 percent then, compared with 9.1 percent today.
Even those Americans who are working are generally working less; the typical private sector worker has a shorter workweek today than four years ago.
Employers shed all the extra work shifts and weak or extraneous employees that they could during the last recession. As shown by unusually strong productivity gains, companies are now squeezing as much work as they can from their newly "lean and mean" work forces. Should a recession return, it is not clear how many additional workers businesses could lay off and still manage to function.
With fewer jobs and fewer hours logged, there is less income for households to spend, creating a huge obstacle for a consumer-driven economy.
Adjusted for inflation, personal income is down 4 percent, not counting payments from the government for things like unemployment benefits. Income levels are low, and moving in the wrong direction: private wage and salary income actually fell in June, the last month for which data was available.
Consumer spending, along with housing, usually drives a recovery. But with incomes so weak, spending is only barely where it was when the recession began. If the economy were healthy, total consumer spending would be higher because of population growth.
And with construction nearly nonexistent and home prices down 24 percent since December 2007, the country does not have a buffer in housing to fall back on.
Of all the major economic indicators, industrial production -- as tracked by the Federal Reserve -- is by far the worst off. The Fed's index of this activity is nearly 8 percent below its level in December 2007.
Likewise, and perhaps most worrisome, is the track record for the country's overall output. According to newly revised data from the Commerce Department, the economy is smaller today than it was when the recession began, despite (or rather, because of) the feeble growth in the last couple of years.
If the economy were healthy, it would be much bigger than it was four years ago. Economists refer to the difference between where the economy is and where it could be if it met its full potential as the "output gap." Menzie Chinn, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin, has estimated that the economy was about 7 percent smaller than its potential at the beginning of this year.
Unlike during the first downturn, there would be few policy remedies available if the economy were to revert back into recession.
Interest rates cannot be pushed down further -- they are already at zero. The Fed has already flooded the financial markets with money by buying billions in mortgage securities and Treasury bonds, and economists do not even agree on whether those purchases substantially helped the economy. So the Fed may not see much upside to going through another politically controversial round of buying.
"There are only so many times the Fed can pull this same rabbit out of its hat," said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.
Congress had some room -- financially and politically -- to engage in fiscal stimulus during the last recession.
But at the end of 2007, the federal debt was 64.4 percent of the economy. Today, it is estimated at around 100 percent of gross domestic product, a share not seen since the aftermath of World War II, and there is little chance of lawmakers reaching consensus on additional stimulus that would increase the debt.
"There is no approachable precedent, at least in the postwar era, for what happens when an economy with 9 percent unemployment falls back into recession," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. "The one precedent you might consider is 1937, when there was also a premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, and the economy fell into another recession more painful than the first."
There is at least one factor, though, that could make a second downturn feel milder than the first: corporate profits. Corporate profits are at record highs and, adjusted for inflation, were 22 percent greater in the first quarter of this year than they were in the last quarter of 2007.
Nervous about the future of the economy, corporations are reluctant to make big investments like hiring. As a result, they are sitting on a lot of cash.
While this may not be much comfort to the nation's 13.9 million unemployed workers, it may be to their employed counterparts.
"In the financial crisis, when markets were freezing up, the first response was, 'I've got to get some cash,' " said Neal Soss, the chief economist at Credit Suisse. "The fastest way to get cash is to not have a weekly payroll, so that's why we saw such big layoffs."
Corporate cash reserves today, he said, could act as a buffer to layoffs if demand drops.
"There are arguments that another recession would be worse, and there are arguments in the other direction," Mr. Soss said. "We just don't know at this juncture. But ultimately it's a question you don't want to know the answer to."

Full text: Last year, a close friend confided that he had joined Alcoholics Anonymous. He never seemed alcoholic, but I supported him because it was important to him. We grew even closer. Then he began pushing me away for A.A. friends, who exclude me because I'm not part of the program. I don't want a dramatic showdown, but I can't pretend we're still close. We'll probably keep drifting. What should I say to friends who ask about us and may try to mend fences?
Anonymous
Philosophy 101 finally pays off! Remember Heraclitus? ("You can't step twice into the same river.") Well, H-man was onto something: Life is change. This includes pals, who grow and shift and, occasionally, leave us in the dust for a spell. The trick is taking the long view, which makes for easier reunions.
It would be pretty natural to feel hurt by your friend's behavior, especially since you were so supportive. But don't let those feelings tempt you to question his program, his friends or even his alcoholism. Those are his calls.
No need to drift, either. Simply acknowledge the situation, without pressuring him to change it. Say: "I'm sorry we're not spending time together. But I'm thrilled you're doing so well. And I'm here when you want to hang out." Respond to mutual friends who ask about him in a similar vein, but keep quiet about his drinking. He told you that in confidence.
We can still care deeply for folks we don't see that often. And even if we can't step into the same river twice, the water has a funny way of looping back around to pals who are kind and support us.
Honk if You're Female
Occasionally at traffic lights, when I'm behind another car and the light turns green, I give a short honk. Invariably, if the driver is male, he rolls down his window and makes an obscene gesture at me. (A simple "thank you" would suffice.) Is honking an assault on masculinity?
Beth Rose, Long Beach, N.Y.
Being honked at is startling, Beth. And it's annoying if the sole cause for the racket is that the light turned green two milliseconds before.
So, patience, please: "Five Mississippi," at least. (Not that there's ever an excuse for "bird flipping," as the kids call it.)
As to your gender theory, let me remind you that the only song I know with the lyrics "Toot, toot. Beep, beep" is Donna Summer's "Bad Girls." Enough said?
Those Office Gifts
I was recently asked to chip in for a colleague's birthday gift, an expensive camera. I've never received a gift from my co-workers, and neither has anyone else at our office. The birthday girl already invited us to an expensive dinner, at which we're to pay for ourselves. We're not close, and I don't want to chip in for the gift or dinner. Must I?
Anonymous
For folks who work in large offices (like Staples or the United States Congress), gifting every Tom, Dick and Mary could become an expensive proposition. (Plus, it's hard to imagine our politicians crossing the aisle to give presents other than shiny cyanide capsules.)
Fortunately, the novelty of gifts at your office gives you an out. Grab it!
Say to the person collecting money for the camera: "It's thoughtful to suggest a collective gift, but it would be burdensome and expensive to buy presents for everyone in the office. And I'd hate to hurt feelings by exclusion. So I'm opting out."
You may go down as a sourpuss, but you're entitled to avoid gift inflation. Just be sure to extend smiley birthday wishes on the big day.
And as for the lavish dinner, plead a prior engagement. That's what evening spin classes are for.
How Do You Spell 'Irked'?
I have a lovely and intelligent new girlfriend. But in her e-mail and text messages, she misspells "you're" as "your" -- when she means "you are." Is there a gentle and inoffensive way to correct this error, without coming off as snooty?
Larry, Houston
Considering that half the electronic messages I receive use "ur" to signify "you are," why not declare victory? She's closer than most.
Spelling lessons rarely go down as hot dates. And your new gal pal may find you a tad pretentious after your tutorial, but you probably are. (I am!)
So, let's show you off to best advantage. Try: "I have a silly pet peeve. I hope you won't feel criticized, because you're so smart. But 'you're' is short for 'you are,' and 'your' is a possessive pronoun -- like 'my' or 'his.' Sometimes you mix them up."
Then, brace yourself for her pet peeve, Grammar Gremlin. But as long as you exchange them lovingly, you two should be just fine.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade the credit rating of the United States for the first time echoed the nervousness of global markets in recent weeks, driven down by the relentless beat of grim economic news and a loss of confidence in the ability of political leaders to navigate challenges.
Governments on both sides of the Atlantic have avoided grappling with fundamental problems, counting on renewed growth to help borrowers who cannot afford to pay and creditors who cannot afford to walk away.
But four years into this age of financial contagion, the global economy cannot seem to pick up steam. Every promising leap seems to end with a sickening thud. The easy answers are exhausted, and political leaders face a rising tide of anger that is constraining their ability to make more difficult choices.
S.&P. said Friday that it was losing faith in America's political leaders. Investors seem to be losing hope. The movements of markets are collective predictions of future prosperity, and the tidings are increasingly grim.
"Europe's plan was to have growth fix the problem. America's plan was to have growth fix the problem. And that's not going to work," said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard. "I think it's really starting to sink in that we're not anywhere near an endgame."
The United States and Europe face parallel debt problems. Here, banks and investors are pitted against homeowners. There, banks and investors are pitted against nations. In both cases, governments have struggled to rebalance their books.
There is no surplus of economic strength to throw at the problem. The United States and Europe ran up great debts in the years of plenty, living well and promising to pay later, even as they made expansive promises to aging populations.
"The restorative forces of the economy are very weak and the immediate forces that will be in place are worsening the problem," said Joseph E. Stiglitz, an economist at Columbia University. "We already know it's not going to be a V-shaped recovery. I had said in my book that it would be more of an L-shaped, slow recovery. I think the answer now is a Japan-style malaise."
The weakness of the American economy is most evident in the lack of jobs. Only 55 percent of working-age adults held full-time jobs in July, the lowest level in modern times. About 25 million American adults want but cannot find full-time work, the government said Friday. The unemployment rate fell slightly, but mostly because 193,000 people stopped searching for jobs.
Consumer spending makes up 70 percent of the nation's economic activity, and people without jobs spend less money. For more than a year the government has reported that the economy was expanding more quickly than employment, fueling hope that hiring would follow.
But last week the government said in a new estimate that it was mistaken, and that the economy actually had expanded at an annual rate of only 0.8 percent during the first half of the year -- about the rate of population growth.
Falling home prices also shadow the recovery. Total household wealth remains 12 percent below its prerecession peak, according to the Federal Reserve. Consumer spending has not suffered a comparable decline, suggesting that people still see brighter days ahead. If they are wrong or if they lose faith, economists say, spending could dip even more sharply -- and with it, the broader economy.
Corporate profits have climbed to record heights, but companies are not hiring. Long-term prosperity depends on investment in research and equipment and workers. But short-term fears are driving a turn toward austerity, said Gary P. Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School.
"The dynamic that our government has gotten trapped in, companies are trapped in as well," he said.
Professor Stiglitz said that falling stock prices could exacerbate the problem.
"Firms with stock prices in decline will be reinvigorated to cut costs," he said. "And what does that mean? Lowering wages and firing people and making people work harder."
Financial markets have also been slow to recover. A lack of confidence in the reported health of financial institutions is visible in the price of their shares. Bank of America closed Friday at $8.17, implying that investors believe the company is worth about $83 billion. Bank of America estimated its own value at roughly $206 billion at the end of June.
There are no easy solutions. Professor Rogoff, who studies the aftermath of financial crises, has written that recoveries tend to take a very long time, particularly when downturns are as long and as deep as this one has been. The only way to hasten the process, he said, is to force the transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors -- to rebalance the books. He argues that this could be done through a policy of tolerance for higher inflation, which would reduce the value of debts over time.
"People sometimes ask, 'What is the checklist of things that have to happen for a recovery?' " he said. "I think there's basically one thing on it -- improving the balance sheets."
Lawrence H. Summers, President Obama's former chief economic adviser who has returned to his previous role as a professor at Harvard, said that exacting a toll from creditors could constrain future growth by discouraging future investments.
"No one is satisfied with the efforts to reduce foreclosures and support the housing market," he said. "The barrier to doing more has not been ideology or any solicitude for the financial sector, but concern about the adverse effects of inducing nonpayment by homeowners or reducing the flow of new mortgage credit."
Mr. Summers argues instead that the government should focus on tax cuts and directed spending to stimulate private spending and investment, policies for which there is little political appetite.
But even such measures, he said, have only a limited effect.
Ultimately, he said, crises are caused by too much confidence, too much borrowing and too much spending -- and the irony is that they must be solved by more confidence, more borrowing and more spending.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- China, the largest foreign holder of United States debt, said Saturday that Washington needed to "cure its addiction to debts" and "live within its means," just hours after the rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded America's long-term debt.
The harshly worded commentary, released by China's official Xinhua news agency, was Beijing's latest effort to express its displeasure with Washington.
Beijing's reaction to the downgrade was the harshest among foreign leaders. Japan -- which held $882 billion in United States Treasuries at the end of last year, making it the second-biggest overseas holder of American debt -- did not release any official statement about the downgrade. A Finance Ministry official said he could not comment.
Though Beijing has few options other than to continue to buy United States Treasury bonds, Chinese officials are clearly concerned that the country's substantial holdings of American debt, worth at least $1.1 trillion, are being devalued.
"The U.S. government has to come to terms with the painful fact that the good old days when it could just borrow its way out of messes of its own making are finally gone," read the commentary, which was published in Chinese newspapers.
Beijing, which did not release any other official statement on the downgrade, called on Washington to make substantial cuts to its "gigantic military expenditure" and its "bloated social welfare" programs.
The commentary serves as a sharp illustration of how the United States' standing in the world is sliding and how China now views itself as ascendant.
While Washington wrangles over its debt and deficit problems and the European Union struggles to deal with its own debt issues, China is sitting on the world's largest foreign exchange holdings, and its economy is growing at close to 9 percent. The country is also once again racking up huge trade surpluses with the rest of the world.
Beijing does have its own worries, like soaring inflation and housing prices and an overheating economy. Policy makers are also trying to deal with the accumulation of huge foreign exchange holdings. Trade and current account surpluses have helped China accumulate the vast foreign exchange reserves. It has invested much of those reserves in United States Treasury bonds, largely because the American market has long been considered the safest and most liquid bond market in the world.
Analysts say that China can also buy bonds in the European and Japanese markets but that those two markets are not big or liquid enough to absorb China's fast-accumulating foreign exchange reserves.
But because China has about $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, there are few places big enough to invest those holdings safely outside of United States Treasuries, even though it looks as if they may lose value.
Analysts say that if China pulled back from buying Treasuries, the dollar would weaken and America's borrowing costs would rise sharply, but that would also hurt China's existing holdings.
And so until China can find a way to slow its accumulation of dollars or find alternatives, it is likely to be the largest buyer of Treasuries. Still, government leaders here increasingly sound as if they are losing confidence.
"International supervision over the issue of U.S. dollars should be introduced, and a new stable and secured global reserve currency may also be an option to avert a catastrophe caused by any single country," the Xinhua commentary said.
Japanese officials in recent weeks had voiced some concern over Washington's debt impasse and its effect on the global economy. Still, trade-driven Japan is more than ever lured to holding Treasuries as a way to weaken its currency and make its exports more competitive. This week, Japan started what one economist estimated to be a 4.5 trillion yen intervention to buy dollars and sell yen. Data is expected to show that Japan's holdings of Treasuries have increased.
Meanwhile, Japan is struggling with its own burgeoning debt, already twice the size of its $5 trillion economy. Standard & Poor's in January downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating to AA-, two notches lower than the newly downgraded AA+ rating held by American securities. The markets shrugged off the downgrade, however, and Japan maintains low long-term interest rates.

Full text: IN the wake of the hugely disappointing budget deal and the S.& P.'s debt downgrade, maybe we need to hang a new sign in the immigration arrival halls at all U.S. ports and airports. It could simply read: "Welcome. You are entering the United States of America. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns."
Because our country is now finding itself in the worst kind of decline -- a slow decline, just slow enough for us to keep deluding ourselves that nothing really fundamental needs to change if our future is to match our past.
Our slow decline is a product of two inter-related problems. First, we've let our five basic pillars of growth erode since the end of the cold war -- education, infrastructure, immigration of high-I.Q. innovators and entrepreneurs, rules to incentivize risk-taking and start-ups, and government-funded research to spur science and technology.
We mistakenly treated the end of the cold war as a victory that allowed us to put our feet up -- when it was actually the onset of one of the greatest challenges we've ever faced. We helped to unleash two billion people just like us -- in China, India and Eastern Europe. For us to effectively compete and collaborate with them -- to maintain the American dream -- required studying harder, investing wiser, innovating faster, upgrading our infrastructure quicker and working smarter.
Instead of doing that at the scale we needed -- that is, building muscle -- we injected ourselves with massive amounts of credit steroids (just like our baseball players). This enabled millions of people to buy homes they could not afford and to fill jobs in construction and retail that did not require that much education. Our European friends went on a similar binge.
All this debt blew up in 2008 in the U.S. and Europe, and that led to the second problem: Homeowners, firms, banks and governments are all now "deleveraging" or trying to -- meaning that they are saving more, shopping less, paying off debts and trying to dig out from mortgages that are under water.
No one better explains the implications of this than Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, who argued in an essay last week for Project Syndicate that we are not in a Great Recession but in a Great (Credit) Contraction: "Why is everyone still referring to the recent financial crisis as the 'Great Recession?' " asked Rogoff. "The phrase 'Great Recession' creates the impression that the economy is following the contours of a typical recession, only more severe -- something like a really bad cold. ... But the real problem is that the global economy is badly overleveraged, and there is no quick escape without a scheme to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors, either through defaults, financial repression, or inflation. ...
"In a conventional recession," Rogoff noted, "the resumption of growth implies a reasonably brisk return to normalcy. The economy not only regains its lost ground, but, within a year, it typically catches up to its rising long-run trend. The aftermath of a typical deep financial crisis is something completely different. ... It typically takes an economy more than four years just to reach the same per capita income level that it had attained at its pre-crisis peak. ... Many commentators have argued that fiscal stimulus has largely failed not because it was misguided, but because it was not large enough to fight a 'Great Recession.' But, in a 'Great Contraction,' problem No. 1 is too much debt." Until we find ways to restructure and forgive some of these debts from consumers, firms, banks and governments, spending to drive growth is not going to come back at the scale we need.
Our challenge now, therefore, is to deleverage the economy as fast as possible, while, at the same time, getting back to investing as much as possible in our real pillars of growth so our recovery is built on sustainable businesses and real jobs and not just on another round of credit injections.
Regarding deleveraging, Rogoff suggests, for example, that the government facilitate the writing down of mortgages in exchange for a share of any future home-price appreciation.
Regarding growth, we surely need a much smarter long-term fiscal plan than the one that just came out of Washington. We need to cut spending in areas and on a time schedule that will hurt the least; we need to raise taxes in ways that will hurt the least (now is the perfect time for a gasoline tax rather than payroll taxes); and we need to use some of these revenues to invest in the pillars of our growth, with special emphasis on infrastructure, research and incentives for risk-taking and start-ups. We need to offer every possible incentive to get Americans to start new businesses to grow out of this hole.
If juggling all these needs at once sounds hard and complicated, it is. There is no easy, one-policy fix. We need to help people deleverage, cut some spending, raise some revenues and reinvest in our growth engines -- as an integrated strategy for national renewal. Something this big and complex cannot be accomplished by one party alone. It will require the kind of collective action usually reserved for national emergencies. The sooner we pull together the better.

Full text: LIKE many Americans, I watched the debate in Washington over the debt ceiling in utter disbelief that lawmakers would risk the sterling credit rating of the United States over something that had been raised 10 times since 2001.
The debt debate fell into the category of events that could hurt your portfolio, with you having little control over it. The same goes for the drop in stock prices at the end of the week; even if you did everything right with your own finances, your portfolio still could lose value.
Yet there are many risks in people's investments that they can control. How many investors, for instance, know what is in their portfolios and, more important, how those assets work -- or do not work -- together? How many people use several financial advisers who do not know what the other managers are doing? These and other common mistakes can expose a portfolio to unintended risks.
"This is a primary issue for individual investors," said Stephen M. Horan, head of private wealth management at the CFA Institute, an association of investment professionals. "We have a much clearer sense of what return is than what risk is. But losses govern the accumulation of wealth to a dramatic extent."
Here are three areas of risk that often get overlooked:
SECURITY SELECTION The classic example of unintended risk in a portfolio is the investor who buys six different mutual funds and thinks that equals diversification. What the investor may not realize is that all six funds can own 10 of the same stocks. Instead of diversifying risk, the investor has concentrated it.
Mr. Horan said investors needed to know what their holdings actually were. It is easy. Look up the funds' Top 10 holdings, available on the fund's Web site, and the sector concentrations. Then, investors need to have the courage of their convictions. Lynn Ballou, an investment adviser and also an ambassador for the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, said investors inadvertently increased their risk by being swayed by people who had little knowledge of their portfolio.
"It's, 'I went out to lunch with someone and he said, wink, wink, nod, nod, I've heard about this company and I'm going to buy some and you should, too,' " Ms. Ballou said. "All that is what I call sexy noise. And 99 times out of 100, it's just fun lunch talk."
But should investors act on those tips, they risk a problem that Chris Walters, executive vice president at Citizens Trust , calls "portfolio happens," the accumulation of investments that are not part of an overarching strategy and do not work together.
At the extreme, he said, was a client who recently bought $1 million of gold bullion without telling anyone. "We said, 'How are you going to get it home? What are you going to do with it?' " Mr. Walters said. But the best advice is to have a personal benchmark, pegged to when you will need the money, like in retirement. Thomas J. Pauloski, national managing director in the wealth management group at AllianceBernstein, said he urged his clients to do that.
"You want to get people away from focusing on the day-to-day jousting," he said. In doing this, an investor hopes to reduce the risk of buying high and selling low.
MANAGING SECURITIES The market crash of 2008 has instilled a fear of being overly concentrated with any one manager or firm. But spreading out everything among different people is not the solution, either.
"We think about the best fund managers and do a pretty good job at the beginning of finding them," Ms. Ballou said. "But we don't stay on top of them. And then, it's, 'I just read my famous fund manager retired or got indicted -- what do I do now?' "
She said more people should think about who is managing their portfolios the way they would think about a garden: after spending time planting beautiful flowers, they don't let it go without pruning and weeding.
This discipline is not easy, even among the wealthiest. One investor, whose family's wealth came from an agricultural products company and inheritance, said it was not until the family decided to move to another financial firm that they found out how much unintended risk was in their portfolio.
The investor, who asked not to be name to protect his family's privacy, said the family had 5 percent of its $50 million of liquid wealth in Microsoft and 7 to 8 percent in Oracle. But since the stocks were held in various accounts, they did not realize how concentrated they were.
"We looked at the stock statements and not what was in the funds," he said. "Microsoft and Oracle are great companies, but we didn't have any other significant holdings."
BNY Mellon Wealth Management performed the risk audit on the portfolio and the family moved their money to that firm. But Timothy E. Sheehan, senior director for business development at the firm, said the risk audits he did for clients were something anyone could do.
"All of this is public information," he said. "But when you tell them they own 30,000 different equity shares, they say, 'How did that happen?' "
A better way for investors to think about risk in their portfolio may be to consider various situations, Mr. Horan said. One might be looking at how your portfolio would fare with high inflation. (Answer: Banks perform less well than companies with tangible assets, like automakers and airlines.)
HIGH-END RISKS Sophisticated, often customized investments have become the norm for those at the top of the wealth scale to minimize losses or maximize returns.
Beyond the obvious risk that an investment will not pan out, there are other risks as well. One is being blinded by the name of an investment and not considering what it does with your money.
Mr. Walters pointed out that people often talked about being invested in hedge funds as if that alone meant something. A hedge fund, like a mutual fund, is just a vehicle to buy and sell things. Investors who don't understand the fund's strategy could unintentionally increase their risk, just like buying six different mutual funds.
Likewise, a private equity fund can give investors a sense of stability that may not be real. It comes partly from how infrequently it is valued. "If it was priced daily, it would look more like a microcap fund," which is more volatile, Mr. Walters said.
Then there are investors who think they are doing the right thing by spreading their money across different asset classes without understanding that those assets perform the same way. Mr. Walters said many of his clients in California own real estate along with municipal bonds. But both assets are vulnerable to interest rates and go up and down together.
Having a point person to gather all the information could help reduce these unintended risks, but who should that be? Advisers will vie for that role, but winning is not easy.
"Upfront, clients are very reluctant and they don't want to show their hand," said Nancy Driggers, senior portfolio manager at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Atlanta. "A lot of times, they've never seen everything in one place. They think of it as very compartmentalized."
That may be fine for some investors who are their own point people. Spreading out their money protects them from the risks of a single firm or adviser.
But they also could find themselves overly concentrated in one area, not invested in another or lacking an overall plan. Unlike Congressional infighting, that is something individual investors can control.
