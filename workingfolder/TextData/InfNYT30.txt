Full text:   Nearly a million low-wage workers in 10 states will get a modest raise this year. In Rhode Island, a new law has raised the state's minimum wage by 35 cents an hour, to $7.75, which will work out to an average annual raise of $510 for 11,000 Rhode Islanders. In nine other states -- Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington -- laws that peg the minimum wage to inflation will result in increases of 10 cents to 15 cents an hour, for hourly wages ranging from $7.35 in Missouri to $9.19 in Washington.
By contrast, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In all, 19 states and the District of Columbia set their minimums above that level, providing a much needed lift for the lowest-paid workers. But state efforts are no substitute for a higher federal minimum because the ability to earn a minimally acceptable income should not depend on where a worker lives.
Will Congress finally raise the federal minimum wage this year? It would be the least that lawmakers could do. In the fiscal cliff deal, lawmakers locked in big tax breaks for wealthy investors and for heirs of multimillion-dollar estates. At the same time, they allowed the payroll tax cut for low- and middle-income taxpayers to expire, without enacting new provisions to ease the blow. The lowest-paid workers will be hit the hardest. In the states that raised their minimum wage this year, much of the increase will be eaten up by the higher payroll tax. In the other states, paychecks will simply be smaller.
Efforts to raise the minimum invariably run into arguments that employers, especially small businesses, cannot afford to pay a higher wage. But the evidence shows that most low-wage employees work for large companies, which have largely recovered from the recession and have reinstituted generous pay packages for executives. As for low-wage workers at small businesses, many are waitresses and other "tipped" workers for whom the federal minimum wage is $2.13 an hour, where it has been since 1991. Clearly, there is ample room for an increase.
A related argument is that a higher minimum wage destroys jobs, especially employment for teenagers. But research shows that most low-wage workers are over the age of 20 and suggests that paying them a higher wage could actually create jobs by bolstering consumer spending.
A higher minimum wage is also an obvious way to counter the accelerating trend toward low-wage work and growing income inequality. For decades, various forces, including the decline in unionization and the global competition for jobs, have pushed down wages in the United States. But the situation has become worse in the last few years, as most of the middle-wage jobs lost during the recession have been replaced with lower-paid work.
Raising the minimum wage is always a fight. Congress has approved legislation to do so only three times in the last 30 years. President Obama promised to take on this fight back in 2008, when he called for a federal minimum wage of $9.50 an hour by 2011, indexed to inflation. It is past time to keep the promise.

Abstract: The Fed also plans to maintain for the foreseeable future the vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities it has acquired since 2008 to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Just a few months after announcing a campaign to reduce unemployment, Federal Reserve officials are already debating how soon to stop it, reflecting persistent internal divisions about the effort's value.
At a meeting in December, several members of the Fed's policy making committee argued that purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities should be reduced or ended "well before the end of 2013," according to an account of the meeting the Fed published Thursday after a customary three-week delay.
The Fed announced after the meeting that it would keep buying assets until the pace of job creation improved substantially, part of an effort to increase the impact of its policies by announcing economic objectives rather than end dates. But the account shows that many members of the 12-person committee continue to think in terms of end dates, partly because they are worried about the potential costs.
The concerns include the potential disruption of financial markets and the delicate balance between encouraging private borrowing and unleashing speculation. Fed officials professed less concern that the purchases could loosen the Fed's grip on inflation. They noted that inflation remained low, and that they expected it to stay under control.
"While almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in September had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased," the meeting account said.
The stock market declined after the Fed released the account of its deliberations, suggesting some investors were surprised by the cautious tone, but the drop was modest. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.21 percent of its value at the close of trading.
Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said investors had expected the Fed to keep buying "through much, if not all, of this year." He said investors would now need to watch more closely for evidence that the recovery was gaining strength, which could lead the Fed to curtail its purchases.
"This should significantly amplify the financial market's sensitivity to upcoming economic data," Mr. LaVorgna wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
The government will release its monthly jobs report Friday morning.
But Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said investors should keep the account in perspective, as a reflection of modest misgivings in the middle of the most aggressive effort the Fed has ever undertaken to stimulate the economy.
The central bank announced after the December meeting that it planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided inflation remained under control, and it estimated that the rate would cross that threshold no sooner than mid-2015.
The Fed also plans to maintain for the foreseeable future the vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities it has acquired since 2008 to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
And Ms. Swonk said she saw nothing in the account to alter her conviction that the Fed intended to keep adding to that stockpile through the coming year. She said the reservations of some officials had not prevented the new campaign, and would not force an early conclusion, because the basic argument for the purchases remained compelling: the economy is not growing fast enough, too many people remain unemployed, and the rest of government is not helping.
"I think that they would love to be able to stop," Ms. Swonk said, but given the condition of the economy, "I think there's still a huge bias toward buying."
She said that four of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee would be replaced in January, and that two new arrivals -- Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston -- had been outspoken supporters of asset purchases.
The Fed's current program of asset purchases began in September with the announcement that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month until the outlook for the labor market "improved substantially."
In December, the Fed said it would also expand its holdings of Treasuries by $45 billion each month, replacing a program in which it acquired that amount of long-term Treasuries each month by selling the same amount of short-term Treasuries, so that the total size of its portfolio remained unchanged.
The account said that a few officials predicted the purchases would need to continue through the end of the year, and a few said it was too soon to make a judgment.
"Several others thought that it would probably be appropriate to slow or to stop purchases well before the end of 2013, citing concerns about financial stability or the size of the balance sheet," the account continued, before concluding, "One member viewed any additional purchases as unwarranted."

Full text:   The big story in the markets this year was not about stocks.
Americans sold off their stock mutual funds, the most popular way to invest in American companies, at the fastest clip since 2008, the year the financial crisis began. That occurred despite the fact that the stock market itself rose steadily; the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the year up 13.4 percent.
Investors have been opting instead for the assumed safety of bonds. Money has been steadily flowing into mutual funds holding bonds of all sorts for the last four years, but the pace accelerated this year. The percentage of household investments in bonds shot up to 26 percent from 14 percent just five years ago, according to Morningstar.
Entering the new year, a growing number of professional investors are betting that the craze for bonds has gone too far, perhaps dangerously so, as has been evident in the headlines from the year-end reports from large investment firms. "Bond PAIN in 2013?" Wells Capital Management's chief strategist asked. "Caution: Turn Ahead," BlackRock analysts wrote. "The inflection year," said Bank of America.
This is not the first time that analysts have forecast an end to the rally in bond values that has lasted for decades. But previously many of the voices predicting it were pessimists who believed that investors would sell off their bonds when they lost faith in the American government's ability to pay back its bonds, forcing the government and many other bond issuers to pay higher interest rates. When interest rates rise, older bonds with lower interest rates are worth less.
While those previous forecasts have proved expensively wrong, this year the forecasters are being joined by many economic optimists who argue that a strengthening American economy is likely to make investors willing to embrace the risks involved in stocks, luring them out of bonds. The question, they say, is only how quickly it will happen.
"Mathematically, it's next to impossible to get the kind of returns on bonds you've seen over the last few years," said Kate Moore, the chief global equity strategist at Bank of America.
When the turn does ultimately come, it is likely to cause pain for at least some of the people who have been investing in bonds in recent years.
"You don't want to be the last one out the door when the trends turn," said Rebecca H. Patterson, the chief investment strategist at Bessemer Trust. "All good things come to an end and we want to make sure we're in front of it."
Most of the talk of investors shifting money from bonds into stocks relies first on the assumption that politicians in Washington are able to resolve the current impasse over the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will go into effect if Congress and President Obama do not come to an agreement, and the coming debate over the nation's debt ceiling. (Late Monday evening, the two sides crept closer to a deal, tentatively agreeing to raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.)
But a number of surveys suggest that professional investors are already starting to prepare for a shift. Hedge funds polled by Bank of America said that they had more of their portfolio allocated to stocks than at any time since 2006.
All but one of the 13 bank strategists tracked by Birinyi Associates expects stock markets to rise in 2013. When 2012 began, the same strategists were predicting a downturn in share prices. Even among mutual fund investors, there are signs that the flows out of stocks and into bonds have been slowing down recently.
The preference for bonds has already been costly for retail investors. Over the last year, most types of American bonds have returned less than an investment in the S.& P. 500. When inflation is factored in, the benchmark 10-year Treasury security is delivering negative returns.
But many investors are still rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the turbulence in the stock markets since then, which have led to wild swings. Over the last five years, all major types of American bonds have done better than leading stock indexes.
The Federal Reserve has been engaged in an aggressive effort to buy bonds and drive down interest rates. The long term goal of that program is to encourage banks to lend money and to drive investors out of bonds. But in the meantime, falling interest rates have made bonds more attractive. The Fed has said it wants to keep rates low until 2015, though it could let them rise sooner if the economy picks up faster than expected. The 10-year Treasury hovered near 4 percent in recent years but has stayed below 2 percent for much of 2012.
A number of big-name investors say they believe that the low rates and economic uncertainty are likely to endure, giving bonds a continuing attraction. William H. Gross, the co-founder of Pimco, and perhaps the world's most famous bond investor, said on Twitter that he expected interest rates would fall further in 2013, in part because of continuing growing pains in the American economy.
Mr. Gross's prediction is particularly notable because in 2011 he bet that interest rates would rise, leading him to sell off some of his firm's Treasury bond holdings. When that bet lost money, Mr. Gross reversed course.
Garth Friesen, the chief investment officer at the hedge fund manager AVM, compared the current situation in the United States to the last few decades in Japan, where investors have continually predicted that interest rates will rise and drive down the value of Japanese bonds. Almost all of those predictions proved wrong as slow economic growth continued to push Japanese interest rates down.
"More money has been lost trying to predict the rotation out of Japanese bonds than almost anywhere else," said Mr. Friesen.
But Mr. Friesen says he does believe that the returns from bonds will be lower than they have been in recent years. A Bank of America global bond index has returned 6 percent over the last year, 17 percent over the last three years and 32 percent since 2007.
Most of the predictions that interest rates will stabilize or turn around are based on the belief that an improving American economy will help push unemployment lower, restore confidence in American companies and encourage inflation to start to rise. If inflation does go up, it will make current bond holdings less attractive.
There is growing evidence this is already happening. In addition to the rising stock market, housing prices have begun to move up and unemployment has been trending down.
Ms. Patterson said that this shift was likely to occur slowly, giving investors time to sell off their bond investments without sustaining any significant losses. What is more, a turn in interest rates will not cause the same problems for all bond holders.
Investors who hold bonds directly will continue to collect regular interest payments and will receive back their entire initial investment, the principal, when the terms of the bonds expire. But for people who frequently buy and sell bonds, including mutual funds, the value of the bonds they currently hold will go down when interest rates rise.
Even among bond mutual funds, some types are expected to continue to do well if and when interest rates rise. Bonds that are issued to provide loans to banks generally do well when rates rise. Among corporate bonds, investments in high-yielding speculative companies -- so-called junk bonds -- generally do better in times of rising rates than bonds issued by companies with high credit ratings.
But all of this calculus could be thrown on its head if the doomsayers are right and interest rates rise quickly at some point. That could happen if, say, there were serious military tensions in the Middle East and oil prices spiked suddenly. It could also occur if investors lose faith in the ability of the United States government to pay back investors who buy its bonds.
Tad Rivelle, the head of bond investing at TCW, said that the Federal Reserve's current policy was most likely to fail and kill confidence in Treasury bonds, forcing the government to pay higher interest rates to borrow. But even if the Fed succeeds, Mr. Rivelle said, interest rates will end up in the same place.
"Whether Fed policy succeeds or fails, rates are ultimately going to be going significantly higher," said Mr. Rivelle.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Furious last-minute negotiations between the White House and the Senate Republican leadership on Monday secured a tentative agreement to allow tax rates to rise on affluent Americans, but not in time for Congress to meet its Dec. 31 deadline for averting automatic tax increases and spending cuts deemed a threat to the economy.
While the Senate moved toward a vote on legislation to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the House was not going to consider any deal until Tuesday afternoon at the earliest, meaning that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts would go into effect as 2013 began. If Congress acts quickly and sends the legislation to President Obama, the economic impact could still be very limited.
Under the agreement, tax rates would jump to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individual incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits would start phasing out on incomes as low as $250,000, a clear win for President Obama, who campaigned on higher taxes for the wealthy.
"Just last month Republicans in Congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans," Mr. Obama said at a hastily arranged news briefing, with middle-income onlookers cheering behind him. "Obviously, the agreement that's currently being discussed would raise those rates and raise them permanently."
Democrats also secured a full year's extension of unemployment insurance without strings attached and without offsetting spending cuts, a $30 billion cost.
As negotiators tied up the last points of dispute, officials said that the two top Democrats on Capitol Hill -- Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California -- had signed off on the agreement. In an effort to win over other Democrats uneasy with the proposal, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had bargained directly with Republican leaders, traveled to the Capitol on Monday night for a 90-minute meeting with his former Senate colleagues.
"I feel very, very good," Mr. Biden said after the meeting. "I think we'll get a very good vote."
In one final piece of the puzzle, negotiators agreed to put off $110 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs for two months while broader deficit reduction talks continue. Those cuts begin to go into force on Wednesday, and that deadline, too, might be missed before Congress approves the legislation.
To secure votes, Mr. Reid also told Democrats the legislation would cancel a pending congressional pay raise -- putting opponents in the politically difficult position of supporting a raise -- and extend an expiring dairy policy that would have seen the price of milk double in some parts of the country.
Anticipating Senate approval of the deal, Speaker John A. Boehner late Monday said the House would "honor its commitment to consider the Senate agreement if it is passed. Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation."
The nature of the deal ensured that the running war between the White House and Congressional Republicans on spending and taxes would continue at least until the spring. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner formally notified Congress that the government reached its statutory borrowing limit on New Year's Eve. Through some creative accounting tricks, the Treasury Department can put off action for perhaps two months, but Congress must act to keep the government from defaulting just when the "pause" on pending cuts is up. Then in late March, a law financing the government expires.
And the new deal does nothing to address the big issues that Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner hoped to deal with in their failed "grand bargain" talks two weeks ago: booming entitlement spending and a tax code so complex that few defend it anymore.
Though the tentative deal had a chance of success if put to a vote, it landed with a thud on Capitol Hill. Republicans accused the White House of "moving the goal posts" by demanding still more tax increases to help shut off across-the-board spending cuts beyond the two-month pause. Democrats were incredulous that the president had ultimately agreed to around $600 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years when even Mr. Boehner had promised $800 billion. But the White House said it had also won concessions on unemployment insurance and the inheritance tax among other wins.
Still, Democrats openly worried that if Mr. Obama could not drive a harder bargain when he holds most of the cards, he will give up still more Democratic priorities in the coming weeks, when hard deadlines will raise the prospects of a government default first, then a government shutdown. In both instances, conservative Republicans are more willing to breach the deadlines than in this case, when conservatives cringed at the prospects of huge tax increases.
"I just don't think Obama's negotiated very well," said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.
But as night fell on New Year's Eve, senators seemed worn down and resigned. "Everybody by this time is angry, but sooner or later this has to be resolved," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee.
Even House Republicans signaled that enough of them, in combination with Democrats, could most likely pass the legislation, just weeks after Republicans shot down Mr. Boehner's proposal to raise taxes only on incomes over $1 million.
"I don't want to say where I am until I read the legislation, but it is certainly better than the alternative," said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.
With a deal agonizingly close, official Washington still prepared for the worst. The Defense Department prepared to notify all 800,000 of its civilian employees that some of them could be forced into unpaid leave without a deal on military cuts. The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance to employers to increase withholding from paychecks beginning Tuesday to match new tax rates at every income level.
"No deal is the worse deal," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, rejecting the assertions of liberal colleagues that no deal would be better than what they would see as a bad deal.
However, new wrenches were gumming up the machinery. Democrats put out late word that Republicans wanted the threshold at which inherited estates would be taxed to be indexed to inflation, a nonstarter for them. Republicans said they needed to see what cuts would pay for the $24 billion needed to put off across-the-board spending cuts.
But with Republicans and Democrats grumbling, it was clear that a deal hashed out through intense talks between Mr. Biden and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had given both sides provisions to cheer and to jeer.
Under the deal, tax rates on dividends and capital gains would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent, on income over $400,000 for single people and $450,000 for couples. The deal would reinstate provisions to tax law, ended by the Bush tax cuts of 2001, that phase out personal exemptions and deductions for the affluent. Those phaseouts, under the agreement, would begin at $250,000 for single people and $300,000 for couples.
The estate tax would also rise, but considerably less than Democrats had wanted. The value of estates over $5 million would be taxed at 40 percent, up from 35 percent. Democrats had wanted a 45 percent rate on inheritances over $3.5 million.
Under the deal, the new rates on income, investment and inheritances would be permanent, as would a provision to stop the alternative minimum tax from hitting middle-class families.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Senate leaders on Sunday failed to produce a fiscal deal with just hours to go before large tax increases and spending cuts were to begin taking effect on New Year's Day, despite a round of volatile negotiations over the weekend and an attempt by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to intervene.
In seesaw negotiations, the two sides got closer on the central issue of how to define the wealthy taxpayers who would be required to pay more once the Bush-era tax cuts expire.
But that progress was overshadowed by gamesmanship. After Republicans demanded that any deal must include a new way of calculating inflation that would mean smaller increases in payments to beneficiaries of programs like Social Security, Democrats halted the negotiations for much of the day.
The Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made an emergency call to Mr. Biden in hopes of restarting negotiations, and the White House sent the president's chief legislative negotiator to the Capitol to meet with Senate Democrats. Soon after, Republicans withdrew their demand and discussions resumed, but little progress was made.
Lawmakers will be back on Monday. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said the Senate would return at 11 a.m. Monday and then left the Capitol just after 6 p.m.
"Talk to Joe Biden and McConnell," Mr. Reid told reporters when asked if negotiations were continuing.
In the balance are more than a half-trillion dollars in tax increases on virtually every working American and across-the-board spending cuts that are scheduled to begin Tuesday. Taken together, they threaten to push the economy back into recession.
"It looks awful," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat. "I'm sure the American people are saying, with so much at stake why are they waiting so late to get this done?"
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who had said early Sunday that he thought a deal was within reach, said later on his Twitter feed, "I think we're going over the cliff."
Weeks of negotiations between President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner inched toward a deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, while locking in trillions of dollars in deficit reduction over 10 years and starting an effort to overhaul the tax code and entitlement programs like Medicare. But earlier this month, Mr. Boehner walked away from those talks.
Instead he tried to reach a much more modest deal to avoid a fiscal crisis by extending the expiring tax cuts for incomes under $1 million. When Mr. Boehner's own Republican members revolted, he ceded negotiations to the Senate. But compromise has proved equally elusive in that chamber.
Absent a last-minute deal, Mr. Reid is expected to move on Monday to bring to a vote a stopgap measure pushed by Mr. Obama, which would retain lower tax rates for incomes below $250,000 and extend unemployment benefits. But it was not clear that would even get a vote. The objection of a single senator on Monday would run out the clock on the 112th Congress before a final tally could be taken.
Mr. Obama appeared on the NBC program "Meet the Press" on Sunday and implored Congress to act. "We have been talking to the Republicans ever since the election was over," Mr. Obama said in the interview. "They have had trouble saying yes to a number of repeated offers."
He added, "Now the pressure's on Congress to produce."
After the talks broke down over the inflation demand, Senate Republicans emerged from a closed-door meeting on Sunday afternoon to declare the issue off the table for now. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said that holding the line against raising taxes on high-income households while fighting for cuts to Social Security was "not a winning hand."
Then they mustered a new talking point, saying Democrats want to raise taxes only to spend more money. Their new objection: Democrats are seeking a one- to two-year "pause" for across-the-board spending cuts and an extension of expired unemployment benefits for two million people.
"We raise taxes, and we spend more?" asked Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. "It's business as usual."
For their part, Democrats beat back the inflation proposal, and then promptly proclaimed themselves incensed that Republicans would not soften their position on a generous level of taxation on inherited estates and an insistence that a final deal permanently prevent the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax system meant to ensure that wealthy people pay more, from expanding to affect more of the middle class.
Democrats were also demanding that across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs -- known as the "sequester" -- at least be delayed.
"We're not here to defend government, we're here to make sure of the defense of our country," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, whose state would be hit particularly hard. "Sequester has consequences."
Senate Democratic aides were openly making legislative plans for later this week, to press Democratic proposals after the fiscal deadline is breached -- and after the next Congress is sworn in on Thursday with more Democrats in both the House and the Senate.
But officials close to the negotiations said the talks were continuing, centered for now on a new axis, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden.
Much of the umbrage was oddly discordant. Mr. Obama has long advocated for a permanent fix to the alternative minimum tax, which must be "patched" each year to keep it from applying to middle-income families. Until this weekend, both Democrats and Republicans appeared willing to let the across-the-board cuts take effect, at least temporarily, while a larger deficit deal is negotiated early next year.
Indeed, many Republicans were the loudest in protesting the cuts. Now that Democrats want them canceled, Republicans equate that position to raising taxes in order to spend more.
On some of the biggest sticking points, the two sides are now inches apart. Barely a week after House Republicans refused to vote to allow taxes to rise on incomes over $1 million, Senate Republicans proposed allowing tax rates to rise on incomes over $450,000 for individuals and $550,000 for couples. Democrats countered with a proposal to extend expiring Bush-era tax cuts up to $360,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples. For both sides, that meant major movement. Mr. Obama has been holding firm at a $250,000 threshold.
Of course, a big question hung over the negotiations in the Senate: even if the Senate can find an accord, would it pass the House?
Even on the estate tax, the two sides are not far apart, although their language is. Republicans want to tax estates valued above $5 million at 35 percent. Democrats want to tax inheritances above $3.5 million at 45 percent.
If that sounds like a bridgeable divide, Democrats are not conceding an inch. "The net result is that 6,000 Americans would get a $1-million-a-year tax break on their estate tax," Mr. Durbin said. "The Republicans once again are ready to shut us down over not 2 percent of the population, but 0.1 percent of the population."

Full text:   IN the continuing fiscal negotiations between President Obama and House Republicans, both sides have, from the very beginning, agreed on one point: Taxes on the middle class must not rise. But maybe it's time to reconsider this premise. An unwavering commitment to keep middle-class taxes low could be one reason the political process has become so deeply dysfunctional.
Let's start with the problem: the budget deficit. Under current policy, the federal government is spending vastly more than it is collecting in tax revenue. And that will be true for the next several decades, thanks largely to the growth in entitlement spending that will occur automatically as the population ages and health care costs increase. As a result, the ratio of government debt to the nation's gross domestic product is projected to rise, substantially and without an end in sight.
That can happen for a while, or even a long while, but not forever. At some point, investors at home and abroad will start questioning our ability to service our debts without creating steep inflation. It's hard to say precisely when this shift in investor sentiment will occur, and even whether it will strike in this president's term or the next, but when it does, it won't be pretty. The United States will find itself at the brink of an unprecedented financial crisis.
Republicans and Democrats agree on the nature of the problem, but they embrace very different solutions. My fear is that both sides are engaged in an excess of wishful thinking, with a dash of mendacity.
If Republicans had their way, they would focus the entire solution on the spending side. They say that reform of the entitlement programs can reduce their cost. The so-called premium-support plan for Medicare, from Paul D. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate, would let older Americans use their health care dollars to buy insurance from competing private plans. (Interestingly, it's similar to the system envisioned for the nonelderly by President Obama's Affordable Care Act.) The hope is that competition and choice would keep health care costs down without sacrificing quality.
The premium-support model may well be better than the current Medicare system, but its supporters oversell what it would be likely to accomplish. The primary driver of increasing health care costs over time is new technology, which extends and improves the quality of life, but often at high cost. Unless the pace or nature of medical innovation changes, this trend is likely to continue, regardless of structural reforms we enact for Medicare.
Democrats, meanwhile, want to preserve the social safety net pretty much as is. They balk at any attempt to reduce this spending, including even modest changes like altering the price index used to calculate Social Security benefits. They focus their attention on raising taxes on the most financially successful Americans, contending that the rich are not paying their "fair share."
Fairness, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Unfortunately, people's judgment is often based on anecdotes that distort rather than illuminate. The story of the undertaxed Warren Buffett and his overtaxed secretary looms larger in the public's mind than it should.
Here are some facts, so you can judge for yourself:
In 2009, the most recent year for which data are available, the richest 1 percent of Americans paid 28.9 percent of their income in federal taxes, according to the Congressional Budget Office. (That includes income taxes, both individual and corporate, and payroll taxes.) Members of the middle class, defined as the middle fifth of households, paid 11.1 percent of their income in taxes.
Some of this difference in tax rates is attributable to temporary tax changes passed in response to the recent recession. But not all. In 2006, before the financial crisis, the top 1 percent paid 30 percent of their income in taxes, compared with 13.9 percent for the middle class.
These data suggest that the rich are not, as a general matter, shirking their responsibilities to support the federal government. To me, the current tax system looks plenty progressive. Others may disagree.
One point, however, cannot be disputed: Even if President Obama wins all the tax increases on the rich that he is asking for, the long-term fiscal picture will still look grim. Perhaps we can stabilize the situation for a few years just by taxing the rich, but as greater numbers of baby boomers retire and start collecting Social Security and Medicare, more will need to be done.
Which brings us back to the middle class. When President Obama talks about taxing the rich, he means the top 2 percent of Americans. John A. Boehner, the House speaker, talks about an even thinner slice. But the current and future fiscal imbalances are too large to exempt 98 percent or more of the public from being part of the solution.
Ultimately, unless we scale back entitlement programs far more than anyone in Washington is now seriously considering, we will have no choice but to increase taxes on a vast majority of Americans. This could involve higher tax rates or an elimination of popular deductions. Or it could mean an entirely new tax, such as a value-added tax or a carbon tax.
To be sure, the path ahead is not easy. No politician who wants to be re-elected is eager to entertain the possibility of higher taxes on the middle class. But fiscal negotiations might become a bit easier if everyone started by agreeing that the policies we choose must be constrained by the laws of arithmetic.

Full text:   Five years ago, the world economy seemed to be doing fine.
But it wasn't. The fourth quarter of 2007 was the peak for the American economy. It began a mild recession in early 2008 that turned into a severe one by late in the year, when the credit crisis spread to most of the world. A few countries escaped recession, but virtually no one was able to avoid severe bear markets in stocks.
The accompanying charts look at changes in gross domestic product and stock markets around the world since the end of 2007.
In some countries, including the largest developing economies in Asia, the G.D.P. charts show no indication that bad things ever happened. China's G.D.P. growth slowed a bit, and may be slowing more now, but it never came close to recession.
By the third quarter of 2012 China's gross domestic product, measured in local currency and adjusted for inflation, was 50 percent larger than it had been at the end of 2007. The economies of India and Indonesia had each grown by 30 percent.
At the other end of the spectrum, some major economies are smaller now than they were then, with little indication that they will completely recover any time soon. The Italian and Spanish economies, hurt by their inability to compete with Germany in export markets, continue to decline. Spain's economy is smaller than it was in 2005, while Italy's has fallen below 2003 levels.
Both would be doing better if they were able to devalue their currencies against Germany's, but they cannot because they share the euro.
Not being in the euro has been critical to the success of some European countries. Poland's economy has grown by about 15 percent, measured in local currency, as the value of the zloty fell sharply in late 2008 and has yet to fully recover against the euro. That has made its exports more competitive.
While some developing economies have showed good growth over the last five years, their stock markets have not done well. In early 2008, China's market broke sharply lower, leading to fears that a world recession might begin there. Nothing like that happened, but the stock market has yet to fully recover.
The United States has perhaps the best combined record of major developed economies. Its G.D.P. is 2.5 percent larger than it was at the end of 2007 -- a smaller gain than was shown in Australia, Canada or Germany -- but its stock market is closer to recovering all the lost ground than the markets in any of those countries.
MSCI, a research company that compiles stock indexes based on all major stocks in each country, reports that its All Country World Index is now 16 percent lower than it was five years ago. World G.D.P. -- counting all 56 countries for which data through the third quarter of 2012 is available -- has fully recovered, largely because of strength in large emerging economies. Both those figures are calculated in dollars, but individual country charts are based on performance measured in local currencies.

Full text:   "Certificates of Confiscation."
Three decades ago, that was what some people said bonds really were. The interest the bond paid would not be enough, they said, to offset the declining value of dollars as inflation added up. The "real" -- after-inflation -- bond yield would be negative.
That was just as the great bull market in bonds began. Bonds were great investments, and the bond bears turned out to have been dead wrong.
Now we have come full circle. The government is selling bonds that are absolutely, positively guaranteed to not pay enough to offset inflation over the coming years. It is even possible that someone who bought a new Treasury security that will be issued on Monday will end up getting fewer dollars back than he or she invested -- interest and principal combined -- between now and when the bond matures in 2017.
The securities are inflation-protected Treasury notes. If inflation ticks up significantly over the coming years, investors will get back more dollars than originally invested. But not enough to come close to keeping up with inflation. If there is no inflation, they will get back less than they invested.
When those securities were auctioned last week, buyers agreed to accept a real yield of negative 1.496 percent. It takes a lot of pessimism -- about the economy and the future of the United States -- to think an investment certain to lose money is an investment worth making.
The great bear market in bonds, both corporates and governments, lasted 35 years, from 1946 to 1981. The bull market lasted about 30 years. A new bear market almost certainly has begun.
If that is true, those seeking a little income now by going out the yield curve will come to rue the decision. They will get the promised interest, but as market interest rates rise, the price of those bonds will decline and decline and decline.
On Oct. 26, 1981, which can be dated as the bottom of the great bond bear market, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 15.21 percent. On that date, a Treasury bond issued in 1970 and scheduled to mature in 2000 was quoted at less than 56 percent of face value. It had a coupon of 7.875 percent, but that was not deemed enough to compensate investors for the risk.
At market extremes, it is often worth analyzing what has to be true for a given investment to be a good, or bad, value. Back in 1981, you had to assume that inflation would not only remain in double digits for decades, but that it would also continue to rise, for a newly issued Treasury bond to turn out to be a bad investment. Yet many investors assumed it would be. After all, a lot of people on Wall Street in 1981 could not remember a time when bonds were good investments.
A few weeks before rates peaked, Seth Glickenhaus, an experienced bond trader and head of Glickenhaus & Company, an investment advisory firm, spoke the conventional wisdom when he said, "Anyone who buys a bond today to hold for more than five years is out of his mind."
Michael Gavin, the head of United States asset allocation for Barclays, pointed out this month that over the past 30 years an investor who stayed invested in American, or British, 10-year government bonds would have earned more than 5 percent a year over inflation.
"It does not require advanced market math to understand that returns like these are no longer remotely plausible," he wrote. "But they say that fish don't know that they live in water -- until they are removed from it -- and we wonder if some of the many market participants whose entire professional experience has been conditioned by the financial backdrop created by the bond market rally might underestimate some consequences of its termination."
Even if rates stay where they are for the next five years, and investors collect the interest coupons, he said, "bonds will be transformed from wealth creators into wealth destroyers."
Or at least they will be unless there is severe deflation. For that is the only situation that will allow today's new long-term bonds to turn into good investments.
Is that possible? To think it is likely, you pretty much have to assume that economic growth is a thing of the past in both the United States and Europe. It is not an optimistic outlook.
James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer -- and a bear on bonds for some time -- argues there are parallels between 1981 and now, at least in conventional wisdom. "Central banks are harmless, said the bond bears in 1981; in a social democracy, inflation is ineradicable," he writes in the current issue of his publication. "Central bankers are harmless, charge the bond bulls of 2012; in an overleveraged economy, inflation is unachievable."
One reason bond yields are so low now -- at least in markets like Britain and the United States -- is the fact that after the Greek fiasco investors have come to fear default more than currency depreciation. That had led to a rush to default-proof bonds, which means bonds issued by countries that can print the currency they borrowed. (It may be that Treasuries will not always be default-proof because a Tea Party-influenced Congress will refuse to allow the government to pay its bills. But so far markets assume the politicians will not be that stupid.)
It is interesting to look at the relationship of stocks and bonds when the bond market is near extremes in valuation. Those moments tend to come when economic uncertainty is high and fears are widespread. In the past, such fears have proved to be wrong.
In 1946, there was a consensus among many economists that a new depression was likely. After all, the 1930s depression did not end until armies put unemployed people to work. Now that the war was over and armies were shrinking, would not the economy retreat again?
Bond prices turned down -- and yields up -- in the spring of 1946. Stocks sold off that fall, and it was not until 1950 that the stock market got back to where it was when the bond bear market began.
Then stocks enjoyed a phenomenal period. One reason interest rates were rising was that economic growth presented good investment opportunities. The stock market was a very good place to put money throughout the 1950s and into the mid-1960s, occasional recessions and bear markets notwithstanding.
During the last 10 or 15 years of the bond bear market, however, the stock market gyrated but went nowhere. In 1981, as the bond bear market was ending, the Dow Jones industrial average was lower than it had been 15 years earlier. The economy was in recession and optimism was hard to find. There was a consensus that the United States had lost its competitive edge and could not compete with Japan. Share prices did not hit bottom until the summer of 1982.
But in 1982 the golden age of American stock and bond markets began. For nearly two decades, both were usually good places to invest, and the United States economy did well. But the technology stock bubble's bursting in 2000 signaled an end to an era in the stock market. A share of Fidelity Magellan -- one of the most successful mutual funds of the 1980s and 1990s -- is now worth less than a share was worth 13 years ago.
As 2012 ends, pessimism is high. Some economists talk of a prolonged period without economic growth in the industrialized world, as the United States and Europe fail to compete with China and India. Investors find a bond guaranteed to lose value -- but not to lose all value -- to be worth buying.
It is no wonder that major corporations now are issuing long-term bonds even though they don't appear to have any need for the money. As economic growth picks up in coming years, those companies will appear to have been prescient. The buyers, on the other hand, will seem to have been as foolish as were those who disdained bonds 30 years ago.

Full text:   It was 15 years ago that Ted Turner needed something interesting to say in a speech -- and decided, in a rush, to give away $1 billion.
"I was on my way to New York to make the speech," Turner recalled to me. "I just thought, what am I going to say?"
So, in front of a stunned dinner audience, he announced a $1 billion gift to United Nations causes such as fighting global poverty.
In nominal terms, before adjusting for inflation, that semiaccidental donation was, at the time, believed to be the biggest single gift ever made, and it has helped transform philanthropy.
Tycoons used to compete for their place on the Forbes and Fortune lists of wealthiest people. If they did give back, it was often late in life and involved museums or the arts. They spent far more philanthropic dollars on oil paintings of women than on improving the lives of real women.
Turner's gift helped change that culture, reviving the tradition of great philanthropists like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Turner publicly began needling other billionaires -- including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett -- to be more generous. That was a breach of etiquette, but it worked.
"It's a starting point for me of this modern era of high-profile big public giving," reflected Matthew Bishop, co-author of "Philanthrocapitalism," a terrific book about how the business world is reshaping philanthropy. "He called on others to step up, which did have a crystallizing effect on others. It allowed journalists and others who were talking to Bill Gates to say: 'Why aren't you giving more?' " Then they tormented Buffett with the same question.
Ultimately, Gates and Buffett made huge contributions that are transforming the struggle against global disease and poverty. My hunch is that Gates will be remembered less for his work on personal computers than for his accomplishments against malaria, AIDS and poverty itself.
Gates and Buffett are both now recruiters for the Giving Pledge, which commits zillionaires to give away at least half their wealth. The giving pledge adds to the expectation that those who have won the global jackpot should give something back.
Turner channeled his money through the United Nations Foundation, where it was leveraged to get other contributions so as to bring $2 billion to finance causes from malaria to polio, from climate change to family planning.
The gift brought new respect to the United Nations and made it increasingly fashionable for billionaires to worry about global poverty. These tycoons bring not just their checkbooks to the table but also a business sensibility that introduces greater rigor and evaluation to the world of bleeding hearts.
All this has helped shine a greater spotlight on neglected issues -- which, in turn, has led to extraordinary results. A study this month reported that infant mortality around the world dropped by more than half from 1990 to 2010. That's millions of lives saved each year.
Of course, not everybody has gotten the memo. Take Donald Trump, who has contributed his name to a foundation but little more. An investigation by The Smoking Gun Web site described him as possibly "the least charitable billionaire in the United States," for he apparently gave the foundation just $3.7 million -- over 20 years. Trump, who has said he is worth $7 billion, is not even the largest contributor to his own foundation.
(A spokesman for Trump suggested that it would be "totally incorrect" to characterize him as uncharitable, saying that he has also donated land in upstate New York for public parks and "millions of dollars" to other causes.)
Turner isn't shy about encouraging others to jump on board. When I asked if he had any advice for my readers, he grew particularly animated: "You don't have to have any money to make a difference; you can pick up trash walking down the street, and I do that all the time," he said. "You can volunteer your time. You can be a big brother or a big sister."
Look, it makes me a little squeamish to extol a billionaire, for our society already has too much worship of the wealthy -- and, in any case, the working poor in America are often more generous in percentage terms (and in volunteering) than those far better off.
That said, it warms my heart that a mogul donated $1 billion to enliven a speech, didn't even put his name on the foundation and then let the money quietly save lives around the world.
If you're still reading, Donald Trump, it's your move.

Full text:   Anyone who has seen "On the Waterfront" knows East Coast longshoremen can be a tough bunch.
The dockworkers are flexing their muscles again, threatening a strike beginning Sunday that would shut seaports from Massachusetts to Texas. It would be the first such coastwide strike since a two-month walkout in 1977 paralyzed the flow of tens of billions of dollars of imports -- and the nation's retailers and other businesses fear a painful replay if the 14,500 dockworkers make good on their threats.
"Unless something miraculous happens, I think we're looking at a strike," said Kevin M. Burke, president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, which represents an industry that imports $72 billion in dresses, shoes and other goods each year through the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports facing a possible shutdown.
"Our companies are preparing for the worst," Mr. Burke said, "but hoping for the best."
The strike threat has so alarmed corporate America that more than 100 business groups wrote to President Obama last week to urge him to intervene to push the two sides to settle -- and, if need be, to invoke his emergency powers under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to bar a strike. President George W. Bush invoked the act in 2002 to end a lockout at ports on the West Coast, where a different union represents dockworkers.
Despite their small numbers, the East Coast dockworkers have outsize influence. Many of them, like the crane operators who transfer containers from ships to the docks, are highly skilled and cannot be easily replaced. And because they control the loading and unloading of goods in most of the nation's ports, a strike could cause extensive economic damage at a time when the economy is already weak.
"They're in a crucial place in the flow of goods," said Richard W. Hurd, an industrial relations professor at Cornell University.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimates that a strike would cost the region $136 million a week in personal income and $110 million in economic output.
The dockworkers union, the International Longshoremen's Association, opposes presidential intervention, and labor specialists say Mr. Obama, like previous union-friendly Democrats, may be reluctant to enjoin a strike. On the other hand, the economy already faces a potential blow from tax increases and federal budget cuts scheduled to begin on Jan. 1, and a strike would cause further damage.
"The last thing the nation needs right now is a strike that would shut down the East Coast and Gulf Coast ports," said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation's vice president for supply chain policy. "This will have a huge ripple effect throughout the economy."
The 14 ports threatened with a strike -- including Boston; New York-New Jersey; Baltimore; Charleston, S.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Miami; and Houston -- handled 110 million tons of cargo last year.
The contract negotiations, which have continued fitfully for nine months, broke off on Dec. 18. At the behest of a federal mediator, the two sides are planning to resume talks this week to try to reach a deal before the deadline of 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
Although several issues need to be resolved, the two sides are deadlocked over one point in particular. The United States Maritime Alliance, an association of shipping companies and terminal owners, is demanding concessions on "container royalty payments," which the companies share with union members for each ton of cargo handled. The companies want to freeze those payments for current longshoremen and eliminate them for future hires.
The maritime alliance, known as USMX, says it paid $211 million in container royalties to the longshoremen last year, averaging $15,500 per eligible worker. James A. Capo, the alliance's chairman, said that came to $10 an hour, on top of what he said were already generous wages.
"This issue seems to have dwarfed anything else," Mr. Capo said. "All it does is make the union more uncompetitive than it already is."
The alliance says that, including the royalties, the longshoremen earn $124,000 a year on average in wages and benefits. Union officials say those figures are misleading and put average annual wages at $75,000 before benefits -- still far more than most union members earn.
The container payments were created in the 1960s to compensate the longshoremen as ports embraced automation and the use of standardized, 40-foot-long containers to ship goods. That caused a big decrease in jobs and working hours. Employment of longshoremen in the Port of New York and New Jersey has dropped to 3,500 from 35,000 in the 1960s.
The shipping companies see the royalty payments as a relic of decades past, while the union still sees them as a core part of wages and as an important way to share productivity gains with members.
The dockworkers union is digging in on the issue.
"We have repeatedly asked them to leave this item alone," said Harold J. Daggett, the union's president.
Last week, a federal mediator asked the two sides to extend their contract until Feb. 1. But Mr. Daggett ruled out an extension unless USMX dropped its demands on the royalty payments.
The union has also complained about other demands the alliance is making for a proposed six-year contract, including delayed contributions to the union's health care fund and annual raises that are below inflation.
Notwithstanding its historical reputation, Mr. Daggett's union has grown tamer since its 1977 walkout. Federal prosecutors have cleaned out much of the organized crime influence in a union long considered one of the most mob-infested. But after decades of labor peace, the elements for a huge confrontation are in place. Mr. Daggett vowed to stand up to employers when he took the union's helm last year.
At the same time, the maritime alliance is taking its toughest bargaining stance in years. It sees an important opportunity for increased business in East Coast ports now that the Panama Canal is being widened. The alliance says high labor costs will hurt East Coast ports when Asian companies like Toyota and Samsung are deciding which coast to use for deliveries.
Mr. Capo also voiced fears of losing business to less expensive East Coast ports like Jacksonville, Fla.
"The I.L.A. faces some tremendous nonunion, non-I.L.A. competition, particularly in the South and the gulf," he said. "With these kinds of wages, they can't survive in an open market."
Dorothy Sue Cobble, a labor relations professor at Rutgers, said the maritime alliance's push to cut labor costs was an example of increased assertiveness among employers at a time when unemployment remains high and many unions are struggling.
"A lot of employers feel it's a good time to demand and receive givebacks," she said.
East Coast and West Coast dockworkers have separate unions. The West Coast association, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, is known for being leftist and active in politics. It supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, and on Nov. 27, the union's clerical workers, worried that some jobs were being outsourced, began an eight-day strike that crippled the nation's two busiest ports, Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif.
Business groups said the 11-day lockout that closed 29 West Coast ports in 2002 cost the nation's economy $1 billion a day until President Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act and ordered the ports reopened.

Full text:   Back in the 1950s three social psychologists joined a cult that was predicting the imminent end of the world. Their purpose was to observe the cultists' response when the world did not, in fact, end on schedule. What they discovered, and described in their classic book, "When Prophecy Fails," is that the irrefutable failure of a prophecy does not cause true believers -- people who have committed themselves to a belief both emotionally and by their life choices -- to reconsider. On the contrary, they become even more fervent, and proselytize even harder.
This insight seems highly relevant as 2012 draws to a close. After all, a lot of people came to believe that we were on the brink of catastrophe -- and these views were given extraordinary reach by the mass media. As it turned out, of course, the predicted catastrophe failed to materialize. But we can be sure that the cultists won't admit to having been wrong. No, the people who told us that a fiscal crisis was imminent will just keep at it, more convinced than ever.
Oh, wait a second -- did you think I was talking about the Mayan calendar thing?
Seriously, at every stage of our ongoing economic crisis -- and in particular, every time anyone has suggested actually trying to do something about mass unemployment -- a chorus of voices has warned that unless we bring down budget deficits now now now, financial markets will turn on America, driving interest rates sky-high. And these prophecies of doom have had a powerful effect on our economic discourse.
Thus, back in May 2009 the Wall Street Journal editorial page seized on an uptick in long-term interest rates to declare that the "bond vigilantes," the "disciplinarians of U.S. policy makers," had arrived, and would push rates inexorably higher if big budget deficits continued. As it happened, rates soon went back down. But that didn't stop The Journal's news section from rolling out the same story the next time rates rose: "Debt fears send rates up," blared a headline in March 2010; the debt continued to grow, but the rates went down again.
At this point the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond is less than half what it was when that 2009 editorial was published. But don't expect any rethinking on The Journal's part.
Now, you could say that The Journal's editors didn't give a specific date for the fiscal apocalypse, although I doubt that any of their readers imagined that they were talking about an event at least three years and seven months in the future.
In any case, some of the most prominent deficit scolds have indeed been willing to talk about dates, or at least time horizons. In early 2011 Erskine Bowles confidently declared that we would face a fiscal crisis within around two years unless something like the Bowles-Simpson deficit plan was enacted, and Alan Simpson chimed in to say that it would be less than two years. I guess he has about 10 weeks left. But again, don't expect either Mr. Simpson or Mr. Bowles to admit that there might have been something fundamentally wrong with their analysis.
No, very few of the prophets of fiscal doom have acknowledged the failure of their prophecies to come true so far. And those who have admitted surprise seem more annoyed than chastened. For example, back in 2010 Alan Greenspan -- who is, for some reason, still treated as an authority figure -- conceded that despite large budget deficits, "inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued." But he went on to declare, "This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency." How dare reality not validate my fears!
Regular readers know that I and other economists argued from the beginning that these dire warnings of fiscal catastrophe were all wrong, that budget deficits won't cause soaring interest rates as long as the economy is depressed -- and that the biggest risk to the economy is that we might try to slash the deficit too soon. And surely that point of view has been strongly validated by events.
The key thing we need to understand, however, is that the prophets of fiscal disaster, no matter how respectable they may seem, are at this point effectively members of a doomsday cult. They are emotionally and professionally committed to the belief that fiscal crisis lurks just around the corner, and they will hold to their belief no matter how many corners we turn without encountering that crisis.
So we cannot and will not persuade these people to reconsider their views in the light of the evidence. All we can do is stop paying attention. It's going to be difficult, because many members of the deficit cult seem highly respectable. But they've been hugely, absurdly wrong for years on end, and it's time to stop taking them seriously.

Full text:   WHEN thinking about the state of the Republican Party, I defer to a point that the Democratic consultant James Carville made the other day: "When I hear people talking about the troubled state of today's Republican Party, it calls to mind something Lester Maddox said one time back when he was governor of Georgia. He said the problem with Georgia prisons was 'the quality of the inmates.' The problem with the Republican Party is the quality of the people who vote in their primaries and caucuses. Everybody says they need a better candidate, or they need a better message but -- in my opinion -- the Republicans have an inmate problem." The political obsessions of the Republican base -- from denying global warming to defending assault weapons to opposing any tax increases under any conditions, to resisting any immigration reform -- are making it impossible to be a Republican moderate, said Carville. And without more Republican moderates, there is no way to strike the kind of centrist bargains that have been at the heart of American progress -- that got us where we are and are essential for where we need to go.
Republican politicians today have a choice: either change your base by educating and leading G.O.P. voters back to the center-right from the far right, or start a new party that is more inclusive, focused on smaller but smarter government and market-based, fact-based solutions to our biggest problems.
But if Republicans continue to be led around by, and live in fear of, a base that denies global warming after Hurricane Sandy and refuses to ban assault weapons after Sandy Hook -- a base that would rather see every American's taxes rise rather than increase taxes on millionaires -- the party has no future. It can't win with a base that is at war with math, physics, human biology, economics and common-sense gun laws all at the same time.
Do you know how troubled this party is? Two weeks ago, the former G.O.P. Senate majority leader Bob Dole, a great American, went to the Senate floor in his wheelchair to show his support for Senate ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of People With Disabilities. Nevertheless, the bill failed to win the two-thirds needed for ratification, because only eight Republicans dared to join Democrats in support of the treaty, which was negotiated and signed by George W. Bush! It essentially requires other countries to improve to our level of protection for the disabled, without requiring us to change any laws. It has already been ratified by 126 countries. But it failed in the Senate because Rick Santorum managed to convince the G.O.P. base that the treaty would threaten U.S. "sovereignty." Santorum stopped just short of warning that space aliens would take over our country if we ratified the treaty.
Because they control the House, this radical Republican base is now holding us all back. President Obama was moving to the center in these budget negotiations. He reduced his demand for higher tax revenues to $1.2 trillion from $1.6 trillion; he upped the level at which Americans who would be hit with higher taxes to those earning $400,000 a year from $250,000; and he made his own base holler by offering to cut long-term spending by lowering the inflation adjustment index for Social Security. It seemed that with a little more Republican compromise, Obama would have met them in the middle, and we could have had a grand bargain that would put the country on a sounder fiscal trajectory and signal to the markets, the world and ourselves that we can still do big hard things together. That will have to wait. Now the best hope is some mini-, crisis-averting, Band-Aid.
The G.O.P. today needs its own D.L.C. The Democratic Leadership Council was founded by a group of Democratic governors and activists, led by Bill Clinton, in 1985 to lead the party back to the center from a failing leftward course that had resulted in it being repeatedly shut out of the presidency, except after Watergate. I asked Clinton's pollster, Stan Greenberg, what Republicans could learn from the Clinton/D.L.C. experience.
"There is a lot of pain," said Greenberg. "You can't change the party without pain. You can't just make some head-fakes to Hispanics." The D.L.C., he noted, started by building an organization over 10 years and by running more centrist Democrats "in the primaries." It didn't just wait to pivot to the center in the general election. It fought for and educated the Democrat base in the primaries, by D.L.C. candidates running in support of free trade, Nafta and welfare reform. "With Clinton, we won the primaries in a way that defined us, so that he could run in the general election as the candidate of broad appeal." That fractured the party and produced Ralph Nader, which cost Al Gore the 2000 election. But after losing that election, said Greenberg, the Democrats came together around a moderate-left core and did not engage "in dysfunctional primaries."
Republicans need to go through a similar process of building new institutions and coalitions to support candidates who can move the party back to the center-right. Today, all their institutions, from think tanks to Fox TV, said Greenberg, "are reinforcing the trends that are marginalizing their party."
Unfortunately, we don't have a decade to wait for a G.O.P. D.L.C. Some leaders in that party need to stand up for sane compromises right now.

Abstract: Because Mr. Boehner and members of his party couldn't bring themselves to accept even a modest rise in taxes. Yet earlier this week progressives suddenly had the sinking feeling that it was 2011 all over again, as the Obama administration made a budget offer that, while far better than the disastrous deal it was willing to make the last time around, still involved giving way on issues where it had promised to hold the line -- perpetuating a substantial portion of the high-income Bush tax cuts, effectively cutting Social Security benefits by changing the inflation adjustment.

Full text:   A few years back, there was a boom in poker television -- shows in which you got to watch the betting and bluffing of expert card players. Since then, however, viewers seem to have lost interest. But I have a suggestion: Instead of featuring poker experts, why not have a show featuring poker incompetents -- people who fold when they have a strong hand or don't know how to quit while they're ahead?
On second thought, that show already exists. It's called budget negotiations, and it's now in its second episode.
The first episode ran in 2011, as President Obama made his first attempt to cut a long-run fiscal deal -- a so-called Grand Bargain -- with John Boehner, the speaker of the House. Mr. Obama was holding a fairly weak hand, after a midterm election in which Democrats took a beating. Nonetheless, the concessions he offered were breathtaking: He was willing to accept huge spending cuts, not to mention a rise in the Medicare eligibility age, in return for a vague promise of higher revenue without any increase in tax rates.
This deal, if implemented, would have been a huge victory for Republicans, deeply damaging both programs dear to Democrats and the Democratic political brand. But it never happened. Why? Because Mr. Boehner and members of his party couldn't bring themselves to accept even a modest rise in taxes. And their intransigence saved Mr. Obama from himself.
Now the game is on again -- but with Mr. Obama holding a far stronger hand. He and his party won a solid victory in this year's election. And the legislative clock is very much in their favor, too. All the Bush tax cuts are scheduled to expire at the end of the month.
A brief digression: I've become aware of a new effort by the G.O.P. to bully reporters into referring only to the "Bush-era" tax cuts, probably in the hope of dissociating those cuts, which they want to preserve, from a president voters now regard with disdain. But George W. Bush and his administration devised those cuts and rammed them through Congress, and it's deceptive to suggest otherwise.
Back to the poker game: The president doesn't hold all the cards -- there are some things he and fellow Democrats want, like extended unemployment benefits and infrastructure spending, that they can't get without some Republican cooperation. But he is in a very strong position.
Yet earlier this week progressives suddenly had the sinking feeling that it was 2011 all over again, as the Obama administration made a budget offer that, while far better than the disastrous deal it was willing to make the last time around, still involved giving way on issues where it had promised to hold the line -- perpetuating a substantial portion of the high-income Bush tax cuts, effectively cutting Social Security benefits by changing the inflation adjustment.
And this was an offer, not a deal. Are we about to see another round of the president negotiating with himself, snatching policy and political defeat from the jaws of victory?
Well, probably not. Once again, the Republican crazies -- the people who can't accept the idea of ever voting to raise taxes on the wealthy, never mind either fiscal or economic reality -- have saved the day.
We don't know exactly why Mr. Boehner didn't respond to the president's offer with a real counteroffer and instead offered something ludicrous -- a "Plan B" that, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, would actually raise taxes for a number of lower- and middle-income families, while cutting taxes for almost half of those in the top 1 percent. The effect, however, has to have been to disabuse the Obama team of any illusions that they were engaged in good-faith negotiations.
Mr. Boehner had evident problems getting his caucus to support Plan B, and he took the plan off the table Thursday night; it would have modestly raised taxes on the really wealthy, the top 0.1 percent, and even that was too much for many Republicans. This means that any real deal with Mr. Obama would be met with mass G.O.P. defections; so any such deal would require overwhelming Democratic support, a fact that empowers progressives ready to bolt if they think the president is giving away too much.
As in 2011, then, the Republican crazies are doing Mr. Obama a favor, heading off any temptation he may have felt to give away the store in pursuit of bipartisan dreams.
And there's a broader lesson here. This is no time for a Grand Bargain, because the Republican Party, as now constituted, is just not an entity with which the president can make a serious deal. If we're going to get a grip on our nation's problems -- of which the budget deficit is a minor part -- the power of the G.O.P.'s extremists, and their willingness to hold the economy hostage if they don't get their way, needs to be broken. And somehow I don't think that's going to happen in the next few days.

Full text:   "Under a paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher spending and, hence, positive inflation."
-- Ben Bernanke, 2002
Now we may find out if Mr. Bernanke was right. Japan appears to be ready to do whatever it takes to end its long run of falling prices. The Bank of Japan took limited action on Thursday, and more is expected in the new year.
Mr. Bernanke, then a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and now its chairman, gave the speech quoted above at a time when the American economy was stumbling along in a slow recovery and prices, at least as measured by the Consumer Price Index, were declining.
He was arguing that the Fed would not be out of ammunition if it cut nominal interest rates to zero and the economy failed to respond. He has since proved he was right about that. In the speech, he made a passing reference to a phrase used by Milton Friedman, about using a "helicopter drop" of money to fight inflation, which eventually earned him the nickname "Helicopter Ben" from conservatives scandalized by his aggressive action after the financial crisis began.
For two decades, Japan has provided stark evidence that chronic deflation is possible in a modern economy. Prices have fallen steadily despite extraordinarily low interest rates. The economy has stagnated.
This week the Liberal Democratic Party, which had ruled Japan for nearly its entire postwar history until it was swept from power three years ago, won a landslide victory. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister from 2006 to 2007, will get another chance.
Mr. Abe devoted a decent part of his campaign to criticism of the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank. He wants the bank to pursue inflation, and to effectively print money until it gets it. At one point during the campaign he spoke of a 3 percent inflation target, although he seems to have cut that back to 2 percent.
Either goal, if realized, would be a major change for the country. The inflation index used in calculations of gross domestic product is now 18 percent lower than it was at the end of 1994.
On Thursday, the central bank took a relatively small step in the direction favored by Mr. Abe. It decided to step up its asset purchases and seemed to leave open the possibility that it would adopt the inflation target at a later meeting. Mr. Abe praised the move.
To a significant extent, deflationary expectations are now baked into the Japanese economy. Tiny government bond yields have persisted for many years. Even though the nominal yields are small, the real (after inflation) yields have been respectable because there has been deflation, not inflation. And the competition has not been that great. The stock market has fluctuated, but it remains far below where it was when the Japanese bubble began to deflate in the early 1990s. Real estate losses from that bubble -- do you remember when the gardens of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were supposed to be worth more than the entire state of California? -- still have an impact on investor psychology.
Western economists, Mr. Bernanke among them, have long called for Japan to target inflation. Lately, some Chinese economists have been offering similar lectures. But until now, little has happened. The central bank has announced a goal of positive inflation of up to 1 percent, but it is not widely believed, and it has certainly not happened.
As it is, the limited quantitative easing efforts of the Japanese central bank have been viewed as temporary, and as not really changing anything. Whether the new promises of something more significant will be credible remains to be seen.
"At this point, moving to a 2 percent target would not be such a giant step," said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who has suggested inflation targeting in the United States as well as in Japan. "They have to pursue it vigorously until we have inflation expectations firmly higher. No one knows how much they would have to do to accomplish that."
The Bank of Japan has in the past been hesitant to really try to establish that credibility, for at least two reasons. One is that there is fear that the Japanese government bond market would be disrupted. Another is that it could do severe damage to the central bank's own balance sheet. It owns a lot of Japanese government bonds whose market value would fall. Conceivably, that could cause the bank to seek a recapitalization from the government, something that would be embarrassing, to say the least.
To establish the credibility, the central bank would have to show a readiness to create credit at a rapid rate. It would probably also need to take steps to hold down the value of the yen, a move that would no doubt cause concern in the United States.
It is, however, very doable, as Switzerland has shown. When the euro zone debt crisis was at its worst, Switzerland became a safe haven for European investors worried that the euro might blow up. That drove up the value of the Swiss franc versus the euro and damaged Switzerland's ability to compete. The Swiss government responded by announcing that the euro would not be allowed to fall below 1.2 Swiss francs. If necessary, the government would simply sell francs to meet any demand.
That has been necessary, and the Swiss have accumulated a huge portfolio of foreign currency. So, too, could the Japanese if they chose to announce that the dollar would henceforth be worth at least 100 yen, a level not seen since 2009.
Doing so would instantly restore at least some competitiveness to Japanese industry, which has experienced something that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago: Japan has a trade deficit.
Bringing inflation to Japan could make the country's debt load -- now higher than that of any other major country -- appear more manageable. One unfortunate result of deflation coupled with perennial recession is that a country's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio rises even if no more money is borrowed. Measured in yen, the Japanese economy was larger when Mr. Abe left office in 2007 -- two years before his party lost power -- than it is now.
A stronger recovery in the United States, not to mention avoiding a new Europe-wide downturn, would make it easier for Japan to begin to grow again. But even if that did happen, it would not solve all of Japan's problems. The country has an aging, shrinking population. It needs more workers, but the Japanese attitude toward immigration makes Arizona look liberal by comparison.
Japan's economy has been adrift for so long that much of the world takes for granted that it cannot, or at least will not, ever be reformed. Such cynicism has a basis, but it is possible that circumstances have changed. Japanese who seemed content with the way things were now clearly want something different, even if they are not sure what, or how to get it.
Three years ago, the Democratic Party of Japan won a landslide election, only to prove stumbling and incoherent when it tried to govern. Now the voters have turned back to the Liberal Democrats. Whether Mr. Abe will be more competent, and whether he will be able to effectively lead a party that still has competing factions, is far from clear.
Still, investors are taking heart. Japanese stocks leapt on the news of the election results, while the yen weakened. For now, at least, there is reason to hope that something important was changed by this election.

Abstract: Higher prices would be based on what dairy farm production costs were in 1949, when milk production was almost all done by hand. Because of adjustments for inflation and other technical formulas, the government would be forced by law to buy milk at roughly twice the current market prices to maintain a stable milk market.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Forget the fiscal crisis and the automatic budget cuts. Come Jan. 1, there is a threat that milk prices could rise to $6 to $8 a gallon if Congress does not pass a new farm bill that amends farm policy dating back to the Truman presidency.
Lost in the political standoff between the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans over the budget is a virtually forgotten impasse over a farm bill that covers billions of dollars in agriculture programs. Without last-minute Congressional action, the government would have to follow an antiquated 1949 farm law that would force Washington to buy milk at wildly inflated prices, creating higher prices in the dairy case. Milk now costs an average of $3.65 a gallon.
Higher prices would be based on what dairy farm production costs were in 1949, when milk production was almost all done by hand. Because of adjustments for inflation and other technical formulas, the government would be forced by law to buy milk at roughly twice the current market prices to maintain a stable milk market.
But the market would be anything but stable. Farmers, at first, would experience a financial windfall as they rushed to sell dairy products to the government at higher prices than those they would get on the commercial market. Then the prices customers pay at the supermarket would surge as shortages developed and fewer gallons of milk were available for consumers and for manufacturers of products like cheese and butter.
For dairy farmers like Dean Norton in upstate New York, who are struggling with high feed costs caused by this summer's drought, a jump in prices would be welcomed.
"But it would be short-term euphoria followed by a long hangover that would be difficult for us to recover from," said Mr. Norton, who is president of the New York Farm Bureau. "I don't think customers and food processors are going to pay double what they are paying now for dairy products."
The Senate passed a farm bill in July. A House version of the bill made it out of committee, but House leaders have yet to bring its version to the floor.
Under the current program, the government sets a minimum price to cover dairy farmers' production costs. If the market price drops below that, the government buys dairy products from farmers to buoy prices and increase demand. Since milk prices have remained above that minimum price in recent years, dairy farmers usually do better by selling their products commercially rather than to the government.
But if 1949 rules go into effect, the government would be required to buy dairy products at around $40 per hundredweight -- roughly twice the current market price -- to drive up the price of milk to cover dairy producers' cost.
"It would be bad for consumer demand in the long run," said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents more than 32,000 dairy farmers.
Mr. Galen and others in the dairy industry said reverting to 1949 policies could probably force the makers of butter, cheese, yogurt and other dairy products to look for cheaper alternatives, like imported milk from countries like New Zealand.
Most dairy companies declined to discuss plans to buy dairy supplies from abroad if they are forced to pay higher prices for milk.
But Land O' Lakes, a dairy company based in Arden Hills, Minn., said the 1949 law could be potentially disruptive for dairy industry operations.
"Congress needs to pass a comprehensive farm bill that helps farmers continue to feed the world, keeps food prices affordable and provides farmers some financial stability in the very unpredictable profession of farming," said Rebecca Lentz, a company spokeswoman.
In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said the department was exploring all its options to deal with the possibility of the 1949 law going into effect.
"We will do whatever we are legally obligated to do," said Mr. Vilsack, who declined to say what specific steps the department would take to prepare for what dairy lobbyists and industry officials are calling the "milk cliff."
Among the options: the agriculture secretary could drag his heels on the milk purchases until Congress passes a new farm bill or an extension of the 2008 one that expired in September, said Vincent Smith, a professor of agriculture at Montana State University in Bozeman.
"This is a totally antiquated law that has nothing to do with farming conditions today," Professor Smith said. "It was put as a poison pill to get Congress to pass a farm bill by scaring lawmakers with the prospect of higher support prices for milk and other agriculture products. Letting it go into effect for even a few months would be particularly disastrous for consumers and food processors. "

Obama and Boehner Diverge Sharply on Fiscal Plan

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Hopes for a broad deficit-reduction agreement faded on Wednesday as President Obama insisted he had offered Republicans "a fair deal" while Speaker John A. Boehner moved for a House vote as early as Thursday on a scaled-down plan to limit tax increases to yearly incomes of $1 million and up, despite Senate opposition and Mr. Obama's veto threat.
The impasse was clear as Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner separately spoke to the television cameras instead of each other, after a weekend of private negotiations amid grieving over the shootings in Newtown, Conn., had narrowed their differences enough to raise optimism about a far-reaching deal to stabilize the nation's debt.
First Mr. Obama and then Mr. Boehner faulted the other side for the impasse, and ultimately the failure, if a year-end deal could not be reached to stop automatic tax increases and the indiscriminate spending cuts in military and domestic programs known as the "sequester." The president, saying he had gone "at least halfway" toward Republicans' demands, evoked Hurricane Sandy and the Newtown school massacre to prod lawmakers to compromise for the nation's benefit.
"When you think about what we've gone through over the last couple months -- a devastating hurricane, and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory -- the country deserves us to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good," he said during an appearance at the White House to discuss gun control.
"Frankly, up until a couple days ago if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner were in a position to say, 'We've gotten a fair deal,' " the president said.
About two hours later at the Capitol, Mr. Boehner delivered a surprisingly brief but sharp retort to Mr. Obama, after which he took no questions from reporters. He started by saying that on Thursday, the House would pass the fallback bill that he has called his Plan B, which would extend the Bush-era tax cuts, which would otherwise expire on Dec. 31, for all incomes up to $1 million -- although later his leadership team was scrambling for votes.
"Then the president will have a decision to make," he said. "He can call upon Senate Democrats to pass that bill, or he can be responsible for the largest tax increase in American history."
The Boehner bill does hold tax benefits for those with a yearly income above $1 million. It would repeal two Clinton-era tax provisions that limit the personal exemptions and deductions that wealthy taxpayers can claim; extend the lower tax rates on inherited estates rather than allow them to revert to the pre-Bush administration level; and set a 20 percent tax rate for the dividends and capital gains of households earning at least $1 million a year.
The speaker's package would raise about $300 billion in additional revenue over 10 years, compared with extending the Bush tax rates for all income, as Republicans long espoused. That is about $500 billion less than Mr. Boehner's original offer for $800 billion. It is about $700 billion less than would be collected under Mr. Obama's proposal to extend the Bush rates only for incomes below a $250,000 threshold for couples, and $200,000 for individuals. In the talks with Mr. Boehner, he moved that line to $400,000.
Mr. Boehner's statement suggested confidence that Republican leaders would have the votes to pass his plan. But lawmakers who were counting votes for the leadership said the tally was short, and House leaders were adding provisions to the speaker's bill to mollify dissidents.
Some Republicans, for example, objected that the plan would do nothing to prevent the automatic military cuts, about $50 billion, from taking effect in January. To satisfy Republican hawks, leaders will hold a separate vote on legislation, nearly identical to a bill passed earlier this year, that would cancel those cuts and instead shift them to domestic programs, a decision likely to amplify Democratic opposition.
Even if the House Republican majority passes the speaker's measure, it probably faces doom in the Democratic-controlled Senate, making Mr. Obama's threatened veto moot. Mr. Boehner's office has countered that Congressional Democratic leaders in 2011 had supported a $1 million threshold for higher tax rates. Democrats said those proposals were largely intended to show that Republicans would not raise taxes even for millionaires.
While Mr. Boehner scrambled to unify his party, Mr. Obama faced unrest as well from liberals who said he had broken a campaign pledge to keep Social Security out of the deficit-reduction talks. Mr. Obama had given tentative support to Republicans' demand that the government adopt a new inflation formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments for federal benefits. The new formula would slightly reduce the growth in Social Security benefits from what it would be under the current inflation index.
Recalling his campaign, Mr. Obama countered, "What I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases. That's exactly what I have put forward. What I have said is, in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things, some things that some Democrats don't want to see, and probably there are a few Republicans who don't want to see them either."
The president said he would continue to have discussions with Mr. Boehner and others. But on Wednesday, even the chief staff negotiators for the two leaders were not speaking.
In trying to line up votes, Republican leaders circulated word that the longtime antitax advocate Grover Norquist had blessed Mr. Boehner's plan as compliant with his "Taxpayer Protection Pledge." Because most Republican candidates sign the pledge not to approve any tax increase, Mr. Norquist effectively has long locked in their votes.
But Mr. Norquist seemed to bend his principles to issue the endorsement, perhaps to maintain his relevance in tax debates. Even senior Republicans lately have denounced Mr. Norquist as a deterrent to resolving the nation's fiscal problems, given increasing bipartisan agreement that higher tax revenues are required to control debt growth.
Even so, the Club for Growth, a conservative group, said on Wednesday that it considered even Mr. Boehner's scaled-back plan a tax increase bill and that it might work to defeat Republican lawmakers who voted for it.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- President Obama delivered to Speaker John A. Boehner a new offer on Monday to resolve the pending fiscal crisis, a deal that would raise revenues by $1.2 trillion over the next decade but keep in place the Bush-era tax rates for any household with earnings below $400,000.
The offer is close to a plan proposed by the speaker on Friday, and both sides expressed confidence that they were closing in on a major deficit-reduction plan that could be passed well before January, when more than a half-trillion dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts would kick in.
Senior Republican aides said the speaker was to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday morning to discuss the state of negotiations. But they cautioned that obstacles remained.
"Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction," said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. "We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem."
The two sides are now dickering over price, not philosophical differences, and the numbers are very close.
Mr. Boehner had offered the president a deficit framework that would raise $1 trillion over 10 years, with the details to be settled next year by Congress's tax-writing committees and the Obama administration. In response, Mr. Obama reduced his proposal to $1.2 trillion from $1.4 trillion on Monday at a 45-minute meeting with the speaker at the White House. That was down from $1.6 trillion initially.
The White House plan would permanently extend Bush-era tax cuts on household incomes below $400,000, meaning that only the top tax bracket, 35 percent, would increase to 39.6 percent. The current cutoff between the top rate and the next highest rate, 33 percent, is $388,350.
On spending, the two sides are also converging.
The White House says the president's plan would cut spending by $1.22 trillion over 10 years, compared with $1.2 trillion in cuts from the Republicans' initial offer. Of that, $800 billion is cuts to programs, and $122 billion comes from adopting a new measure of inflation that slows the growth of government benefits, especially Social Security. The White House is also counting on $290 billion in savings from lower interest costs on a reduced national debt.
Of the $800 billion in straight cuts, the president said half would come from federal health care programs; $200 billion from other so-called mandatory programs, like farm price supports, not subject to Congress's annual spending bills; $100 billion from military spending; and $100 billion from domestic programs under Congress's annual discretion.
To make all this happen, Mr. Obama proposed fast-track procedures to help Congressional tax writers overhaul the individual and corporate tax code and make changes to other programs.
Senior Republican aides made it clear that differences remain. For instance, they say the president is still pressing for $1.3 trillion in higher taxes because the change in the way inflation is calculated would not only slow the growth of spending but also raise more revenue by slowing the rate at which tax brackets rise each year with the cost of living. That would mean that incomes would probably grow faster than the rise in tax brackets, pushing people more quickly into higher tax rates.
They also disagree with the president over counting lower interest payments on the national debt as savings.
"A proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced," said another spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel, using the Republicans' calculation for the president's offer.
The president is also insisting on some protections for what he has called the "most vulnerable populations," which Republican aides said they had not been expecting. The new inflation calculations, for instance, would probably not affect wounded veterans and disabled people on Supplemental Security Income.
And Mr. Obama is sticking by his request for additional upfront spending on infrastructure and an extension of expiring unemployment benefits.
He would also secure some tax and policy changes long sought by both parties but unattainable in the context of smaller budget deals. His proposal would permanently extend popular business tax breaks like the credit for corporate research and development, permanently stop the expansion of the alternative minimum tax so it does not affect more of the middle class, and stop a long-planned and deep cut to Medicare health providers, which Congress has never had the stomach to allow to kick in.
To keep the country from returning to fiscal showdowns, Mr. Obama wants the government's borrowing limit to rise high enough to take the issue off the table for two years, although he said that Congress could periodically weigh in and try to override a presidential lifting of the debt ceiling, should it want to.
Senior Republican aides made it clear on Monday night that the plan was not what the speaker had wanted. He had proposed higher income tax rates on income over $1 million. That revenue would be supplemented by reinstating a provision in the tax code -- phased out by the Bush-era tax cuts -- that automatically limits tax deductions and credits for the affluent. The speaker was also ready to accept a White House proposal from Mr. Obama's first days in office that would limit tax deductions to 28 percent, trimming back deductions for charitable giving and other activities from the top rate paid by the giver, 35 percent currently.

Full text:   TOKYO -- Shinzo Abe, set to return as Japan's prime minister after his party's landslide victory on Sunday, means it when he says he knows what it feels like to hit rock bottom. His last term in office was marred by political financing scandals, a nationalist agenda that seemed off the mark and rumors -- later confirmed -- that he had resigned over an intestinal ailment, an ignominious exit that prompted snide jokes about his condition.
Mr. Abe's impending comeback says more about the spectacular failure of the leaders who succeeded him than about a revival on his part. But Mr. Abe, 58, is in many ways a changed man. Though analysts say he remains deeply nationalistic at heart, he has toned down his hawkish language and instead has focused on reviving Japan's moribund economy.
It is still possible that China, which has been enmeshed in a territorial quarrel with Japan, could prompt Mr. Abe to show his nationalist colors. He said Monday that there would be no negotiation over Japan's claims to the set of islands in dispute, but he went no further than the incumbent Democrats, who have also asserted Japanese sovereignty over the islands.
So far, Mr. Abe has reserved his tough talk for the economy, promising public spending largess, a far more aggressive stand against deflation and bolder measures to weaken the strong yen, which has stifled Japan's export-led economy. He peppered his campaign speeches with promises to rebuild a strong country, emphasizing resilience against natural disasters and economic downturns, rather than dwelling on North Korean rockets or the Chinese Navy.
The economic focus helped Mr. Abe lead his party, the Liberal Democrats, to victory while sidestepping difficult issues like nuclear power. The Liberal Democrats promoted nuclear power during their half-century of almost uninterrupted leadership until the Democrats ousted them from power in 2009, less than two years before the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed more than 20,000 people and set off the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Markets have cheered on Mr. Abe's economic turn, and rallied on Monday after his party's decisive victory. The United States dollar reached as high as 84.48 yen on Monday, its highest level against the Japanese currency since April 2011. The Nikkei stock average, which surged 10 percent in the monthlong prelude to Sunday's elections in anticipation of Mr. Abe's economic policies, gained an additional 0.94 percent on Monday, rising to 9,828.88.
At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Abe said: "I once fell to rock bottom and was hit with a storm of criticism. Now, I want to prove it's possible to start over again."
Mr. Abe's first stint as prime minister, in 2006-7, began on a high note. The Japanese news media hailed him as the first prime minister born after World War II and the handpicked successor to a popular leader, Junichiro Koizumi.
But Mr. Abe made the mistake of focusing on a drive to instill patriotism in schools and elevate the military's status, an approach that appeared to be out of touch with a population more concerned about the state of the national pension system and other bread-and-butter issues. Mr. Abe quickly became an object of ridicule in the popular media, an embodiment of an expression popular at the time: "K.Y.," for "kuuki yomenai," which literally means "can't read the air," or "clueless."
Mr. Abe's cabinet was weakened by gaffes and a series of money and pension-related scandals that led four of his ministers to resign and a fifth to commit suicide. Overseas, he was criticized for denying that Japan's wartime army had forced women into sexual slavery, despite historical documents and testimony. The controversy prompted United States lawmakers to pass a bill calling for an apology. And 10 months into his term, Mr. Abe's governing party suffered a humiliating defeat in elections for Parliament's upper house; two months later, he was gone.
With upper house elections expected this summer, Mr. Abe is determined not to make the same mistakes, analysts say. He will be especially cautious, they say, because his mandate is not as rock solid as the Liberal Democrats' supermajority in the lower house might suggest. The party won just 40 percent of the vote in the country's electoral districts, but benefited from a splintering of the opposition. If the opposition regroups or the Liberal Democrats stumble, the tables could quickly turn against them.
"In the beginning, he will keep a moderate tone," said Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a professor of political science at Keio University in Tokyo. "He will avoid making waves by staying close to the United States. He knows he must focus on the economy first, for the upper house elections."
Mr. Abe's promise to go much further to tackle deflation is particularly significant, economists say, given years of halfway measures. He has already pressured the Bank of Japan to print more money, urging that the inflation target double to 2 percent, and threatening to change laws to give the government more power in setting the bank's policy goals.
He has made clear that the bank's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, known for his cautious stance on inflation, will be shown the door when his term ends in three months.
Mr. Abe has also said he will kick-start growth with spending on public works, a promise that has rallied support for the Liberal Democrats across Japan's depressed countryside. Mr. Abe said Monday that a high priority would be redrafting next year's budget so that it amounts to a total of 10 trillion yen, or $119 billion, to allocate more on reconstruction and disaster prevention.
But these expansionary policies scare some economists. The country's public debt has mushroomed to more than twice the size of its gross domestic product, making it the largest public debt in the industrialized world. A return to large public spending would undo recent efforts to rein in that debt, while too much inflation could drive up borrowing costs and cause investors to lose confidence in Japan's finances.
For others, the focus on public works represents a return to the pork-barrel politics of the 1990s, when the Liberal Democrats promised extensive projects in return for votes, and racked up huge public debt. In their recent campaigns, Liberal Democratic lawmakers across the country courted farming and construction industry lobbies with promises of public works spending.
New pork-barrel ties could threaten steps Mr. Abe says are needed to revitalize the economy: for example, free trade agreements to improve Japanese exporters' access to overseas markets and open up industries at home to more competition.
Analysts do not expect Mr. Abe to make any concerted push that would alienate farming and construction groups, which represent heavily insular industries opposed to any free trade pacts.
"Infrastructure projects are like a drug," said Takayoshi Igarashi, a political scientist at Hosei University in Tokyo and a former government adviser on public works. "Once you start, it's difficult to stop. But all the spending leads to more and more debt.
"And when you promise everyone favors, you are left with little scope to do anything else."

Abstract: To be more precise, over the last half-century, federal spending on average equaled 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product, while revenues averaged 17.9 percent. "The economy will, I think, go off a cliff," the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference last week.

Full text:   It takes only two lines to explain the federal government's financial situation. The first shows federal spending, measured as a share of the nation's economic output. The second shows federal revenues. And the space in between - that's the deficit.
To be more precise, over the last half-century, federal spending on average equaled 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product, while revenues averaged 17.9 percent.
As those figures suggest, the government almost always runs an annual deficit. Revenue has exceeded spending in just five of the last 50 years - in 1969 and from 1998 to 2001. The rest of the time, the government has borrowed some of the money that it needs. And the next year it borrowed even more, to cover the old debts and the new deficit. Every year the government runs a deficit increases the total amount of the federal debt.
Borrowing can be very good policy. It allows the government to provide Americans with a higher quality of life: more infrastructure, more services, more investment in the future. And as long as the economy continues to grow, the loans actually become easier to repay with time because doing so requires a smaller share of current revenue.
Inflation helps in the same way: more dollars to repay the same amount of debt.
Consider what happened after World War II. In 1946, the federal debt equaled 122 percent of the nation's annual economic output, the highest level on record. And over the next three decades, the amount the government owed almost exactly doubled.
As the accompanying chart shows, the government ran annual deficits in most of those years. But economic output, and inflation, rose even faster. By 1975, the federal debt was twice as large, but it equaled just 35 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
Or consider a person who makes $10,000 and buys a home with a mortgage that requires annual payments of $2,000. Over the following decade, the person gets a few raises and a new job. Add in some inflation, and the worker is now making $20,000. The mortgage debt, however, does not increase. The person still owes just $2,000 a year.
That's the sunny side, but deficits can cause problems too. Greater debt requires larger interest payments. Government borrowing can soak up money that might otherwise be available to businesses and consumers. The European debt crisis is a reminder that countries sometimes cannot borrow as much as they need.
And the federal government's needs are getting larger. The chart shows clearly that the gap between spending and revenue has yawned wider since the mid-1970s, save for that anomalous interlude in the late years of the Clinton administration.
In recent years, of course, the gap has grown even wider. The recession eroded revenues, and the government, seeking to stimulate the economy, increased spending.
Over the last five years, spending averaged 22.8 percent of the nation's annual economic output, revenues 16.3 percent.
What happens next? That is where the two charts diverge.
In the first situation, the government jumps from the so-called fiscal cliff. That has a certain appeal. As the chart shows, revenues would increase, spending would plunge, and the annual deficits would shrink. Economists, however, predict that the nation also would plunge back into recession. "The economy will, I think, go off a cliff," the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference last week.
In the second situation, the government makes almost no changes to current policy and annual deficits shrink slightly before expanding again. That, too, has an obvious benefit: it avoids an immediate dose of economic pain. But it leaves the larger issue unresolved. Annual deficits, and the debt, would continue to grow.
Both the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans would like to land somewhere in between: more revenues, yes, and less spending too, but not enough of either to eliminate deficits or undermine the economic recovery.
So far, they have not been able to agree where those lines should be.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   As you might imagine, I find myself in a lot of discussions about U.S. fiscal policy, and the budget deficit in particular. And there's one thing I can count on in these discussions: At some point someone will announce, in dire tones, that we have a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit.
No, I don't think the people making this pronouncement realize that they sound just like Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies.
Anyway, we do indeed have a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit, or at least we did; in fiscal 2012, which ended in September, the deficit was actually $1.089 trillion. (It will be lower this year.) The question is what lesson we should take from that figure.
What the Dr. Evil types think, and want you to think, is that the big current deficit is a sign that our fiscal position is completely unsustainable. Sometimes they argue that it means that a debt crisis is just around the corner, although they've been predicting that for years and it keeps not happening. (U.S. borrowing costs are near historic lows.) But more often they use the deficit to argue that we can't afford to maintain programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. So it's important to understand that this is completely wrong.
Now, America does have a long-run budget problem, thanks to our aging population and the rising cost of health care. However, the current deficit has nothing to do with that problem, and says nothing at all about the sustainability of our social insurance programs. Instead, it mainly reflects the depressed state of the economy -- a depression that would be made even worse by attempts to shrink the deficit rapidly.
So, let's talk about the numbers.
The first thing we need to ask is what a sustainable budget would look like. The answer is that in a growing economy, budgets don't have to be balanced to be sustainable. Federal debt was higher at the end of the Clinton years than at the beginning -- that is, the deficits of the Clinton administration's early years outweighed the surpluses at the end. Yet because gross domestic product rose over those eight years, the best measure of our debt position, the ratio of debt to G.D.P., fell dramatically, from 49 to 33 percent.
Right now, given reasonable estimates of likely future growth and inflation, we would have a stable or declining ratio of debt to G.D.P. even if we had a $400 billion deficit. You can argue that we should do better; but if the question is whether current deficits are sustainable, you should take $400 billion off the table right away.
That still leaves $600 billion or so. What's that about? It's the depressed economy -- full stop.
First of all, the weakness of the economy has led directly to lower revenues; when G.D.P. falls, the federal tax take falls too, and in fact always falls substantially more in percentage terms. On top of that, revenue is temporarily depressed by tax breaks, notably the payroll tax cut, that have been put in place to support the economy but will be withdrawn as soon as the economy is stronger (or, unfortunately, even before then). If you do the math, it seems likely that full economic recovery would raise revenue by at least $450 billion.
Meanwhile, the depressed economy has also temporarily raised spending, because more people qualify for unemployment insurance and means-tested programs like food stamps and Medicaid. A reasonable estimate is that economic recovery would reduce federal spending on such programs by at least $150 billion.
Putting all this together, it turns out that the trillion-dollar deficit isn't a sign of unsustainable finances at all. Some of the deficit is in fact sustainable; just about all of the rest would go away if we had an economic recovery.
And the prospects for economic recovery are looking pretty good right now -- or would be looking good if it weren't for the political risks posed by Republican hostage-taking. Housing is reviving, consumer debt is down, employment has improved steadily among prime-age workers. Unfortunately, this recovery may well be derailed by the fiscal cliff and/or a confrontation over the debt ceiling; but this has nothing to do with the alleged unsustainability of the deficit.
Which brings us back to ONE TRILLION DOLLARS.
We do indeed have a big budget deficit, and other things equal it would be better if the deficit were a lot smaller. But other things aren't equal; the deficit is a side-effect of an economic depression, and the first order of business should be to end that depression -- which means, among other things, leaving the deficit alone for now.
And you should recognize all the hyped-up talk about the deficit for what it is: yet another disingenuous attempt to scare and bully the body politic into abandoning programs that shield both poor and middle-class Americans from harm.

Full text:   WASHINGTON - Speaker John A. Boehner's latest offer to President Obama to allow tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million has already changed the terms of negotiations to avert a fiscal crisis in January, and both sides on Sunday expressed new optimism that a deal could be reached this week.
In a phone call with Mr. Obama on Friday, the speaker, who had resolutely opposed allowing income tax rates to rise on anyone, instead spoke in terms of preventing taxes from rising on everyone with a yearly income below $1 million. He also said he could accept an agreement that would raise $1 trillion in new revenues over 10 years, up from $800 billion, if the president committed to significant savings from benefit programs like Medicare, according to people familiar with the talks.
Also, in a big concession, Mr. Boehner offered to extend the debt limit for a year rather than withhold Republican support for an increase to once again use the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit as leverage to force Mr. Obama's acceptance of additional spending cuts in coming months. Mr. Obama has lowered his revenue demand from $1.6 trillion over 10 years to $1.4 trillion, and some Democrats have said his bottom line is $1.2 trillion. Even so, administration officials characterized the speaker's overture as a sign of progress.
With Friday's exchange, the president and the speaker put aside their philosophical argument over whether higher tax rates would hurt "small businesses" and "job creators" and began wrangling only over price. While Republicans with knowledge of the talks said a deal was not imminent, they indicated that it was close. "We are hopeful," one of the officials familiar with the talks said Sunday.
No deal is certain. The parties are far apart on possible changes to benefit programs, especially Medicare, and new tax revenues that must be locked in right away through higher tax rates rather than later through an uncertain tax reform effort. Democrats were hostile on Sunday.
"The reported offer by Speaker Boehner on tax rates would lose almost three-quarters of the revenue that could be gained by ending the Bush tax cuts for households with incomes over $250,000," said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. And that number does matter. The president and the speaker are $400 billion apart on the amount their proposals would instruct Congress's tax-writing committees to raise when the hard work of overhauling the tax code begins next year.
The sides are further apart on the amount of spending that should be cut. The White House has said it wants the relevant Congressional committees to find $400 billion in savings from federal health care programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Mr. Obama's health care law over 10 years, and about $200 billion in other cuts. Republicans want $600 billion in savings from health care programs over 10 years and $600 billion in other cuts, none of them detailed yet.
The officials familiar with the talks said this weekend that Mr. Boehner wants Mr. Obama to agree to move the government to a different way of calculating inflation that would slow the growth rate of many government programs, chiefly Social Security, by slightly lowering cost-of-living adjustments. It would also raise additional revenues because tax brackets, which rise each year with inflation, would rise more slowly. Rising incomes would more quickly push people into higher tax brackets.
But the officials said that Mr. Boehner was willing to drop discussions of an immediate increase in the eligibility age for Medicare, to 67 from 65, recognizing the fierce opposition to that change among Democrats.
Mr. Boehner crafted his proposal on tax rates as a counterargument to a growing number of Republicans who have publicly said that the party should quickly pass legislation to extend expiring tax rates for incomes below $250,000. Advocates of that position said it would keep taxes from going up on Jan. 1 for 98 percent of households.
But Mr. Boehner argued that the proposal, still being pushed by Mr. Obama, would allow the top two income tax rates to increase to 39.6 percent and 36 percent, from 35 percent and 33 percent, to capture people who could arguably call themselves upper middle class. By pressing for a limit of $1 million of income, only the top rate and a handful of the superrich would be affected, and virtually no legitimate small businesses would feel the hit.
The president's plan, which also would include higher tax rates on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, would raise $960 billion over 10 years. Congressional tax experts estimated on Sunday that a 39.6 percent rate on incomes over $1 million would raise $269.3 billion over 10 years. If limits on tax deductions and credits for high-income families that were repealed in the 2001 tax cut are allowed to return, that figure would top $300 billion.
The officials said that would be enough to justify canceling spending cuts that are set to take effect on Jan. 2 and would allow Congress to start on a tax-code overhaul that would create a new set of tax rates, possibly beginning in 2014. Closing loopholes and curtailing deductions and credits would raise most of the $1 trillion in revenues Mr. Boehner has offered, they say.
But Republicans have yet to show how tax writers can get from $300 billion in revenues through one higher tax rate to $1 trillion, and many tax experts have said it could be impossible without cutting back tax breaks for the middle class as well as for those with high incomes.
Politically, however, even Mr. Boehner's modest play on higher rates carries a significant risk in a House Republican conference in which most lawmakers have vowed to never raise taxes. One Republican House member, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to undermine the speaker's bargaining position, called Mr. Obama's resolute demand for higher tax rates "a brilliant play to start a Republican civil war."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   The American economy could finally have a pretty good year next year -- assuming Washington does its part.
Economists see a number of sources of underlying strength in the economy, but for the growth to gain traction, they say, political leaders need to avoid the broad tax increases and spending cuts now being debated.
The nascent housing rebound, the natural gas boom, record profit margins, a friendlier credit market for small businesses, along with pent-up demand for autos and other big purchases, could in combination unleash growth and hiring that the economy needs.
"Underneath all the shenanigans in Washington, there's a lot of strengthening," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
More robust growth next year -- perhaps higher than 3 percent later in the year, according to some of the more optimistic forecasts -- would certainly be a stark reversal from the current sluggish path.
There is a range of opinion among economists, though, and some warn of continued sluggishness, especially in the beginning of the year.
Estimates for the last quarter of 2012 are hovering around an unusually weak 1 percent annualized rate.
That dismal pace is driven partly by drags from Europe's recession and China's slowdown; partly by companies readjusting after potentially overstocking their back-room shelves in the third quarter; and largely by worries about the so-called fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases set for early 2013.
Surveys of consumer and business confidence in recent weeks have plummeted to recession-era lows. With such uncertainty, businesses have also recently curtailed spending on capital investments like computers, delivery trucks and other equipment, apparently in anticipation of higher tax rates and the destructive side effects of government cutbacks. Given that capital expenditures have been weak recently, some economists believe businesses will start spending more if Congress ends or at least delays the risk of severe fiscal tightening.
"You would think there must be for most businesses a list of projects they'd like to do which they've just been pushing a little bit into the future because they haven't been able to justify taking the risk because they don't know what's around the corner," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. "When they know more about the future, and what tax rates they'll be paying, they will be able to dust off those plans and finally execute them."
Improving access to credit helps these capital expenditures become not only more attractive, but also more accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been rising in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve. The National Federation of Independent Business has also reported that the share of small business owners who say their credit needs are not being met has been falling.
Additionally, corporate profits reached a high, even adjusting for inflation, in the third quarter. Companies have amassed a lot of cash that they can use to buy equipment or hire people if they feel secure enough about the recovery.
Consumers, on the other hand, are still not exactly cash-rich, particularly since their disposable income has been flat to falling in recent months. But in the last few years they have deleveraged greatly -- either by paying down debt or having it written off through default -- and, more important, they are feeling a little wealthier because the housing market appears to have bottomed out. The country has finally worked its way through the excess housing inventory from the bubble years, and now housing prices and housing construction are rising.
Household formation is picking up: young people are finally moving into their own homes, as are other Americans who had lived with family or friends.
"We're slowly but steadily improving, with more job opportunities in particular for younger households," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "They can only live with their parents for so long. There are powerful centrifugal forces in those households, on both sides. As soon as they have a chance to get out, many will take it."
Demographic data suggests that there should be about a million more households headed by younger Americans today than there actually are. That bodes well for continued formation of households next year, and new household formation is typically accompanied by other spending like furniture and kitchenware. Under normal circumstances, each new household adds about $145,000 to output that year as the spending ripples through the economy, Mr. Zandi says.
As is the case with businesses, economists see consumers unleashing some of their pent-up demand for cars. The average age of all vehicles in operation in America is at a record high of 11.2 years, according to the research firm R. L. Polk, which tracks vehicle sales and registrations. Vehicle sales have already been posting large gains this year.
The major caveat to all these relatively upbeat indicators, of course, is that Congress might override all this strength with deep austerity measures.
Even without all of the federal tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for 2013, the government sector will slow growth because state and local governments are still shrinking, said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. The sharp fiscal tightening at the federal level under current law would not only drag on growth but throw the entire economy back into recession, according to numerous private and government forecasters.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the entirety of the so-called fiscal cliff would shave about three percentage points off gross domestic product growth next year.
A more modest tightening along the lines of what President Obama wants -- which would include extending most existing tax rates and spending programs -- would still substantially reduce growth, analysts say. Charles Dumas, the chairman of Lombard Street Research, forecasts about a two percentage point subtraction from output growth next year under a situation where most of the Bush tax cuts are kept, the payroll tax holiday is phased out and most of the scheduled spending cuts are eliminated.
"The full drag posed by the cliff is sufficient to erase roughly two and a half years' worth of economic gains," said Joseph A. LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank.

Full text:   The projected growth of Medicare costs is the single biggest contributor to the country's long-term budget deficits, many estimates show. No cohort of Americans, with the possible exception of the very affluent, pays enough in Medicare taxes and premiums to cover its eventual Medicare costs.
Much of the early public discussion of the fiscal deadline has focused on taxes, and the decline of tax rates in recent decades has played a crucial role in creating the deficit. But the question of how to reduce the growth of Medicare costs will become increasingly important as the population continues to age and health costs continue to increase.
In the current fiscal talks, Republicans are pushing for significant changes to Medicare, in exchange for agreeing to tax increases. Democrats are arguing that Medicare is not the most pressing budget problem.
What follows is a primer on Medicare costs.
Q. Is Medicare really a bigger long-term problem than Social Security or military spending?
A. Yes. Over the next 25 years, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare spending will rise to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product, from 3.7 percent this year. (Other federal health care spending - like Medicaid, the insurance program principally for low-income families - is projected to rise to 3.7 percent of the G.D.P. in 2037, from 1.7 percent this year.)
In total, health care spending's percentage of the G.D.P. is expected to rise by five points. Social Security spending is projected to rise by only 1.2 percentage points, to 6.2 percent in 2037. All other federal spending is expected to shrink by two percentage points, to 9.6 percent.
These estimates assume that some current policies continue, rather than that the various tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 occur and remain in place.
Q. Why is Medicare the big problem?
A. As much attention as the aging of society receives, the rise of medical costs is a bigger budgetary problem. The faster growth of Medicare costs, relative to Social Security costs, highlights this difference.
Social Security costs will indeed grow in coming years, adding to the government's fiscal problems. But those costs will not grow nearly as rapidly as Medicare's, because Medicare costs are a function of both the aging society and the cost of treating any one person. Social Security's costs stem almost entirely from the number of elderly people.
Q. Don't most Americans pay for their Medicare benefits, through payroll taxes over their working lives?
A. No, and it is not even close. Two married 66-year-olds with roughly average earnings over their lives will end up paying about $122,000 in dedicated Medicare taxes through the payroll tax, including the part their employers pay, according to Eugene Steuerle, Stephanie Rennane and Caleb B. Quakenbush of the Urban Institute. That married couple can expect to receive about three times as much - $387,000, adjusted for inflation - in benefits. The projected gap is even larger for younger people because of growing health care costs.
In short, the single biggest cause of the long-term deficit is that most people receive much more from Medicare than they give to it.
Q. Why are health costs growing so rapidly?
A. For a good reason and a bad one.
The good reason is that our medical system has made enormous progress in recent decades and can treat conditions that once would have killed people. Cancer treatment and cardiac care are two examples of areas with beneficial new treatments that are often not cheap. An American who turns 65 today can expect to live almost 20 more years on average, up from about 16 years in 1980.
The bad reason is that our health care system wastes large amounts of money. The United States spends roughly twice as much money per person on health care as many other rich countries, without getting vastly better results. Americans receive better care in some areas (some cancers) and worse in others (higher error rates).
It is hard to make the case that the American health system provides a good return on the money it spends. Life expectancy is higher and has grown over the last 30 years in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Japan, among other countries.
Q. What are the possible solutions?
A. For starters, we could pay more in taxes. Tax revenues are near a 60-year low as a share of the G.D.P. They will rise somewhat as the economy recovers and incomes increase, but not by nearly enough to pay for growing health care costs.
Covering the future costs of Medicare and Medicaid solely through higher taxes would involve sharp increases - much greater than anything being debated now. So most budget experts believe that changes to Medicare need to be part of the deficit solution.
Among the options are raising the eligibility age, which is now 65; reducing benefits for affluent families; introducing more competition; and paying for quality of care, rather than quantity.
Q. What are the upsides and downsides of each?
A. Let's take the options one at a time:
The main arguments for raising the eligibility age are that Americans live longer than they used to and that the 2010 health care law makes it easier for people to get insurance if they do not receive it from an employer. The main counterargument is that the longevity increase has been smallest for low-income people, who are most likely to benefit from Medicare coverage.
Reducing benefits for high-income families has some bipartisan support, given the recent increases in income inequality. But some Democrats worry that it could eventually undermine Medicare's popularity, making it more akin to a welfare program.
Many Republicans advocate for more competition in health care, noting that competition has reduced prices and raised the quality of service in many industries. It has an uneven record of doing so in health care, though, in part because insurers can often profit by denying care.
Paying for quality rather than quantity has support from many economists. But it is not always easy. Patients and doctors often want to proceed with high-cost care even when research has not shown it to be effective.
Q. Does Medicare need to be fixed before Jan. 1?
A. Obviously not. Many potential changes would need to be phased in and would not bring savings for years. Other policy changes, like tax increases, can have a quicker effect on the deficit.
On the other hand, fixing Medicare is never going to be easy. Every budget negotiation between Congress and the president is an opportunity for them to make progress on a fiscal problem that is growing every year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   A coalition of Republican leaders and conservative groups agrees that the Texas Constitution could use a tighter cap on state spending.
Where they disagree is why such an amendment is needed.
Officials including Gov. Rick Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst say they want to amend the Constitution to limit spending growth to the combined rate of population and inflation to keep Texas running conservatively, as they say it has been for years. Currently, the Constitution restricts spending to the typically higher rate of growth in state personal income.
"We need to make constitutionally sure the fiscal conservatism that got us to where we are now will continue in the decades to come," Mr. Perry said in September.
Some prominent conservative activists say the proposal is about ending the excessive spending growth that has occurred over the last 20 years.
"The 2012-13 Texas state budget is a welcome break from that trend, but with the threat of a national recession looming, now is not the time to lose fiscal discipline," read a statement sent out last month and signed by leaders of groups like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Americans for Prosperity-Texas.
From 1992 to 2010, the two-year budgets passed by Texas lawmakers have roughly tripled in size, to $187.5 billion from $62.8 billion. The budget grew an average of 3.9 percent every two years once inflation and population gains were factored in.
The trend shifted sharply last year largely because of a multibillion-dollar shortfall. The current $173.5 billion budget represented a sharp cut in financing but was also widely viewed as incomplete. Medicaid, for instance, was underpaid by nearly $5 billion. When the Legislature convenes in January, lawmakers plan to pass a supplemental budget that will add billions to the current budget's final tally.
"The rule of thumb has been pretty much look and see how much money we have to spend and spend it," said Talmadge Heflin, a budget expert with the Texas Public Policy Foundation and a former legislator. "Last couple of sessions, at least the last one, they've had to prioritize more because the money hasn't been there."
When talking about the state's budget growth, Texas Republican lawmakers point a finger at federal mandates and entitlement programs. Instead of the full budget, they tend to praise the smaller growth in general revenue spending, the portion of the budget over which state officials have the most discretion. Not counting the current budget, general revenue spending, adjusted for population growth and inflation, has grown an average of less than 1 percent every two years since 1992.
"What is driving the growth is Medicaid, and that is being made by decisions in Washington, not decisions that state lawmakers made," said Dale Craymer, the president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association.
The debate among Republicans over the state's fiscal record exposed deep fissures in the party during this year's primary. In his losing bid for United States Senate, Mr. Dewhurst vowed to bring the "Texas model" of fiscal restraint to Washington, a promise that was mocked by the winner, Ted Cruz, who had the support of Tea Party groups.
"In his entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget," Mr. Cruz said during a televised campaign debate.
At the time, Mr. Dewhurst accused Mr. Cruz of lying. Last month, Mr. Dewhurst said critics were still misinforming Texans about the state's budget history.
"We have kept our spending as low as possible while, in my judgment, still funding our priorities," he said, "and not enough credit is given to the members of the Legislature for that."

Full text:   THE Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee this week gave the first hint of what would cause it to allow interest rates to rise. It promised to maintain low rates until the unemployment rate -- at 7.7 percent last month -- fell to 6.5 percent, so long as inflation also remained quiet.
Fed officials do not think that will happen until late 2015, but they could be overly pessimistic. A year ago, they thought that the rate would not get as low as it is now until 2014.
The prolonged low level of interest rates -- both short-term rates that are administered by the Fed and longer-term rates that are more subject to market forces -- has caused many investors to search for yield by purchasing longer-term bonds.
That has provided a bonanza for companies in the United States and in many emerging markets, where the amounts of newly issued bonds have risen rapidly.
"Almost any kind of corporate activity is acceptable to the bond market," said Michael Shaoul, the chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management. "That is really a sign the bond market is becoming indiscriminate."
For a bond investor, there are two things that can go wrong. The first is credit quality, when bonds either default or at least fall in market value because a default seems more likely. The second is interest rate risk -- the risk that market interest rates will rise significantly.
Mr. Shaoul said he thought investors in emerging market bonds were more likely to run into credit problems, while American bond buyers were more likely to face interest rate problems as the American economy improved.
"Five years down the road," he said, "you are likely to have significantly higher interest rates."
For a bond market investor now, the choice is to stick to shorter-term bonds, and get very low yields, or to move to longer-term ones that pay higher interest rates but that could lose market value if the interest rate offered on new bonds rose.
Much of the recent issuance in bonds has been because of refinancing, in which companies repay existing bonds with money borrowed on better terms. For holders, it can seem the worst of both worlds: if rates rise, they have old bonds that have lost value. If rates fall, their old bonds are redeemed by the company, depriving them of the yield they expected.
As can be seen in the accompanying graphic, corporate bond issuance in the United States has risen to record levels this year, and the average interest rate on high-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds because they are rated below investment grade, has fallen even more rapidly than have rates on higher-quality bonds.
Martin Fridson, the chief executive of FridsonVision and a veteran high-yield market analyst, said he thought high-yield investors were likely to lose money in 2013, as declines in prices offset the interest income realized from the bonds.
His model says the yield spread between the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II index and similar Treasury securities should now be around 6.5 percentage points, based on historical spreads as well as economic conditions, current default rates and the relative availability of bank credit. The actual difference, as shown by the chart, is about 5.3 percentage points, which he thinks is not enough to offset the risk.

Full text:   Stocks fell on Friday as another decline in Apple took a toll and investors unloaded some shares because of the uncertainty surrounding the budget negotiations in Washington.
All three major stock indexes ended the week slightly lower, the Nasdaq for the second consecutive week.
Apple's stock slid 3.76 percent, to $509.79, after the iPhone 5 received a tepid reception in China.
UBS maintained its buy rating on Apple, but cut its price target to $700 from $780 and expressed concerns that iPhone production may be dropping.
Shares of Apple have fallen 27.4 percent since their closing high of $702.10 on Sept. 19.
The S.& P. Information Technology Index lost 1 percent as Apple fell and Jabil Circuit fell 5.5 percent, to $17.51, after UBS cut its price target.
Stocks have been treading water as the possibility of not reaching a deal to settle the budget impasse until early next year is rising.
"We're faced with uncertainty," said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets in Boston. "And that's going to continue now into January. It basically puts everybody on hold and just have the markets kind of thrash around."
President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, held a "frank" meeting on Thursday at the White House to discuss how to avoid the tax increases and spending cuts set to kick in early in 2013.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 35.71 points, or 0.27 percent, to 13,135.01. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.87 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,413.58. The Nasdaq composite index lost 20.83 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,971.33.
For the week, the Dow slipped 0.15 percent, while the S.& P. 500 fell 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent.
Among other Nasdaq decliners, shares of the chip maker Qualcomm slid 4.7 percent, to $59.83.
Best Buy slid 14.7 percent, to $12.05, after the electronics retailer agreed to extend the deadline for the company's founder to make a bid.
Among the day's economic data, consumer prices fell in November for the first time in six months, indicating inflation pressures were muted.
A separate report showed manufacturing grew at its swiftest rate in eight months in December.
Chinese data was encouraging, as Chinese manufacturing grew at its fastest rate in 14 months in December. The news was deemed as helpful for materials companies in the United States, including United States Steel, which rose 6.8 percent, to $23.85.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 9/32, and the yield fell to 1.70 percent from 1.73 percent late Thursday.

Full text:   WASHINGTON
The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to announce specific economic objectives for its policies would have stunned and dismayed earlier generations of central bankers, who regarded secrecy as a virtue and obfuscation as a prized technique for manipulating financial markets.
"Since I've become a central banker, I've learned to mumble with great coherence," Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman, told reporters in 1987. "If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said."
But a greater appreciation for the virtues of transparency has been one of the most important shifts in central banking in recent decades. It is a response to public demands for increased accountability and an embrace of economic research on monetary policy that finds speaking clearly is more effective than mumbling. The Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet Yellen, last month described the result as a "revolution."
Until recently, the Fed under Mr. Greenspan and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, were tentative participants in this revolution. Mr. Bernanke spoke often about the need to speak clearly, but there were few tangible changes.
It now appears that he was simply busy dealing with a financial crisis. Over the last two years, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues have announced a series of changes intended to increase the transparency of the Fed's decision-making. Some of those moves have also transformed the way those decisions are made and, the Fed hopes, increased the power of its efforts to revive the economy.
Several of those changes were tied together by Wednesday's announcement that the Fed would hold short-term interest rates near zero as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent and inflation remained under control.
The new policy quantifies the goals that the Fed formally articulated for the first time in a statement in January. It extends the Fed's recent willingness to forecast the level of interest rates. It will require the Fed to publish a consensus forecast of inflation for the first time. And it was announced on Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke said, in part because he was scheduled to hold a news conference, another of his innovations.
The Fed's push to speak more clearly is partly motivated by political considerations. During the prosperous 1990s, the success of monetary policy was its own justification. After a financial crisis that the Fed failed to avert or predict, in the fourth year of a recovery that continues to disappoint, the Fed has no better defense than to explain what it is doing as clearly as possible.
It is primarily the result, however, of taking research seriously. While some economists, notably Milton Friedman, long argued that transparency would fortify the Fed's independence, the economic case crystallized more recently.
"It was an article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the best policy," Ms. Yellen recalled in a recent speech.
Absurd as it may seem now, until the mid-1990s, the Fed did not announce changes in its benchmark interest rate. It let the movement speak for itself.
Ms. Yellen and her colleagues have now concluded that transparency actually enhances the impact of the Fed's policies, particularly in the current circumstance. The Fed cannot push short-term rates below zero, but it still can reduce long-term rates, which are based on the expected level of short-term rates over the life of a loan, by persuading investors that those rates will remain near zero.
The Fed first experimented with this approach in 2003, when it announced that it would keep its benchmark rate at 1 percent for a "considerable period."
In recent years, since pushing rates nearly to zero in December 2008, the Fed has steadily elaborated on that idea. It promised to keep rates near zero for an "extended period." Then it announced a series of specific timetables, most recently promising in September to hold rates near zero at least until mid-2015.
Mr. Bernanke said on Wednesday that he did not expect the change to an unemployment rate peg to have a significant short-term impact. The Fed still expects to start raising rates no earlier than the second half of 2015. For now, the central bank is simply clarifying its reasons.
But the change could have more important consequences in the future. Until now, when economic conditions changed, markets were left to wonder whether Fed policy would change, too. Now, if the pace of growth increases and unemployment falls more quickly, the Fed has already said that it will move to raise interest rates sooner. If the recovery once again falters and unemployment rises, the Fed has already said that it will continue to suppress rates.
Better yet, investors can respond immediately, an effect that Mr. Bernanke described on Wednesday as a kind of "automatic stabilizer" for the economy.
"If the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower long-term rates and that will be supportive of the economy," he said. "It kind of offsets adverse shocks."
Analysts said the new policy also had some potential downsides, in particular because the unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of the health of the labor market. Last month, for example, the rate fell to 7.7 percent primarily because people stopped looking for work, not because they found new jobs.
The Fed said it would continue to consult other economic indicators, but Kris Dawsey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, noted that doing so would seem to undermine the benefits of announcing a specific economic objective.
"Under these circumstances the forward guidance would be considerably less clear than calendar-based guidance, as outside observers would have difficulty determining when this wide-ranging set of labor market indicators would cause the committee to believe that rate hikes should begin," he wrote.
A number of analysts including Mr. Dawsey also said that the new policy would give investors a new reason to fixate on the government's monthly release of employment data, potentially increasing market volatility.
And as the unemployment rate approaches 6.5 percent, investors may find themselves once again wondering what the Fed will do next.

As State Budgets Rebound, Federal Cuts Could Pose Danger

Author: Cooper, Michael.

Full text:   After years of budget cuts and sluggish recovery, states expect to see their revenues climb back to prerecession levels this year for the first time since the financial crisis hit. But even as some states hope to restore some of the deep spending cuts they have made, they face a new threat.
Washington's efforts to tame the federal deficit, state officials fear, could end up further whittling away the federal aid that states depend upon and weakening the economy as it slowly mends.
Those worries cloud a year that should be a turning point of sorts for the states. A fiscal survey of states released Friday by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers found that states expect to collect $692.8 billion in general fund revenues this fiscal year, which is more than they collected in 2008, the last fiscal year before the recession.
That is good news, but perhaps not as good as it initially appears. Adjusted for inflation, this year's revenues are still expected to be 7.9 percent below the 2008 levels. And with Medicaid costs continuing to rise -- states now spend more on Medicaid than on elementary and high school education -- states find themselves hard-pressed to restore many of the deep cuts they have made to other services.
Now many governors are bracing for the prospect of cuts in federal aid, which provided states with roughly a third of their revenue last year.
"What we're really seeing here is there is not enough money to make up for any federal cuts," said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the state budget officers' association. "What I've heard from the state budget people is that they've told departments and agencies in state government: Do not expect us to have the money available, even if we wanted to, to make up for federal cuts."
The slow recovery is uneven, the fiscal survey found: 21 states are still not collecting as much revenue as they did before the recession, and almost half are spending less than they did before the recession. With Medicaid costs continuing to rise, many states were forced to continue to make cuts in other areas. The survey found that while states are spending more on Medicaid and elementary and secondary education this year, they are still cutting higher education, public assistance and corrections. Transportation spending is roughly flat.
The pressure states are under can be seen in some of the actions they are taking. Pennsylvania is thinking of privatizing the management of its lucrative state lottery, and is weighing a bid from the company that runs the National Lottery in Britain. Connecticut is planning another round of cuts that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy warns "will have a real impact on people's lives." Ohio, which, like many states, has struggled to find money to maintain and improve its highways, announced a plan on Thursday to borrow against future toll revenues to pay for transportation projects.
Some services may never rebound from recent cuts, Mr. Pattison said, as states spend a bigger share of their limited resources on health care and education. "In most states, I think, parks and recreation will never get back to the general fund levels they had in the past," he said. "They'll be primarily funded by fees: campsite fees, admission fees, things like that. It's a small part of the pie, but I think it's an example of an area of state government that's just suffered in the recession and is not going to see a return, because the focus will be on these other areas."
Dan Crippen, the executive director of the National Governors Association, characterized the slow growth in state revenues this way: "While up is certainly better than down, no one is out singing 'Happy Days Are Here Again.' "
States fear the outcome of the budget talks between President Obama and Congress, whether a deal is reached by the end of the year or not.
"If Congress fails to act by the end of the calendar year, federal funds flowing to states would decline under the process of automatic across-the-board spending cuts known as sequester," the report, the Fiscal Survey of States, warns. "But even if a sequester is avoided, the likely policies required to address the nation's long-term fiscal debt problems may also reduce the level of federal funds for states."
Mr. Crippen said that governors had been meeting with federal officials to try to make sure that they understood how changing the tax code or cutting federal spending would affect states.
Capping deductions for state and local taxes, he said, would have big ramifications for some states. Ending the tax exemption for municipal bonds could raise borrowing costs. If planned spending cuts to the military are allowed to take effect next year, it could hurt the economies of states heavily reliant on military spending. And if those cuts are averted, they could be replaced with more cuts to state grants.
"States understand that there are going to be reduced resources to states coming from the federal budget," Mr. Crippen said. "States are going to need, as these programs get revamped and cut, a lot more discretion if they're going to provide the same level, or even near the same level, of services that they're providing today."
The fiscal woes of states have been raising concern in recent years. Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Richard Ravitch, the former New York lieutenant governor, formed a State Budget Crisis Task Force to shine a spotlight on the issue.
As the group released its findings on New Jersey's fiscal problems in Trenton on Thursday, Mr. Ravitch said he had been stunned to learn that after the financial turmoil of 2008 no one in federal government was keeping close track of state and local fiscal troubles, since those levels of government employ about 19 million people and pay for 70 percent of America's infrastructure.
"If we don't solve this," he said, "it's our democratic process that's going to be in the greatest jeopardy."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The income stagnation that has hit the middle class in the last decade is complicating the Democrats' position in the fiscal talks, making it more difficult for them to advocate across-the-board tax increases if a deal falls through.
Many Democrats have derided the expiring tax cuts as irresponsible since President George W. Bush signed them a decade ago. Yet the party is united in pushing to make the vast majority of them permanent, even though President Obama could ensure their expiration at year's end with a simple veto.
That decision reflects concern over the wage and income trends of the last decade, when pay stagnated for middle-class families, net worth declined and economic mobility eroded. Democrats who generally would prefer more tax revenue to help pay the growing cost of Medicare and other programs are instead negotiating with Republicans to find a combination of spending cuts and targeted tax increases for higher incomes.
If the two parties fail to come to a deal by Jan. 1, taxes on the average middle-income family would rise about $2,000 over the next year. That would follow a 12-year period in which median inflation-adjusted income dropped 8.9 percent, from $54,932 in 1999 to $50,054 in 2011.
The income and wealth trends of the last decade also create a longer-term dilemma for the party. By advocating the continuation of most of the Bush-era tax cuts, Democrats might find themselves confronting deeper-than-comfortable cuts to spending programs that aid the poor and middle class down the road.
"The goal is not just to make the tax code more progressive, but also to obtain adequate revenue to finance progressive spending programs," said Peter Orszag, a vice chairman at Citigroup and a former White House budget director. "Making the tax code more progressive but locking into a vastly inadequate revenue base is not doing the notion of progressivity overall any favors."
According to calculations by the independent Tax Policy Center, if Congress did nothing and all tax increases took effect at the end of the year, the hit would be broad but the brunt of it would fall on high-income households. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile of the income distribution would see a $412 bigger tax bill. For the top 0.1 percent, the average increase would be $633,946.
Only a small handful of policy voices on the left are making the case for the tax cuts to fully expire. In part, that is because the economy is still growing slowly, and tax increases have the potential to weaken it. But it is also partly because of structural changes in the economy.
"This is about math and values," Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in an e-mail. "Our first priority needs to be extending tax cuts for the middle class. At a time when we need to cut our debt and are asking everyone to chip in, we simply can't afford to continue extending all of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans."
The Congressional Budget Office has found that between 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent of households saw their inflation-adjusted income grow 275 percent. For the bottom 20 percent, it grew just 18 percent, and federal tax and transfer programs also did less and less to reduce income inequality over that period.
The mounting concentration of wealth is even more dramatic. A recent Economic Policy Institute study found that between 1983 and 2010 about three-quarters of all new wealth accrued to the wealthiest 5 percent of households. Over the same period, the bottom 60 percent actually became poorer.
Such figures are why some Democrats argue that even if the economy were to return to Clinton-era growth rates, its poor and middle class could not stomach a return to Clinton-era tax rates, at least not yet. Moreover, it has led Democrats to expand the "middle class" to encompass the vast majority of taxpayers, with families earning as much as $300,000 a year unlikely to see their taxes go up.
"The causes of the massive rise in inequality that we've seen that have caused stagnation for the middle class -- stagnation at best -- for the past 20 or 30 years are not likely to abate," said Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. "If they're caused by globalization and skill-biased technological change, they're likely to continue or accelerate."
Last week, President Obama visited the Virginia home of Tiffany and Richard Santana, a high school teacher and an employee at a car dealership, to make the case. "They're keeping it together, they're working hard, they're meeting their responsibilities," Mr. Obama said of the Santanas. "For them to be burdened unnecessarily because Democrats and Republicans aren't coming together to solve those problems gives you a sense of the costs on personal terms."
Mr. Obama's argument for raising revenue from high-income households and keeping taxes low on middle-income households long predates the recession or his time in the White House. Aides say the position stems in part from his belief that long-term economic changes have rewarded the rich and punished many others.
But limiting tax increases to just a small fraction of households might mean raising too little revenue over the long term to finance the programs that Democrats also fiercely want to preserve -- Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, education, supports for lower-income working families and infrastructure, among others, some policy experts on the left say.
"It's perfectly reasonable for the White House to begin collecting more revenue from folks who have done by far the best in pretax terms," said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a former economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "But ultimately we can't raise the revenue we need only on the top 2 percent."

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- The bottlenecks at a major port were so bad this year that Christmas trees from Canada were delayed for weeks, and when they did show up they cost hundreds of dollars. A government-run ice cream factory opened with great fanfare, only to shut down a day later because of a shortage of basic ingredients. Foreign currency is so hard to come by that automakers cannot get parts and new cars are almost impossible to buy.
And all of this happened while the economy was growing -- before the slowdown many predict next year.
Such frustrations are typical in Venezuela, for rich and poor alike, and yet President Hugo Chávez has managed to stay in office for nearly 14 years, winning over a significant majority of the public with his outsize personality, his free-spending of state resources and his ability to convince Venezuelans that the Socialist revolution he envisions will make their lives better.
Now that revolution is threatened by Mr. Chávez's fight with cancer. His health has become precarious enough that before undergoing surgery this week he designated a successor for the first time, saying that Vice President Nicolás Maduro should lead in his place if he cannot continue.
But as the undisputed head of his revolutionary movement, known as Chavismo, Mr. Chávez makes virtually all major government decisions and bullies both allies and opponents to keep them in line. Top government officials speak of him as their father. During his most recent presidential campaign this fall he frequently stirred crowds with the shout: "Chávez is revolution!"
Many doubt that any successor will be as adept at fostering support amid the nation's economic problems, widespread corruption, rampant crime and daily hassles -- raising the question of what will become of Mr. Chávez's movement without him.
"There's just nobody within Chavismo who can remotely match Chávez's capacity to connect to Venezuelans," said Michael Shifter, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington. "What ties it together is loyalty and a personal attachment to Chávez, and that's very weak. That's not a very solid foundation."
On Wednesday, with a grim face, Mr. Maduro implied that the president's condition was indeed serious, warning the nation to prepare for "the hard, complex and difficult days" ahead. It is a bitter pill for many Chávez supporters to swallow.
"We don't need another president, we need him," Reina Mocoa, 50, said.
A fervent Chávez follower, Ms. Mocoa was given an apartment in a new government-erected building this year. First there was no water. Then the plumbing leaked. A design flaw causes the apartment to flood when it rains. But her ire was never directed at Mr. Chávez.
"He gives orders, but they don't do the things as he wants them done," Ms. Mocoa said, reflecting a common perception that Mr. Chávez's subordinates are corrupt or inept, and that many of the country's problems can be attributed to greedy capitalists. "It's not his fault."
She said she was willing to give Mr. Maduro a chance to prove himself. But not all Chávez supporters feel that way.
"I only want Chávez," said Agustín Gutiérrez, 53, in Cumaná, an eastern city, adding that he did not trust Mr. Maduro to carry on "the revolution."
"There cannot be Chavismo without Chávez," he said.
Mr. Chávez's own record is mixed. After doing little to address a deep housing shortage, he has given away tens of thousands of homes, but the rush to build meant that many were plagued by construction flaws or other problems. He has used price controls to make food affordable for the poor, but that has contributed to shortages in basic goods. He created a popular program of neighborhood clinics often staffed by Cuban doctors, but hospitals frequently lack basic equipment.
There is no doubt that living conditions have improved for the poor under Mr. Chávez, and that is the greatest source of his popularity. But the improvements came at a time when high oil prices were pouring money into the country and fueling economic growth, which some analysts say would have led to similar improvements under many leaders, even some with more market-friendly policies.
Still, Mr. Chávez's movement is as much about ideas and symbols as material gains, and he has given a whole class of people that was once ignored a sense that their problems matter.
If Mr. Chávez is unable to start his new six-year term on Jan. 10, if he steps down after that or if he dies, new elections will take place. He has named Mr. Maduro as his chosen candidate.
For the opposition, a new election so soon after its stinging defeat in the presidential contest in October would seem a golden opportunity. It has never been able to beat Mr. Chávez in a head-to-head race, but its candidates have often done well against other members of Mr. Chávez's party.
The most likely opposition candidate is Henrique Capriles Radonski, a young governor who ran a strong campaign against Mr. Chávez in the October election. On Sunday he will run for re-election as governor of Miranda State. If he wins, he would seem set as the opposition standard-bearer. If he loses, that could provoke a potentially bruising battle over leadership within the opposition, which has a history of infighting.
But Chavismo, too, has its factions, and last Saturday Mr. Chávez staged an intense effort to enforce unity before his operation. Appearing on television to name Mr. Maduro as next in line, he pointed to a sword that once belonged to Simón Bolívar, the independence leader whom Mr. Chávez venerates, and asked for "all the support of the people."
The factions within Chavismo follow two broad divisions. There is a civilian wing, which includes Mr. Maduro, that is strongly committed to the socialist-inspired program. And there is a faction linked to the military, which puts nationalism ahead of socialism. There are other groups, too, including the government-run oil industry and a group of entrepreneurs who have gotten rich off government contracts and connections.
"Now comes the internal power struggle," said Luis La Torre, a supporter of Mr. Chávez from Carúpano, an eastern city.
For all of Mr. Chávez's international clout, especially among other leftist governments in the region, these domestic political relationships may prove the most difficult to manage without him. After all, Mr. Maduro has served as foreign minister for six years and is well known for promoting Mr. Chávez's often contentious foreign policy, including forging close relations with countries like Iran and Syria. Some analysts expect little to change on the international front with Mr. Maduro at the helm, except perhaps a thawing in relations with the United States because he is considered more open to dialogue.
If Mr. Chávez does indeed leave office, whoever replaces him will face a series of economic challenges. Most economists predict growth will slow next year, and some foresee a recession, after a year marked by a huge jump in government spending aimed at getting Mr. Chávez re-elected. An eventual devaluation of the currency, the bolívar, seems likely, and many also expect a rise in the already high inflation rate. The oil industry, the most important sector of the economy and a crucial source of government revenue, is stagnant and needs vast investment to increase production levels.
Without Mr. Chávez to hold things together, his movement could well splinter over time, whether or not it remains in power. But it is almost certain to remain a force.
"The legacy of Chávez is going to be very powerful," said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "It's hard for me to think of a Venezuela where five or 10 years from now there aren't a lot of politicians trying to get votes appealing to having been Chavistas and appealing to the memory that Venezuelans have of Chávez."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve made it plain on Wednesday that job creation had become its primary focus, announcing that it planned to continue suppressing interest rates so long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent.
It was the first time the nation's central bank had publicized such a specific economic objective, underscoring the depth of its concern about the persistence of what the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, called "a waste of human and economic potential."
To help reduce unemployment, the Fed said it would also continue monthly purchases of $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until job market conditions improved, extending a policy announced in September.
But the Fed released new economic projections showing that most of its senior officials did not expect to reach the goal of 6.5 percent unemployment until the end of 2015, raising questions of why it was not moving to expand its economic stimulus campaign.
At a news conference after a two-day meeting of the bank's top policy committee, Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Fed was approaching the limits of its ability to help the unemployed.
"If we could wave a magic wand and get unemployment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that," he said when asked if the Fed could do more. "But there are constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools and in terms that we do need to take into account other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet," referring to the monthly purchases of securities.
The changes announced Wednesday continue a shift that began in September, when the Fed announced that it would buy mortgage bonds until the job market generally improved.
As it did in September, the Fed sought to make clear on Wednesday that it was not responding to new evidence of economic problems, but increasing its efforts to address existing problems that have restrained growth for more than three years.
In focusing on job creation, the Fed is breaking with its long history of treating the inflation rate as the primary focus of a central bank. But the Fed is charged by Congress with both controlling inflation and minimizing unemployment. And over the last year, a group of officials led by Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, convinced their colleagues that the Fed was falling short on the unemployment front.
The unemployment rate in November was 7.7 percent -- it has not been below 6.5 percent since September 2008 -- while the rate of inflation in recent months is lower than the 2 percent annual rate that the Fed considers healthiest.
"Imagine that inflation was running at 5 percent against our inflation objective of 2 percent," Mr. Evans said in a September 2011 speech first describing the proposal. "Is there a doubt that any central banker worth their salt would be reacting strongly to fight this high inflation rate? No, there isn't any doubt. They would be acting as if their hair was on fire. We should be similarly energized about improving conditions in the labor market."
That argument was easier to win because inflation is under control, and the Fed expects the pace of price increases to remain at or below 2 percent through 2015. But in perhaps the clearest indication of the Fed's philosophical shift, the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday that it would not relent in its focus on unemployment unless the medium-term outlook for inflation rose above 2.5 percent.
The change was supported by 11 of the committee's 12 members. The only dissent came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has repeatedly called for the Fed to do less. He says he believes the policies are ineffective and could inhibit the central bank's ability to control inflation.
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it said in September that it intended to do so until at least mid-2015. The forecast was intended to reduce borrowing costs by persuading investors that interest rates would remain low for longer than they might have expected.
Mr. Bernanke said Wednesday that the shift to economic targets was not significant in the short term because the Fed still expected its goals to be reached no sooner than mid-2015. He said the bank chose 6.5 percent as its target because analyses showed that full-throttle stimulus beyond that level of unemployment could result in higher inflation.
Stock prices jumped after the Fed released its policy statement at midday, then began falling during Mr. Bernanke's news conference about two hours later as he insisted that the Fed was not significantly increasing its efforts to bolster the economy. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.04 percent on the day.
Some of Mr. Bernanke's colleagues, and some outside economists, argue that telling investors how the economic situation must change in order to warrant a shift in policy might be more convincing, and more potent, than publishing an estimated endpoint.
"The accommodation switch has been turned on," wrote Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays. He added that the new guidelines "could very well overcome some of the previous confusion surrounding date-based policy rate guidance."
The Fed's asset purchases are intended to reinforce the impact of its interest rate policies in a manner akin to removing seats from a game of musical chairs. Would-be investors in Treasuries and mortgage bonds are forced to compete for the remaining supply by accepting lower interest rates -- that is, they are forced to pay up front a larger share of the money they are entitled to receive as the bond matures, lowering costs for borrowers.
The Fed announced in September that it would expand its holdings of mortgage-backed securities by about $40 billion a month. Those purchases joined the bank's earlier commitment to buy about $45 billion in Treasury securities each month through the end of December, which has now been extended indefinitely. But instead of financing the purchases by selling short-term Treasuries, the Fed will credit banks that sell the bonds with new reserves, essentially creating money, as it now does in purchasing mortgage bonds.
It decided not to increase the scale of purchases, however, in part because it did not want to undermine the private market by soaking up too much of the available supply -- one of the constraints Mr. Bernanke mentioned on Wednesday.
The forecasts published Wednesday show that Fed officials expect the economy to expand 2.3 percent to 3 percent in 2013, slightly below the September forecast of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. Fed officials have repeatedly overestimated the health of the economy and the pace of the recovery, and the latest changes, while relatively small, continue that pattern.
The forecasts remain optimistic in at least one respect: they assume that Congress and the White House will reach a deal to avert scheduled tax increases and spending cuts next year. If that does not happen, Fed officials agree that the impact of the bank's stimulus campaign will be trivial in comparison to the consequences, and the economy will most likely return to recession.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Not since Joe the Plumber have contractors taken on such political overtones.
In a city where it is often impossible to get a plumber or any other repairman, somebody just figured out how to fix the pipes -- and replace light bulbs, scrub off graffiti and patch leaky roofs. Throughout Moscow and other Russian cities, such elementary building repairs are suddenly in full swing as the city's craftsmen, their reputations for surliness, laziness and drunkenness undiminished, are hurrying from one appointment to another.
Delighted Muscovites are crediting a new Web site for the unaccustomed Calvinist work ethic. Called Roszkh, it streamlines the process for filing complaints about maintenance of the communal areas of apartment buildings, like hallways and entryways, that remained public property after post-Soviet privatizations.
Stymied by a loss of momentum after street protests, Russian opposition leaders had been casting about for other approaches to remain relevant through what promises to be a long tenure for President Vladimir V. Putin. Aleksei Navalny, a blogger and political activist, hit upon the idea of the Web site, which is run under the auspices of his Foundation for Fighting Corruption.
"It's difficult to say when the next wave of protests will come," Mr. Navalny said in an interview about his new site, named after an acronym Russians use for their combined utility and building maintenance bills, ZhKKh.
Roszkh was an instant sensation. Since the site went up on Nov. 8, 28,354 users have filed 45,835 complaints, mostly in Moscow and other large cities. So far, repairmen have fixed about 2,600 reported problems. That may not sound like much, but in Russia it qualifies as extraordinary.
"I live in an old five-story building where the hallway has no light and no windows," one Muscovite, Boris Frantskevich, wrote in a post. It seemed it would be that way forever. But on a lark, he tried logging a complaint on the Web site.
"Just today, I walk out of my apartment and an electrician is digging in the wires," Mr. Frantskevich wrote. "Wow, he's fixed the light."
Mr. Navalny attributes the site's success to official sensitivities to a deep vein of public anger over the deplorable state of housing in Russia, and particularly in Moscow. In a leaked letter, Russia's chief housing inspector issued an order that the complaints on Mr. Navalny's Web site be addressed immediately.
The inspector, Nikolai Vasyutin, clarified the government response in a letter to subordinates: Applicants needed to be helped immediately, not in spite of the site's political character, but because of it.
"It's become obvious this is a policy by the opposition to discredit all levels of the government," the letter said. "But this shouldn't confuse the organs of the state housing inspection." It instructed city officials to counteract the tactic by fixing problems quickly.
Public opinion surveys indicate that the steady rise in ZhKKh fees is the issue that upsets Russians most; a planned increase was delayed during presidential elections last winter, only to kick in this year.
The fees have been rising faster than inflation. Many Russians are incensed about paying more -- currently about $130 a month in Moscow, and less in other cities -- while hallways, even in upscale buildings, are often yawning black tunnels, splattered with graffiti and reeking of septic odors.
These problems have become a vulnerability for Mr. Putin, but one largely of his own making. The governing political party, United Russia, went to great pains to ensure that it dominated not only national but also regional and local politics, often suppressing opponents to do so. The party also dominates city councils.
As Mr. Navalny, a former real estate lawyer, has been gleefully pointing out, this means that every broken light bulb and burst pipe is now the party's problem.
"We are trying to attract people who can fight corruption together with us," Mr. Navalny said. "It's clear that an ordinary person has a hard time helping us fight corruption at Gazprom," the big state energy company. "But unfortunately in Russia, corruption surrounds a person everywhere. We are trying to create a mechanism for people to fight corruption themselves."
The site asks users to enter their address and choose from a menu of common Russian repair problems: water flowing a rich orange color from rusted pipes, say, or a boiler failing in midwinter.
The program then automatically pastes on a lengthy legal text composed by Mr. Navalny and his volunteer group of lawyers for the benefit of the receiving bureaucrat, citing ordinances that mandate a response or repair, usually within 45 days.
The site automatically routes complaints to the appropriate municipal authority in thousands of cities in Russia's 83 regions. So far, though, Muscovites and residents of a few other large cities where Internet use is high have filed most of the complaints.
The site is easy to use. It saves profiles, allowing angry Russians to return whenever they have another leaky pipe or a new buildup of filth in a hallway.
In St. Petersburg, building inspectors initially declined to respond to several thousand complaints generated on the site. Whether that was for political reasons or out of laziness remains unclear.
But by early December, the office was working overtime to fix communal areas, and a housing maintenance official had been arrested for mismanagement, one of several moves by the government in an apparent effort to get ahead of the issue.
Even as complaints pile up, site moderators urge users to keep on filing.
One man, Sergei Sadko, wrote that an entire delegation of city officials promptly visited his apartment after he complained about a leaky roof.
"They said they would fix it in the spring," he wrote. "Should I change my status to 'problem solved'?"
The response: "File another complaint. They are required to fix everything immediately."

Abstract: To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.

Full text:   Below is the statement the Federal Reserve released Wednesday after the central bank's two-day policy meeting:
Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months, apart from weather-related disruptions. Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed. Inflation has been running somewhat below the committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The committee also will purchase longer-term Treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities is completed at the end of the year, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month.
The committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace and composition of its asset purchases, the committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.
In particular, the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.
The committee views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date-based guidance. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments. When the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; William C. Dudley, vice chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Dennis P. Lockhart; Sandra Pianalto; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; John C. Williams; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was Jeffrey M. Lacker, who opposed the asset purchase program and the characterization of the conditions under which an exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate.

Abstract: Half a million people are now in prison or jail for drug offenses, about 10 times the number in 1980, and there have been especially sharp increases in incarceration rates for women and for people over 55, long past the peak age for violent crime.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Stephanie George and Judge Roger Vinson had quite different opinions about the lockbox seized by the police from her home in Pensacola. She insisted she had no idea that a former boyfriend had hidden it in her attic. Judge Vinson considered the lockbox, containing a half-kilogram of cocaine, to be evidence of her guilt.
But the defendant and the judge fully agreed about the fairness of the sentence he imposed in federal court.
"Even though you have been involved in drugs and drug dealing," Judge Vinson told Ms. George, "your role has basically been as a girlfriend and bag holder and money holder but not actively involved in the drug dealing, so certainly in my judgment it does not warrant a life sentence."
Yet the judge had no other option on that morning 15 years ago. As her stunned family watched, Ms. George, then 27, who had never been accused of violence, was led from the courtroom to serve a sentence of life without parole.
"I remember my mom crying out and asking the Lord why," said Ms. George, now 42, in an interview at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee. "Sometimes I still can't believe myself it could happen in America."
Her sentence reflected a revolution in public policy, often called mass incarceration, that appears increasingly dubious to both conservative and liberal social scientists. They point to evidence that mass incarceration is no longer a cost-effective way to make streets safer, and may even be promoting crime instead of suppressing it.
Three decades of stricter drug laws, reduced parole and rigid sentencing rules have lengthened prison terms and more than tripled the percentage of Americans behind bars. The United States has the highest reported rate of incarceration of any country: about one in 100 adults, a total of nearly 2.3 million people in prison or jail.
But today there is growing sentiment that these policies have gone too far, causing too many Americans like Ms. George to be locked up for too long at too great a price -- economically and socially.
The criticism is resonating with some state and federal officials, who have started taking steps to stop the prison population's growth. The social scientists are attracting attention partly because the drop in crime has made it a less potent political issue, and partly because of the states' financial problems.
State spending on corrections, after adjusting for inflation, has more than tripled in the past three decades, making it the fastest-growing budgetary cost except Medicaid. Even though the prison population has leveled off in the past several years, the costs remain so high that states are being forced to reduce spending in other areas.
Three decades ago, California spent 10 percent of its budget on higher education and 3 percent on prisons. In recent years the prison share of the budget rose above 10 percent while the share for higher education fell below 8 percent. As university administrators in California increase tuition to cover their deficits, they complain that the state spends much more on each prisoner -- nearly $50,000 per year -- than on each student.
Many researchers agree that the rise in imprisonment produced some initial benefits, particularly in urban neighborhoods, where violence decreased significantly in the 1990s. But as sentences lengthened and the prison population kept growing, it included more and more nonviolent criminals like Ms. George.
Half a million people are now in prison or jail for drug offenses, about 10 times the number in 1980, and there have been especially sharp increases in incarceration rates for women and for people over 55, long past the peak age for violent crime. In all, about 1.3 million people, more than half of those behind bars, are in prison or jail for nonviolent offenses.
Researchers note that the policies have done little to stem the flow of illegal drugs. And they say goals like keeping street violence in check could be achieved without the expense of locking up so many criminals for so long.
While many scholars still favor tough treatment for violent offenders, they have begun suggesting alternatives for other criminals. James Q. Wilson, the conservative social scientist whose work in the 1970s helped inspire tougher policies on prison, several years ago recommended diverting more nonviolent drug offenders from prisons to treatment programs.
Two of his collaborators, George L. Kelling of the Manhattan Institute and John J. DiIulio Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania, have joined with prominent scholars and politicians, including Jeb Bush and Newt Gingrich, in a group called Right on Crime. It advocates more selective incarceration and warns that current policies "have the unintended consequence of hardening nonviolent, low-risk offenders" so that they become "a greater risk to the public than when they entered."
These views are hardly universal, particularly among elected officials worried about a surge in crime if the prison population shrinks. Prosecutors have resisted attempts to change the system, contending that the strict sentences deter crime and induce suspects to cooperate because the penalties provide the police and prosecutors with so much leverage.
Some of the strongest evidence for the benefit of incarceration came from studies by a University of Chicago economist, Steven D. Levitt, who found that penal policies were a major factor in reducing crime during the 1990s. But as crime continued declining and the prison population kept growing, the returns diminished.
"We know that harsher punishments lead to less crime, but we also know that the millionth prisoner we lock up is a lot less dangerous to society than the first guy we lock up," Dr. Levitt said. "In the mid-1990s I concluded that the social benefits approximately equaled the costs of incarceration. Today, my guess is that the costs outweigh the benefits at the margins. I think we should be shrinking the prison population by at least one-third."
Some social scientists argue that the incarceration rate is now so high that the net effect is "crimogenic": creating more crime over the long term by harming the social fabric in communities and permanently damaging the economic prospects of prisoners as well as their families. Nationally, about one in 40 children have a parent in prison. Among black children, one in 15 have a parent in prison.
Cocaine in the Attic
Ms. George was a young single mother when she first got in trouble with drugs and the law. One of her children was fathered by a crack dealer, Michael Dickey, who went to prison in the early 1990s for drug and firearm offenses.
"When he went away, I was at home with the kids struggling to pay bills," Ms. George said. "The only way I knew to get money quick was selling crack. I was never a user, but from being around him I pretty much knew how to get it."
After the police caught her making crack sales of $40 and $120 -- which were counted as separate felonies -- she was sentenced, at 23, to nine months in a work-release program. That meant working at her mother's hair salon in Pensacola during the day and spending nights at the county jail, away from her three young children.
"When I caught that first charge, it scared me to death," she recalled. "I thought, my God, being away from my kids, this is not what I want. I promised them I would never let it happen again."
When Mr. Dickey got out of prison in 1995, she said, she refused to resume their relationship, but she did allow him into her apartment sometimes to see their daughter. One evening, shortly after he had arrived, the police showed up with a search warrant and a ladder.
"I didn't know what they were doing with a ladder in a one-story building," Ms. George said. "They went into a closet and opened a little attic space I'd never seen before and brought down the lockbox. He gave them a key to open it. When I saw what was in it, I was so mad I jumped across the table at him and started hitting him."
Mr. Dickey said he had paid her to store the cocaine at her home. At the trial, other defendants said she was present during drug transactions conducted by Mr. Dickey and other dealers she dated, and sometimes delivered cash or crack for her boyfriends. Ms. George denied those accusations, which her lawyer argued were uncorroborated and self-serving. After the jury convicted her of being part of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, she told the judge at her sentencing: "I just want to say I didn't do it. I don't want to be away from my kids."
Whatever the truth of the testimony against her, it certainly benefited the other defendants. Providing evidence to the prosecution is one of the few ways to avoid a mandatory sentence. Because the government formally credited the other defendants with "substantial assistance," their sentences were all reduced to less than 15 years. Even though Mr. Dickey was the leader of the enterprise and had a much longer criminal record than Ms. George, he was freed five years ago.
Looking back on the case, Judge Vinson said such disparate treatment is unfortunately all too common. The judge, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan who is hardly known for liberalism (last year he ruled that the Obama administration's entire health care act was unconstitutional), says he still regrets the sentence he had to impose on Ms. George because of a formula dictated by the amount of cocaine in the lockbox and her previous criminal record.
"She was not a major participant by any means, but the problem in these cases is that the people who can offer the most help to the government are the most culpable," Judge Vinson said recently. "So they get reduced sentences while the small fry, the little workers who don't have that information, get the mandatory sentences.
"The punishment is supposed to fit the crime, but when a legislative body says this is going to be the sentence no matter what other factors there are, that's draconian in every sense of the word. Mandatory sentences breed injustice."
Doubts About a Penalty
In the 1980s, stricter penalties for drugs were promoted by Republicans like Mr. Reagan and by urban Democrats worried about the crack epidemic. In the 1990s, both parties supported President Bill Clinton's anticrime bill, which gave states money to build prisons. Three-strikes laws and other formulas forced judges to impose life without parole, a sentence that was uncommon in the United States before the 1970s.
Most other countries do not impose life sentences without parole, and those that do generally reserve it for a few heinous crimes. In England, where it is used only for homicides involving an aggravating factor like child abduction, torture or terrorism, a recent study reported that 41 prisoners were serving life terms without parole. In the United States, some 41,000 are.
"It is unconscionable that we routinely sentence people like Stephanie George to die in our prisons," said Mary Price, the general counsel of the advocacy group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. "The United States is nearly alone among the nations of the world in abandoning our obligation to rehabilitate such offenders."
The utility of such sentences has been challenged repeatedly by criminologists and economists. Given that criminals are not known for meticulous long-term planning, how much more seriously do they take a life sentence versus 20 years, or 10 years versus 2 years? Studies have failed to find consistent evidence that the prospect of a longer sentence acts as a significantly greater deterrent than a shorter sentence.
Longer sentences undoubtedly keep criminals off the streets. But researchers question whether this incapacitation effect, as it is known, provides enough benefits to justify the costs, especially when drug dealers are involved. Locking up a rapist makes the streets safer by removing one predator, but locking up a low-level drug dealer creates a job opening that is quickly filled because so many candidates are available.
The number of drug offenders behind bars has gone from fewer than 50,000 in 1980 to more than 500,000 today, but that still leaves more than two million people on the street who sell drugs at least occasionally, according to calculations by Peter H. Reuter, a criminologist at the University of Maryland. He and Jonathan P. Caulkins of Carnegie Mellon University say there is no way to lock up enough low-level dealers and couriers to make a significant impact on supply, and that is why cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs are as readily available today as in 1980, and generally at lower prices.
The researchers say that if the number of drug offenders behind bars was halved -- reduced by 250,000 -- there would be little impact on prices or availability.
"Mandating long sentences based on the quantities of drugs in someone's possession just sweeps up low-level couriers and other hired help who are easily replaced," Dr. Caulkins said. "Instead of relying on formulas written by legislators and sentencing commissions, we should let judges and other local officials use discretion to focus on the dealers who cause the most social harm -- the ones who are violent, who fight for turf on street corners, who employ children. They're the ones who should receive long sentences."
These changes are starting to be made in places. Sentences for some drug crimes have been eased at the federal level and in states like New York, Kentucky and Texas. Judges in Ohio and South Carolina have been given more sentencing discretion. Californians voted in November to soften their state's "three strikes" law to focus only on serious or violent third offenses. The use of parole has been expanded in Louisiana and Mississippi. The United States Supreme Court has banned some life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders.
Nonetheless, the United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, still has nearly a quarter of the world's prisoners.
A Mother Taken Away
Ms. George said she could understand the justice of sending her to prison for five years, if only to punish her for her earlier crack-selling offenses.
"I'm a real firm believer in karma -- what goes around comes around," she said. "I see now how wrong it was to sell drugs to people hooked on something they couldn't control. I think, what if they took money away from their kids to buy drugs from me? I deserve to pay a price for that. But my whole life? To take me away from my kids forever?"
When she was sentenced 15 years ago, her children were 5, 6 and 9. They have been raised by her sister, Wendy Evil, who says it was agonizing to take the children to see their mother in prison.
"They would fight to sit on her knee the whole time," she recalled recently during a family dinner at their home in Pensacola. "It's been so hard for them. Some of the troubles they've had are because of their anger at her being gone."
The youngest child, William, now 20, dropped out of middle school. The older two, Kendra and Courtney, finished high school but so far have not followed their mother's advice to go to college.
"I don't want to blame things on my situation, but I think my life would have been a whole lot different if she'd been here," said Courtney, now 25, who has been unemployed for several years. "When I fell off track, she would have pushed me back. She's way stronger than any of us."
Ms. George, who has gotten a college degree in prison, calls the children every Sunday. She pays for the calls, which cost 23 cents a minute, with wages from two jobs: a regular eight-hour shift of data processing that pays 92 cents an hour, supplemented by four hours of overtime work at a call center in the prison that provides 411 directory assistance to phone companies.
"I like to stay busy," she said during the interview. "I don't like to give myself time to think about home. I know how much it hurts my daughter to see her friends doing things with their mothers. My boys are still so angry. I thought after a while it would stop, that they'd move on as they got older and had girlfriends. But it just seems like it gets worse every Mother's Day and Christmas."
She seemed undaunted, even cheerful, during most of the interview at the prison, where she sleeps on a bunk bed in an 11-by-7-foot cell she shares with another inmate. Dressed in the regulation uniform, khaki pants and work boots, she was calm and articulate as she explained her case and the failed efforts to appeal the ruling. At this point lawyers say her only hope seems to be presidential clemency -- rarely granted in recent years -- yet she said she remained hopeful.
She lost her composure only once, while describing the evening in 1996 when the police found the lockbox in her apartment. She had been working in the kitchen, braiding someone's hair for a little money, while Courtney, then 8, played in the home. He watched the police take her away in handcuffs.
"Courtney called out, 'Mom, you promised you weren't going to leave us no more,' " Ms. George recalled, her eyes glistening. "I still hear that voice to this day, and he's a grown man."

Correction: December 14, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about growing skepticism over mandatory prison sentences referred incorrectly to Supreme Court rulings on sentencing for juvenile offenders. The court has banned sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles convicted of crimes that did not involve killings; the justices also struck down laws that required such sentences in homicide cases without allowing judges or juries to consider individual circumstances. The court has not completely "banned life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders."

Full text:   WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The nation's trade deficit widened in October as exports suffered the biggest decline in nearly four years, indicating that slowing global demand was spilling over into the nation's already struggling economy.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap increased 4.9 percent to $42.2 billion. In a sign of weak domestic demand, imports hit the lowest level in one and a half years.
"The report tells a tale of weakening economic growth momentum both domestically and globally," said Millan Mulraine, a senior economist at TD Securities in New York.
Economists, who had expected the trade deficit to widen to $42.6 billion in October, said Hurricane Sandy, which struck the East Coast in late October, could have disrupted trade flows.
But the Commerce Department did not indicate that the storm was a factor. The wider trade gap in October reflected a 3.6 percent decline in exports of goods and services to $180.5 billion. That was the biggest percentage drop in exports since January 2009.
Imports of goods and services fell 2.1 percent, to $222.8 billion, in October, the lowest since April 2011.
Economists said the decline in imports was hardly surprising, given a weakening in consumer demand in recent months.
Fears that tighter fiscal policy, set to kick in early next year, could push the economy into recession have sapped domestic demand and caused businesses to cut back on spending.
Trade was a modest boost to the third quarter's 2.7 percent annual growth pace. Revisions to September's data showed a narrower trade gap than previously reported and suggested the contribution from trade was probably slightly bigger.
In October, the inflation-adjusted trade deficit narrowed to $46.2 billion from $46.6 billion in September.
While that implied trade would make another small contribution to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, economists said the size of the decline in exports raised the bar high for that.
Weak domestic demand was underscored by a 0.6 percent rise in wholesale inventories in October, which came as sales fell for the first time in three months, a second Commerce Department report showed.
That pushed the inventories/sales ratio, a measure of how long it would take wholesalers to clear their warehouses, to a three-year high. Inventories accounted for more than a quarter of the economy's growth pace in the third quarter.
While exports to the 27-nation European Union rose 1.4 percent in October, there were substantial declines in goods shipped to France, Germany, Italy and Britain.
Exports to the European Union in the first 10 months of 2012 were down 0.7 percent compared to same period in 2011.
American exports to Latin America also fell in October, and shipments to Japan dropped 8 percent.
Although exports to China, which have been growing more slowly than in recent years, surged 23.1 percent in October, imports rose to a record.
That pushed the United States' trade deficit with China to a record $29.5 billion.

Abstract: Half a million people are now in prison or jail for drug offenses, about 10 times the number in 1980, and there have been especially sharp increases in incarceration rates for women and for people over 55, long past the peak age for violent crime.

Full text:   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Stephanie George and Judge Roger Vinson had quite different opinions about the lockbox seized by the police from her home in Pensacola. She insisted she had no idea that a former boyfriend had hidden it in her attic. Judge Vinson considered the lockbox, containing a half-kilogram of cocaine, to be evidence of her guilt.
But the defendant and the judge fully agreed about the fairness of the sentence he imposed in federal court.
"Even though you have been involved in drugs and drug dealing," Judge Vinson told Ms. George, "your role has basically been as a girlfriend and bag holder and money holder but not actively involved in the drug dealing, so certainly in my judgment it does not warrant a life sentence."
Yet the judge had no other option on that morning 15 years ago. As her stunned family watched, Ms. George, then 27, who had never been accused of violence, was led from the courtroom to serve a sentence of life without parole.
"I remember my mom crying out and asking the Lord why," said Ms. George, now 42, in an interview at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee. "Sometimes I still can't believe myself it could happen in America."
Her sentence reflected a revolution in public policy, often called mass incarceration, that appears increasingly dubious to both conservative and liberal social scientists. They point to evidence that mass incarceration is no longer a cost-effective way to make streets safer, and may even be promoting crime instead of suppressing it.
Three decades of stricter drug laws, reduced parole and rigid sentencing rules have lengthened prison terms and more than tripled the percentage of Americans behind bars. The United States has the highest reported rate of incarceration of any country: about one in 100 adults, a total of nearly 2.3 million people in prison or jail.
But today there is growing sentiment that these policies have gone too far, causing too many Americans like Ms. George to be locked up for too long at too great a price -- economically and socially.
The criticism is resonating with some state and federal officials, who have started taking steps to stop the prison population's growth. The social scientists are attracting attention partly because the drop in crime has made it a less potent political issue, and partly because of the states' financial problems.
State spending on corrections, after adjusting for inflation, has more than tripled in the past three decades, making it the fastest-growing budgetary cost except Medicaid. Even though the prison population has leveled off in the past several years, the costs remain so high that states are being forced to reduce spending in other areas.
Three decades ago, California spent 10 percent of its budget on higher education and 3 percent on prisons. In recent years the prison share of the budget rose above 10 percent while the share for higher education fell below 8 percent. As university administrators in California increase tuition to cover their deficits, they complain that the state spends much more on each prisoner -- nearly $50,000 per year -- than on each student.
Many researchers agree that the rise in imprisonment produced some initial benefits, particularly in urban neighborhoods, where violence decreased significantly in the 1990s. But as sentences lengthened and the prison population kept growing, it included more and more nonviolent criminals like Ms. George.
Half a million people are now in prison or jail for drug offenses, about 10 times the number in 1980, and there have been especially sharp increases in incarceration rates for women and for people over 55, long past the peak age for violent crime. In all, about 1.3 million people, more than half of those behind bars, are in prison or jail for nonviolent offenses.
Researchers note that the policies have done little to stem the flow of illegal drugs. And they say goals like keeping street violence in check could be achieved without the expense of locking up so many criminals for so long.
While many scholars still favor tough treatment for violent offenders, they have begun suggesting alternatives for other criminals. James Q. Wilson, the conservative social scientist whose work in the 1970s helped inspire tougher policies on prison, several years ago recommended diverting more nonviolent drug offenders from prisons to treatment programs.
Two of his collaborators, George L. Kelling of the Manhattan Institute and John J. DiIulio Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania, have joined with prominent scholars and politicians, including Jeb Bush and Newt Gingrich, in a group called Right on Crime. It advocates more selective incarceration and warns that current policies "have the unintended consequence of hardening nonviolent, low-risk offenders" so that they become "a greater risk to the public than when they entered."
These views are hardly universal, particularly among elected officials worried about a surge in crime if the prison population shrinks. Prosecutors have resisted attempts to change the system, contending that the strict sentences deter crime and induce suspects to cooperate because the penalties provide the police and prosecutors with so much leverage.
Some of the strongest evidence for the benefit of incarceration came from studies by a University of Chicago economist, Steven D. Levitt, who found that penal policies were a major factor in reducing crime during the 1990s. But as crime continued declining and the prison population kept growing, the returns diminished.
"We know that harsher punishments lead to less crime, but we also know that the millionth prisoner we lock up is a lot less dangerous to society than the first guy we lock up," Dr. Levitt said. "In the mid-1990s I concluded that the social benefits approximately equaled the costs of incarceration. Today, my guess is that the costs outweigh the benefits at the margins. I think we should be shrinking the prison population by at least one-third."
Some social scientists argue that the incarceration rate is now so high that the net effect is "crimogenic": creating more crime over the long term by harming the social fabric in communities and permanently damaging the economic prospects of prisoners as well as their families. Nationally, about one in 40 children have a parent in prison. Among black children, one in 15 have a parent in prison.
Cocaine in the Attic
Ms. George was a young single mother when she first got in trouble with drugs and the law. One of her children was fathered by a crack dealer, Michael Dickey, who went to prison in the early 1990s for drug and firearm offenses.
"When he went away, I was at home with the kids struggling to pay bills," Ms. George said. "The only way I knew to get money quick was selling crack. I was never a user, but from being around him I pretty much knew how to get it."
After the police caught her making crack sales of $40 and $120 -- which were counted as separate felonies -- she was sentenced, at 23, to nine months in a work-release program. That meant working at her mother's hair salon in Pensacola during the day and spending nights at the county jail, away from her three young children.
"When I caught that first charge, it scared me to death," she recalled. "I thought, my God, being away from my kids, this is not what I want. I promised them I would never let it happen again."
When Mr. Dickey got out of prison in 1995, she said, she refused to resume their relationship, but she did allow him into her apartment sometimes to see their daughter. One evening, shortly after he had arrived, the police showed up with a search warrant and a ladder.
"I didn't know what they were doing with a ladder in a one-story building," Ms. George said. "They went into a closet and opened a little attic space I'd never seen before and brought down the lockbox. He gave them a key to open it. When I saw what was in it, I was so mad I jumped across the table at him and started hitting him."
Mr. Dickey said he had paid her to store the cocaine at her home. At the trial, other defendants said she was present during drug transactions conducted by Mr. Dickey and other dealers she dated, and sometimes delivered cash or crack for her boyfriends. Ms. George denied those accusations, which her lawyer argued were uncorroborated and self-serving. After the jury convicted her of being part of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, she told the judge at her sentencing: "I just want to say I didn't do it. I don't want to be away from my kids."
Whatever the truth of the testimony against her, it certainly benefited the other defendants. Providing evidence to the prosecution is one of the few ways to avoid a mandatory sentence. Because the government formally credited the other defendants with "substantial assistance," their sentences were all reduced to less than 15 years. Even though Mr. Dickey was the leader of the enterprise and had a much longer criminal record than Ms. George, he was freed five years ago.
Looking back on the case, Judge Vinson said such disparate treatment is unfortunately all too common. The judge, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan who is hardly known for liberalism (last year he ruled that the Obama administration's entire health care act was unconstitutional), says he still regrets the sentence he had to impose on Ms. George because of a formula dictated by the amount of cocaine in the lockbox and her previous criminal record.
"She was not a major participant by any means, but the problem in these cases is that the people who can offer the most help to the government are the most culpable," Judge Vinson said recently. "So they get reduced sentences while the small fry, the little workers who don't have that information, get the mandatory sentences.
"The punishment is supposed to fit the crime, but when a legislative body says this is going to be the sentence no matter what other factors there are, that's draconian in every sense of the word. Mandatory sentences breed injustice."
Doubts About a Penalty
In the 1980s, stricter penalties for drugs were promoted by Republicans like Mr. Reagan and by urban Democrats worried about the crack epidemic. In the 1990s, both parties supported President Bill Clinton's anticrime bill, which gave states money to build prisons. Three-strikes laws and other formulas forced judges to impose life without parole, a sentence that was uncommon in the United States before the 1970s.
Most other countries do not impose life sentences without parole, and those that do generally reserve it for a few heinous crimes. In England, where it is used only for homicides involving an aggravating factor like child abduction, torture or terrorism, a recent study reported that 41 prisoners were serving life terms without parole. In the United States, some 41,000 are.
"It is unconscionable that we routinely sentence people like Stephanie George to die in our prisons," said Mary Price, the general counsel of the advocacy group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. "The United States is nearly alone among the nations of the world in abandoning our obligation to rehabilitate such offenders."
The utility of such sentences has been challenged repeatedly by criminologists and economists. Given that criminals are not known for meticulous long-term planning, how much more seriously do they take a life sentence versus 20 years, or 10 years versus 2 years? Studies have failed to find consistent evidence that the prospect of a longer sentence acts as a significantly greater deterrent than a shorter sentence.
Longer sentences undoubtedly keep criminals off the streets. But researchers question whether this incapacitation effect, as it is known, provides enough benefits to justify the costs, especially when drug dealers are involved. Locking up a rapist makes the streets safer by removing one predator, but locking up a low-level drug dealer creates a job opening that is quickly filled because so many candidates are available.
The number of drug offenders behind bars has gone from fewer than 50,000 in 1980 to more than 500,000 today, but that still leaves more than two million people on the street who sell drugs at least occasionally, according to calculations by Peter H. Reuter, a criminologist at the University of Maryland. He and Jonathan P. Caulkins of Carnegie Mellon University say there is no way to lock up enough low-level dealers and couriers to make a significant impact on supply, and that is why cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs are as readily available today as in 1980, and generally at lower prices.
The researchers say that if the number of drug offenders behind bars was halved -- reduced by 250,000 -- there would be little impact on prices or availability.
"Mandating long sentences based on the quantities of drugs in someone's possession just sweeps up low-level couriers and other hired help who are easily replaced," Dr. Caulkins said. "Instead of relying on formulas written by legislators and sentencing commissions, we should let judges and other local officials use discretion to focus on the dealers who cause the most social harm -- the ones who are violent, who fight for turf on street corners, who employ children. They're the ones who should receive long sentences."
These changes are starting to be made in places. Sentences for some drug crimes have been eased at the federal level and in states like New York, Kentucky and Texas. Judges in Ohio and South Carolina have been given more sentencing discretion. Californians voted in November to soften their state's "three strikes" law to focus only on serious or violent third offenses. The use of parole has been expanded in Louisiana and Mississippi. The United States Supreme Court has banned life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders.
Nonetheless, the United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, still has nearly a quarter of the world's prisoners.
A Mother Taken Away
Ms. George said she could understand the justice of sending her to prison for five years, if only to punish her for her earlier crack-selling offenses.
"I'm a real firm believer in karma -- what goes around comes around," she said. "I see now how wrong it was to sell drugs to people hooked on something they couldn't control. I think, what if they took money away from their kids to buy drugs from me? I deserve to pay a price for that. But my whole life? To take me away from my kids forever?"
When she was sentenced 15 years ago, her children were 5, 6 and 9. They have been raised by her sister, Wendy Evil, who says it was agonizing to take the children to see their mother in prison.

Ms. George, who has gotten a college degree in prison, calls the children every Sunday. She pays for the calls, which cost 23 cents a minute, with wages from two jobs: a regular eight-hour shift of data processing that pays 92 cents an hour, supplemented by four hours of overtime work at a call center in the prison that provides 411 directory assistance to phone companies.
"I like to stay busy," she said during the interview. "I don't like to give myself time to think about home. I know how much it hurts my daughter to see her friends doing things with their mothers. My boys are still so angry. I thought after a while it would stop, that they'd move on as they got older and had girlfriends. But it just seems like it gets worse every Mother's Day and Christmas."
She seemed undaunted, even cheerful, during most of the interview at the prison, where she sleeps on a bunk bed in an 11-by-7-foot cell she shares with another inmate. Dressed in the regulation uniform, khaki pants and work boots, she was calm and articulate as she explained her case and the failed efforts to appeal the ruling. At this point lawyers say her only hope seems to be presidential clemency -- rarely granted in recent years -- yet she said she remained hopeful.

Full text:   James D. Hodgson, who as President Richard M. Nixon's secretary of labor in the early 1970s promoted jobs for minority workers in the building trades and safer American workplaces, died on Nov. 28 at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 96.
In a message to colleagues, Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said his family announced the death on Monday.
Mr. Hodgson (pronounced HOD-sun) was later the ambassador to Japan in the Ford administration, but for most of his career he was a behind-the-scenes negotiator for the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, hammering out labor contracts in the 1950s and '60s.
After landing in Washington as the deputy to Labor Secretary George P. Shultz in 1969, he remained all but unknown, even to organized labor, as he quietly ran the department's day-to-day affairs for more than a year.
But when Mr. Shultz became White House budget director in July 1970, Mr. Hodgson was thrust into the spotlight, and for the next two and a half years he was an important figure in the administration's political and legislative fights in Congress on labor issues.
Early in his tenure, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 became law, greatly expanding the Labor Department's regulatory responsibilities and its authority to oversee federal and state compliance efforts. Toxic substances, dangerous machinery and a host of electrical, chemical and fire hazards were widespread at work sites, and Mr. Hodgson began the daunting tasks of identifying and policing them.
He also undertook a campaign to promote an early affirmative-action initiative, called the Philadelphia Plan for its city of origin. The effort set goals and timetables for major contractors doing business with the government to hire more black plumbers, electricians, ironmongers and other workers in the building trades. Many unions opposed the plan, which had limited success.
At a time of inflation and rising unemployment, strikes were mounted by longshoremen and farm workers in California, autoworkers in Ohio, teachers in Philadelphia, police officers in New York City and even Major League Baseball players, who in 1972 staged the first walkout in their history. Mr. Hodgson urged Congress to ban national transportation strikes and other walkouts that might severely affect the nation. But, conforming to administration policy, he sidestepped direct involvement in labor disputes.
Mr. Hodgson's relations with labor in general and with George Meany, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., were cool at best. Mr. Hodgson stepped down in February 1973, early in Nixon's abortive second term, and was replaced by Peter J. Brennan, a construction trades union leader who had been a major Nixon political supporter.
In June 1974, Nixon's nomination of Mr. Hodgson to be ambassador to Japan was approved by the Senate. Less than two months later, Nixon resigned in the Watergate scandal, and Mr. Hodgson served in Tokyo for the next three years under President Gerald R. Ford.
Three decades after American atomic bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II, Japan had largely been rebuilt and Washington and Tokyo had settled on a security treaty, the status of Okinawa, and trade and monetary issues. Although it was a relatively quiet period in Japanese-American relations, Mr. Hodgson was generally given high marks as ambassador.
James Day Hodgson was born on Dec. 3, 1915, in Dawson, Minn., to Fred Hodgson and the former Casaraha Day. His father owned a chain of lumber yards. James attended public schools in Dawson and studied sociology and anthropology at the University of Minnesota, graduating in 1938. He was a supervisor for a state youth employment program for two years, and in 1941 joined Lockheed in Burbank, Calif., as a personnel clerk.
In 1943, he married Maria Denend, who survives him. A son, Frederic, and a daughter, Nancy Nachman, are also among his survivors.
Mr. Hodgson joined the Navy in 1943, rose to lieutenant and became an intelligence officer in the Pacific during World War II. He was discharged in 1946 and returned to Lockheed to work in personnel and labor relations.
He participated in periodic contract negotiations with Lockheed's 100,000 employees and later with the International Association of Machinists, which represented aerospace workers. Union leaders regarded him as tough but fair-minded. He became vice president of industrial relations in 1968.
Lockheed, which built many of America's most famous wartime and postwar aircraft, was one of the first big corporations to recruit and train black and Hispanic workers in the early 1960s. Mr. Hodgson promoted that program and a company plan that chipped in 50 cents for every dollar that workers invested in stocks or savings.
In the 1960s, he was a consultant to the City of Los Angeles and the State of California on automation and staffing problems, and taught classes at the University of California, Los Angeles. With Marshall H. Brenner, he wrote "Successful Experience: Training Hard-Core Unemployed," a 1968 article in The Harvard Business Review.
After returning from his ambassadorship in Japan, Mr. Hodgson was chairman of the Pathfinder Mines Corporation, a uranium mining company, from 1977 to 1982, and served on other corporate boards as well. He also taught at Harvard, Stanford and other universities. He was the author of "American Senryu" (1992), a collection of short poems similar to haiku, and with Yoshihiro Sano and John L. Graham wrote "Doing Business With the New Japan" (2000).

Full text:   Washington
LAST month The Chronicle of Higher Education published a damning investigation of college athletes across the nation who were maintaining their eligibility by taking cheap, easy online courses from an obscure junior college.
In just 10 days, academically deficient players could earn three credits and an easy "A" from Western Oklahoma State College for courses like "Microcomputer Applications" (opening folders in Windows) or "Nutrition" (stating whether or not the students used vitamins). The Chronicle quoted one Big Ten academic adviser as saying, "You jump online, finish in a week and half, get your grade posted, and you're bowl-eligible."
On the face of it, this is another sad but familiar story of the big-money intercollegiate-athletics complex corrupting the ivory tower. But it also reveals a larger, more pervasive problem: there are no meaningful standards of academic quality in higher education. And the more colleges and universities move their courses online, the more severe the problem gets.
Much attention has been paid to for-profit colleges that offer degrees online while exploiting federal student-loan programs and saddling ill-prepared students with debt. But nearly all of the institutions caught up in the 10-day credit dodge exposed by The Chronicle were public, nonprofit institutions. And both the credit-givers, like Western Oklahoma, and the sports machines at the other end of the transaction, like Florida State University, were doing nothing illegal.
A main reason the scandal persists is that our system is built around the strange idea of the "credit hour," a unit of academic time that does little to measure student learning. The credit hour originated around the turn of the 20th century, when the industrialist-turned-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie moved to create a pension system for college professors. (It's now known as TIAA-CREF.) Pensions were reserved for professors who worked full time, which ended up being defined as a minimum of 12 hours of classroom teaching per week in a standard 15-week semester.
After World War II, higher education began a huge expansion, driven by the G.I. Bill, a changing economy and a booming middle class. It needed a way to count and manage millions of new students. Credit hours were easy to record, and already in place. That's why today, credit hours determine eligibility for financial aid and graduation (you generally need 120 for a bachelor's degree).
But colleges were left to judge the quality of credit hours by affixing grades to courses, and the quality of colleges themselves would be judged by -- well, there was the rub. Colleges didn't want to be judged by anyone other than themselves, and remarkably, the government went along with it. Yes, colleges are held accountable by nonprofit accrediting organizations -- but those are, in turn, run by other colleges. When asked, Western Oklahoma's accreditor said it had never heard of the school's three-credits-in-10-days scheme and would look into it. But the next scheduled accreditation review isn't until 2017.
The lack of meaningful academic standards in higher education drags down the entire system. Grade inflation, even (or especially) at the most elite institutions, is rampant. A landmark book published last year, "Academically Adrift," found that many students at traditional colleges showed no improvement in critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing, and spent their time socializing, working or wasting time instead of studying. (And that's not even considering the problem of low graduation rates.)
The rapid migration of higher education online exacerbates these problems. The notion of recording academic progress by counting the number of hours students spend sitting in a classroom is nonsensical when there is no actual classroom. Perhaps students themselves will decide what constitutes quality, as they choose among the so-called "massive online open courses" being offered free by brand-name universities including Harvard, M.I.T. and Stanford. I suspect those courses that will be most valued will be those where students actually learn.
But the most promising solution would be to replace the anachronistic credit hour with common standards for what college students actually need to know and to be able to do. There are many routes to doing this. In the arts and sciences, scholarly associations could define and update what it means to be proficient in a field. So could professional organizations and employers in vocational and technical fields.
Ending the antiquated credit hour would not only avert abuses involving college sports, but also prevent students of all kinds from taking the path of least resistance toward degrees that may be ultimately worthless.

Abstract: The most vocal proponent of focusing on economic goals, Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last month that the Fed should declare its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided that the rate of inflation did not exceed 2.5 percent.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce on Wednesday that it will continue buying Treasury securities to stimulate growth in the new year.
The Fed's public declaration in September that it would buy bonds until the outlook for the labor market "improved substantially" has cleared away much of the uncertainty and controversy that usually precedes such announcements.
The economic recovery remains lackluster and millions are looking for work. But while some analysts question the central bank's ability to improve the situation, few doubt that the Fed, under its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is determined to keep trying.
Indeed, while Fed officials continue to warn that a failure to avert scheduled tax increases and spending cuts next year would overwhelm their efforts and plunge the economy back into recession, they have also said that even if Congress and the White House negotiate a compromise, the Fed's efforts would continue.
"I am not prepared to say we are remotely close to substantial improvement on the employment front," Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said in a recent speech. "I expect that continued aggressive use of balance sheet monetary tools will be appropriate and justified by economic conditions for some time, even if fiscal cliff issues are properly addressed."
The remarks were particularly significant because Mr. Lockhart is among the moderate members of the Federal Open Market Committee whose support Mr. Bernanke invested months in winning before starting the new policy.
With the direction of policy clearly set, debate has turned to the details. The Fed, whose policy-making committee is meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, still must determine what to buy and how much to spend, and officials continue to debate the best way to describe when the agency is likely to stop buying.
In making those decisions, the Fed must balance its conviction that buying bonds reduces borrowing costs for businesses and consumers against concerns the purchases might disrupt financial markets or inhibit its control of inflation.
Analysts say the immediate answer is likely to be more of the same. The Fed currently buys $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion of Treasury securities a month. Officials highlighted that $85 billion figure in September, and have indicated since that it remained their rough target.
"It would be odd for them to disappoint the expectations that they have created themselves," Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients predicting that the Fed would maintain both the dollar amount and the division. Other analysts have suggested the Fed might slightly decrease the total amount of purchases, to $80 billion, or increase the share of mortgage securities.
The Fed is unlikely to announce a new timetable this week, analysts said. The committee has said that it does not plan to raise interest rates before the middle of 2015, and that it will stop buying bonds before it starts raising rates.
Many officials on the 12-member committee -- perhaps even the majority -- would prefer to substitute economic objectives for guidance set by the calendar. The Fed's ability to reduce borrowing costs derives in part from persuading investors that interest rates will remain low. Telling investors how the economic situation must change in order to warrant a change in policy could be more convincing, and therefore more potent, than simply publishing an estimated endpoint, these officials say.
But an account of the committee's previous meeting, in late October, showed that officials remained divided about which economic objectives to use.
The most vocal proponent of focusing on economic goals, Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last month that the Fed should declare its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided that the rate of inflation did not exceed 2.5 percent.
"I believe we have the ability to go even further in reassuring financial markets and the general public that policy will stay appropriately accommodative," Mr. Evans said in advocating the change during a speech in Toronto.
Other officials have misgivings about placing such emphasis on any single economic indicator, or on the unemployment rate in particular.
The discussions are moving slowly, in part because it is not clear the changes being contemplated would have significant benefits. The targets the Fed is considering closely resemble its own past practice, meaning the new thresholds would tend to reinforce rather than shift expectations.
Lou Crandall, chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, noted in a recent analysis that the unemployment rate exceeded 7 percent in the mid-1980s and again in the early 1990s, and in both cases the Fed waited until the rate fell well into the 6 percent range before it began to raise interest rates.
The relative complacency of Fed officials also reflects their judgment that the mortgage-bond purchases announced in September are working. Average interest rates on 30-year mortgages are at the lowest levels on record, averaging 3.35 percent in November, according to Freddie Mac's regular survey.
"This is solid evidence that our policy has been and continues to be effective -- though it is certainly not all-powerful in current circumstances," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last week.
To continue the companion purchases of Treasury securities, the Fed will need to change its approach. It is now buying long-term securities with proceeds from the sale of short-term securities, but it is running out of inventory to sell.
The most likely alternative is to create money by crediting the accounts of banks that sell bonds to the Fed, the same method now being used to buy mortgage bonds and also to finance earlier rounds of the Fed's so-called quantitative easing.
The Fed has repeatedly overestimated the health of the economy and the impact of its efforts. This time, officials have promised to maintain their efforts even as the economy shows signs of improvement. But they are once again sounding notes of cautious optimism about the coming year -- if Washington does not interfere.
A budget deal reducing deficits in the long term, Mr. Bernanke said in November, "could help make the new year a very good one for the American economy."

Full text:   Miami
OUTSIDE the United States, many real estate developers have less of an appetite for risk than their counterparts here.
In South America, for instance, developers typically ask buyers to pony up a big chunk of the total price of an apartment in a new development long before it's finished.
So South Americans pay huge installments -- often 50 percent or more of the cost of the unit by the time the building is completed. It's a system that most Americans, accustomed to financing at least 80 percent of a property with a bank loan, would consider unworkable.
I remember being shocked to learn from the owner of the apartment I rented in São Paulo, Brazil, where I lived as a foreign correspondent, about the schedule of huge payments -- totaling 57 percent -- he had had to deliver to the developer as the condo building went up. It was all nonrefundable, he told me.
But what if something went wrong, I asked him, like the developer going bankrupt? Or if the economy suddenly exploded into crisis, which is certainly not unheard of in South America?
He just shrugged. That's simply how things are done down south, where interest rates are much higher, and where historically high inflation made financing riskier and more expensive than in the United States. The practice is especially common in Brazil and Argentina, but also in smaller countries like Uruguay, where Donald Trump has a licensing agreement for a new residential tower in the beach resort of Punta del Este that will require down payments of 40 percent from buyers before construction begins.
That perspective offers a different lens on the risks that developers are taking in Miami's recent condo boomlet.
The Miami of today is not the Miami of 2004, when property prices were still rising in large part on a wave of speculation, with buyers putting down, at most, 20 percent and then flipping properties before construction was done.
This is post-bubble Miami, where banks are still skittish about backing new condo projects.
So Miami developers have taken a page from the South American playbook -- a handy strategy, given how many willing buyers are flocking to Miami from that continent. Developers of several condos downtown and at the beach are requiring initial deposits of 40 percent or more, and more as they get closer to completion. By the time the building is finished, buyers are forking over as much as 80 percent of the total price of their apartments.
"Essentially, the buyers are helping developers build their buildings," said Ann Nortmann, senior project director for Palau at Sunset Harbor, a 50-unit development planned for South Beach that requires a total deposit of only 40 percent because the developer, SMG Management, expects more American buyers.
Jorge M. Pérez, chairman of the Related Group of Florida and a chief architect of the new strategy, defends it as necessary to get developments off the ground, and to prevent speculators from flocking back to Miami, hoping to flip apartments as they did in the old days.
"Financing died during the recession," Mr. Pérez said. "We all were awakened by the things that happened. We said, 'If we don't have the buyers that will pay for the majority of the price in the building upfront, then we don't want to take the chance of building these buildings.' "
Related has employed the financing strategy in three buildings now under construction in South Florida (Apogee Beach, MyBrickell and Millecento) and in three others where sales, but not construction, have started (Beachwalk, Icon Bay and One Ocean). A 3,200-square-foot penthouse at One Ocean is listed for $8.5 million.
For all six towers, Related is requiring buyers to pay 40 percent by the time construction begins, and even more during construction. By the time they move in, buyers will have paid 50 percent to 80 percent of the total apartment price.
The strategy isn't exactly keeping buyers away. MyBrickell and Millecento, both in downtown Miami, have all their units under contract, while Apogee Beach has only two apartments out of 49 still available, according to a Related spokeswoman.
"People said there is no way people would pay that, and people have," Mr. Pérez said. That's in large part because South Americans are South Florida's biggest condo buyers right now. Argentines are "by far" the top buyers, he said, followed by Brazilians, Colombians, Venezuelans, Mexicans and Peruvians. Argentines concerned about high inflation in their country have seen Miami real estate as a stable place to park their money.
Wealthy Europeans, including some from economically distressed countries like Greece and Italy, are also flocking to Miami real estate, as are Americans from the Northeast and Chicago. Many of those buyers are willing to pay all cash for the condos.
Related is sitting on another 20 or so pieces of land from Palm Beach to Miami where it is considering beginning sales for developments "when we think the market is ready," Mr. Pérez said.
South Florida's real estate industry has been buzzing about more than 80 planned residential developments. But Mr. Pérez said he saw that as mostly hype.
"There is not that much development going on right now," he said. "There are a lot of projects that have been announced. But I don't know where they are going to get financing from."
For now, with buyers assuming more risk, they don't have to worry as much. Still, "South Americans are not stupid. They are not going to give money to someone they don't think is going to deliver the building."
The new financing strategy is great for developers, who can reduce their risk, but it carries some downsides. For one, it has motivated developers to build more towers for the rich -- mostly with foreigners in mind, though they rarely want to admit that -- and not for middle-class Americans who simply cannot afford the big down payments, real estate lawyers said.
That could keep lenders from returning to more traditional lending practices, which some appraisers believe is necessary for Miami's bifurcated real estate market to become truly healthy again. As it is, luxury residences are breaking price records even as tens of thousands of foreclosure cases clog the courts.
Inspections are also an issue. Normally banks require regular inspections during construction to ensure that the buildings are meeting standards. With banks out of the process, developers won't face the same level of scrutiny, real estate lawyers said.
"Will a developer cut corners?" said Avi Tryson, a lawyer with Beloff Parker Jacobs PLC in Miami Beach. "I am sure they might." It will fall to government authorities, which require some inspections of their own, to police developers, he said.
And buyers, of course, will have more nonrefundable skin in the game. If they cannot close for whatever reason, developers don't have to refund the big down payments. "But we will work to help you sell your unit," Mr. Pérez said.
For now, Related will stick to the high down-payment strategy in its new planned developments. At some point, Mr. Pérez predicted, developers will loosen rules to require 30 percent down.
"The world is going to change," he said. "I just hope we don't go back to the past, when we had very highly leveraged buildings" that attracted speculators.
Mr. Tryson, the lawyer, sees the big-money spigot -- still flowing so strongly from South America especially -- eventually shutting off.
"I don't know how long it can continue," he said. "There is only so much foreign money. There is only so much domestic money. At some point there has to be a breaking point where they implement a more mixed model or go back to 20 percent."

Abstract: Twisting describes some of what the Fed has been doing in recent months, as well as back in 1961: shifting the duration of its portfolio by selling short-term securities and buying longer-term ones. Because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, large purchases of longer-term securities can be expected to drive up those prices and lower those longer-term interest rates.

Full text:   TIME is running out for Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve stimulus program named for that hip-swiveling dance from the 1960s.
The Fed's twist is scheduled to end soon, mainly because the central bank is running low on the short-term securities that keep the action going. Decorum may prevent it from adopting "Gangnam Style" moves right now, but the Fed's mesmerizing dance with the bond market isn't over yet.
"The bond market is counting on the Fed -- and can keep counting on it -- to hold short-term interest rates near zero for some time to come," said Kathy A. Jones, fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research. And with the weak economy vulnerable to a shock if the Congress and White House don't reach an agreement soon on fiscal policy, the Fed is likely to introduce further innovations, perhaps as early as this week.
The Fed's hypnotizing moves have captivated the bond market for many months, said Ed Yardeni, an independent economist. "The stock market still reacts to news events these days; the bond market barely does. The Fed has put it in a nearly perpetual rally." That can't last forever, but ultralow yields and remarkably rich prices have persisted largely because of the Fed's daring experiments and interventions.
When Operation Twist arrived in September 2011, it was a retro maneuver with a Kennedy pedigree. In February 1961, the country was in recession and unemployment was high (though it was only 6.8 percent, compared with 7.7 percent today and 9.1 percent in September 2011). President John F. Kennedy declared that he would stimulate the economy with a joint Fed-Treasury operation first called Operation Nudge, because it involved nudging interest rates by altering the composition of the Fed's portfolio.
That name didn't catch on. Instead, traders called it Operation Twist in homage to the dance popularized by Chubby Checker. Twisting describes some of what the Fed has been doing in recent months, as well as back in 1961: shifting the duration of its portfolio by selling short-term securities and buying longer-term ones. Because bond prices and yields move in opposite directions, large purchases of longer-term securities can be expected to drive up those prices and lower those longer-term interest rates.
Despite the Fed's bulk sales, current short-term rates have remained low, largely because the Fed exercises considerable influence over those rates.
The twist appears to be winding down, though, because "the Fed has replaced $667 billion in short-term Treasuries on its balance sheet with an equivalent amount in longer-term Treasures" since September 2011, according to "A Citizen's Guide to Unconventional Monetary Policy," a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Capital Economics, a research firm, said in a separate report that the Fed "doesn't have any more short-term Treasury securities to sell, at least not with maturities of less than three years."
Many market strategists assume that the Fed will shift to outright purchases of Treasury securities without selling shorter-term securities from its portfolio, expanding its already swollen balance sheet. It ballooned from $869 billion in August 2007 to "well over $2 trillion," according to the Fed's Web site.
Since 2008, the Fed has engaged in three rounds of unconventional large-scale asset purchases, known as quantitative easing. In the first round, QE1, from November 2008 to March 2010, it bought $1.75 trillion in long-term Treasuries and other securities, the Richmond Fed said. In QE2, from November 2010 through June 2011, it bought $600 billion in long-term Treasuries. QE3 has been under way since September 2012, with the Fed buying $40 billion each month in mortgage-backed securities.
Now, said Ned Davis Research in a report last week, the Fed is likely to replace Operation Twist with purchases of Treasuries, perhaps in the $45 billion a month range, bringing its total monthly purchases to $85 billion.
Similarly, Jim McDonald, Northern Trust's chief investment strategist, said: "With the problems the economy's been facing -- and with the prospect of a fiscal cliff in Washington -- we expect the Fed to err on the side of accommodation, and convert Operation Twist into full-bore quantitative easing."
As Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen is reputed to have said, "A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking real money."
RECENT speeches by Fed officials reveal that they are considering an additional option -- engaging in more explicit "forward guidance" about their intentions, linking their policy on interest rates to metrics like the unemployment and inflation rates.
"This is all about signaling," Ms. Jones said -- about using language and numbers to persuade investors, consumers and people in business that money will be cheap and plentiful for a long time to come.
During the worst phase of the financial crisis, the Fed's extraordinarily expansive monetary policy was intended to prevent the economy from plunging into a possible depression. These days, it is intended to help restore vigor to the economy, with mixed results so far. The November survey of Blue Chip Economic Indicators, for example, showed that economic forecasters expected gross domestic product growth of only 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, along with 2 percent annual growth in 2013.
Recent data suggests a possible downward revision for 2013. And unless the White House and Congressional negotiators reach an agreement soon, the economic impact of a fiscal impasse is likely to be severe -- including a 2013 recession, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
While the stock market has been jumping and stumbling in apparent response to incremental news on the Washington fiscal negotiations -- A deal is on! No it's not! Yes it is! -- the bond market has been eerily buoyant, Mr. Yardeni said. He coined the term "bond vigilantes" in 1983 to describe bond-buyers who punished the Reagan administration for its swelling budget deficits.
"Now, " Mr. Yardeni said, "the Fed has stymied the bond vigilantes in the United States by taking bond rates as close to zero as you can get them." For the foreseeable future, he said, that market is likely to keep following the Fed's mesmerizing lead.

Full text:   In March 1991, Michael R. Milken, once the richest and most powerful financier of his generation, entered prison, signaling the end of an era of junk bond-financed hostile takeovers and high-visibility prosecutions that law enforcement officials hoped would deter insider trading for generations.
But now, less than one generation later, federal prosecutors and enforcement lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission have exposed a vast network of insider trading that in its sophistication, breadth and profits dwarfs that of the earlier era. And with the emergence of Steven A. Cohen, the founder of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, as a subject of interest, the government has identified a financier whose power and wealth surpasses even that of Mr. Milken in his heyday.
Why has insider trading proved so persistent, even in the face of prosecutions and popular Hollywood films like "Wall Street"?
The risk-versus-reward equation that has always been a factor in financial markets has changed drastically in the last 20 years. Ivan F. Boesky, the once-celebrated arbitrageur who admitted to insider trading after preaching to graduates of the University of California, Berkeley in 1986 that "Greed is all right, by the way," had to pay fines and restitution then considered a milestone: $100 million.
When the government revealed that Mr. Milken earned $550 million in a single year in the 1980s, the sum astonished Wall Street and even his fellow traders at his now-defunct firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert. The Wall Street Journal calculated that $550 million was more than it cost to launch the space shuttle, build a B-1 bomber or, adjusted for inflation, pay for the Louisiana Purchase. (Mr. Milken's take would be $1.07 billion in 2011 dollars.)
By contrast, the average hedge fund manager in the top 25 performers today makes that in a good year, and a few have earned more than $4 billion in a single year. Mr. Cohen reportedly earned $1.4 billion in 2009, and Forbes estimated his net worth in 2012 at $8.8 billion. (Mr. Milken's fortune, by comparison, is estimated by Forbes at $2 billion, which puts him in the middle of the magazine's list of the richest 400 Americans.)
At the same time, the tactics and technologies available to inside traders today are more sophisticated and more difficult both to detect and to prove.
A large majority of hedge funds have not been tainted by any wrongdoing, just as most junk bond traders were never accused of any crime. Mr. Cohen hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing nor has his firm, although the S.E.C. has said it may face civil charges.
This week, I stopped by St. Andrews Plaza in Lower Manhattan to see Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and his deputy, Richard Zabel, the former head of the criminal division. Both said they couldn't discuss any pending cases. But many people who work in financial markets "are highly skilled at cost-benefit analysis," Mr. Bharara told me. "They're highly intelligent. They've been to the best schools. They weigh the risk of getting caught against the potential reward, and they decide it's worth the risk. We're trying to tilt that equation."
There's no doubt that the potential for gain "has soared," Robert S. Khuzami, head of enforcement at the S.E.C., told me, and not because there are more takeovers and other market-moving events to trade on. "That's a big change from the 1980s and '90s. Hedge funds can take massive positions, use short-selling and derivatives, and employ trading techniques that aren't transparent, and make huge amounts of money on small fluctuations on price. They don't need to hit a home run on a $20 pop on a takeover announcement. These bets may be bunts and singles, but they get to the same place."
Even at lower rungs of the hedge fund world, the potential gains have shot up. Mathew Martoma, a former SAC trader who was accused last month of using secret information to help SAC gain profits, was paid a $9.4 million bonus in 2008, when he was just 34. At the same time, the cost of failure can be catastrophic. When he failed to replicate that kind of information, he was fired a little more than a year later. (Mr. Martoma pleaded not guilty to the charge, and, through his lawyer, has denied any wrongdoing.)
The pressure to get an "edge," as hedge fund traders often put it, has never been greater. "There's a cruciblelike intensity of competition now that didn't exist at the time of Boesky," Mr. Zabel told me. "With hedge funds, there's a lot of capital, and they're competing ruthlessly. You have to be better every quarter or you're not going to exist. Add the tremendous incentive of great wealth, and it's not surprising that some people lack the moral fiber to resist that kind of pressure."
Even as the potential rewards have soared, the nature of today's trading -- the bunts and singles, as Mr. Khuzami put it -- has made enforcement more difficult, leading to what seems to have been a perception of less risk of getting caught. In the wake of the Milken-Boesky era, the government has become sophisticated at monitoring major market-moving events like takeover announcements, to the point that insider trading on major corporate news has become relatively rare (though just this week the S.E.C. charged an old-fashioned insider trading ring based on leaks about proposed mergers and acquisitions).
Modern technology has also rendered obsolete the use of suitcases of cash, secret passwords and other subterfuges I described in "Den of Thieves," my 1991 book about Mr. Milken, Mr. Boesky and insider trading in the 1980s. "In the 1980s, you had to meet someone, or have lunch or exchange information in ways that were slower and more visible," Mr. Zabel said. "Now, you can have only the glow of your computer screen on your face and you can scoop up all sorts of valuable information from all over the country or even the world. If you get even little bits, you can trade on a daily or hourly basis on micromovements."
But technology has cut both ways. Although some critics say the S.E.C.'s expertise has lagged advances in areas like high-frequency trading, the enforcement division has made progress in monitoring suspicious trading. "We've created databases to see who is trading in tandem, even if you know nothing about an event," Mr. Khuzami said. "It's a trader-based approach, not an issuer-based approach. These trading patterns are the first clue to what might be insider trading rings. You then have to do the real detective work, pulling phone records and e-mails and using other techniques to uncover the links. "
There's no doubt that the new techniques have been yielding results. Since Mr. Bharara became a United States attorney in 2009, his office has charged 75 people with insider trading, including such now-household names as Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, and Rajat K. Gupta, a former McKinsey chief and Goldman Sachs director. His office has secured 69 convictions or guilty pleas without losing a case (six are pending and more are said to be in the pipeline). Many of those cases were developed in conjunction with the S.E.C., which has brought over 200 enforcement actions since 2009. "These have been cases of hard-core insider trading, and they've done a marvelous job," said Harvey Pitt, the former S.E.C. chairman who previously represented Mr. Boesky (and has lectured SAC employees on compliance with securities law).
It's still too soon to measure the deterrent effect of the latest wave of cases, but it's surely substantial. For the most part, inside traders aren't hardened criminals but rational decision-makers. When confronted by an F.B.I. agent in his front yard, Mr. Martoma fainted. "What we're trying to accomplish is deterrence," Mr. Bharara said. He mentioned that the jurors in the Gupta case openly wept as they rendered their guilty verdict, which they must have known meant the ruin of a once-illustrious career and reputation. "I want smart people to see that and say, 'I never want that to happen to me.' "
One thing that apparently hasn't changed is motive, and a question hovering over insider trading prosecutions then and now is why people who are already so rich and successful would resort to criminal activity. "Sometimes, it's about the money or a bigger house in the Hamptons or wanting to climb the social ladder," Mr. Khuzami said. "But for the already-rich, it's mostly about ego and being a player. A winning tip impresses others and makes them part of the club."
Mr. Pitt added: "My bottom line is that not a lot has really changed. Cheating is still cheating. Insider trading is cheating. It's an effort to get an edge and give yourself an advantage you know you're not supposed to have."
"Far too many people are questioning whether the markets give you a fair shake or whether inside traders are taking advantage of them," Mr. Pitt said. "That's bad for capitalism, bad for capital formation and very bad for the country."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Acknowledging that the economy is likely to remain weak well into next year, the European Central Bank sharply reduced its growth forecast for the euro zone Thursday, and left its main interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent.
Meanwhile the central bank in Britain, which does not use the euro, also decided to hold its benchmark interest rate at a record low, amid indicators that the outlook for the British economy was dimming, largely because of troubles in the euro zone. The Bank of England kept the rate at 0.5 percent.
Mario Draghi, the E.C.B. president, cited economic uncertainty for the 17 euro zone countries in scaling back the bank's prediction outlook for 2013. Compared with a previous growth forecast of 0.5 percent of growth in gross domestic product for the currency bloc, he said growth at best was unlikely to exceed 0.3 percent. And the euro zone economy could even end up shrinking 0.9 percent next year, he said.
Among the risks that could hamper future growth, Mr. Draghi listed "uncertainties about the resolution of sovereign debt and governance issues in the euro area, geopolitical issues and fiscal policy decisions in the United States."
Yet he left room for the prospect of a return to more positive figures later next year, citing recent indicators showing increased business confidence in France, Germany and Italy.
In London on Thursday, the Bank of England not only held interest rates steady, but signaled no change in its economic stimulus program, which has called for purchasing £375 billion, or some $600 billion, in government bonds to pump more money into the economy.
The government had said Wednesday that it would take a year longer to bring Britain's budget deficit under control because the economic recovery had slowed, mainly because of troubles in the euro zone.
The Bank of England is evaluating its options to fuel the British economy, which is again running out of steam after emerging from a double-dip recession earlier this year.
Apart from its bond-buying stimulus program, known as quantitative easing, the central bank has also been helping banks access capital more cheaply to be able to lend more. Some economists said more stimulus might be needed to bring back more stable growth and allow the government to meet its debt reduction target.
"Given that economic data has weakened if anything over the last month or so, further quantitative easing remains in the cards," said Victoria Clarke, an economist at Investec in London.
The British economy is likely to shrink 0.1 percent this year before expanding 1.2 percent next year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent agency. That compares with 0.8 percent growth predicted for this year in March and a 2 percent expansion for next year.
Some economists expect the Bank of England to restart its bond purchasing program early next year as a way to inject more money into the economy.
For the E.C.B., in a year where it has cut its rates to a record low, introduced a EUR1 trillion, or a $1.3 trillion, program of lending to banks and announced its willingness to purchase bonds from heavily indebted countries within the euro zone, the decision to leave the benchmark interest rate untouched seemed to reflect an eagerness to shift some of the burden of responsibility back to governments.
Mr. Draghi called it "essential" that countries continue restructuring their financial sectors and reduce their amount of public debt, but refrained from indicating that any further programs were in the offing to help ease the crisis, now entering its third year.
The E.C.B.'s benchmark rate has lost much of its power to influence market rates in troubled corners of the euro zone. Credit remains expensive in countries like Portugal and Italy because of lingering fear among lenders that the euro zone could splinter.
"There were no clear hints on unconventional measures of credit easing," wrote Elga Bartsch, a researcher with Morgan Stanley, in a note to investors. "In fact, when asked about additional measures the E.C.B. could take, Mr. Draghi rattled through what the E.C.B. has done in the past and the positive impact that these measures have had."
Among those successful programs was a decision to make cheap, three-year loans available to European banks, largely credited with helping to avert a banking crisis and lowering borrowing costs for countries like Italy and Spain. The bank announced six more dates when banks would be able to borrow money in the first half of 2013.
Another mechanism that has helped stimulate lending has been the pledge to buy bonds of troubled countries to help contain their borrowing costs and remove fear of a euro breakup.
So far, the mere threat of E.C.B. bond buying has been enough to push down the borrowing of vulnerable countries like Spain and Italy. But many economists wonder how long the tenuous calm on debt markets can last, and speculation has mounted that Spain will be the first country to take advantage of the offer.
But Mariano Rajoy, prime minister of Spain, has said he wants assurances that his country's debt yields would be brought down if it were to participate. Mr. Draghi rejected any preconditions for entry into the bond-buying program, dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions, citing the stipulations for participation announced in September.
"The conditions under which the O.M.T. is going to be activated are very straight," Mr. Draghi said. "They don't talk about negotiations or a certain interest rate or anything like that."
Mr. Draghi also expressed confidence that European leaders would reach agreement soon on a unified regulatory framework for banks, but he insisted that such a system cover all 6,000 banks in the region -- a position that is sure to displease Germany, which wants to retain control over the small banks that do most of the lending in that country.
Inflation in the euro zone has fallen close to the E.C.B.'s official target of 2 percent, leaving room for a rate cut. Still, a cut would have been a surprise. The central bank "has explained before that it thinks such a cut would have no impact on the economy as the transmission mechanism remains impaired," Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, wrote in an e-mail.
Mr. Draghi gave no clear indication whether a rate cut had been discussed among the central bankers, saying only that "there was a wide discussion, but in the end, the prevailing decision was to leave the rates unchanged."
Some members of the E.C.B. Governing Council may well have been concerned that a rate cut would use up one of the last policy weapons they have left.
"The E.C.B. is out of ammo," Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York, wrote Wednesday in his daily memo to clients. "We cannot imagine what it might do at its meeting tomorrow that would make any difference."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   Let's get one thing straight: America is not facing a fiscal crisis. It is, however, still very much experiencing a job crisis.
It's easy to get confused about the fiscal thing, since everyone's talking about the "fiscal cliff." Indeed, one recent poll suggests that a large plurality of the public believes that the budget deficit will go up if we go off that cliff.
In fact, of course, it's just the opposite: The danger is that the deficit will come down too much, too fast. And the reasons that might happen are purely political; we may be about to slash spending and raise taxes not because markets demand it, but because Republicans have been using blackmail as a bargaining strategy, and the president seems ready to call their bluff.
Moreover, despite years of warnings from the usual suspects about the dangers of deficits and debt, our government can borrow at incredibly low interest rates -- interest rates on inflation-protected U.S. bonds are actually negative, so investors are paying our government to make use of their money. And don't tell me that markets may suddenly turn on us. Remember, the U.S. government can't run out of cash (it prints the stuff), so the worst that could happen would be a fall in the dollar, which wouldn't be a terrible thing and might actually help the economy.
Yet there is a whole industry built around the promotion of deficit panic. Lavishly funded corporate groups keep hyping the danger of government debt and the urgency of deficit reduction now now now -- except that these same groups are suddenly warning against too much deficit reduction. No wonder the public is confused.
Meanwhile, there is almost no organized pressure to deal with the terrible thing that is actually happening right now -- namely, mass unemployment. Yes, we've made progress over the past year. But long-term unemployment remains at levels not seen since the Great Depression: as of October, 4.9 million Americans had been unemployed for more than six months, and 3.6 million had been out of work for more than a year.
When you see numbers like those, bear in mind that we're looking at millions of human tragedies: at individuals and families whose lives are falling apart because they can't find work, at savings consumed, homes lost and dreams destroyed. And the longer this goes on, the bigger the tragedy.
There are also huge dollars-and-cents costs to our unmet jobs crisis. When willing workers endure forced idleness society as a whole suffers from the waste of their efforts and talents. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that what we are actually producing falls short of what we could and should be producing by around 6 percent of G.D.P., or $900 billion a year.
Worse yet, there are good reasons to believe that high unemployment is undermining our future growth as well, as the long-term unemployed come to be considered unemployable, as investment falters in the face of inadequate sales.
So what can be done? The panic over the fiscal cliff has been revelatory. It shows that even the deficit scolds are closet Keynesians. That is, they believe that right now spending cuts and tax hikes would destroy jobs; it's impossible to make that claim while denying that temporary spending increases and tax cuts would create jobs. Yes, our still-depressed economy needs more fiscal stimulus.
And, to his credit, President Obama did include a modest amount of stimulus in his initial budget offer; the White House, at least, hasn't completely forgotten about the unemployed. Unfortunately, almost nobody expects those stimulus plans to be included in whatever deal is eventually reached.
So why aren't we helping the unemployed? It's not because we can't afford it. Given those ultralow borrowing costs, plus the damage unemployment is doing to our economy and hence to the tax base, you can make a pretty good case that spending more to create jobs now would actually improve our long-run fiscal position.
Nor, I think, is it really ideology. Even Republicans, when opposing cuts in defense spending, immediately start talking about how such cuts would destroy jobs -- and I'm sorry, but weaponized Keynesianism, the assertion that government spending creates jobs, but only if it goes to the military, doesn't make sense.
No, in the end it's hard to avoid concluding that it's about class. Influential people in Washington aren't worried about losing their jobs; by and large they don't even know anyone who's unemployed. The plight of the unemployed simply doesn't loom large in their minds -- and, of course, the unemployed don't hire lobbyists or make big campaign contributions.
So the unemployment crisis goes on and on, even though we have both the knowledge and the means to solve it. It's a vast tragedy -- and it's also an outrage.

Full text:   Washington
WITH the budget-and-tax showdown dominating headlines, most Americans probably missed an even more ominous story: according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, America's underlying growth rate -- that is, the best the economy could do, under optimal conditions, without driving up inflation -- has slowed from just under 4 percent a year in 2000 to just under 2 percent today.
Why does this matter? For one thing, the combination of a lower underlying growth rate, which you could think of as the economy's speed limit, and a less equitable distribution of that growth was a reason middle-income households did so badly and poverty went up in the 2000s.
During the 1990s, in contrast, stronger demand for goods and services led to much faster job growth and the last real gains experienced by middle- and lower-income households. Faster growth in those years also spun off a lot more government revenues, which interacted with slightly higher tax rates to take the budget from deficit to surplus.
Why has the underlying growth rate slowed? It's actually pretty simple: growth is determined by the supply of labor and capital -- i.e., people and machines -- and how efficiently we use those inputs to make the output, or gross domestic product.
According to the report, we're slipping on all fronts. As baby boomers head toward retirement, the growth of the labor force is decelerating; it is expected to grow about half as fast over the next decade as over the last.
This problem was exacerbated by the deep recession, as even younger un- and underemployed workers got discouraged with their job prospects and left the job market (though many will be back when things pick up). Also, for years the influx of women into the labor force raised the economy's speed limit; that trend plateaued about a decade ago.
We've done better on the productivity side. But we've underinvested in our capital stock -- factories, the machines inside them and software. In the 1990s, when the economy's speed limit was growing, the flow of services from capital stock increased 4.7 percent a year; in the 2000s, its growth slowed sharply to 2.4 percent, even though tax rates on such investment were considerably lower.
In other words, our workers and machinery are still highly productive, but we've been underinvesting in them. In fact, according to the Congressional Budget Office, this investment deficit explains more than a third of the slower underlying growth rate.
Can we do anything about this? Some economists think of the potential growth rate as they do a person's height: it may be too bad they're short, but if you try to make them taller, you'll just waste resources on a lost cause. Recessions may be amenable to monetary and fiscal policy, but structural shortfalls are a function of demographics, resource constraints and technological limits.
But that's not quite right. Sometimes people don't hit their potential height because they didn't get enough nutrition, and it's the same thing with economies. Bad public policy is to blame as well.
Our whole policy focus in this space tends to be on tax policy -- specifically, on cutting taxes on investors and so-called job creators. But that type of "supply-side" taxation has obviously been a bust. We have to look elsewhere, and fast.
First of all, the distinction between the cyclical and the structural is artificial. Bad cyclical growth begets bad structural growth; persistent cyclical weakness in demand -- a long recession, long periods of high unemployment -- reduces potential growth. Workers who experience long-term unemployment thanks to a harsh cyclical downturn can find themselves less employable because of skill deterioration once the market picks up.
A weak-demand economy requires fewer workers and less capital investment. It also dampens forward-looking investment, and thus the supply of productive capital: American corporations are sitting on almost $2 trillion in reserves that they're not investing for lack of good options.
The first thing to do is keep applying the accelerator on pro-growth policies that strengthen near-term demand and labor quality, including paycheck supports (like the payroll tax break), training for unemployed workers and investment in bridges, tunnels and other infrastructure. Over the longer term, we might want to think of immigration reform as a way to counteract our decelerating work force.
For now, though, we're into a negative loop where persistently weak demand is chipping away at the labor and capital supply and productivity advances needed to increase our potential growth rate. Supply-side, deregulatory zeal has deprived the economy of investments in infrastructure and other public goods, innovative research and the oversight necessary to prevent the shampoo cycles -- bubble, bust, repeat -- that are whacking away at our potential growth rates.
This can all be corrected, but we've got to stop setting fiscal traps for ourselves and squabbling about a few points on the marginal tax rate. Instead, let's start taking the steps that can get this economy back up to speed.

Full text:   Other than poverty, José Carrillo and Joshua Williams have little in common. The austere life of Mr. Carrillo, a 79-year-old Peruvian immigrant from Washington Heights, is a universe apart from the hardscrabble reality of Mr. Williams, a 28-year-old single father from Atlanta staying at his aunt's place in Brooklyn to save on rent.
But their lives are connected. They both work in the fast-food industry -- Mr. Carrillo at a McDonald's in Midtown Manhattan and Mr. Williams at a Wendy's in Brooklyn. They both earn a little more than $7 an hour. And they both need food stamps to survive. Last Thursday, both did something they had never done before: they went on strike.
Their activism, part of a flash strike of some 200 workers from fast-food restaurants around New York City, caps a string of unorthodox actions sponsored by organized labor, including worker protests outside Walmart stores, which, like most fast-food chains, are opposed to being unionized, and union drives at carwashes in New York and Los Angeles.
Labor unions are hoping that the unusual tactics, often in collaboration with social justice activists and other community groups, will offer them a new opportunity to get back on the offensive, helping to raise the floor for wages and working conditions in the harsh, ultracompetitive economy of the 21st century.
Mr. Carrillo's and Mr. Williams's meager salaries also underscore the straightforward choice we face as a nation: either we build an economy in which most workers can earn enough to adequately support their families or we build a government with the wherewithal to subsidize the existence of a lower class that can't survive on its own. We are doing neither.
More than two million workers toil in food preparation jobs at limited-service restaurants like McDonald's, according to government statistics. They are the lowest-paid workers in the country, government figures show, typically earning $8.69 an hour. A study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning research organization, concluded that almost three-quarters of them live in poverty. And they are unlikely to have ever contemplated joining a union.
On a full-time schedule, they could make a little over $18,000 a year, just about enough to keep a family of two parents and one child at the threshold of poverty. But full-time work is hard to come by. With fast-food restaurants increasingly using scheduling software to adjust staffing levels, workers can no longer count on a steady stream of work. Their hours can be cut sharply from one week to the next based on the business outlook or even the weather.
Orley Ashenfelter, a labor economist at Princeton, published a study earlier this year that captured the plight of workers under the Golden Arches in a novel way: measuring pay by the burgers a worker could buy for an hour of work, he calculated that the real wages of McDonald's workers in the United States hit about 2.2 Big Macs an hour last year. That's 15 percent less than in 2000.
Many economists will argue that concern about the lowly McJob is misplaced. These jobs offer a wage to people with no training or education. Mr. Carrillo, for instance, doesn't speak English. "To get a better job at my age, you need a profession," he says. To improve the lives of American workers, most economists argue, we might do better by focusing on education to equip them with the skills to perform more productive, better-paid jobs.
But this argument overlooks the fact that the McJob is hardly a niche of the labor market reserved for the uneducated few. Rather, it might be the biggest job of our future.
The American labor market has been hollowing out for decades -- losing many of the middle-skilled, relatively well-paid jobs in manufacturing that can be performed more cheaply by machines or workers overseas. It has split between a high end of well-educated workers, and a low end of less-educated workers performing jobs, mostly in the service sector, that cannot be outsourced or mechanized.
This process is not expected to reverse any time soon. According to government statistics, personal care aides will make up the fastest-growing occupation this decade. The Economic Policy Institute study found that some 57 percent of them live in poverty.
This poses an existential question for labor unions, which are struggling because of the loss of union jobs to automation and stiff competition, both from cheaper labor in the mostly union-free South and developing nations around the world: can they do something to improve workers' lot?
They have in the past. A recent study by the International Labor Organization concluded that low-wage work was rare where unionization rates were high. In countries where more than half of workers belong to a union, only 12 percent of jobs pay less than two-thirds of the middle wage, on average.
Still, there is little reason to believe that American labor unions can do much to lift the floor on wages in the future. Fewer than 7 percent of workers in the private sector are in a union. We have the largest share of low-paid jobs in the industrial world, amounting to almost one in four full-time workers, according to the International Labor Organization. And our rates of unionization continue to fall.
Union leaders know they are fighting long odds -- hemmed in by legal decisions limiting how they can organize and protest, while trying to organize workers in industries of low skill and high turnover like fast food. But they hope to have come upon a winning strategy, applying some of the tactics that workers used before the Wagner Act created the federal legal right to unionize in 1935.
"We must go back to the strategies of nonviolent disruption of the 1930s," suggests Stephen Lerner, a veteran organizer and strategist formerly at the Service Employees International Union, one of the unions behind the fast-food strike. "You can't successfully organize without large-scale civil disobedience. The law will change when employers say there's too much disruption. We need another system."
In the 1990s and 2000s, the S.E.I.U. unionized tens of thousands of mostly Latino janitors from Los Angeles to Houston, including thousands of illegal immigrants, who were until then considered impossible to organize because of their legal status. It did so by putting pressure not only on the building maintenance contractors but also on the building owners who hired them, often resorting to bare-knuckle tactics. In 1990, the union asked members to mail their trash to Judd Malkin, the chairman of the company that owned buildings in the Century City complex in Los Angeles, printing his address on garbage bags. Mr. Malkin met Mr. Lerner soon thereafter.
The second part of the S.E.I.U.'s strategy was equally important. Rather than proposing a union contract for janitors as a narrow goal, the S.E.I.U.'s "Justice for Janitors" campaign framed the effort as a broad movement for the economic rights of low-wage workers. And the union rallied local politicians, community leaders and civil rights groups to their cause.
If unions alone may be powerless, the thinking goes, they can be powerful as part of a broader social movement. "We need workers to come together in formations they haven't done before," says Mary Kay Henry, who heads the S.E.I.U. "The tipping point is the entire low-wage economy."
The odds that organized labor can tip the scales remain long, however. The S.E.I.U. did organize many janitors, but it did not stem the decline of unions across the economy. Despite the victories, janitors in the United States today earn about 10 percent less on average than they did in 1990, in inflation-adjusted terms.
Still, if employers can't be swayed to take on more responsibility for the welfare of their workers, the burden will fall on taxpayers. To put it succinctly, the bottom 40 percent of families earn less than they did almost a quarter of a century ago. If that trend continues, we may need a much bigger government.

Abstract: Mr. Crapo said Congress could agree on some additional cuts to health care providers and change the way inflation is calculated to slow not only automatic increases in Medicare and Social Security benefits, but also the annual rise in tax brackets.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- For all the growing angst over the state of negotiations to head off a fiscal crisis in January, the parties are farthest apart on a relatively small part of the overall deficit reduction program -- the down payment.
President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, are in general agreement that the relevant Congressional committees must sit down next year and work out changes to the tax code and entitlement programs to save well more than $1 trillion over the next decade.
But before that work begins, both men want Congress to approve a first installment on deficit reduction in the coming weeks. The installment would replace the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that make up the "fiscal cliff," while signaling Washington's seriousness about getting its fiscal house in order. That is where the chasm lies in size and scope.
Mr. Obama says the down payment should be large and made up almost completely of tax increases on top incomes, partly because he and Congressional leaders last year agreed on some spending cuts over the next decade but have yet to agree on any tax increases.
Republicans have countered by arguing for a smaller down payment that must include immediate savings from Medicare and other social programs. Republicans, using almost mirror-image language, have said that they do not want to agree to specific tax increases and vague promises of future spending cuts.
Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee and part of a bipartisan "Gang of Six" senators who devised the two-stage process, said: "I think there's a lot of confusion between the initial down payment and the framework. That's for sure."
The two biggest areas of dispute are tax increases and the big government health insurance programs, Medicare and Medicaid. On the health programs, neither side believes Congress could meaningfully overhaul them in the four weeks that remain before the fiscal deadline.
"Entitlement reform is a big step, and it affects tens of millions of people," said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, another architect of the two-stage framework. "It's not just a matter of cutting spending in an appropriation. It's changing policy. And that's why I was reluctant to include it in the down-payment conversation. I want this to be a thoughtful effort on both sides that doesn't jeopardize this program."
But Republicans say that it is possible to make some initial changes to the programs in coming weeks. "There are simpler things that can be done," said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho and another Gang of Six member. "The real structural changes would come later."
Mr. Crapo said Congress could agree on some additional cuts to health care providers and change the way inflation is calculated to slow not only automatic increases in Medicare and Social Security benefits, but also the annual rise in tax brackets.
Democrats instead argue that the down payment should consist of a combination of tax increases and cuts to programs outside Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, like farm programs. Mr. Obama has pushed for a return to the top tax rates under President Bill Clinton.
Republican leaders have said that they are willing to raise new tax revenues -- albeit not as much as Democrats want -- but Republicans want taxes to rise by closing loopholes and curbing tax deductions and credits.
If the two sides are able to come to an agreement on the down payment, it would also likely fix targets for larger savings in the tax code and entitlement programs. The White House and Congress would then spend much of the next year trying to hash out the specific policy changes needed to hit those targets.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Republican Congressional leaders on Monday countered President Obama's deficit reduction proposal with a plan of their own that is far heavier on spending cuts but embraces $800 billion in new taxes over the next 10 years.
The counteroffer represented an acknowledgment by Republicans that they had to issue their own proposal to head off around $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts next year, a fiscal combination that could send the economy back into recession. They said that their approach was a move toward the center rather than sticking to a position established last year with the passage of the House Republican budget, which included contentious changes to Medicare and Medicaid and deep domestic spending reductions.
"Mindful of the status quo election and past exchanges on these questions, we recognize it would be counterproductive to publicly or privately propose entitlement reforms that you and the leaders of your party appear unwilling to support in the near term," Republican leaders wrote in a letter to Mr. Obama.
The president's offer, forwarded to Congressional leaders by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner last week, stuck almost word for word with the proposal the administration released nearly a year ago. Monday's Republican offer on taxes was close to what Speaker John A. Boehner offered during private talks with Mr. Obama last year.
But it did bring some Republican concessions. Senior Republican leadership aides said the $800 billion in new revenue would come from increases in tax receipts, not from increased economic growth, as Republican leaders have often suggested since the number emerged from the Boehner-Obama talks. But the plan would extend the expiring Bush-era tax cuts for high-income Americans, something the president has said he will not agree to.
The offer itself -- in a letter signed by the Republican House leadership, including Representative Paul D. Ryan, the former vice-presidential nominee -- means that both sides have now put their opening bids on the table. Republican leaders last week loudly rejected the Obama administration's offer and said they would not counter until the president came back with a plan they considered more realistic, not the one Mr. Boehner again dismissed on Monday as a "La-La-Land offer."
But facing increasing political pressure to produce an alternative, Republicans acted. "What we are putting forth is a credible plan that deserves serious consideration from the White House," Mr. Boehner said.
The White House was critical of the proposal. "The Republican letter released today does not meet the test of balance," said Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director. "In fact, it actually promises to lower rates for the wealthy and sticks the middle class with the bill. Their plan includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve."
Republicans did produce proposals that could create a political backlash. Of the plan's savings, $200 billion over 10 years would come from changing the way the government calculates inflation, which would slow benefit increases in programs from Medicare to Social Security and raise taxes by slowing the annual rise in tax brackets. Republican aides said that it would be unpopular, but that it was the right response to deficits still topping $1 trillion.
The Republican plan also called for $600 billion in cuts to federal health care programs, including an increase in the eligibility age for Medicare and increased means testing to shrink health benefits for more affluent elderly Americans.
In all, the Republican offer would reduce the deficit more than the president's, which predicted about $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years. The White House also counted $1 trillion in cuts agreed to last year, savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and lower interest payments on a shrinking debt for a total savings of $4 trillion. Republicans rejected that accounting, but using the same figures their plan would cut $4.6 trillion from future deficits over 10 years.
In an effort to give their proposal added credibility, Republicans said their counteroffer is close to numbers suggested last year by Erskine B. Bowles, the Democratic co-chairman of the president's deficit reduction task force. Mr. Bowles said last week that his numbers, offered in testimony to a special bipartisan Congressional committee on deficit reduction, were not so much a plan as a back-of-the-envelope suggestion to show that a deal could be struck that would be somewhere between Mr. Obama's position and the speaker's during their talks last year.
On Monday, Mr. Bowles sought to distance himself from the Republican plan, saying circumstances had overtaken his numbers. He said that to get a deal today "it will be necessary for both sides to move beyond their opening positions."
With just weeks left to find a solution, the parties remain far apart on substance. The White House is insisting that tax increases include higher tax rates on affluent households, a formula Republicans continue to reject.
"The new revenue in the Bowles plan would not be achieved through higher tax rates, which we continue to oppose and will not agree to in order to protect small businesses and our economy," the Republican letter said. "Instead, new revenue would be generated through pro-growth tax reform that closes special-interest loopholes and deductions while lowering rates."
Republicans offered no specifics on which loopholes or deductions they would close, saying that would be determined next year by the Congressional tax-writing committees.
Cuts to other programs that are not under the purview of annual Congressional spending bills -- so-called mandatory programs -- would total $300 billion over 10 years, according to the Republican plan. And discretionary programs, already cut by nearly $1 trillion through last year's Budget Control Act, would be cut another $300 billion.
Republican leaders called the offer "exactly the kind of imperfect but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs."

Full text:   Sometimes you have to walk through the desert to get to the Promised Land. That's the way it is for Republicans right now. The Republicans are stuck in a miserable position at the end of 2012, but, if they handle things right, they can make 2013 an excellent year -- both for their revival prospects and for the country.
First, they have to acknowledge how badly things are stacked against them. Polls show that large majorities of Americans are inclined to blame Republicans if the country goes off the "fiscal cliff." The business community, which needs a deal to boost confidence, will turn against them. The national security types and the defense contractors, who hate the prospect of sequestration, will turn against them.
Moreover a budget stalemate on these terms will confirm every bad Republican stereotype. Republicans will be raising middle-class taxes in order to serve the rich -- shafting Sam's Club to benefit the country club. If Republicans do this, they might as well get Mitt Romney's "47 percent" comments printed on T-shirts and wear them for the rest of their lives.
So Republicans have to realize that they are going to cave on tax rates. The only question is what they get in return. What they should demand is this: That the year 2013 will be spent putting together a pro-growth tax and entitlement reform package that will put this country on a sound financial footing through 2040.
Republicans should go to the White House and say they are willing to see top tax rates go up to 36 percent or 37 percent and they are willing to forgo a debt-ceiling fight for this year.
This is a big political concession, but it's not much of an economic one. President Obama needs rate increases to show the liberals he has won a "victory," but the fact is that raising revenue by raising rates is not that much worse for the economy than raising revenue by closing loopholes, which Republicans have already conceded.
In return, Republicans should also ask for some medium-size entitlement cuts as part of the fiscal cliff down payment. These could fit within the framework Speaker John Boehner sketched out Monday afternoon: chaining Social Security cost-of-living increases to price inflation and increasing the Medicare Part B premium to 35 percent of costs.
But the big demand would be this: That on March 15, 2013, both parties would introduce leader-endorsed tax and entitlement reform bills in Congress that would bring the debt down to 60 percent of G.D.P. by 2024 and 40 percent by 2037, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Those bills would work their way through the normal legislative process, as the Constitution intended. If a Grand Bargain is not reached by Dec. 15, 2013, then there would be automatic defense and entitlement cuts and automatic tax increases.
Both parties say they are earnest about fundamental tax and entitlement reform. This deal would force them to think beyond the 10-year budget window and put credible plans on the table to address the long-term budget problems while there is still time. No more waiting for the other guy to go public with something serious. The ensuing debate would force voters to face the elemental truth -- that they can only have a government as big as they are willing to pay for. It would force elected officials to find a long-term pro-growth solution as big as Simpson-Bowles.
Republicans could say to the country: Hey, we don't like raising tax rates. But we understand that when a nation is running a $16 trillion debt that is exploding year by year, everybody has to be willing to make compromises and sacrifices. We understand that the big thing holding the country back is that the political system doesn't function. We want to tackle big things right now.
The year 2013 would then be spent on natural Republican turf (tax and entitlement reform) instead of natural Democratic turf (expanding government programs). Democrats would have to submit a long-term vision for the country that either reduced entitlement benefits or raised middle-class taxes, violating Obama's campaign pledge. Republicans would have to face their own myths and evasions, and become a true reform and modernization party.
The 2012 concession on tax rates would be overshadowed by the 2013 debate on the fiscal future. The world would see that America is tackling its problem in a way that Europe isn't. Political power in each party would shift from the doctrinaire extremists to the practical dealmakers.
Besides, the inevitable package would please Republicans. The House would pass a conservative bill. The Senate would pass a center-left bill. The compromise between the two would be center-right.
It's pointless to cut a short-term deal if entitlement programs are still structured to bankrupt our children. Republicans and Democrats could make 2013 the year of the truly Grand Bargain.

Abstract: Specifically, regulators at the CME Group, which runs commodity and futures exchanges, are investigating whether Mr. Hadden's purchases or sales of Treasury futures late in the trading day manipulated closing prices in the market and, in turn, made other of his trades more profitable, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Full text:   On paper, Glenn Hadden seemed to be the ideal person to run a large bond trading operation at Morgan Stanley when he was hired in early 2011. Mr. Hadden, a former Goldman partner, was one of the most profitable bond traders on Wall Street.
But there was more to his story than just stellar financial results. He had left his previous employer, Goldman Sachs, after questions about his trading activity. And now, Mr. Hadden is under investigation over his trading in Treasury futures while at Goldman, according to a regulatory filing.
Specifically, regulators at the CME Group, which runs commodity and futures exchanges, are investigating whether Mr. Hadden's purchases or sales of Treasury futures late in the trading day manipulated closing prices in the market and, in turn, made other of his trades more profitable, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Mr. Hadden, who is now the head of the global interest rates desk at Morgan Stanley, has been given formal notice by the CME that an inquiry is under way, meaning that it is at an advanced stage.
Through a Morgan Stanley spokesman, Mr. Hadden, 42, declined to comment. Goldman Sachs also declined to comment, and Morgan Stanley would say only that Mr. Hadden continues to work at the firm as head of global rates.
Mr. Hadden is one of the highest paid professionals at Morgan Stanley and has been known throughout his career for aggressive and profitable risk taking. It is unusual for someone of Mr. Hadden's stature to be the target of a civil complaint like this, and if he is found to have violated exchange rules, he could, in the extreme, face millions in fines and be barred from trading on the CME Group.
While Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs learned about the investigation only in recent months, both firms were aware of another controversy involving Mr. Hadden that took place not long after the CME trading now under scrutiny.
After receiving complaints involving Mr. Hadden from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Goldman Sachs took the extraordinary step of putting him on paid leave in 2009, according to several people briefed on the matter.
Goldman is one of 21 firms designated to trade United States government securities with the New York Fed. Traders at the Fed, according to people briefed on the matter, suspected that Goldman was trying to improperly profit from one of the federal government's bond-buying programs, which are aimed at stimulating economic growth. A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment.
While neither Goldman nor Mr. Hadden was accused by regulators of wrongdoing in that case, Mr. Hadden's leave from Goldman dragged on for months, in part because senior managers were divided on whether he should return to work, and whether he should have managerial responsibilities if he did return, according to people involved in the discussions.
In November 2010, Goldman told its employees that Mr. Hadden was leaving the firm. Morgan Stanley snapped him up soon afterward. Several senior executives there were aware of the New York Fed's complaints when Mr. Hadden was hired, but they were satisfied that he had not done anything wrong, according to people involved in the decision to hire him.
"Wall Street is always looking for a proven moneymaker and has been known to look the other way on things in pursuit of that," said Michael Driscoll, a former senior trader at the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns who now teaches at Adelphi University.
Mr. Hadden joined Goldman in 1999, just months before the firm went public, and rose to become one of the bank's top traders. In 2008 he was made a partner, a title typically reserved for executives known inside Goldman as "commercial killers" - people who make an outsize financial contribution to the firm. Current and former colleagues said Mr. Hadden, who has been known to drink copious amounts of Gatorade at work, was almost "machinelike" when he traded. "He gets this look in his eye," one former colleague said. "It is scary."
His trading made him very wealthy. His exact compensation is not known but rival rates traders and head hunters estimate that in his best years he made more than $10 million.
Mr. Hadden was just the sort of swing-for-the-fences trader Morgan Stanley needed in late 2010, when it was working to rehabilitate its fixed income, or bond, department. That unit, where Mr. Hadden now works, was badly bruised during the financial crisis. Since then, its efforts to rebuild have been slowed by ratings cuts and new regulations that require it and its rivals to hold more capital against riskier operations. These rules are forcing Morgan to either scale back or get out of certain business lines altogether.
Trading interest rates, which fall under the bond department, however, is less capital intensive, so in recent years, Morgan Stanley has made a big push into this corner of Wall Street. Enter Mr. Hadden.
He has continued to deliver profits to Morgan Stanley, but his time there has not been without incident. In 2011, Mr. Hadden's division was burned by a bad wager on United States inflation expectations, resulting in a loss of tens of millions of dollars, according to people briefed on the trade. Since then, Morgan executives have increased their supervision of Mr. Hadden's activities, according to several people briefed on the matter.
A lot is riding on Mr. Hadden at Morgan, however. Not only does he run the firm's powerful rates desk, but many of his bosses - including Colm Kelleher, co-president of institutional securities, and Kenneth M. deRegt, global head of fixed income sales and trading - had a role in hiring him.
Morgan Stanley reported the investigation to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's self-regulator, on Nov. 19, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Mr. Hadden got his start in finance in Canada. He was raised in Ontario and attended the University of Western Ontario, where he played football. He worked on Bay Street, which is Toronto's financial district, and eventually landed a job there with Goldman. He also worked for Goldman in London and New York.
He has not forgotten his Canadian roots. He is a big supporter of the Toronto Argonauts football team, and he held a charity-driven party in Toronto connected to the recent centennial Grey Cup.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: A vicious circle imperils all the Arab nations with unfinished revolutions: political unrest scares off the investors needed to create jobs. Since President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in January 2011, the unemployment rate has risen to 18 percent of those eligible to work from 13 percent, meaning about 750,000 people are out of work. The economy contracted by 1.8 percent in 2011, troubled by problems like a 30 percent drop in the number of tourists, according to the World Bank.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTUNIS -- Tahar Bayahi, who runs Tunisia's largest grocery store chain, spent the days right after the revolution toting up his losses: one-quarter of his 60 stores nationwide incinerated and another quarter pillaged.
Yet his company, Magasin Général, turned right around to rebuild, pouring $40 million and nine months into the effort. "It's true that we were badly affected, but it opened up a far larger horizon," Mr. Bayahi said over lunch on a sunny lakeside terrace. "What was important was that the change would bring us to a new epoch much faster."
Nearly two years after riots that began over economic frustration and unemployment toppled the Tunisian government and started the Arab Spring, the frustration that people here are not better off is starting to overflow again. The gross domestic product is down, unemployment is up, debt and inflation are growing and social unrest is simmering.
Last week, the government sent troops into Siliana, south of the capital, after four days of violent protests, mainly over demands for jobs and more government investment, turned violent. Thousands participated and hundreds were injured in clashes with the police.
President Moncef Marzouki, acknowledging Friday on television that the government had not "met the expectations of the people," expressed concern that unrest could spread to other towns in the underdeveloped interior.
"Tunisia today is at a crossroads," he said. "Tunisia today has an opportunity that it must not miss to be a model because the world is watching us, and we mustn't disappoint."
Unemployment remains the biggest economic problem and catalyst for unrest. A vicious circle imperils all the Arab nations with unfinished revolutions: political unrest scares off the investors needed to create jobs.
Since President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in January 2011, the unemployment rate has risen to 18 percent of those eligible to work from 13 percent, meaning about 750,000 people are out of work.
More troubling, a third of the unemployed are college graduates, said Said Aidi, minister of the economy for much of 2011. By 2015, an estimated 100,000 new graduates will seek jobs annually, while even before the revolution at most 20,000 graduates a year found work matching their degrees.
"Ben Ali ignored the blinking red lights on the economy, and that is what got him thrown out," said Karim Ben Smail, the owner of a modest publishing company. "The unemployed are an army in a country the size of Tunisia."
The numbers are not all bad, however. The economy contracted by 1.8 percent in 2011, troubled by problems like a 30 percent drop in the number of tourists, according to the World Bank. It predicts 2.2 percent growth this year, and a close-to-normal 4.6 percent by 2014 should conditions stabilize.
But a new constitution has yet to be written, and elections have been postponed until at least next June. Periodic riots -- especially the sacking of the United States Embassy in September in response to a video made in the United States mocking the Prophet Muhammad -- have left investors sitting on their wallets and kept tourists at home. A State Department travel advisory warned Americans against visiting Tunisia.
Bracing for further unrest, Magasin Général rebuilt its stores with shatterproof glass, heavy metal shutters and 20-foot walls topped by barbed wire.
Before the revolution, the company felt disadvantaged because its closest competitors, franchises of the giant French retailers Carrefour and Monoprix, enjoyed closer ties to the ruling family, Mr. Bayahi said. Both opened superstores while his applications languished.
After the revolution, he expected permits to sail through, particularly since his two proposed superstores meant more than 1,400 jobs. Instead, officials tell him "it is being studied," just like before the revolution, he said.
While Mr. Bayahi blamed a combination of government incompetence and foot dragging for the delay, economic experts cited an additional reason. Small neighborhood shops potentially hurt by big chains extend credit to poor customers, helping to maintain social peace.
Blame for the economic doldrums is focused on the Renaissance Party, a centrist Islamist party that dominates the transitional governing coalition. Critics say the party lacks financial expertise and is so focused on putting an Islamic stamp on the new constitution that it has neglected developing even a rudimentary economic vision.
Its promise to create 20,000 new public-sector jobs was criticized as compounding the problem. "They are learning how to run the machine while operating it," said Cyril G. Karray, the author of a book on Tunisia's woes called "The Next War in Tunisia -- Victory in 5 Battles."
Senior officials say the public is expecting too much too fast. "It's like you get married and you want a baby boy with blue eyes one month later," said Abdelfattah Mouru, a Renaissance Party founder. "It is not up to the government alone to make the rain and the sunshine."
Realistically, Tunisia needs three to five years to see a change in employment prospects, both politicians and economists said. The question is whether social unrest can be tamed for that long.
There have been discussions about dusting off an economic development plan commissioned from the consulting company McKinsey several years ago, Mr. Aidi, the former minister, said. It recommended that Tunisia foster new economic sectors and concentrate some in the interior. They included renewable energy, biotechnology and logistics, taking advantage of Tunisia's proximity to Europe to become a shipment point for much of North and West Africa.
Tunisian companies have established a successful auto parts sector and call centers, for example. Mail order and help lines for the French-speaking world have generated 25,000 jobs and could create many more, Mr. Aidi said.
The problem has always been raising money.
The G-8 major economies, meeting in Deauville, France, in the first flush of the Arab Spring, generated huge expectations by pledging, along with richer oil states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, some $40 billion to the nascent democracies. Nothing close materialized.
The World Bank approved a $500 million loan on Tuesday to help carry out economic reform and spur job creation.
The United States has given about $300 million since the revolution, and the European Union has provided $400 million over two years. Qatar bought an entire $500 million bond issue this year.
"You can have the most beautifully designed program, but if the investors are not there to invest in green energy and so on, you will not see any results," said Mustapha K. Nabli, Tunisia's former Central Bank governor.
This is especially true in the interior, the wellspring of the revolution not least because economic development lagged. The anger remains palpable. "We will burn Sidi Bouzeid once again!" a young man shouted to a visiting foreigner in the central town where the protests began.
Against hope, young entrepreneur workshops have become ubiquitous. In Sidi Bouzeid one recent weekend, teams competed to propose a viable business plan for a new company.
Asked about work before the revolution, Naily Amine, 30, said, "My job was leaning against the wall, waiting for work."
Five years ago, armed with a college degree in industrial maintenance, he tried to start a company to recycle plastic waste into pipes for agricultural irrigation. Mr. Amine, a slight man with black hair, worked harvesting tomatoes, fixing cars and in construction while chasing the $6,000 he needed so the bank would lend him $60,000. He was sure the revolution would transform his lot. "I expected investment to grow, for the unemployment problem to be solved," he said.
Instead, hurdles multiplied. Before, only ruling family cronies seemed to get the industrial park land for factories. When Mr. Amine tried to meet the new governor to ask about land now, he could not even make an appointment. The staff was always on strike.
The unemployment office promised to match investors with projects, and for the first year after the revolution Mr. Amine went faithfully each week to sign in. Now he often skips it.
"Nothing has changed since the revolution," he said gloomily. "If anything there are more problems -- there is just a lot of confusion."
Correction: December 23, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 2 about the growing unrest in Tunisia over the state of the country's economy referred incompletely to its 18 percent unemployment rate. It is 18 percent of those eligible to work, not of the total population. The article also misstated, in some editions, the number of people out of work. It is about 750,000, not about 1.8. million. And the article misspelled the name of Tunisia's largest grocery chain, which had dozens of its 60 stores incinerated or pillaged during riots that toppled the Tunisian government. The company is Magasin Général, not Magasins Général.

Full text:   Americans cut back on spending last month while their income remained flat, a trend that in part reflected disruptions from Hurricane Sandy and could slow economic growth for the rest of the year.
The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending dropped 0.2 percent in October. It was the weakest figure since May, and it compared with a 0.8 percent spending increase in September. Income had risen 0.4 percent in September.
Work interruptions caused by the storm reduced wages and salaries in October by about $18 billion at an annual rate, the government said. The storm affected 24 states, with the most severe damage in New York and New Jersey.
Consumers may also be scaling back on spending because of fears about the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect in January if Congress and the Obama administration fail to strike a budget deal by then.
"The upshot is that although both incomes and spending will probably bounce back in November, the underlying trend is weak," said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
The spending figures suggested that the economy was growing more slowly in the October-December quarter than it did in the July-September quarter. Consumer spending drives nearly 70 percent of economic activity.
Mr. Dales predicted that domestic economic growth would slip from the 2.7 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter to 1 percent in the October-December period. That is too low to cut the unemployment rate, now at 7.9 percent.
Income and spending gains would have been meager even after discounting the effects of the storm. Income would have risen 0.1 percent. Spending would have been essentially flat, Mr. Dales said.
After-tax income adjusted for inflation fell 0.1 percent in October. And spending, when adjusted for inflation, dropped 0.3 percent -- the biggest such decline in three years. The saving rate edged up slightly to 3.4 percent of after-tax income in October, compared with 3.3 percent in September.
Many economists say growth will rebound once rebuilding begins in the Northeast. And if President Obama and Congress can reach a budget deal, some economists, including the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, are predicting a strong year for the economy.

Abstract: According to an analysis by The New York Times, the combination of all income taxes, sales taxes and property taxes took a smaller share of their income than it took from households with the same inflation-adjusted income in 1980. Many pay no federal income taxes, but they do pay a range of other levies, like federal payroll taxes, state sales taxes and local property taxes.

Full text:   BELLEVILLE, Ill. -- Alan Hicks divides long days between the insurance business he started in the late 1970s and the barbecue restaurant he opened with his sons three years ago. He earned more than $250,000 last year and said taxes took more than 40 percent. What's worse, in his view, is that others -- the wealthy, hiding in loopholes; the poor, living on government benefits -- are not paying their fair share.
"It feels like the harder we work, the more they take from us," said Mr. Hicks, 55, as he waited for a meat truck one recent afternoon. "And it seems like there's an awful lot of people in the United States who don't pay any taxes."
These are common sentiments in the eastern suburbs of St. Louis, a region of fading factory towns fringed by new subdivisions. Here, as across the country, people like Mr. Hicks are pained by the conviction that they are paying ever more to finance the expansion of government.
But in fact, most Americans in 2010 paid far less in total taxes -- federal, state and local -- than they would have paid 30 years ago. According to an analysis by The New York Times, the combination of all income taxes, sales taxes and property taxes took a smaller share of their income than it took from households with the same inflation-adjusted income in 1980.
Households earning more than $200,000 benefited from the largest percentage declines in total taxation as a share of income. Middle-income households benefited, too. More than 85 percent of households with earnings above $25,000 paid less in total taxes than comparable households in 1980.
Lower-income households, however, saved little or nothing. Many pay no federal income taxes, but they do pay a range of other levies, like federal payroll taxes, state sales taxes and local property taxes. Only about half of taxpaying households with incomes below $25,000 paid less in 2010.
The uneven decline is a result of two trends. Congress cut federal taxation at every income level over the last 30 years. State and local taxes, meanwhile, increased for most Americans. Those taxes generally take a larger share of income from those who make less, so the increases offset more and more of the federal savings at lower levels of income.
In a half-dozen states, including Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey, the increases were large enough to offset the federal savings for most households, not just the poorer ones.
Now an era of tax cuts may be reaching its end. The federal government depends increasingly on borrowed money to pay its bills, and many state and local governments are similarly confronting the reality that they are spending more money than they collect. In Washington, debates about tax cuts have yielded to debates about who should pay more.
President Obama campaigned for re-election on a promise to take a larger share of taxable income above roughly $250,000 a year. The White House is now negotiating with Congressional Republicans, who instead want to raise some money by reducing tax deductions. Federal spending cuts also are at issue.
If a deal is not struck by year's end, a wide range of federal tax cuts passed since 2000 will expire and taxes will rise for roughly 90 percent of Americans, according to the independent Tax Policy Center. For lower-income households, taxation would spike well above 1980 levels. Upper-income households would lose some but not all of the benefits of tax cuts over the last three decades.
Public debate over taxes has typically focused on the federal income tax, but that now accounts for less than a third of the total tax revenues collected by federal, state and local governments. To analyze the total burden, The Times created a model, in consultation with experts, which estimated total tax bills for each taxpayer in each year from 1980, when the election of President Ronald Reagan opened an era of tax cutting, up to 2010, the most recent year for which relevant data is available.
The analysis shows that the overall burden of taxation declined as a share of income in the 1980s, rose to a new peak in the 1990s and fell again in the 2000s. Tax rates at most income levels were lower in 2010 than at any point during the 1980s.
Governments still collected the same share of total income in 2010 as in 1980 -- 31 cents from every dollar -- because people with higher incomes pay taxes at higher rates, and household incomes rose over the last three decades, particularly at the top.
There are now many more millionaires, in other words, paying more than they did in 1980, but they are paying less than they would have if tax laws had remained unchanged. And while they still pay a larger share of income in taxes than the rest of the population, the difference has narrowed significantly.
The trend can be seen by comparing three examples:
¶A household making $350,000 in 2010, roughly the cutoff for the top 1 percent, on average paid 42.1 percent of its income in taxes, compared with 49 percent for a household with the same inflation-adjusted income in 1980 -- a savings of about $24,100.
¶A household making $52,000 in 2010, roughly the median income, on average paid 27.7 percent of its income in taxes, compared with 30.5 percent in 1980, saving $1,500.
¶A household making $22,000 in 2010 -- roughly the federal poverty line for a family of four -- on average paid 19.4 percent in taxes, compared with 20.2 percent, saving $200.
Jared Bernstein, who served as chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the Times analysis highlighted the need to raise taxes on the affluent and cut taxes for the poor. He cautioned that the middle class most likely would need to pay more, too.
"When you look at these numbers, you understand why we're not collecting the revenue we need to support the spending we want," said Mr. Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "We've really gutted the system."
But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a prominent conservative economist, said the changes in taxation over the last three decades reflected a conscious and successful strategy to encourage economic growth that should be reinforced, not reversed.
Mr. Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is the president of the American Action Forum, said government should reduce deficits primarily through spending cuts, particularly to Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs that are the largest source of projected increases in the federal debt.
"We can't grow our way out of it, and we can't tax our way out of it," he said of the government's fiscal predicament. "We have a spending problem, period."
Mr. Hicks, like many residents of Belleville, views this debate with unhappiness. He would like the government to cut spending but not reduce services. He is certain that the government should not raise taxes on the middle class, a group in which he includes himself, but he is ambivalent about asking anyone to pay more. Higher taxes would hurt his businesses, he said, so raising taxes on those who make more money seems likely to hurt their businesses, too.
"At this point, I guess it's inevitable in order to get us out of this hole," Mr. Hicks said of higher taxes. "Illinois is in bad shape, along with a lot of the nation. But I don't feel like we should tax the middle class any more than we are right now. There's going to come a point where they take the incentive out of working hard."
If the government cut his taxes, Mr. Hicks said, he would use the money to put a roof over the picnic tables outside the restaurant, expanding the year-round seating area. He already employs 14 people; then he could hire more.
And if taxes rose? Would Mr. Hicks, who started working when tax rates were higher, really choose to slow down?
He smiled. "No," he said. "I like it. What else would I do with my time?"
Cutting From Both Ends
The federal income tax, which will turn 100 next year, is in decline.
Congressional Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly voted to reduce the share of income that people must pay. Over the last decade, annual revenues from federal taxation of individual and corporate income averaged just 9.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the lowest level for any 10-year period since World War II.
The recession and new rounds of tax cuts further reduced revenues, to 7.6 percent of economic output in the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years. Stronger economic growth has produced a modest increase in tax collections, but the White House budget office estimates that collections for the fiscal year that ended in September will total 9 percent of economic output, still less than before the financial crisis.
Federal spending, meanwhile, grew faster than the economy over the last decade -- particularly during the recession. To pay those bills, the government borrowed more money than it collected in income taxes in each of the last three fiscal years, something it had not done in even a single year since World War II, federal data show.
Congress could have eliminated those deficits by cutting spending. It might also have averted those deficits by leaving the tax code unchanged. The government on average would have collected an additional $800 billion in each year from 2006 to 2010 if the 1980 code had remained in effect and economic activity had continued at the same pace, the Times analysis found. The annual federal deficits during those years averaged $714 billion.
Leaving the tax code as it was in 1980, however, would not have solved the nation's long-term fiscal problems. Increases in federal spending, driven primarily by the rising cost of health care, are projected to outstrip even the revenue-raising capacity of the 1980 tax code in the coming decades, necessitating some combination of spending cuts and tax increases.
The income tax stands apart from other forms of taxation. It is the reason that upper-income households pay a larger share of their income in taxes than the rest of the population. The combined burden of all other federal, state and local taxes takes roughly the same share from all taxpayers. And many Americans -- even in a middle-class, Democratic stronghold like Belleville -- have misgivings about imposing higher tax rates on the affluent, an important reason that income taxation has declined.
The share of Americans who said high-income households paid too little in taxes fell from 77 percent in 1992 to 62 percent in 2012, according to Gallup, even as income inequality rose to the highest levels since the Great Depression.
Some people in Belleville subscribe to the argument that higher tax rates impede economic growth by discouraging investment. For others, it is a matter of fairness.
Anita Thole, a middle-income safety supervisor for a utility contractor, is not wealthy. She does not expect that she ever will be. She is a single mother with a daughter in college, and she said she regarded the wealthy with a mixture of envy and admiration. But she does not want them to pay higher taxes.
"They work their butt off to get what they got," she said. "I wouldn't want them to pay more so that I can pay less."
Do they work harder than you?
"What? No. I work my butt off," Ms. Thole, 46, said. "But you got to believe in the American dream. You got to love them for what they did, for what they made of themselves and for being more aggressive than me."
Ms. Thole, like many in Belleville, is also convinced that governments could avoid raising taxes by adopting more frugal habits.
"There's some days we stay home and we eat peanut butter," she said.
What would she like governments to cut?
"I really like it when they cut the weeds along the highway," she said. "I like it when there's good roads to drive on. The schools, I don't know, I don't want to pull back from the schools. I don't have the answer of where to pull back.
"I want the state parks to stay open. I want, I want, I want. I want Big Bird. I think it's beautiful. What don't I want? I don't know."
To Tax or Not to Tax?
William L. Enyart is a rarity in Belleville: he wants to raise his own taxes.
Mr. Enyart and his wife are lawyers, although for the last five years he led the Illinois National Guard. The couple made $380,587 in 2011 and paid $104,864 in federal taxes. His conviction that they should have paid more may not be shared by many of the area's higher-income residents. But as the newly elected Democratic congressman for southwestern Illinois, Mr. Enyart, 63, is also the only man in town with a direct vote on federal tax policy.
Mr. Enyart, who won the seat of a retiring Democratic congressman, campaigned in part on his support for Mr. Obama's tax plan. He defeated a Republican candidate who opposed it, 52 percent to 43 percent. But Mr. Enyart said he heard little enthusiasm for tax increases in his district. What has changed, he said, is that people are increasingly concerned about cuts to government benefits and services.
"Nobody likes to pay taxes. Nobody wants to raise taxes on anybody," Mr. Enyart said. "But nobody wants to cut veterans services, nobody wants to give up that Interstate highway, nobody wants -- pick the service that you like. These are necessary services, and they need to be paid for."
The tax increase proposed by Mr. Obama, on taxable income -- income after deductions and other adjustments -- above $250,000 a year, would pay for only a small part of those services. It would reduce the projected deficit over the next decade by a little less than 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Nonetheless, Mr. Enyart said that he did not support broader tax increases. The focus, he said, should be on requiring the rich to pay more.
"We have the greatest disproportion of wealth since 1928, and I don't think that's a healthy thing," he said. "How much money is enough? Do hedge fund traders really need to make a billion dollars a year and pay only 15 percent in taxes when we have teachers making $50,000 and paying 20 percent?"
John Siemens, who did not vote for Mr. Enyart, said that kind of "raise taxes" talk was a crowd-pleasing distraction from the need for painful spending cuts.
Mr. Siemens and his wife, Jan, both 59, own a company with a pair of factories in southwestern Illinois where workers assemble dollar-bill scanners for vending machines, dashboard lights for automobiles, magnetic probes for hospitals and other electronic equipment. They earned about $250,000 last year, so Mr. Obama's plan would not have increased their income taxes. But it would raise the estate taxes they would have to pay to pass the company to their children someday.
Like many opponents of the president's plan, Mr. Siemens thinks higher taxes will discourage investment and slow economic growth.
"There's some tax rates that probably do need to be raised," he said. "There are some that need to be lowered. But the politicians are not having an honest discussion. Is it fair or not fair is not the question. The question is, If you want to raise revenues, does that make sense or not?"
He noted as an example that interest on municipal bonds is tax-exempt, which encourages the wealthy to lend to local governments.
"Those lower tax rates were put into place for a reason," he said. "It's not just, let's give the wealthy a break."
Mr. Siemens does have a concern about fairness. He believes that lower-income households are not paying enough in taxes.
"By any measure, the wealthy are still paying a disproportionate amount of their income in taxes," he said. "Is that fair or not fair? I don't know, but I have an issue with the dramatic reduction of taxes at the low end because I think everybody needs some skin in the game."
The debate is no longer theoretical here in Illinois. Facing perhaps the deepest budget crisis of any state, the Illinois legislature last year raised the state income tax rate to 5 percent from 3 percent. Unlike the federal income tax, Illinois taxes all income at the same rate.
Mr. Enyart said that the state needed more revenue, but that it should move to a tax system that imposed a heavier burden on high-income households. Mr. Siemens said the state should have cut spending.
The higher taxes have increased his costs and given an advantage to competitors in other states. And there are broader ripples, too: he said he was planning to buy some used machines, rather than new ones, to save money.
"We feel the burden of that, but it hasn't gotten to the threshold of pain yet where we would move," Mr. Siemens said. "There's a lot of expense that would be incurred in moving, including a disruption of the work force, which you are always loath to do."
View From the Lower End
Taylor McCallister, 20, works the front window at Mr. Hicks's barbecue restaurant, taking orders from customers. She also works a second job and attends Southwestern Illinois College. She earned about $30,000 last year and, like her boss, she wishes the government would take less of that money.
"When I see my check it's like, damn, that's a huge chunk that was taken out," she said. "I could have been making $450 instead of $378."
Mitt Romney's remarks about the "47 percent" focused public attention on the rising share of Americans who do not pay federal income taxes, a trend that has encouraged the public perception that lower-income households are getting a sweetheart deal. The share of Americans who think lower-income households pay too little in taxes increased to 24 percent in 2012 from 8 percent in 1992, according to Gallup.
But low-wage workers like Ms. McCallister still pay federal payroll taxes, which provide financing for Social Security and Medicare. They still pay sales taxes. Even if they are renters, they still bear the cost of property taxes in the form of higher rents.
And those taxes have climbed most quickly in recent decades.
The average American in 2010 paid 30 percent more of income in payroll taxes than in 1980, even while paying 27 percent less in federal income taxes. As a result, revenue from the payroll tax almost equaled income tax revenue before a temporary payroll tax cut took effect in 2011. The cut is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
The rise of the payroll tax reflects the general movement away from requiring upper-income households to pay a larger share of income in taxes. All workers pay the same Social Security tax on wages below a threshold, which stood at $106,800 in 2010. The Medicare tax imposes a single rate on all wages, without a threshold.
Some experts argue, however, that payroll taxes are a special case because workers are entitled to Social Security benefits based in part on the amounts that they pay in taxes -- a system more akin to a pension plan than an income tax.
In Illinois, the average burden of state and local taxes rose to 10.2 percent of income in 2010 from 8.8 percent in 1980, even before the latest round of tax increases last year.
And Illinois, like most states, takes a larger share of income from those who make less. Illinois households earning less than $25,000 a year on average paid 14.3 percent of income in state and local taxes in 2010, while those earning more than $200,000 paid 9.4 percent, according to the Times analysis.
Ms. McCallister said she and her friends worry about the nation's financial problems. Their answer is simple: Someone has to pay more, and the affluent can best afford to do so. She said it was time to reverse a trend that had been going on so long it predated her birth by a decade.
"I want to know honestly how the more wealthy feel," she said between tending to customers. "You'd think that they would want to help. We're working these kinds of jobs and that's what we have to do to make it through, and there's other people making all this money. I don't get it, honestly.
"I feel that maybe people who don't make as much shouldn't have to pay as much in. But who makes the rules?
"Not me."

Full text:   Even though government figures showed on Thursday that the economy grew faster than first estimated in the third quarter, economists warned that the pace of expansion could slow drastically in the final months of the year amid the fiscal standoff in Washington and growing caution on the part of businesses.
The Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, well above the 2 percent estimate it gave in late October. But the revision was driven by increased inventory accumulation and a jump in federal spending -- factors unlikely to be repeated in the current quarter, economists said.
"It's a nice headline number," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, "but it exaggerates the underlying momentum in the economy. Sustainable improvements in growth are not driven by inventories."
What's more, the revised figures show that spending by businesses on equipment and software declined by 2.7 percent in the third quarter, the first decrease since the end of the recession in mid-2009.
Mr. Gault attributed the weak spending by companies in large part to growing uncertainty among executives about whether Congress and the White House can reach a deal before Jan. 1 that prevents more than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts from going into effect early next year. "The No. 1 thing is the fiscal cliff," Mr. Gault said.
The impasse in Washington has not only dominated the political debate since the election, but also become a leading worry for corporate America. President Obama met with business leaders on Wednesday to seek their support in negotiating a compromise, the second time he has sat down with prominent corporate chiefs this month, while Wall Street has wavered with each zig and zag of the debate.
The president and Congressional Democrats favor letting Bush-era tax cuts expire for top earners, while many Republicans have opposed any rise in tax rates and are pressing for greater reductions in federal spending.
Most observers expect a short-term compromise to be found that blunts the full effect of the tax increases and spending reductions, but economists say the risks to future growth are mounting. If a deal is not reached, the economy will grow at an annual rate of just 1.1 percent in 2013, according to a new forecast issued Thursday by Macroeconomic Advisers, with unemployment rising to 8.5 percent by the end of the year.
Unemployment now stands at 7.9 percent, still far above the level before the financial crisis and the recession, and it is not expected to come down significantly unless economic growth accelerates. For now at least, that seems unlikely.
"Over all, it was a disappointing report," said Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The accumulation of inventories went from subtracting 0.1 percentage points from the initial estimate to adding 0.8 percentage points, she said.
"A lot of that inventory build was unintentional, which suggests a downside risk for the fourth quarter," she said. "Businesses had expected stronger sales and consumer spending and were caught off guard." Ms. Meyer said she expected the economy to grow by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The government also reported on Thursday that first-time unemployment claims dropped by 23,000, to 393,000, last week. But Ms. Meyer cautioned that these figures were much more volatile than usual because of the Thanksgiving holiday and Hurricane Sandy.
The weak underlying data in the report on third-quarter performance prompted Maury Harris, chief United States economist at UBS, to cut his projected estimate of fourth-quarter growth to 1 percent from 1.6 percent. "Part of this is Sandy and part of this is the inventories," he said.
The uncertainty about what will happen in Washington is reflected in the sharp divergence of views among economists about growth in the first quarter of 2013. While Mr. Harris sees growth rebounding in early 2013, to an annual rate of 2.1 percent, Ms. Meyer estimates the rate of expansion will be less than half of that at 1 percent.
The Commerce Department data suggests that in spite of the caution about the future, the overall picture for companies remained healthy, with United States corporate profits reaching a record in the third quarter.
The increase from the second quarter was entirely a result of stronger business performance at home. Profits received from American-owned businesses abroad fell slightly in the third quarter, which may not be surprising given the recession in Europe and the slowdown in China.
There were signs of optimism in Thursday's data. Residential fixed investment rose 14.2 percent, a sign that the housing recovery was gaining steam. A separate report from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales rose to a two-and-a-half-year high.
Indeed, not all economists took a pessimistic view.
"Just because the private sector is going into neutral doesn't mean we have to automatically have a recession," said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist and asset allocation strategist at Barclays. "Households are deleveraging, corporate balance sheets are strong, and business isn't overextended.
"Short of a policy mistake in Washington, it's tough to get a recession right now," he said.
The new estimate of growth represents a substantial increase in the level of the second quarter, when the economy grew at a rate of just 1.3 percent. It also marks the fastest rate of expansion since the fourth quarter of 2011, when the economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace.
This was the second of the government's three estimates of quarterly growth. The final figure is scheduled for Dec. 20.

Abstract: For years, deficit scolds have held Washington in thrall with warnings of an imminent debt crisis, even though investors, who continue to buy U.S. bonds, clearly believe that such a crisis won't happen; economic analysis says that such a crisis can't happen; and the historical record shows no examples bearing any resemblance to our current situation in which such a crisis actually did happen.\n

Full text:   These are difficult times for the deficit scolds who have dominated policy discussion for almost three years. One could almost feel sorry for them, if it weren't for their role in diverting attention from the ongoing problem of inadequate recovery, and thereby helping to perpetuate catastrophically high unemployment.
What has changed? For one thing, the crisis they predicted keeps not happening. Far from fleeing U.S. debt, investors have continued to pile in, driving interest rates to historical lows. Beyond that, suddenly the clear and present danger to the American economy isn't that we'll fail to reduce the deficit enough; it is, instead, that we'll reduce the deficit too much. For that's what the "fiscal cliff" -- better described as the austerity bomb -- is all about: the tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to kick in at the end of this year are precisely not what we want to see happen in a still-depressed economy.
Given these realities, the deficit-scold movement has lost some of its clout. That movement, by the way, is a hydra-headed beast, comprising many organizations that turn out, on inspection, to be financed and run by more or less the same people; dig down into many of these groups' back stories and you will, in particular, find Peter Peterson, the private-equity billionaire, playing a key role.
But the deficit scolds aren't giving up. Now yet another organization, Fix the Debt, is campaigning for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, even while making lower tax rates a "core principle." That last part makes no sense in terms of the group's ostensible mission, but makes perfect sense if you look at the array of big corporations, from Goldman Sachs to the UnitedHealth Group, that are involved in the effort and would benefit from tax cuts. Hey, sacrifice is for the little people.
So should we take this latest push seriously? No -- and not just because these people, aside from exhibiting a lot of hypocrisy, have been wrong about everything so far. The truth is that at a fundamental level the crisis story they're trying to sell doesn't make sense.
You've heard the story many times: Supposedly, any day now investors will lose faith in America's ability to come to grips with its budget failures. When they do, there will be a run on Treasury bonds, interest rates will spike, and the U.S. economy will plunge back into recession.
This sounds plausible to many people, because it's roughly speaking what happened to Greece. But we're not Greece, and it's almost impossible to see how this could actually happen to a country in our situation.
For we have our own currency -- and almost all of our debt, both private and public, is denominated in dollars. So our government, unlike the Greek government, literally can't run out of money. After all, it can print the stuff. So there's almost no risk that America will default on its debt -- I'd say no risk at all if it weren't for the possibility that Republicans would once again try to hold the nation hostage over the debt ceiling.
But if the U.S. government prints money to pay its bills, won't that lead to inflation? No, not if the economy is still depressed.
Now, it's true that investors might start to expect higher inflation some years down the road. They might also push down the value of the dollar. Both of these things, however, would actually help rather than hurt the U.S. economy right now: expected inflation would discourage corporations and families from sitting on cash, while a weaker dollar would make our exports more competitive.
Still, haven't crises like the one envisioned by deficit scolds happened in the past? Actually, no. As far as I can tell, every example supposedly illustrating the dangers of debt involves either a country that, like Greece today, lacked its own currency, or a country that, like Asian economies in the 1990s, had large debts in foreign currencies. Countries with large debts in their own currency, like France after World War I, have sometimes experienced big loss-of-confidence drops in the value of their currency -- but nothing like the debt-induced recession we're being told to fear.
So let's step back for a minute, and consider what's going on here. For years, deficit scolds have held Washington in thrall with warnings of an imminent debt crisis, even though investors, who continue to buy U.S. bonds, clearly believe that such a crisis won't happen; economic analysis says that such a crisis can't happen; and the historical record shows no examples bearing any resemblance to our current situation in which such a crisis actually did happen.
If you ask me, it's time for Washington to stop worrying about this phantom menace -- and to stop listening to the people who have been peddling this scare story in an attempt to get their way.

Full text:   Omaha
SUPPOSE that an investor you admire and trust comes to you with an investment idea. "This is a good one," he says enthusiastically. "I'm in it, and I think you should be, too."
Would your reply possibly be this? "Well, it all depends on what my tax rate will be on the gain you're saying we're going to make. If the taxes are too high, I would rather leave the money in my savings account, earning a quarter of 1 percent." Only in Grover Norquist's imagination does such a response exist.
Between 1951 and 1954, when the capital gains rate was 25 percent and marginal rates on dividends reached 91 percent in extreme cases, I sold securities and did pretty well. In the years from 1956 to 1969, the top marginal rate fell modestly, but was still a lofty 70 percent -- and the tax rate on capital gains inched up to 27.5 percent. I was managing funds for investors then. Never did anyone mention taxes as a reason to forgo an investment opportunity that I offered.
Under those burdensome rates, moreover, both employment and the gross domestic product (a measure of the nation's economic output) increased at a rapid clip. The middle class and the rich alike gained ground.
So let's forget about the rich and ultrarich going on strike and stuffing their ample funds under their mattresses if -- gasp -- capital gains rates and ordinary income rates are increased. The ultrarich, including me, will forever pursue investment opportunities.
And, wow, do we have plenty to invest. The Forbes 400, the wealthiest individuals in America, hit a new group record for wealth this year: $1.7 trillion. That's more than five times the $300 billion total in 1992. In recent years, my gang has been leaving the middle class in the dust.
A huge tail wind from tax cuts has pushed us along. In 1992, the tax paid by the 400 highest incomes in the United States (a different universe from the Forbes list) averaged 26.4 percent of adjusted gross income. In 2009, the most recent year reported, the rate was 19.9 percent. It's nice to have friends in high places.
The group's average income in 2009 was $202 million -- which works out to a "wage" of $97,000 per hour, based on a 40-hour workweek. (I'm assuming they're paid during lunch hours.) Yet more than a quarter of these ultrawealthy paid less than 15 percent of their take in combined federal income and payroll taxes. Half of this crew paid less than 20 percent. And -- brace yourself -- a few actually paid nothing.
This outrage points to the necessity for more than a simple revision in upper-end tax rates, though that's the place to start. I support President Obama's proposal to eliminate the Bush tax cuts for high-income taxpayers. However, I prefer a cutoff point somewhat above $250,000 -- maybe $500,000 or so.
Additionally, we need Congress, right now, to enact a minimum tax on high incomes. I would suggest 30 percent of taxable income between $1 million and $10 million, and 35 percent on amounts above that. A plain and simple rule like that will block the efforts of lobbyists, lawyers and contribution-hungry legislators to keep the ultrarich paying rates well below those incurred by people with income just a tiny fraction of ours. Only a minimum tax on very high incomes will prevent the stated tax rate from being eviscerated by these warriors for the wealthy.
Above all, we should not postpone these changes in the name of "reforming" the tax code. True, changes are badly needed. We need to get rid of arrangements like "carried interest" that enable income from labor to be magically converted into capital gains. And it's sickening that a Cayman Islands mail drop can be central to tax maneuvering by wealthy individuals and corporations.
But the reform of such complexities should not promote delay in our correcting simple and expensive inequities. We can't let those who want to protect the privileged get away with insisting that we do nothing until we can do everything.
Our government's goal should be to bring in revenues of 18.5 percent of G.D.P. and spend about 21 percent of G.D.P. -- levels that have been attained over extended periods in the past and can clearly be reached again. As the math makes clear, this won't stem our budget deficits; in fact, it will continue them. But assuming even conservative projections about inflation and economic growth, this ratio of revenue to spending will keep America's debt stable in relation to the country's economic output.
In the last fiscal year, we were far away from this fiscal balance -- bringing in 15.5 percent of G.D.P. in revenue and spending 22.4 percent. Correcting our course will require major concessions by both Republicans and Democrats.
All of America is waiting for Congress to offer a realistic and concrete plan for getting back to this fiscally sound path. Nothing less is acceptable.
In the meantime, maybe you'll run into someone with a terrific investment idea, who won't go forward with it because of the tax he would owe when it succeeds. Send him my way. Let me unburden him.

Abstract: Corporate records show that the relatives' stake of that investment most likely peaked at $2.2 billion in late 2007, the last year in which Taihong's shareholder records were publicly available. Because the company is no longer listed in Ping An's public filings, it is unclear if the relatives continue to hold shares.

Full text:   SHENZHEN, China -- The head of a financially troubled insurer was pushing Chinese officials to relax rules that required breaking up the company in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.
The survival of Ping An Insurance was at stake, officials were told in the fall of 1999. Direct appeals were made to the vice premier at the time, Wen Jiabao, as well as the then-head of China's central bank -- two powerful officials with oversight of the industry.
"I humbly request that the vice premier lead and coordinate the matter from a higher level," Ma Mingzhe, chairman of Ping An, implored in a letter to Mr. Wen that was reviewed by The New York Times.
Ping An was not broken up.
The successful outcome of the lobbying effort would prove monumental.
Ping An went on to become one of China's largest financial services companies, a $50 billion powerhouse now worth more than A.I.G., MetLife or Prudential. And behind the scenes, shares in Ping An that would be worth billions of dollars once the company rebounded were acquired by relatives of Mr. Wen.
The Times reported last month that the relatives of Mr. Wen, who became prime minister in 2003, had grown extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership, acquiring stakes in tourist resorts, banks, jewelers, telecommunications companies and other business ventures.
The greatest source of wealth, by far, The Times investigation has found, came from the shares in Ping An bought about eight months after the insurer was granted a waiver to the requirement that big financial companies be broken up.
Long before most investors could buy Ping An stock, Taihong, a company that would soon be controlled by Mr. Wen's relatives, acquired a large stake in Ping An from state-owned entities that held shares in the insurer, regulatory and corporate records show. And by all appearances, Taihong got a sweet deal. The shares were bought in December 2002 for one-quarter of the price that another big investor -- the British bank HSBC Holdings -- paid for its shares just two months earlier, according to interviews and public filings.
By June 2004, the shares held by the Wen relatives had already quadrupled in value, even before the company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. And by 2007, the initial $65 million investment made by Taihong would be worth $3.7 billion.
Corporate records show that the relatives' stake of that investment most likely peaked at $2.2 billion in late 2007, the last year in which Taihong's shareholder records were publicly available. Because the company is no longer listed in Ping An's public filings, it is unclear if the relatives continue to hold shares.
It is also not known whether Mr. Wen or the central bank chief at the time, Dai Xianglong, personally intervened on behalf of Ping An's request for a waiver, or if Mr. Wen was even aware of the stakes held by his relatives.
But internal Ping An documents, government filings and interviews with bankers and former senior executives at Ping An indicate that both the vice premier's office and the central bank were among the regulators involved in the Ping An waiver meetings and who had the authority to sign off on the waiver.
Only two large state-run financial institutions were granted similar waivers, filings show, while three of China's big state-run insurance companies were forced to break up. Many of the country's big banks complied with the breakup requirement -- enforced after the financial crisis because of concerns about the stability of the financial system -- by selling their assets in other institutions.
Ping An issued a statement to The Times saying the company strictly complies with rules and regulations, but does not know the backgrounds of all entities behind shareholders. The company also said "it is the legitimate right of shareholders to buy and sell shares between themselves."
In Beijing, China's foreign ministry did not return calls seeking comment for this article. Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman sharply criticized the investigation by The Times into the finances of Mr. Wen's relatives, saying it "smears China and has ulterior motives."
After The Times reported last month on the family's wealth, lawyers representing the family said the article contained unspecified errors and that the family reserved the right to take legal action.
In addition, the Chinese government blocked access to the English-language and Chinese-language Web sites of The Times in China -- and continues to do so -- saying the action was "in accordance with laws and rules."
Neither Mr. Wen, who is expected to retire in March, nor Mr. Dai, who is now the head of the National Social Security Fund, could be reached for comment.
Western and Chinese bankers and lawyers involved in Ping An's 2004 Hong Kong stock listing and a subsequent 2007 listing in Shanghai said they did not know that relatives of Mr. Wen had acquired large stakes in the company.
Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which once held sizable stakes in Ping An and served as lead underwriters for the Hong Kong public offering, also said they were never told of the holdings. At Ping An's urging, the two investment banks had also appealed in 2000 to Mr. Wen and other regulators for the waiver from the breakup rule. The private equity divisions of the two investment banks sold their combined stakes to HSBC in 2005 for about $1 billion -- a 14-fold increase on their initial investment.
Thousands of pages of publicly available corporate documents reviewed by The Times suggest that the Ping An stakes held by the prime minister's relatives were concealed behind layers of obscure partnerships rather than being held directly in their names.
In an interview last month, Duan Weihong, a wealthy Wen family friend, said that the shares in Ping An actually belonged to her and that it was an accident that Mr. Wen's relatives appeared in shareholding records. The process involved borrowing their government identity cards and obtaining their signatures.
China and Hong Kong have detailed regulations on the disclosure of corporate information deemed material to a publicly listed company's operation, like the identities of large shareholders and details about whether companies controlling large stakes are related parties. But legal experts say enforcement is often lax, particularly inside China. There is also, they say, a culture of nominee shareholders -- when one person holds shares on behalf of someone else -- that is difficult for even the most seasoned lawyers and accountants to penetrate.
The Times found no indication such regulations or any law was broken, nor any evidence that Mr. Wen held shares in Ping An under his own name.
After reviewing questions from The Times, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange declined to comment. The China Securities Regulatory Commission in Beijing did not respond to inquiries.
HSBC, today Ping An's largest shareholder with about 15.5 percent of its stock, declined to comment. The company announced last week that it is considering selling its stake in Ping An as part of a broad effort to raise capital.
Ping An today is a hugely successful conglomerate with revenue of $40 billion last year and about 500,000 insurance agents across China. It is China's only fully integrated financial institution, with the second largest insurer, a trust company and brokerage house.
In late 2010, Ping An added more firepower, announcing a $4 billion deal that has since given it control of the Shenzhen Development Bank, one of China's midsize commercial banks. Ping An is now building a new headquarters here in Shenzhen, a spectacular 115-story office tower that was designed by the New York architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox.
Ping An's Close Call
Ma Mingzhe, the Ping An chairman and chief executive, was a high school graduate who got his start as an aide to Yuan Geng, a pioneering figure in some of China's earliest economic reforms and an early leader of Ping An.
Impressed with Mr. Ma's intellect, Mr. Yuan put him in charge of human resources at a state-managed industrial park, and eventually at a new insurance firm, Ping An, which took root in Shenzhen, a coastal boomtown.
Mr. Ma's timing was opportune. China was just beginning to restructure its state-led economy. The government began dismantling the iron rice bowl system, which had guaranteed pensions, social insurance and living quarters to Communist Party cadres.
Although Ping An was founded as a state entity, it was one of the first Chinese insurance companies to experiment with Western management systems, including the use of actuaries and back-office operations, as well as foreign shareholders.
Mr. Ma helped manage the tiny company when it was founded in 1988. Several years later, he was looking for big-name shareholders from the United States.
In 1994, the private equity divisions of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs each paid about $35 million to acquire 7.5 percent interests in Ping An. At the time, they were the largest foreign investments ever made in a Chinese financial institution.
Much of the company's early success was attributed to Mr. Ma, a hard-charging executive who was admired for his management and political skills -- and for taking risks.
"He had all the qualities of a great entrepreneur," says Yan Feng, who helped run Ping An's Shanghai office in the 1990s. "He was a quick learner, knew how to adapt to new situations and was really determined. He'd do whatever it takes to get what he wants."
But the company's growth drive ran into trouble in the late 1990s, when China's economy weakened after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
The bloated state sector began to collapse, and by 1998, some of the nation's biggest banks were nearly insolvent.
Ping An's hard-won fortunes were also evaporating. Like most big Chinese insurers, Ping An had won new clients with investment products that guaranteed big returns over long periods based on the high interest rates banks offered for deposits during a time of inflation. When interest rates plummeted in the mid-1990s, losses piled up.
In 1999, senior executives at Ping An began to acknowledge that the company could soon be insolvent. As a joint-stockholding company, Ping An had big institutional investors, mostly state companies. But many of them refused to come to the company's aid by purchasing additional shares, which would have provided needed capital.
"They weren't sure Ping An would survive," said one former Ping An executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
There was also mounting pressure from the government. Worried about systemic risks to the financial system, regulators in Beijing stepped up their enforcement of laws that required financial institutions to limit the scope of their business activities.
Banks were told to sell their stakes in brokerage houses or trust companies; and insurance companies had to choose to operate in life or property insurance, but not both.
After China's new insurance regulatory agency was established in 1998, it began pressing Ping An to shed its trust and securities business, and to split its life and property insurance divisions into separate companies.
At a news conference in November 1999, Ma Yongwei, then the chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, said the agency had already drawn up plans to split up Ping An and other insurers.
"The separation plans have been submitted to the State Council for approval," Ma Yongwei told the media, adding that they would "deepen reform of the insurance system."
Pushing Back the Regulators
With his company about to be broken up, Ma Mingzhe, also known as Peter Ma, fired off letters to leaders in Beijing, dictated memos reminding himself to "buy golf clubs" for high-ranking officials, and kept detailed charts outlining the lobbying responsibilities of each top executive at Ping An, according to a copy of those records verified by former Ping An executives.
Mr. Ma focused much of his personal energy on China's highest government administrative body, the State Council, a 38-member group whose senior leaders were Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao, then vice premier. The company also sought the support of Dai Xianglong, the nation's central bank chief, who also had oversight over the insurance industry.
Mr. Wen was in a unique position. He was head of China's powerful Central Financial Work Commission, which had been established in 1998 to oversee the country's banking, securities and insurance regulators, as well as China's biggest financial institutions.
When Mr. Ma met regulators, he told them his company was facing insolvency and asked them to help shore up the company's balance sheet by approving a Hong Kong stock offering, according to transcripts of Ping An meetings and interviews with participants.
"Now, Ping An's life insurance is in a loss, and property insurance and the trust company have thin margins," Mr. Ma wrote in the Sept. 29, 1999, letter to Mr. Wen. The contents were confirmed by two former top Ping An executives.
Rather than an out-and-out breakup, Mr. Ma offered a middle road. After seeking advice of other investors, Mr. Ma proposed the formation of a holding company that would effectively separate life insurance from property but keep them under one corporate umbrella, along with the securities and trust division.
The company, he said, would re-establish itself as the Ping An Group, according to Ping An documents reviewed by The Times. He then began looking for allies to promote his proposal.
In January 2000, with Mr. Ma's backing, executives from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs wrote a joint letter to Mr. Wen arguing that a breakup would "violate China's policy to encourage and protect foreign investment," according to a copy of the letter reviewed by The Times. The letter's authenticity was verified by former executives at the two investment banks.
The American investment banks warned that "as a listed company in the U.S., we could be required to disclose our losses relating to the investment in Ping An, which would not be helpful for the image of China's policy of reform and opening to the outside."
The letter came after months of aggressive lobbying on the part of Ping An executives and the two American banks to persuade other high-ranking officials in Beijing, including the central bank and the insurance regulator, to hold Ping An together, according to corporate documents reviewed by The Times.
As early as 1999, executives at Ping An also began making contact with the relatives of Mr. Wen.
Hu Kun, a former Ping An employee who served as Mr. Ma's staff assistant from 1997 to 2000, recalled a 1999 meeting between Mr. Ma and Zhang Beili, the wife of Mr. Wen.
Mr. Hu said he was not told what transpired at the meeting, but he recalled his boss's reaction. "Because of that meeting, Chairman Ma got very excited," said Mr. Hu, who is now living in the United States and who has quarreled with Ping An over 52,000 shares he claimed he was owed.
Corporate records reviewed by The Times indicate that Mr. Ma held an afternoon meeting and then dinner with the prime minister's wife and Li Chunyan, who ran Ping An's office in Beijing, on June 17, 1999.
It is not known what they discussed, but the relationship seemed to flourish. Around the same time, a diamond company partly controlled by the relatives of Ms. Zhang began occupying office space at the Ping An office tower in Beijing, according to records the diamond company filed with regulators. Later, a start-up co-founded by Wen Yunsong, the son of Ms. Zhang and the prime minister, won a lucrative technology contract from Ping An, according to interviews with former Ping An executives.
Mr. Ma, who is 56 and still runs Ping An, declined to comment for this article. Interviews with four senior executives who worked with Mr. Ma and Mr. Hu at the corporate headquarters in Shenzhen during the same period corroborate Mr. Hu's recollections and the content of the documents reviewed by The Times concerning Ping An's lobbying efforts and meetings with the relatives of Mr. Wen.
In addition, Li Chunyan, who ran the Beijing office, confirmed in a telephone interview that during that period he had brought Ms. Zhang to meet the Ping An chairman, Mr. Ma.
The documents and interviews shed no light on whether those meetings played a role in the decision by government regulators to abandon plans to split up Ping An. But in April 2002, the nation's top regulators delivered their verdict. With approval of the State Council and insurance regulators, Ping An began the process of transforming itself into a financial conglomerate.
The company was not only allowed to retain property and life insurance licenses, but also licenses that permitted it to operate a brokerage and a trust company. It was also allowed to obtain a bank license.
Together, analysts say, the licenses were worth a fortune in China's tightly regulated marketplace.
"They were one of the few who got to enjoy these gold-digging benefits," said Bob Leung, a longtime insurance analyst at UBS in Hong Kong.
By late 2002, Ping An had not simply survived the downturn, its prospects had begun to look bright. The company's restructuring bolstered revenue and profits. In October of that year, one of the world's biggest banks, HSBC, agreed to pay $600 million to acquire a 10 percent stake in the company from Ping An. Just over a year later, regulators approved the company's application to list and sell shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
While Ping An was preparing for its listing in Hong Kong, a group of investors with close ties to senior officials in Beijing, including Wen Jiabao, were quietly accumulating large blocks of Ping An stock.
Buying Into Ping An
On Dec. 26, 2002, Ping An filings show, a company run by Duan Weihong, a Wen family friend from the prime minister's hometown, acquired Ping An stock through a company called Taihong. Soon after, the relatives of Mr. Wen and colleagues of his wife took control of that investment vehicle, the records show.
According to documents Ping An filed ahead of its Hong Kong listing, Taihong acquired 77.7 million shares of Ping An from the China Ocean Shipping Company, a global shipping giant known as Cosco, and 2.2 million more shares from Cosco's Dalian subsidiary. A two-for-one stock split doubled the number of shares Taihong owned. So in June 2004, just before Ping An's Hong Kong offering, Taihong held 159.8 million shares, or about 3.2 percent of Ping An's stock, according to public filings.
In an interview, Ms. Duan said she had paid about 40 cents a share at current exchange rates, or a total of $65 million, to acquire the shares.
The price seems to have been a huge and unusual discount, analysts say, since HSBC had two months earlier acquired its 10 percent stake for about $1.60 a share, according to public filings.
Cosco did not return calls seeking comment.
For Taihong, it was a blockbuster purchase. By 2007, when the price of Ping An's stock peaked, the 159 million shares were valued at $3.7 billion -- though by 2007 Taihong had already significantly reduced its stake, according to public filings.
While Taihong was the shareholder of record, the beneficiaries of the Ping An deal were cloaked behind more than a dozen investment vehicles controlled by the relatives of Mr. Wen, including two brothers-in-law, a sister-in-law, as well as several longtime colleagues and business partners of his wife, Zhang Beili, according to corporate and regulatory documents. All of them were listed, along with Ms. Duan, as the owners of Taihong.
And by 2007, the prime minister's mother, who is now 91, was listed on public documents as holding $120 million worth of Ping An stock through a pair of investment companies linked to Taihong.
Ms. Duan, who says she got to know the prime minister's family in 2000, said that she bought the Ping An shares for her own personal account. The Wen relatives only appear in the Taihong shareholding records, she said, because her company borrowed the government-issued identity cards of other people -- mistakenly, she said, from relatives of the prime minister -- to help mask her own Ping An stake from the public.
"In the end," Ms. Duan said, "I received 100 percent of the returns."
The Fallout
In 2001, China issued new regulations that put restrictions on trading in listed shares by Communist Party members and their families.
For instance, the rules barred party officials in charge of a state-owned company from using their parents, children -- or even their children's spouse's relatives -- to trade stocks of a listed state-owned company.
The Times found no indication that Mr. Wen shared inside information with family members.
But there are many unanswered questions about the relatives' holdings, analysts consulted by The Times said, like who might have known about the relatives' purchases and whether anyone had a legal obligation to disclose that information.
Executives at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs say they were unaware of the share purchases and were not involved in the transactions.
The companies also said that a typical I.P.O. process is unlikely to uncover the ultimate identity of shareholders who are hiding behind layers of investment vehicles using unrecognizable names.
According to regulations in Hong Kong and China, publicly listed companies and their professional partners who help sell shares to the public are legally obligated to disclose the identities of only those shareholders controlling a stake larger than 5 percent. The Times found that at its peak, Taihong, the investment vehicle tied to the Wen family, never held more than a 3.2 percent stake.
Another question that remains unanswered is how Taihong was able to buy shares of Ping An at a price that appears to have been highly discounted. By late 2002, Ping An had already become a hot I.P.O. prospect following a big investment by HSBC.
The answers to some of the questions, legal experts say, may turn on who was involved in brokering the deal that led to the relatives' acquiring shares in Ping An in the period before the company's public offering in 2004, and whether the deal-makers were seeking to gain favors from the regulators.
"The key questions are: why were these people chosen, and on what terms did they get the shares?" said Jerome A. Cohen, a professor at New York University Law School and an expert on China's legal system. "Obviously, everyone would like to get in before a hot I.P.O."

Abstract: All of the components of a sensible Social Security reform -- means-testing for wealthier beneficiaries, changing the way benefits adjust for inflation, a slow increase in the retirement age -- become easier if the program is treated as normal safety-net spending rather than an untouchable entitlement with a dedicated funding stream.

Full text:   WE have two political parties in America, runs a saying that conservatives like to quote. One is stupid, the other is evil. And when they join forces to do something that's both stupid and evil -- well, that's what we call "bipartisanship."
The payroll tax holiday that passed Congress in the winter of 2010 was a rare exception to this pessimistic rule. Cutting the payroll tax was good short-term politics for both Democrats and Republicans: it was a tax cut that liberals hoped would double as stimulus, and a boost to the middle class that conservatives could support without embracing new federal spending. But more important, it opened the door to what would be good long-term policy as well -- because more than almost any feature of the American tax code, the payroll tax deserves to be pared away into extinction.
But now Washington is in danger of practicing payroll-tax bipartisanship of a more destructive sort. While the White House and Congressional Republicans wrestle over where to set income tax rates and how and whether to cut spending, the payroll tax holiday has been orphaned. Lacking noisy champions and press attention, it's in danger of expiring at the end of the year out of political indifference.
That outcome would be unfortunate. Payroll taxes are a relic of New Deal Machiavellianism: by taking a bite of every worker's paycheck and promising postretirement returns, Franklin Roosevelt effectively disguised Social Security as a pay-as-you-go system, even though the program actually redistributes from rich to poor and young to old. That disguise has helped keep Social Security sacrosanct -- hailed by Democrats because it protects the poor and backed by Republicans as a reward for steady work.
But the costs of this disguise have grown too great to bear. Whatever its past political advantages, the payroll tax now imposes an unnecessary burden on a stagnating economy. In an era of mass unemployment, mediocre wage growth and weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder, it makes no sense to finance our retirement system with a tax that falls directly on wages and hiring and imposes particular burdens on small business and the working class.
What's more, the payroll tax as it exists today can't cover the program's projected liabilities anyway, and the pay-as-you-go myth stands in the way of the changes required to keep Social Security solvent. All of the components of a sensible Social Security reform -- means-testing for wealthier beneficiaries, changing the way benefits adjust for inflation, a slow increase in the retirement age -- become easier if the program is treated as normal safety-net spending rather than an untouchable entitlement with a dedicated funding stream.
By cutting the tax rate and promising to make up the difference out of general revenue, the payroll tax holiday took a big step in this direction -- and letting it expire would take a big step back. Republicans have every reason to recognize this reality: their long-term size-of-government goals require Social Security reform, and the illusions fostered by the payroll tax are an obstacle -- originally created by their political enemies! -- to any restraint in what the program spends.
Instead, a mix of ideology and cynicism has tilted Republicans against the payroll tax cut. The party's ideologues regard the issue as a distraction from the more important debate over income taxes, and some of them fret, à la Mitt Romney with the "47 percent," about taking too many Americans off the tax rolls. The party's cynics, meanwhile, have seized on the opportunity to imitate liberal scare campaigns on Social Security, and posture as staunch defenders of the retirement status quo.
It's been left to a few prominent Democrats, including Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, to make the case for letting the holiday continue. This is a positive sign for liberalism, since it suggests a preference for middle-class paychecks over middle-class entitlements, and a willingness to recognize that the ideals of work and thrift and upward mobility aren't necessarily well served by the way we tax and spend today.
It will be a discouraging sign for conservatism if these Democrats don't find Republican allies. Nothing cost the Republican Party more dearly in the last election than the sense that the party didn't care about the struggles of the middle class. The payroll tax cut is addressed directly to those struggles -- and it's also a case where the short-term interests of Americans living paycheck to paycheck align with the long-term conservative interest in entitlement reform.
That combination doesn't often come around. So there is only one question conservatives should be asking about the payroll tax holiday: How do we make it permanent?

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Standing by his desk in New Zealand's distinctive round Parliament building, known locally as the Beehive, Prime Minister John Key proudly brandished an ornately engraved sword. It was used, he said, by Frodo Baggins, the protagonist of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and in the films it possesses magical powers that cause it to glow blue in the presence of goblins.
"This was given to me by the president of the United States," said Mr. Key, marveling that President Obama's official gift to New Zealand was, after all, a New Zealand product.
In Mr. Key's spare blond-wood office -- with no goblins in sight -- the sword looked decidedly unmagical. But it served as a reminder that in New Zealand, the business of running a country goes hand in hand with the business of making movies.
For better or worse, Mr. Key's government has taken extreme measures that have linked its fortunes to some of Hollywood's biggest pictures, making this country of 4.4 million people, slightly more than the city of Los Angeles, a grand experiment in the fusion of film and government.
That union has been on enthusiastic display here in recent weeks as "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," the first of three related movies by the director Peter Jackson, approached its world premiere on Wednesday in Wellington (and on Dec. 14 in the United States). Anticipation in New Zealand has been building, and there are signs everywhere of the film's integration into Kiwi life -- from the giant replica of the movie's Gollum creature suspended over the waiting area at Wellington Airport to the gift shops that are expanding to meet anticipated demand for Hobbit merchandise (elf ears, $14).
But the path to this moment has been filled with controversy. Two years ago, when a dispute with unions threatened to derail the "Hobbit" movies -- endangering several thousand jobs and a commitment of some $500 million by Warner Brothers -- Mr. Key persuaded the Parliament to rewrite its national labor laws.
It was a breathtaking solution, even in a world accustomed to generous public support of movie projects, and a substantial incentive package was included: the government agreed to contribute $99 million in production costs and add $10 million to the studio's marketing budget. And its tourism office will spend about $8 million in its current fiscal year, and probably more in the future, as part of a promotional campaign with Time Warner that is marketing the country as a film-friendly fantasyland.
For a tiny nation like New Zealand, where plans to cut $35 million from the education budget set off national outrage earlier this year (and a backtrack from the government), the "Hobbit" concessions were difficult for many to swallow, especially since the country had already provided some $150 million in support for the three "Lord of the Rings" movies.
Now, even amid the excitement of the "Hobbit" opening, skepticism about the government's film-centric strategy remains. And recently it has become entangled with new suspicions: that Mr. Key's government is taking cues from America's powerful film industry in handling a request by United States officials for the extradition of Kim Dotcom, the mogul whose given name was Kim Schmitz, so he can face charges of pirating copyrighted material.
New Zealand's political scene erupted in September, as Mr. Key publicly apologized to Mr. Dotcom for what turned out to be illegal spying on him by the country's Government Communications Security Bureau. The Waikato Times, a provincial paper, taunted Mr. Key, accusing him of making New Zealand the "51st state," while others suggested that a whirlwind trip by Mr. Key to Los Angeles in early October was somehow tied to the Dotcom case.
"No studio executive raised it with me," Mr. Key said in an interview last month. He spoke the day after a private dinner where he lobbied executives from Disney, Warner Brothers, Fox and other companies for still more New Zealand film work, with Mr. Jackson, a New Zealander, joining by video link.
Mr. Key has been sharply criticized for cozying up to Mr. Jackson in what some consider unseemly ways. Last year, a month before elections in which he and his National Party were fighting to keep control of the government, Mr. Key skipped an appointment with Queen Elizabeth II in Australia to visit the Hobbiton set. He also interviewed Mr. Jackson on a radio show, prompting an outcry from the opposition.
Pro-union forces remain predictably outraged. Phil Darkins, a vice president of Actors Equity in New Zealand, calls his country the "only Western democracy on the planet where professional performers have virtually no rights," and his group has continued to seek an overall agreement with producers.
Mr. Darkins, in a recent e-mail, also objected to immigration law changes that allow foreign film workers into the country for brief periods without review by local worker groups, calling it "a virtual open-door policy."
The opposition Labour Party, while backing the government's support for the film industry, has chafed at what it views as the "Warner Brothers-specific" concessions made by Mr. Key.
"We wouldn't move the crossbar for any individual company," said Trevor Mallard, a Labour leader, in an interview in Wellington last June.
And even as the "Hobbit" films, years in the making, approached their debut, Mr. Key could not predict when a next major film would follow.
"It's too early to say," he said.
An Economic Engine
Nowhere is filmmaking big enough to move a national economy. But in New Zealand, add movies to another business -- tourism -- and there is potential for transformative economic growth.
That's the strategy Mr. Key's government has pursued. The making of feature films and television shows generated only about $1.1 billion in revenue last year, well under 1 percent of a gross domestic product of roughly $160 billion. About 17 percent of movie and television revenue is directly subsidized by the national government, which spent nearly $200 million to support movies last year.
But tourism is an economic sector 20 times the size of the country's movie and television production business. And as other countries, notably China, have moved into some of New Zealand's core dairy industry, the Kiwis, a particularly inventive people, have focused more on the vacation market.
The thinking: Movies may draw visitors who are not up to the rigors of bungee-jumping, zorbing (which involves rolling downhill inside a plastic ball) or other rigorous outdoor sports that are tourism mainstays.
In an unusual arrangement, Mr. Key, a former currency trader with Merrill Lynch who did graduate work at Harvard, retains a portfolio as his government's tourism minister. Scratching for solutions to the 2010 crisis with unions over "The Hobbit," he settled on a policy that would, in effect, use much of the tourism budget to re-brand the country as Middle-earth, hoping to lure visitors to locations where Mr. Jackson has shot and is shooting his films.
Still, it's a sizable gamble considering the potential pitfalls. There is no guarantee that moviegoers will embrace the "Hobbit" films with the same fervor as the "Rings" trilogy. Those films had combined worldwide ticket sales of about $3 billion (in 2012 dollars, after adjusting for inflation). Warner and its New Line Cinema unit, both of which declined to comment for this article, have high hopes for the movies, which also have backing from MGM.
Other big questions remain, starting with Mr. Jackson's decision to shoot the films at 48 frames a second, twice the usual rate, in search of new visual heights; early reaction to the result has been sharply mixed. Then there is the capricious nature of the filmmaking business, which has become increasingly mobile and will quickly flee to the national or local government offering the best incentives.
Exchange rates play a sizable part in the bidding process. Favorable rates were one reason Mr. Jackson and his partners were able to build New Zealand into a crossroads for special effects and postproduction work, the kind of business that George Lucas once cornered in Northern California. "Avatar," "Marvel's The Avengers," "The Adventures of Tintin" and "Prometheus" are among the many films that have crossed through Mr. Jackson's Wellington-based effects shop, Weta Digital, on their way to theaters.
But recently a stronger New Zealand dollar, which currently trades for about 82 cents in United States currency, has eroded its cost advantage for North American companies, something that other countries are trying to exploit. Northern Ireland now claims to be the "new New Zealand," while Serbia says it is "New Zealand, but cheaper," notes Gisella Carr, the chief executive of Film New Zealand, an industry group that scours the globe for film work.
Hollywood is also looking to China, where an aggressive government and its allied companies are building expensive movie facilities and offering access to a vast market in exchange for a stake in American studio pictures.
New Zealand does have language in its favor, since the crews speak English. It also has a "just do it" approach that endears it to studios. "We're not afraid," said Tim Coddington, an Auckland-based producer who worked on the "Chronicles of Narnia" fantasies in New Zealand. Still, for Mr. Key and others, the primary challenge remains linked tightly to Mr. Jackson: how do you build a significant and enduring economic sector from a local business dominated by one man?
"Peter Jackson might make movies for the next 50 years, or he might not," said Mr. Key. "You can't base an industry solely on one person. That's a very vulnerable business strategy."
The Native Son
Inside one of four soundstages at his Stone Street Studios, located near Wellington Airport, Peter Jackson stood among several dozen extras and delivered a pep talk. It was mid-June, and the scene involved villagers headed to battle. "Hold those weapons like you plan to use them," he commanded.
A disheveled, soft-spoken 51-year-old, he is accustomed to being in the thick of things. If Mr. Lucas and his "Star Wars"-born effects companies developed an outsize presence in Marin County in California, Mr. Jackson in many ways dominates a whole country.
When he decided to use 12 hilly acres of a remote sheep farm as his "Hobbit" village, a New Zealand army convoy arrived the next morning to build a series of access roads to the site. "We couldn't believe it," said Russell Alexander, an owner of the farmland. "This guy has command of our army?"
Smaller filmmakers say the priority given to big productions like Mr. Jackson's has hurt the independent community. In Auckland, where an independent film culture once thrived, Mr. Jackson is acidly referred to by less-favored members of the industry as "Sir Peter," emphasizing the honorific he received in 2010.
Mr. Jackson, who grew up in the village of Pukerua Bay, played down his stature during an interview inside his modestly furnished office. "My business empire? That's an awfully grandiose term," he said in response to a question.
He disagreed with the notion that New Zealand's film industry rested squarely on his shoulders. "If I started to think like that my head would explode," he said. "I can't take responsibility for everyone's employment."
New Zealand was notably not kind to Mr. Jackson at the outset of his career. But little by little, he clawed his way forward, pouring his own money into his films and ultimately buying an old paint factory as a studio base when he was starting the "Rings" trilogy.
"It was mothballed, covered in dust, dark, dingy and cold," Mr. Jackson said of the complex. "We were going to be up to our eyeballs in debt if we bought it."
But as he toured the grounds with Fran Walsh, an Oscar-winning screenwriter and producer who is Mr. Jackson's partner in life and in business, an omen appeared. Someone had left behind an old paperback book -- "The Lord of the Rings."
"We looked at each other and said, 'We'll take it,' " Mr. Jackson said.
The paint factory formed part of Stone Street Studios, which is laid out around a courtyard and includes departments like wardrobe and makeup and the four soundstages, two of them sophisticated enough to allow Mr. Jackson to construct a rushing river inside, as "Hobbit" scenes required.
A few blocks away is Weta Digital, which employs over a thousand graphic artists, technicians and support staff when operating at full tilt, and has taken over four buildings, one of which is a former ice cream factory. Sprawling a couple of streets away is Mr. Jackson's postproduction facility, complete with apartments, so directors never have to leave, and a lavishly decorated theater, a copy of one at the Hearst Castle in California.
Also nearby is the 300-employee Weta Workshop, which builds props, designs film-related merchandise and fills orders for privately commissioned "toys" for rich collectors -- like a full-size working Panzer tank.
"It's all an endeavor to create sustainable work for us," said Richard Taylor, a five-time Oscar winner for visual effects, makeup and costumes who co-owns much of Mr. Jackson's moviemaking operation and runs Weta Workshop. "Our fortunes are dictated by the world's creative industries, and that puts us in a very nervous place a lot of the time."
The collection of companies now takes up so much square footage in Wellington's Miramar neighborhood that it has been given a nickname: Wellywood.
An Illusion's Staying Power
Whether movies are a matter of political life and death for Mr. Key remains open to debate. He strongly challenged the notion that he might have lost the 2011 election had "The Hobbit" been lost. "Definitely not," he said.
Things got tense for him during the campaign, however, after he interviewed Mr. Jackson in September 2011 on a radio talk show called "The PM's Hour." New Zealand's Electoral Commission declared that the interview violated laws barring broadcasters from providing a candidate with free publicity close to an election, but a full-blown scandal was averted when police officials decided in March not to prosecute the radio service. Still, Labour politicians were unappeased, and blamed Mr. Key. "It was a political stunt, and he should have taken responsibility for that," Labour's deputy leader, Grant Robertson, said in a statement.
Nor did Mr. Jackson's gilded image escape untarnished in the turmoil over the dealings with Warner. In June 2011, a periodic survey of the "most trusted" people in New Zealand found that Mr. Jackson had plunged 68 slots, to No. 74.
The question facing both Mr. Key and Mr. Jackson is whether overseas travelers will be attracted to a deliberate illusion that blurs the line between New Zealand and its films. It worked once before: the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, featuring lavish photography of volcanoes, waterfalls and sharp-peaked mountain ranges, prompted a surge of visitors. "I don't mean to sound mercenary, but at this point, it's not about the films, it's about New Zealand," said Kevin Bowler, the chief executive of Tourism New Zealand.
As Mr. Bowler spoke in June, about two dozen workers at computer screens in an office overlooking the Wellington harbor were proliferating a Web and poster campaign. As "Lord of the Rings" tourism peaked in recent years, about 6 percent of international visitors to New Zealand, or roughly 150,000 people, cited the films as a reason for coming; 11,200 said it was their only reason. Given the movie world's increasing appetite for fantasy, however, Mr. Bowler predicted that the payoff from Mr. Jackson's new films would be larger.
Already, plans are in place to close streets in central Wellington for a day and a half to accommodate a throng of perhaps 100,000 expected to gather outside the premiere at the Embassy theater, which has been updated so that it can handle the film's high-speed format.
Mr. Jackson's staff at Weta, in the meantime, has been busy redecorating the country, including placing fanciful, Weta-designed "bandages" on the fuselage of Wellington's air ambulance.
Here in Wellington, Mr. Key explained, "Peter is a very, very big fish in quite a small tank."

Full text:   LONDON -- Beth Foster was looking for a better way to invest part of her bonus than a savings account when she received an e-mail from her trusted online travel agent.
The privately owned travel start-up, called Mr & Mrs Smith, was selling a four-year bond directly to its customers, paying 7.5 percent interest in cash or 9.5 percent in Mr & Mrs Smith vouchers that could be used to book vacations.
With memories of a recent trip to Tuscany still fresh in her mind, Ms. Foster, 30, decided to invest just short of £5,000, or just under $8,000, and tapped into a growing market in Britain and the rest of Europe of companies seeking cash directly from individuals eager for higher returns in a low-interest environment.
"This is a much better and more exciting way to invest than a savings account," said Ms. Foster, a strategist at Google in London. "It seemed as safe as anything else right now."
With interest rates at a record low of 0.5 percent in Britain and many savings account rates below the country's inflation level, investors are jumping on products with higher returns, even if they are riskier. Companies are eager to explore new ways of financing as bank lending continues to be tight after the financial crisis.
Britain's retail bond market, where companies large and small go directly to individual investors to raise money, has soared to more than $2 billion a year from about $360 million in 2010 (the figures do not include unregulated bonds issued by the likes of Mr & Mrs Smith, which are not tracked). That is still minuscule compared to the $214 billion in debt issued by companies in Britain this year and $3.7 trillion worldwide.
Similar retail bonds are not offered in the United States, where investors hungry for yield have piled into corporate debt through investment funds. But the retail bonds speak to a broader trend of companies tapping people for money more directly and introducing greater risk. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act that Congress passed this year allows "emerging growth" companies to sell stock with fewer restrictions and then report less information to their shareholders than was required from ordinary companies.
Concerns about Europe's retail bonds are emerging, especially with the smaller companies. The bonds might appeal to customers of the companies because they feel they are supporting a start-up firm, but many are risky because they are unregulated and barely traded.
"It's a bit worrying that people are prepared to take extra risk because they know or trust the company brand name," said Howard Burchett, director of private clients at broker Charles Stanley. Mr & Mrs Smith said it planned to raise nearly $8 million with the bond and "cut out the big banks" while obtaining financing for an expansion plan. Leon, a sandwich shop here, plans to pay interest to its bond investors in salads and meatball wraps, while Hotel Chocolat, a British chocolate maker, has been paying bond investors in boxes of chocolate.
"Interest rates main institutions are offering are very low, there's no trust in financial institutions and it's pointless to keep money in the bank, so people are thinking, 'Why not?' " Peter Harris, co-founder of Hotel Chocolat, said. The company so far has raised more than $6 million by selling bonds.
While Hotel Chocolat's and Mr & Mrs Smith's unregulated bonds are not publicly traded and are purchased directly from the company, another more liquid and regulated area of the retail bond market is also flourishing. In it, a growing number of larger and publicly traded utilities and financial services firms have been soliciting retail investors over the last year or so.
For these companies, retail bonds are usually a cheaper and faster way to raise money than a traditional corporate bond. They do not require the services of investment banks or expensive road shows to garner investor interest, and listing fees are lower. Companies market their retail bonds directly to their customers through leaflets and by post rather than to financial institutions.
Investors in retail bonds that trade on the London Stock Exchange still need to purchase them through a designated broker, but they do not have to buy into a fund and are exempt from a certain tax on financial investments.
They also don't have to put up as much money. The minimum investment is well below that of traditional corporate bonds. For example, St. Modwen Properties, a real estate company that raised $127 million through a retail bond on Nov. 7, allowed a minimum investment of £2,000, or a little over $3,100. That compares with a minimum of nearly $80,000 for a corporate bond, according to the London Stock Exchange. St. Modwen's bonds mature in 2019 and pay a fixed interest rate of 6.25 percent a year. Other companies that issued retail bonds recently include National Grid, a utility; the financial arm of Tesco, the supermarket chain; and Severn Trent, a British water company.
"It's about diversifying our funding sources," said Michael McKeon, chief financial officer of Severn Trent, which borrowed about $120 million through 10-year bonds at a variable rate in July of 1.3 percent. "If it goes well, we should be coming back to this market more often."
Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said he saw opportunities for similar markets in the United States and elsewhere in Europe.
Given that about three-quarters of corporate funding needs in Europe are met by banks, and banks are deleveraging their lending portfolios, "we see a good match between the yield in retail bonds and a lot of capital available from retail investors looking for that yield," Mr. Rolet said. "There is no yield these days unless you want to invest in Greek debt."
Eden Riche, head of debt capital markets origination at Investec in London, said the stock exchange's retail bond market helped to make bonds more attractive to ordinary investors because of greater transparency and a low minimum investment of around $3,000, on average. Once the bonds are traded on the exchange, investors can buy and sell them for as little as £100, or $160.
"You've got this huge pool of retail liquidity sitting dormant in savings accounts that is coming to the bond market, earning higher yield," Mr. Riche said. "But of course there is higher risk associated with this."
Retail bonds that are not traded on the exchange, like the Mr & Mrs Smith bond, can be bought from the company directly either through their Web site or by sending a check by post.
Ms. Foster, the Mr & Mrs Smith investor, said she discussed the move with her financial adviser, who had his reservations. But in the end, her decision was based on a little bit more than just pure financials. "I really believe in the brand," she said, "and it's much more appealing using your money supporting a U.K. start-up."

Full text:   The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, again strongly urged Congress on Tuesday to ward off the sudden and severe combination of tax increases and spending cuts coming at the end of the year.
"Uncertainties about the situation in Europe and especially about the prospects for federal fiscal policy seem to be weighing on the spending decisions of households and businesses as well as on financial conditions," Mr. Bernanke said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York. "Such uncertainties will only be increased by discord and delay."
Citing several outside economic assessments of the coming tax increases and spending, he said "a fiscal shock of that size would send the economy toppling back into recession." Mr. Bernanke summarized the Fed's recent actions to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities and continue extending the maturity of its Treasury holdings.
Asked after the speech whether the Fed would provide specific unemployment and inflation thresholds that would prompt officials to tighten monetary policy, as some analysts have expected, Mr. Bernanke said that officials were considering this and that he did not want to "front run" those discussions. He said one advantage of this approach would be to better distinguish between how the Fed thinks the economy is going to evolve and how the Fed will react to conditions.
But he also said that monetary policy was a complex process and that officials had "an enormous amount of material" at every meeting that might be difficult to boil down to just two or three numbers that represent when officials would begin to tighten policy. Even if they could do that, he said, it was unclear whether there would be sufficient agreement on the committee about which numbers would initiate a policy change.
Analysts have also been expecting that the Fed will start replacing its current program to extend the maturity of its Treasury holdings with straight purchases of Treasury securities. In his speech, Mr. Bernanke did not address this question.
He said that while the details of a Congressional agreement to avert a so-called fiscal cliff were important, so were speed and a general impression of a functional and cooperative legislative branch.
"The economic confidence of both market participants and the general public likely will also be influenced by the extent to which our political system proves able to deliver a reasonable solution with a minimum of uncertainty and delay," he said.
Financial crises are always followed by painfully slow recoveries, Mr. Bernanke said, but this recovery has also been hampered by several frustrating "headwinds," including a healing but still scarred housing market, clogged credit channels, the European debt crisis and, perhaps most pressingly, fiscal gridlock in Washington.
He also expressed concern about the approaching debt limit.
The United States is expected to reach the limit on how much it can borrow in early 2013. The last time the debt limit was about to be reached, Congressional Republicans held the decision to raise the limit hostage until the very last minute.
"As you will recall, the threat of default in the summer of 2011 fueled economic uncertainty and badly damaged confidence, even though an agreement ultimately was reached," Mr. Bernanke said. "A failure to reach a timely agreement this time around could impose even heavier economic and financial costs."
He said that averting the fiscal tightening at year's end should not preclude fixing the country's longer-run problems with the fiscal budget, which he said was on "an unsustainable path."
Avoiding a fiscal tightening when the recovery is still fragile would help bolster economic growth, he said, which would help bring down the deficit as businesses and individuals make more money and as a result pay more in taxes.
"At the same time, a credible plan to put the federal budget on a path that will be sustainable in the long run could help keep longer-term interest rates low and boost household and business confidence, thereby supporting economic growth today," he said.
Mr. Bernanke was also asked why the Fed does not lower or eliminate the interest rate -- already at 0.25 percent -- that it pays banks for excess reserves kept at the central bank to encourage more lending.
He said that Fed officials had not ruled out that idea but that so far it appeared the benefits would be very small and that there were concerns that eliminating the interest takes away a tool used to control broader interest rates.

Full text:   DAUPHIN ISLAND, Ala. -- Even in the off season, the pastel beach houses lining a skinny strip of sand here are a testament to the good life.
They are also a monument to the generosity of the federal government.
The western end of this Gulf Coast island has proved to be one of the most hazardous places in the country for waterfront property. Since 1979, nearly a dozen hurricanes and large storms have rolled in and knocked down houses, chewed up sewers and water pipes and hurled sand onto the roads.
Yet time and again, checks from Washington have allowed the town to put itself back together.
Across the nation, tens of billions of tax dollars have been spent on subsidizing coastal reconstruction in the aftermath of storms, usually with little consideration of whether it actually makes sense to keep rebuilding in disaster-prone areas. If history is any guide, a large fraction of the federal money allotted to New York, New Jersey and other states recovering from Hurricane Sandy -- an amount that could exceed $30 billion -- will be used the same way.
Tax money will go toward putting things back as they were, essentially duplicating the vulnerability that existed before the hurricane.
"We're Americans, damn it," said Robert S. Young, a North Carolina geologist who has studied the way communities like Dauphin Island respond to storms. "Retreat is a dirty word."
This island community of roughly 1,300 year-round residents has become a symbol of that reflexive policy.
Like many other beachfront towns, Dauphin Island has benefited from the Stafford Act, a federal law that taps the United States Treasury for 75 percent or more of the cost of fixing storm-damaged infrastructure, like roads and utilities.
At least $80 million, adjusted for inflation, has gone into patching up this one island since 1979 -- more than $60,000 for every permanent resident. That does not include payments of $72 million to homeowners from the highly subsidized federal flood insurance program.
Lately, scientists, budget-conscious lawmakers and advocacy groups across the political spectrum have argued that these subsidies waste money, put lives at risk and make no sense in an era of changing climate and rising seas.
Some of them contend that reconstruction money should be tightly coupled with requirements that coastal communities begin reducing their vulnerability in the short run and that towns along shorelines facing the largest risks make plans for withdrawal over the long term.
"The best thing that could possibly come out of Sandy is if the political establishment was willing to say, 'Let's have a conversation about how we do this differently the next time,' " said Dr. Young, a coastal geologist who directs the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University. "We need to identify those areas -- in advance -- that it no longer makes sense to rebuild."
A coalition in Washington called SmarterSafer.org, made up of environmentalists, libertarians and budget watchdogs, contends that the subsidies have essentially become a destructive, unaffordable entitlement.
"We simply can't go on subsidizing enormous numbers of people to live in areas that are prone to huge natural disasters," said Eli Lehrer, the president of the conservative R Street Institute, part of the coalition.
This argument might be gaining some traction. Earlier this year, Congress passed changes to the federal flood insurance program that are supposed to raise historically low premiums and reduce homeowner incentives for rebuilding in the most hazardous areas.
Less widely known about than flood insurance are the subsidies from the Stafford Act, the federal law governing the response to emergencies like hurricanes, wildfires and tornadoes. It kicks in when the president declares a federal disaster that exceeds the response capacity of state and local governments.
Experts say the law is at least as important as the flood program in motivating reconstruction after storms. In the same way flood insurance shields families from the financial consequences of rebuilding in risky areas, the Stafford Act shields local and state governments from the full implications of their decisions on land use.
Under the law, the federal government committed more than $80 billion to disaster recovery from 2004 to 2011, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office. While billions of dollars went to relieve immediate suffering, including cash payments to families left homeless by storms, nearly half of the money was spent helping state and local governments clean and restore damaged areas and rebuild infrastructure.
At times, local governments have tried to use the money to reduce their vulnerability to future disasters, but they complain that they often run into bureaucratic roadblocks with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
For instance, after flooding from Hurricane Irene washed out many culverts in Vermont last year, many towns built bigger culverts to handle future floods. But they are still fighting with the agency over reimbursement.
W. Craig Fugate, the agency's administrator, acknowledged in an interview that "as a nation, we have not yet figured out" how to use federal incentives to improve resiliency and discourage excessive risks.
If private property owners want to assume the risks, "that's one thing," he said. "But if we find that we as taxpayers are assuming that risk without benefit, then we need to rethink that."
Dauphin Island is a case study in the way the federal subsidies have enabled repetitive risk taking. Orrin H. Pilkey, an emeritus professor at Duke University who is renowned for his research in costal zones, described the situation here as a "scandal."
The island, four miles off the Alabama coast, was for centuries the site of a small fishing and farming village reachable only by boat. But in the 1950s, the Chamber of Commerce in nearby Mobile decided to link it to the mainland by bridge and sell lots for vacation homes.
Then Hurricane Frederic struck in 1979, ravaging the island and destroying the bridge.
President Jimmy Carter flew over to inspect the damage. Rex Rainer, the Alabama highway director at the time, recalled several years later that the president "told us to build everything back just like it was and send him the bill."
The era of taxpayer largess toward Dauphin Island had begun. With $33 million of federal money, local leaders built a fancier, higher bridge that encouraged more development in the 1980s. Much of that construction occurred on the island's western end, a long, narrow sand bar sitting only a few feet above the Gulf of Mexico.
"You can always look back and say, 'Maybe we shouldn't have done that,' " said Mayor Jeff Collier, who noted that many of the decisions were made before he took office over a decade ago. "But we can't turn the clock back."
In the 1990s, big storms started hitting the island roughly every three years. Two back-to-back hurricanes, Ivan in 2004 and Katrina in 2005, destroyed more than 300 homes. Most have not been rebuilt, but scores have been. Some beachfront building lots are now inundated by the Gulf of Mexico.
The bulk of the town's reconstruction money has been spent on the western end. That means many of the prime beneficiaries have not been permanent residents, but rather vacation homeowners from places like New Orleans and Atlanta.
Since 1988, federal figures show, Dauphin Island property owners have paid only $9.3 million in premiums to the national flood insurance program, but they have received $72.2 million in payments for their damaged homes. Figures from a federal contractor show that the average island resident pays less than $700 a year for flood insurance, though a few do pay as much as $3,000.
On Dauphin Island and in many other beachfront communities, the federal subsidies have helped people replace small beach shacks with larger, more valuable homes. That is a main reason the nation's costs of storm recovery are roughly doubling every decade, even after adjusting for inflation.
Dauphin Island has tried to limit its risk, imposing stricter building codes that go beyond federal requirements. New houses now must be built high on pilings to survive storm surges.
Local residents argue that federal help is warranted because their erosion problems have been worsened by government dredging in the nearby Mobile Ship Channel, which some scientists agree has helped starve the Dauphin Island beaches of sand. And residents say that simply letting the island's western end wash away would leave the mainland and its marshes, rich with seafood, more exposed to storms.
People here have formed strong emotional attachments to their island. "There's a lot of wildlife and a lot of bird life, and it's just a great place to relax," said Jay Minus, a lawyer in Mobile who owns two homes on the western end. "You can sit on the porch and watch the dolphins swim past your house."
Just this summer, Hurricane Isaac dealt the island a moderate blow, leaving most homes unscathed but managing to do $3 million worth of damage to public infrastructure. On a recent day, bulldozers crawled around the island, scooping up tons of sand to replenish the beach. As in the past, the town will most likely pay only 15 percent of the repair costs.
Coastal geologists describe western Dauphin Island as a textbook example of a place that should never have been developed. Scientists say that climate change will most likely speed up the rise of sea levels in the coming decades and that many more coastal communities will face repetitive risks.
With little pressure coming from Washington or state governments, only a handful of communities have started thinking seriously about a new approach.
"We need a plan," Dr. Young said.
Given the political realities, however, it is by no means clear how to move forward. In some flood plains, public money has been used to buy out vulnerable property owners. Entire towns were moved out of the Mississippi River flood plain in the 1990s, for instance, saving money over the long haul.
Several oceanfront communities have resisted such proposals, though one, in Texas, consented to a buyout plan after being badly damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008. The federal government, despite its willingness to spend tens of billions of dollars repairing communities after storms, has not put up the kind of buyout money that might convince more owners to walk away.
Because buyout proposals often take years to put together, several experts suggested that they be drawn up in advance with maps of properties targeted for acquisition. Then, if those homes are damaged, state or local leaders could move swiftly after a storm, offering the owners voluntary buyouts before they make up their minds to rebuild.
Mr. Collier, the mayor, has long heard the argument that a rising sea will ultimately force a retreat from Dauphin Island and similar places.
"I'm not going to say that's wrong," he said. "But somebody needs to tell me, how are we going to get there?"

Full text:   House Republicans like to talk about the need to find common ground with President Obama to make progress on important national issues, especially after the election. Yet within days, they were setting an agenda to eliminate an important element of his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, recently proposed that House Republicans set their sights on repealing the part of the law that creates an independent board that is supposed to help limit growth in Medicare spending. Increases in Medicare spending have already slowed substantially, but the board will be needed to make sure that they stay low after 2014, when most of the law takes effect.
The board, known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board, has been the subject of false attacks over the past few years by Republicans who claim that it will ration care, disrupt doctor-patient relationships, and tell patients what treatments they can receive. That is an outlandish way to describe a board that is prohibited by law from making any recommendations to ration care, raise premiums, increase cost-sharing, restrict benefits or limit eligibility.
The board will consist of 12 experts, including doctors, patient advocates, employers and financial analysts, who will be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and three nonvoting government officials. Its sole duty is to monitor and, if necessary, reduce Medicare spending, which needs to be reined in to control deficits.
If the projected growth rate in per capita Medicare spending exceeds specified targets pegged initially to an average of general and medical inflation and later to gross domestic product, the board must recommend changes (most likely cuts in payments to health care providers) to bring the growth rate back in line. Congress can override the board's recommendations, but it must still find equivalent savings.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that repealing the board might drive up federal spending on Medicare by $3.1 billion over a decade. Without pressure from such a board, Congress is apt to be weak in resisting demands by powerful health care groups and industries for higher Medicare reimbursements.
Mr. Cantor apparently believes that throwing around the false charge that the board will harm patient care will persuade enough members of the Democrat-led Senate to follow the House, which has voted twice to repeal the board. In a recent letter to House Republicans, Mr. Cantor said that "one of our most successful critiques" of the president's health care reforms was that "Obamacare put the government between doctors and patients."
Mr. Cantor has suggested that seven Democratic senators who will be up for re-election in 2014 in states that the Romney-Ryan ticket just carried might yield to Republican pressure. They would be foolish to fall for the scare tactics and force Mr. Obama to have to veto a repeal bill that would eliminate a crucial cost-saving measure.

Full text:   Sochi, a Black Sea resort city in the southwest corner of Russia, is preparing for the Olympics in February 2014, when it will become the first subtropical city to host the Winter Games. Dmitry Chernyshenko has returned to his hometown as the president and chief executive of the Sochi 2014 organizing committee.
Citrus and palm trees will provide a backdrop to the indoor ice sports arenas for figure skating and hockey. Outdoor competitions like skiing and luge will be held about 30 miles north, high in the Caucasus Mountains.
Seemingly the entire region is under construction, with 60,000 laborers and 3,000 heavy trucks -- many running 24 hours a day -- working to convert a little-known area next to the Georgia border into a stage befitting the Olympics. Chernyshenko, 44, is the face of it all. JASON STALLMAN
Q. Will everything be done in time?
A. All Olympics-related infrastructure should be done two seasons prior to the Games. So we are already beginning test events at the venues. Which, by the way, is killing rumors that we're trying to hide our venues. We're telling everyone, please, come see our venues.
The environment now looks like a big construction site. Major construction works at the Olympic sites will be ceased after July 2013. However, we will continue the process of fine-tuning, like landscaping. At the same time, all construction works in the city should be put on halt till after the Games. I mean, for instance, the construction of hotels or other facilities not related to the Games.
Q. What has been the most difficult aspect of planning the Olympics?
A. The project is delivered by people. The challenge is personnel. Owing to the Games, the unemployment in the region is practically nonexistent. On the other side, it means we need to search other labor markets for personnel. We have to attract specialists from all around the country, and volunteers. I'm talking about Games makers, those who will organize the Games. We're using two companies, both in the United States, to help -- Adecco and Kelly -- to help find personnel. They've built subsidiary offices all over the country. We have to find, select, hire, train and accommodate. So it's very difficult.
Q. What will the total cost be for the Games?
A. It is important to understand that there are two separate, clearly outlined budgets to consider. As C.E.O. of Sochi 2014 organizing committee, I am responsible for the budget for the staging of the Sochi 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The budget for staging the Games amounts to $1.8 billion and is financed from the Sochi 2014 organizing committee marketing program and guaranteed state funding. Taking into consideration the exchange rate and inflation, it corresponds approximately to the budgets of previous Games.
The projected budget for the construction of Olympic facilities and related infrastructure is 185 billion rubles ($5.9 billion), approximately half of which is coming from private investors. However, you should keep in mind these budgets do not include the programs on renovation of the region that are not directly linked to the Games.
Q. There was huge demand for tickets to all events at the London Games. What are your expectations for ticket sales?
A. I have no doubt that the Games in Sochi will be sold out.
Q. If you had to pick one event to attend at the Sochi Games, what would it be?
A. Ice hockey final. The U.S. team is in it. Russia wins, 5-3.
Q. How about up on the mountain?
A. On the mountain, I would come to biathlon. That's the most popular sport in our country.

Abstract: The intentional: Since Ronald Reagan's administration, with mixed results, presidents and Congresses have occasionally mandated a self-imposed future crisis to force themselves to agree on unpopular tax and spending actions. The measures from the 2011 deal are set to take effect at the same time as the changes to jobless benefits, the alternative minimum tax adjustment and the Medicare "doc fix," and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts -- a confluence that the two parties did not fully expect back in August 2011.

Full text:   Many Americans must be wondering: What is all this about a "fiscal cliff"? And why did it receive so little attention during the presidential campaign?
Well, it's complicated -- the so-called cliff, that is. And most solutions are politically painful. In a rare show of bipartisanship, or mutual protection, both parties ducked the debate until after the election. What follows is an attempt to demystify the issue, which President Obama and the lame-duck Congress now are struggling over, and which may occupy them right through the holidays.
Q. What is the fiscal cliff?
A. The term refers to more than $500 billion in tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to take effect after Jan. 1 -- for fiscal year 2013 alone -- unless Mr. Obama and Republicans reach an alternative deficit-reduction deal. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is not known for catchy phrases, coined the metaphor "fiscal cliff" last winter to warn of the dangerous yet avoidable drop-off ahead in the nation's fiscal path. It stuck.
Q. If we go over this so-called cliff, what happens?
A. Taxes would rise for nearly every taxpayer and many businesses. Financing for most federal programs, military and domestic, would be cut. Many economists say that while annual budget deficits are too high, these new taxes and spending cuts would be too much deficit reduction, too suddenly, for a weak economy. More than $500 billion equals roughly 3 percent to 4 percent of gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office has said the result would be a short recession, though some analysts say the measures could be managed so they do less damage. "Slope," they argue, is a better metaphor than cliff.
Q. Exactly what tax increases are in store?
A. When a tax cut expires, the practical effect is a tax increase. And a slew of tax cuts -- $400 billion for 2013 -- expire on Dec. 31: All of the Bush-era rate reductions; smaller tax cuts that periodically expire for businesses and individuals; and the 2-percentage-point cut in payroll taxes that Mr. Obama pushed in 2010, which increased an average worker's take-home pay by about $1,000 a year.
Also, 28 million taxpayers -- about one in five, all middle- to upper-income -- would have to pay the alternative minimum tax in 2012, raising their taxes more. That is because Congress has failed to pass an inflation adjustment, as it usually does, to restrict the number of taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum largely to the affluent.
Q. What spending would be cut?
A. An emergency unemployment-compensation program is expiring, which would save $26 billion but end payments to millions of Americans who remain jobless and have exhausted state benefits. Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced 27 percent, or $11 billion, because this year Congress has not passed the usual so-called "doc fix" to block the cuts, which otherwise are required by a 1990s cost-control law.
The biggest cut would be $65 billion, enacted across the board for most federal programs over the last nine months of fiscal year 2013, from January through September. This cut, known as the sequester, was mandated by an August 2011 budget deal between Mr. Obama and Congress that ended their standoff over raising the nation's debt limit. In that deal, they agreed to reduce spending by $1 trillion over 10 years and to identify an additional $1.2 trillion in savings by January 2013. If they fail to agree on the second installment -- as is the case so far -- the automatic cuts will kick in.
Q. Why did the parties create such a fiscal and economic threat?
A. It was part intentional, part coincidental.
The intentional: Since Ronald Reagan's administration, with mixed results, presidents and Congresses have occasionally mandated a self-imposed future crisis to force themselves to agree on unpopular tax and spending actions. In that spirit, the idea behind the August 2011 deal was that Republicans would so greatly fear the military cuts, and Democrats the domestic spending cuts, that they would negotiate a deficit-reduction alternative by the Jan. 1 deadline.
The coincidental: The measures from the 2011 deal are set to take effect at the same time as the changes to jobless benefits, the alternative minimum tax adjustment and the Medicare "doc fix," and the expiration of the Bush tax cuts -- a confluence that the two parties did not fully expect back in August 2011. The nation will also reach its debt ceiling in January, creating additional uncertainty. Accounting maneuvers by the Treasury Department could push that deadline to March, but Mr. Obama wants a debt-limit increase as part of any deal, adding another item to the agenda.
Q. Can't Democrats and Republicans agree on anything here?
A. They actually agree on a lot. Neither side favors the sequester, an expanded alternative minimum tax or Medicare cuts for doctors; the issue in preventing those outcomes is where to find offsetting savings to avoid adding to annual deficits. And both parties want to extend all of the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of taxpayers -- on income below $250,000 for couples and on income below $200,000 for individuals.
Their main disagreement is a familiar one: the Bush rates on income above that, for the top 2 percent of taxpayers. Mr. Obama campaigned against the rates in 2008 and in 2012. In December 2010, when the Bush tax cuts originally were to expire, Mr. Obama reluctantly agreed to extend all of them for two years in exchange for Republicans' support for the temporary payroll tax cut and extended jobless aid. This time, he swears, is different.
Q. If the president extended all the Bush rates once, why wouldn't he do so again for the right concessions?
A. The economy was weaker in 2010, and so was Mr. Obama. Republicans had just triumphed in the midterm elections, taking control of the House. Now Mr. Obama is fresh off re-election, and Congressional Democrats have gained seats. He vows that he will not allow the top tax rate to stay at 35 percent; a return to 39.6 percent would raise about $1 trillion over 10 years. Chastened Republicans have suggested they would support higher revenues, but only from limiting tax deductions for high-income taxpayers, not from higher rates. Mr. Obama has not ruled out a compromise that would limit deductions as well as setting the top rate above 35 percent but below 39.6 percent.
Q. What now? Might they really reach an impasse?
A. No one knows. Despite market jitters about that outcome, Democrats suggest that they are willing to let Jan. 1 come and go without resolution unless Republicans relent on the top rate. That could simply be bravado, to make Republicans blink. A Washington Post-Pew Research Center poll this week found that a majority of Americans would blame Republicans for failure.
Q. Is there a best-case outcome here?
A. Many budget experts and economists are hoping for a two-part deal. The first part would extend many of the tax cuts and repeal the automatic spending cuts to avert the changes scheduled after Jan. 1. But it would be contingent on the second part: a framework for reducing projected long-term deficits by overhauling both the tax code -- to raise revenues -- and entitlement programs -- chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, whose rising costs in an aging population are unsustainable. Those overhauls would preoccupy Mr. Obama and Congress through 2013 and perhaps 2014.
Such an agreement would set specific targets for new tax revenue and spending cuts to reduce deficits by about $4 trillion over a decade, giving Congress and the president more time to work out the details. If they failed to do so, presumably other automatic changes might be in store as an enforcement action -- setting up yet another looming deadline.

Full text:   JOPLIN, Mo.
IF you didn't live through Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath, it's hard to fathom the extent of the destruction. Photos and videos go only so far. You simply cannot understand it if you haven't been through it.
Unfortunately, plenty of Americans have been through it, in one form or another. And their empathy about the length of the recovery runs deep. "I hope they don't get discouraged, because it does take a long time," said Raye Frerer of Joplin, Mo., where a tornado left a 14-mile scar last year. "Here we are, 18 months later, and we're still not back in our home."
Even today, you can stand on what passes for a hill in Joplin's midsection, at 23rd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, look east and look west and see empty space. The trees are still gone. Apartment complexes are gone. The hospital is gone. The high school is gone.
That's what happens when an EF-5 tornado touches down, eviscerating everything in its path, as it did here on Sunday, May 22, 2011. Winds reaching 250 miles per hour tore homes and other buildings from their foundations and sent debris flying for miles, and 161 people died.
As Joplin's residents make their way through the stages of grief, they are eager to talk about it. They want to share how they survived and how they're preparing for the next one, because they now understand that this kind of disaster can happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time. We all know the risks, and we promptly learn to ignore them. After all, you can't function very well if you live in daily fear of disaster.
But you can prepare yourself for the possibility, however remote, that something like what happened to the people of Joplin -- or New Orleans, or Northridge, Calif., or New York City and the surrounding areas last month -- will happen to you. And one of the easiest steps you can take is to disaster-proof your finances.
The tornado here caused nearly $3 billion in damage. Some 61,000 insurance claims were filed, with a total payout of more than $2 billion. Of that, 31 percent went to homeowners and 5 percent to people who lost their cars and trucks.
But many people did not get as much relief as they had expected. The long road back to financial wellness has been more difficult than it perhaps had to be. And those lessons have stayed with them.
The Rising Storm
Ms. Frerer, 58, was at her mother's home south of Joplin that Sunday afternoon. They were celebrating Mother's Day a week late, and her mother, who is close to 80, looked out the window from a small breakfast nook and said, "That's the blackest cloud I've ever seen!" Ms. Frerer turned to her husband, Fred, and told him she didn't want to get her hair wet, so maybe it was time to head home.
Mr. Frerer, 60, is retired, and Ms. Frerer is a teacher. When they got to their house in Joplin, Mr. Frerer stood in the road to check the sky. When he came back in, he grabbed a twin mattress from one of the beds, and the two of them settled onto the floor of their small bathroom with the mattress on their heads.
"My chest started getting tight and my ears, all of a sudden they started popping," Ms. Frerer said. "They must have popped hundreds of times. And I thought, 'Lord, what on earth am I going to do?' I thought, 'God, I'm prepared to meet you.' "
She had been through tornadoes before, and they usually sounded like freight trains. "This one sounded like World War III," she said. "You could feel it, almost like a cosmic tug of war between good and evil."
The house shook, objects pummeled the walls outside the bathroom, and then, as suddenly as it had arrived, the storm ended.
They stood up from under the mattress and opened the bathroom door. Ms. Frerer could see that the nearby middle school had been destroyed, and she wondered whether there would be school tomorrow. Then she realized she shouldn't be able to see outside.
"I stepped into the hall, and the only part of that house still standing was the bathroom that we were in," she said.
Money issues take an obvious back seat to the imminent possibility of death at moments like this. But they surface fairly soon after.
The Frerers were more prepared than many people are, and for that they credit Financial Peace University, the biblically tinged educational enterprise of Dave Ramsey, a nationally syndicated talk-radio financial adviser. One of the so-called baby steps Mr. Ramsey recommends is to set aside $1,000 where it is easily accessible. The Frerers had some of that amount stashed in a small safe in their bedroom closet. The closet wasn't there after the tornado, but the safe was.
They kept another portion of the money in an envelope that ended up embedded in a vent. They remembered the cash a couple of days after the storm and were able to retrieve it.
Disaster preparedness experts say cash is an important element of any emergency planning, because you don't know if banks will still be standing or if A.T.M.'s will be operational. But a common question is how much you should have on hand. Ted Beck, president of the National Endowment for Financial Education, suggests the same amount as emergency officials recommend for food and water: three days' worth.
The Frerers also had homeowners' insurance. Ms. Frerer contacted their insurance company, State Farm, that first night as they took shelter nearby at her brother's house. She got through despite spotty cellphone coverage but had to leave a message when no one picked up. (With so many cell towers down, calls were hard to make. Text messages, she learned, were more likely to go through because they are shorter bursts of data.)
She said one lesson she and her husband learned was that people should try to build a close relationship with an insurance agent, so the agent will try to contact them if a disaster happens. Another couple in their neighborhood had such a relationship, and six days after the storm, that couple had keys to a fully stocked temporary apartment.
The Frerers spent the first few days staying with friends and family, trying to figure out what kind of financial assistance they would get from insurance and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. By the time they started looking for rental apartments or hotel rooms, there weren't any available. Ms. Frerer said another lesson was to go ahead and book something immediately after a disaster, assuming you can afford to front the money before seeking reimbursement from your insurance company.
When the insurance adjuster arrived two days later, she gave the Frerers a check for about $1,000. Several weeks later, another adjuster told them they were about $30,000 short of what they needed to rebuild their home to what it had been. That was in large part because the cost of supplies and materials skyrocketed in the Joplin area after the storm. The couple looked into buying an existing house, but prices for those also went up because of high demand and diminished supply -- the tornado had destroyed 7,000 homes.
"My house was insured for more than the house down the street sold for six to nine months before," Ms. Frerer said, "so I thought, 'Hey, we're good to go.' Well, not necessarily." She said she had begun checking her insurance coverage yearly and making sure she understood every part of her policy. Mr. Beck, the National Endowment for Financial Education president, suggests doing this at the same time you do the annual check of smoke detectors in your home, so it becomes a habit.
One bit of bureaucracy the Frerers came up against was the insurance company's demand for a detailed list of the contents of their destroyed home, including what they paid for each item, its current value and its replacement value. "Like, I have 16 T-shirts or I have 22 pairs of whatever," Ms. Frerer said. "What kind of toiletries, makeup -- I kid you not. The detail they wanted was overwhelming."
She had a receipt box for major purchases, but not for smaller items. And that box? "It's probably blown across to Illinois by now," she said.
Mr. Beck said that without receipts, the best way to prove what you owned was with photos and videos. Every year or two, walk around your house and take a detailed inventory of what you own. Put the videos or photos on a DVD or thumb drive and keep it in a safe deposit box or somewhere else outside your home, or store it online. You can also give copies to family members who do not live in your area.
The Frerers are now living in a small rental while they build a new, large house less than a mile from the one that blew apart. The school district bought their old land for rebuilding. Because of the insurance shortfall, they are dipping into their savings and retirement funds. They say their financial recovery was helped by the fact that they had paid off their mortgage and had no debt. But Ms. Frerer's voice still catches when she thinks about how much worse it could have been.
"It makes us thankful for things that aren't financial," she said. "I'm not going to dwell or think about what I've lost. We come from pioneer stock, so that's the way we want to live. We're just going to pull up our bootstraps and thank God for what he provides and get on with living."
Starting All Over
Michael and Tabitha Davison were apart on the night of the tornado. He was at a home south of the tornado's path with their 15-year-old son and a youth group from the church where he works as a custodian. She teaches at a private religious school and was with their daughter, Emma, at the family's home, directly in the tornado's path, trying to fix a plumbing problem: a shower head that had leaked for the entire decade since they bought the house, just before Sept. 11, 2001.
"I mention that as an important detail," Ms. Davison, 39, said. "We moved into the house with a tragedy, and we left the house with a tragedy."
Joplin's warning sirens first sounded around 5:10 p.m. Ms. Davison said she didn't hear them. Mr. Davison, 42, texted her, "Don't worry, we're in the basement," which alerted her to the coming storm. About 10 minutes later the sirens sounded again. She looked out the window and didn't see anything, and the radar on local television news showed what seemed like a small storm cell. But as a resident of Tornado Alley, imprudence was not her style.
She and Emma, 12, moved to the one room in the house -- the laundry -- with an exterior wall and an interior wall between them and the direction the storm was coming from. They dragged in a large cedar chest, and Emma climbed in with a few stuffed animals and her iPod. Ms. Davison sat down next to the chest, placed her hand inside to keep contact with her daughter and hoped for the best. And then, the tornado was upon them.
"Trains are nothing compared to this sound," she said. "You hear this ferocious thing just hitting your house, and you start to feel the walls moving. We were praying the Lord's Prayer. It sounds melodramatic now, because we were not injured in any way, but at that time I faced my death, and possibly the death of my child."
Emma started crying as rain began to fall on them -- on the first floor of a three-story house.
They emerged to find a living room that opened to the sky, and a second-story staircase to nowhere. A van outside the house was decimated. In one bit of good news, they found all three of their cats unharmed.
Ms. Davison's mother had always told her to get replacement cost insurance, as opposed to what is known as an actual cash value payment. With a cash value policy, the insurance payment is for what your home and its contents were worth before they were destroyed. Replacement cost insurance covers what it would cost to buy all of your belongings new, whenever you need to replace them. Replacement cost coverage is usually 10 to 20 percent more expensive than cash value coverage, but the Davisons chose that option through their insurance carrier, Horace Mann.
Their policy included an inflation guard that automatically adjusted to cover increases in rebuilding costs. That saved them from the gap experienced by the Frerers when construction materials became so expensive after the storm. The policy also included $10,000 worth of debris removal and demolition costs, as well as money to pay for a rental property, which they did not use because so many friends and family members opened their homes.
Because the Davisons' insurance was so comprehensive, they moved quickly to buy another home. They didn't want to deal with all the decisions involved in building a house from scratch, and they didn't want to stay in their old neighborhood, where all the trees were suddenly gone. Within six weeks, they had a check in hand large enough to pay off their mortgage and to cover the full cost of the new home, which they got at a discount because they were able to pay cash.
They also had some money to restock the new home, including with a few major appliances. Ms. Davison said people tended to forget about all the little things they own. "Think about replacing all your spices at $3 or $4 or $5 a bottle," she said. "When you have to start a whole house, you buy everything from scratch all at once."
The Davisons were also lucky that both of them were able to keep working. The church where Mr. Davison works sustained damage, but not enough to keep him off the job, and Ms. Davison's school was not in the tornado's path. They said the insurance payout involved a significant amount of paperwork, particularly when it came to buying the house, but it still took them only two months to get into their new home. For that, they praised their insurance company.
Ms. Davison said that one important element of preparation was knowing how to get access to medications after a disaster. "If you're going to put together a kit, one thing that would be really good to have is just the names of your prescriptions and how many milligrams you're taking," she said.
This was a common problem faced by Joplin residents. Stephanie Brady, vice chairwoman of Joplin's long-term recovery committee, noted that many pharmacies, including the local Walmart, were damaged or destroyed, as was a hospital and several other large medical buildings. "That was one of the big expenses that people had," she said. "They've lost their prescriptions and they couldn't get a new one, an actual script, let alone have the money to purchase it again."
Ms. Davison said she wished she and her husband had thought to put shoes on as the tornado approached, and that would be a priority next time. They also now have a fire-safe box containing important household documents, after losing their college diplomas and marriage license in the storm. But even if they had done all of this before May 22, 2011, they said no plan would have been sufficient for what happened.
New, and Stronger, Shelter
Carrie Cook, 39, works in the advertising department of the local cable television company. She was supposed to be cleaning her apartment that Sunday evening. An inspection was scheduled the next day, an annual walk-through that occurs in rental housing subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as hers is. Instead, she had driven to her mother's house for dinner with her 9-year-old son, Zachary. As they arrived, the sirens sounded. She asked her mother if they should leave the area, but dinner was in the oven, so they decided to stay. Minutes later, Ms. Cook's ex-husband drove up with their other son, 7-year-old Aidan.
"He said, 'Everybody get in the car!' And he told my mom, 'You're coming, too,' " Ms. Cook said. "We got in his truck and drove to my dad's house, and as we were going into his storm shelter the fence and everything was falling down, so we were in the middle of it. It was right on us real fast."
After the tornado passed, they drove back to her mother's house. A trip that usually took 10 minutes took more than 30 because of downed power lines and other debris on the roads. Her mother's house was still standing, while others around it had been ripped from their foundations, but it was not habitable. Ms. Cook's car, still sitting in the driveway where she had left it, was destroyed. "It looked like a bomb had blown off in it," she said. "The windows were all gone, shot out."
She wasn't going to leave her mother there that night, so she suggested they all stay at the apartment complex. Instead, her father and ex-husband insisted on going alone to check on it. They made a videotape of that journey, and in viewing it again recently, Ms. Cook choked up. The top floor of the two-story complex was sheared away. Their first-floor apartment was uninhabitable. "They had brand-new beds that my dad and their dad had just built for them," she said of her sons. "They had those for one week. All you could see underneath was drawers of their pajamas."
Added Aidan: "There was a Dumpster in our living room."
Ms. Cook said the calculation of what this could do to their finances started that night. "When I saw the picture of my apartment and I had already seen my car, all that processing started," she said. "I couldn't sleep. I immediately went into panic mode: 'Where are we going to live?' "
For the first few nights they stayed in hotels, courtesy of her mother's employer, and after that in a succession of apartments.
The saving grace for Ms. Cook was that she had renter's insurance. A recent survey by the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, showed that less than a third of renters in the United States purchased renter's insurance, despite owning an average of $30,000 worth of household goods. The Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, another industry group, said the cost of insuring that amount of property was about $12 a month, which would also cover $100,000 worth of liability if someone were injured on the premises.
"I got my first check within five days," Ms. Cook said. And what led her to buy that insurance? "I didn't get it because I was afraid of a tornado," she said. "I got it because I couldn't control what anybody else did" in the apartment building.
Ms. Cook did not work for three weeks after the storm because her sons' day care had no electricity, and she was sorting through what little was left of the apartment.
She said she still felt that she had been underinsured -- and the insurance she did have meant she did not qualify for FEMA assistance, despite repeated appeals for aid.
FEMA's Individuals and Households Program provides grants of up to $31,500 for temporary housing and repairs, as well as replacement of some essential household items. But money paid out in the immediate aftermath of a disaster must be repaid once an insurance settlement is received, and any money FEMA provides as a supplement to insurance is only for repairs to an existing home, not for the cost of rebuilding one.
Like Ms. Frerer, Ms. Cook found it difficult to complete the required inventory statement. "I had to remember what else I'd lost, such as my grandmother's ring that I'd gotten as a sweet 16," she said. "It was difficult to remember, it was depressing and it was time-consuming."
She had also opted for full coverage on her car, instead of just liability, even though it was paid off. That meant another insurance check that covered the cost of an equivalent used car.
Ms. Brady of Joplin's long-term recovery committee said the lack of adequate vehicle coverage was a significant issue for a lot of lower-income families that carried only liability insurance. She said that 18,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed and that public transportation wasn't available for two weeks after the storm. "So a lot of people lost their jobs because they couldn't get to it because they didn't have that transportation, and it just compounded the situation," she said.
Like the Frerers, Ms. Cook is a follower of Dave Ramsey, the talk-radio financial adviser, and she did have some cash hidden in a piece of furniture in her apartment. That was one piece that was still intact after the storm came through. It wasn't a lot, but at that point every dollar was helpful. She said she was able to get through the first few months in large part because of the kindness of strangers. "People from everywhere donated money," she said. "They'd hand you a Bible and it had $20 in it. They would just come up to you and give you gift cards."
Ms. Cook recently moved into one of 65 homes that Habitat for Humanity is building this year in Joplin. She said getting the house was "a work of God." She filled out an application after the storm, and the organization sent someone to interview her family. They fell into the sweet spot for Habitat -- somewhere between the people who make too little to maintain a house properly and those who make enough to buy one on their own.
"We are able to look at this tragedy as one of the best days of our lives," she said. Habitat even built them a storm shelter, so she and the boys have somewhere to escape to when the next tornado comes.
In their new house, all around, they hear the din of construction on the other houses that are slowly rising from the ruined streetscape. It nearly drowns out the chimes they've placed on their brand-new front porch. But not quite.

Full text:   THE last time the world as we knew it seemed likely to end, Dan Tapiero thought about buying gold.
He didn't tell his wife; they didn't talk about things like that. In fact he didn't tell anyone for a while. He just tried to figure out how he was going to buy physical gold as the financial markets collapsed at the end of 2008.
Mining stocks were not for him, and neither was buying gold on the futures exchange. That was financial gold, meaning it existed on account statements but was not tangible. He wanted the real thing, gold in the form of bullion that he could hold in his palms, smudge with his thumbs.
But Mr. Tapiero, a portfolio manager at several hedge funds over the last two decades, realized quite quickly that it was harder to fulfill his desire than he had thought. When he called up one bank he patronized in his day job, he learned it had a minimum purchase amount of $20 million worth of physical gold. Even at that amount, he could not have access to it; it would have to stay at the bank.
He didn't want to buy that much, but he wanted to buy more than a bag of gold coins, or a bar or two. Most of all, he wanted to know that it would be stored someplace safe where he could get to it even if all of the banks suddenly closed for a while. "There was concern at that time that the system was frozen and you didn't really know whether you were going to be able to have access to your money or to your assets," Mr. Tapiero said. "And I started thinking, O.K., well, I'd like to own something that isn't a number on a flashing screen."
Investing in physical gold has had an image problem of late. After the financial crisis, it was seen by many mainstream advisers as something that crackpots coveted. They would buy it, store in their basements and know that their wealth was secure if the world -- or at least the prevailing financial and political systems -- ended.
This was easy to mock, and many people did. What, after all, would you buy with your gold if the world came to an end?
Then there was the group that saw gold as a speculative bet, as something that would rise in value as fear about the global economy sunk in. That was less of a crackpot idea: the price of gold went from around $700 an ounce when Mr. Tapiero began buying it in the fall of 2008 to more than $1,900 an ounce last summer. It is now trading around $1,700 an ounce.
Mr. Tapiero did not buy his bullion because he thought the world was ending. "And if it did end," he said, "I don't know that gold would be that important -- it might be radioactive."
He also made clear that he does not keep it at his home in Greenwich, Conn. "It might not be safe," he said, "if someone holds you at gunpoint and they say, 'Show me your safe' and you open it up and all your gold is there."
Instead, his gold -- now about 25 percent of his net worth, he said, declining to quantify it further -- is kept in various professionally managed vaults. We met at one in Midtown Manhattan.
The vault was in an unassuming, brick office building with a completely plain, even dingy lobby. The offices of the vaulting company, which asked not to be named as a condition for granting me entry, had rows of nondescript cubicles that gave no sign beyond the company logo of what might be going on there.
As for the vault itself, it looked secure from the outside. But once past the thick door, it felt completely utilitarian, even a bit grim, particularly for what it held for its undisclosed number of clients.
Mr. Tapiero eyed the rows of 100-ounce bars -- each about the size of an iPhone and worth about $170,000 -- and estimated there was $4 billion worth of gold at current prices stacked on metal shelves that looked as if they were built in the 1970s. That amount of gold would fit in the back of any sport utility vehicle.
The vault company did not share the identities of other customers. But suspicion that there was interest in owning this kind of physical gold led Mr. Tapiero and a friend, Steven Feldman, to form a company, Gold Bullion International, in 2009. It allows people to buy bullion but also to have access to it and, if they want, have it delivered to their home or anywhere else. Their customers range from chief executives and entrepreneurs to housewives and grandparents buying for their grandchildren.
Mr. Tapiero described their challenge as, "How do we start a company that can provide physical gold -- have it delivered, but also have it stored outside the banking system -- to the retail customer?"
His theory was that gold had been misunderstood in the United States in a way that it had not been in the rest of the world. He attributed this to the inability of individuals to own gold for some 40 years, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 ordered any American holding more than $100 worth of gold to exchange if for $20.67 an ounce. He did this to prevent individuals from hoarding gold during the Great Depression, and the restriction wasn't lifted until the 1970s.
Another reason Mr. Tapiero thinks people came to misjudge gold was the bull market in stocks from 1982 to 2007, which made owning an asset that just sits there, like gold, unattractive.
Mr. Tapiero said that today gold was a legitimate investment that should be part of any diversified portfolio, because it is a hedge against a global economic slowdown and the inflation that many believe will occur when economies pick up.
But like many investments, the likelihood that gold will continue to increase in value rests on the rise of India and China. There, gold is being increasingly bought as a way to demonstrate success in addition to as an investment.
If you don't need to be able to put your hands on your gold to sleep at night, the World Gold Council sponsors an exchange-traded fund, which trades under the ticker GLD. It allows people to buy and sell shares in a fund that owns gold, much as they would with a mutual fund that owns stocks.
Jason Toussaint, managing director of the World Gold Council, said that like Mr. Tapiero, his group wanted people to see gold as something that they should always own and not something they buy only as a safe haven.
"It implies people run to it and then when the storm has passed they go back to risky assets," he said. "We think the time is right to look for a new paradigm."
More traditional advisers see a place for gold in some portfolios, though they put it in the same group as other alternative assets. They also advise keeping the allocation relatively low, 3 to 5 percent of a total portfolio.
"Most assets like equities or bonds can be valued because they throw off some income over time," said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer and head of investment management and guidance for Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. "We talk about gold not as an investing asset but purely as a hedging asset."
Mr. Tapiero said that the idea of making gold a permanent part of a portfolio was part of a broader argument about the future of the global economy, one epitomized in the professional investing world by two very different managers.
There is Warren Buffett, who made his fortune buying stocks in companies he understands and who does not see much use in owning gold. Then there is Ray Dalio, who runs Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, who has put 10 percent of his firm's money into gold.
Mr. Tapiero says he believes gold will continue to be a store of value, and he dismisses the end-of-the-world crowd -- though, he said, his company is happy to sell them gold and store it for them.
"Gold will do very well, and it will be good to have physical gold if everything happens except the end of the world," Mr. Tapiero said. "If the end of the world is zero, and we get to 10, from 100, it's going to be the thing that performs well."

Abstract: There are record numbers of student borrowers in financial distress, according to federal data. [...]more and more of those with unpaid federal student debt are losing a portion of their Social Security benefits to the government -- nearly 119,000 through September, compared with 60,000 for all of 2007 and 23,996 in 2001, according to the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service.

Full text:   When Michele Fitzgerald and her daughter, Jenni, go out for dinner, Jenni pays. When they get haircuts, Jenni pays. When they buy groceries, Jenni pays.
It has been six years since Ms. Fitzgerald -- broke, unemployed and in default on the $18,000 in loans she took out for Jenni's college education -- became a boomerang mom, moving into her daughter's townhouse apartment in Hingham, Mass.
Jenni pays the rent.
For Jenni, 35, the student loans and the education they bought have worked out: she has a good job in public relations and is paying down the loans in her name. But for her mother, 60, the parental debt has been disastrous.
"It's not easy," Ms. Fitzgerald said. "Jenni feels the guilt and I feel the burden."
There are record numbers of student borrowers in financial distress, according to federal data. But millions of parents who have taken out loans to pay for their children's college education make up a less visible generation in debt. For the most part, these parents did well enough through midlife to take on sizable loans, but some have since fallen on tough times because of the recession, health problems, job loss or lives that took a sudden hard turn.
And unlike the angry students who have recently taken to the streets to protest their indebtedness, most of these parents are too ashamed to draw attention to themselves.
"You don't want your children, much less your neighbors and friends, knowing that even though you're living in a nice house, and you've been able to hold onto your job, your retirement money's gone, you can't pay your debts," said a woman in Connecticut who took out $57,000 in federal loans. Between tough times at work and a divorce, she is now teetering on default.
In the first three months of this year, the number of borrowers of student loans age 60 and older was 2.2 million, a figure that has tripled since 2005. That makes them the fastest-growing age group for college debt. All told, those borrowers owed $43 billion, up from $8 billion seven years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Almost 10 percent of the borrowers over 60 were at least 90 days delinquent on their payments during the first quarter of 2012, compared with 6 percent in 2005. And more and more of those with unpaid federal student debt are losing a portion of their Social Security benefits to the government -- nearly 119,000 through September, compared with 60,000 for all of 2007 and 23,996 in 2001, according to the Treasury Department's Financial Management Service.
The federal government does not track how many of these older borrowers were taking out loans for their own education rather than for that of their children. But financial analysts say that loans for children are the likely source of almost all the debt. Even adjusted for inflation, so-called Parent PLUS loans -- one piece of the pie for parents of all ages -- have more than doubled to $10.4 billion since 2000. Colleges often encourage parents to get Parent PLUS loans, to make it possible for their children to enroll. But many borrow more than they can afford to pay back -- and discover, too late, that the flexibility of income-based repayment is available only to student borrowers.
Many families with good credit turn to private student loans, with parents co-signing for their children. But those private loans also offer little flexibility in repayment.
The consequences of such debt can be dire because borrowers over 60 have less time -- and fewer opportunities -- than younger borrowers to get their financial lives back on track. Some, like Ms. Fitzgerald, are forced to move in with their children. Others face an unexpectedly pinched retirement. Still others have gone into bankruptcy, after using all their assets to try to pay the student debt, which is difficult to discharge under any circumstances.
The anguish over college debt has put a severe strain on many family relationships. Parents and students alike say parental debt can be the uncomfortable, unmentionable elephant in the room. Many parents feel they have not fulfilled a basic obligation, while others quietly resent that their children's education has landed the family in such difficult territory.
Soon after borrowing the money for Jenni's education, Ms. Fitzgerald divorced and lost her corporate job. She worked part-time jobs and subsisted on food stamps and public assistance.
"I don't really feel guilt, but I do know that this is all because of a loan taken out on my behalf," said Jenni, who has a different last name and agreed to be interviewed only if it would not be disclosed. "I asked my mother to move in with me, because I couldn't stand it that she was living in a place with no heat and a basement that kept flooding."
The unusual arrangements, and strained family dynamics, can be awkward. Like Jenni, many with student debt problems agreed to be interviewed only on the condition that they not be identified because they did not want to expose their financial troubles.
"It makes you feel like a failure as a parent, to be unable to help your children and to have all your hard work end in a pile of debt," said one New Jersey man, who took out a second mortgage of $280,000 to help cover his children's college costs. "I sent my older kids to private colleges, and I was happy to do it because it's how you help them get started off. But I can't do it for the youngest, and I haven't even been able to start the conversation with him."
Ms. Fitzgerald said she had little hope of a comfortable old age. She has no health insurance. She knows that the odds of finding a good job in her 60s, with no college degree, are slim -- and she knows that the government will take part of her Social Security, in payment of her debt, which she said had now ballooned to about $40,000 because of penalties for nonpayment. At one point, she said, the Internal Revenue Service seized a $2.43 tax refund.
Jenni has volunteered to take on her mother's debt, but Ms. Fitzgerald has refused, saying it is her legal and moral obligation, and anyway, Jenni has her own loans to pay off -- about $220 a month -- and not much discretionary income. The very suggestion that Jenni might take on her debt annoys her.
"Don't you think she is doing enough for me now by supporting me a hundred percent, financially, by my living with her and her extending her resources?" Ms. Fitzgerald asked. "The whole idea was for her to get a college education so she can succeed in life; it is hard enough just to do that without being burdened with her mother's welfare, like I was her child."
Jenni occasionally jumped in with explanations or clarifications, as she and her mother sat in the living room discussing their situation. When Ms. Fitzgerald talked of being depressed last year, so overwhelmed by the cartons of documents and dunning letters that she threw them all out, Jenni said gently, in an almost maternal tone, "But you're doing much better now."
Many young people live with deep guilt that their education has pushed their parents into debt, and perhaps ruined their credit rating. Even those who do not know exactly how much money their parents have, or how much they owe, worry about how their debt will affect their parents' lives.
One 27-year-old man from East Texas, who earned a bachelor's degree in California, is now nearing graduation with another bachelor's degree, in Russian literature, from Columbia University. He said he did not know how much debt he and his mother had accumulated in the course of his educational wanderings, sounding almost paralyzed by the prospect of talking to her about it.
"I should know how much I owe, and it's sad that I don't," he said. "I feel like I'm standing on the train track and I can hear the rumble of the train coming, and I don't know how hard the train will slam into me."
In one extreme case, student debt, and the constant creditor calls, were mentioned in a suicide note by the stepfather of a young law school graduate. The guilt has been crushing for the graduate.
Teresa Tosh, 56, a mother of five who works for the county government in Tulsa, Okla., had co-signed large graduate and law school loans for one of her sons, Jacob, who has a different last name. In total, he owes more than $200,000 on his federal loans, in addition to more than $100,000 on the private student loans his mother co-signed.
But like many recent law graduates, Jacob had trouble finding a job, and when he finally found one, an hour from home, the salary was nowhere near enough to cover loan payments. Creditor calls to both Jacob and to his mother became more and more frequent.
Jacob talked to the collectors when they called, and tried to work out payments as best he could. But shortly after one call ended, he and his mother said, the phone would ring again: another collection agent, in another part of the country. Ms. Tosh's husband, George, a Vietnam veteran who worked from home, concluded that Jacob was lying about trying to work things out, deceiving Ms. Tosh, ruining her credit and leaving her holding the bag.
The household tension grew intense, and in July 2010, Mr. Tosh shot himself, leaving a note saying that he could no longer stand the incessant calls from Sallie Mae, one of the lenders.
"Jake has destroyed us. You can't tell me that sally mae is getting paid when they keep calling all day, every day," he said in a note to his wife. "I can't even answer the phone in my own home no more. I can't live like this no more."
Ms. Tosh said she was "not naïve enough to think the Sallie Mae calls were the only reason" that her husband killed himself. "But they were adding a lot of stress," she said. "They'd never stop calling."
A few months after the suicide, Jacob moved to Dallas and got a document-review job. The pay is not enough to meet his loan payments -- or even full interest -- but his creditors agreed to let him make partial-interest-only payments for two years. While his balance continues to grow, that arrangement protected his mother from payment demands for two years.
"It's made my life so much more stressful and guilt-filled because I know that it affects her," Jacob said. "I barely have enough money to pay the bills, but if I miss by a day, they call her."
Jacob pays about $1,200 a month toward the debt, more than he pays for rent. He and his mother are carefully rebuilding their relationship, after a period of great tension. Ms. Tosh traveled to Dallas for his birthday.
"She's been really good about it," Jacob said. "It's always there, but she doesn't bring it up."

The Demographic Excuse

Abstract: The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer argued that if the Republican Party embraced amnesty and nominated Marco Rubio, it would win the Hispanic vote outright in 2016, solving its demographic problem in one swoop. (After Reagan signed an amnesty bill in 1986, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote fell in the next presidential election.) Latino voters are not, as conservative strategists often claim, "natural" Republican voters -- notwithstanding their (moderate) social conservatism, they tend to lean leftward on economic issues, and to see government more as an ally than a foe.

Full text:   THE Republican Party has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. It just failed to unseat a president presiding over one of the longest stretches of mass unemployment since the Great Depression. In a year when the Senate map offered them numerous opportunities, the Republicans managed to lose two seats instead.
In part, these failures can be attributed to the country's changing demographics. Reliable Republican constituencies -- whites, married couples and churchgoers -- are shrinking as a share of the electorate. Democratic-leaning constituencies -- minorities, recent immigrants, the unmarried and unchurched -- are growing, and voting in larger numbers than in the past.
But Republicans are also losing because today's economic landscape is very different than in the days of Ronald Reagan's landslides. The problems that middle-class Americans faced in the late 1970s are not the problems of today. Health care now takes a bigger bite than income taxes out of many paychecks. Wage stagnation is a bigger threat to blue-collar workers than inflation. Middle-income parents worry more about the cost of college than the crime rate. Americans are more likely to fret about Washington's coziness with big business than about big government alone.
Both shifts, demographic and economic, must be addressed if Republicans are to find a way back to the majority. But the temptation for the party's elites will be to fasten on the demographic explanation, because playing identity politics seems far less painful than overhauling the Republican economic message.
This explains why many high-profile Republicans responded to last Tuesday's defeat by embracing some form of amnesty for illegal immigrants. Fox News's Sean Hannity, a reliable weather vane, publicly converted to the cause of comprehensive immigration reform last week. The Washington Post's Charles Krauthammer argued that if the Republican Party embraced amnesty and nominated Marco Rubio, it would win the Hispanic vote outright in 2016, solving its demographic problem in one swoop. Judging from the noises emanating from John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the party's Congressional leadership agrees.
No doubt a more moderate tone on immigration would help Republicans. But the idea of amnesty as a Latino-winning electoral silver bullet is a fantasy.
First, Hispanics are not single-issue voters: they can be alienated by nativism, but they can't just be won by the promise of green cards and open borders. (After Reagan signed an amnesty bill in 1986, the Republican share of the Hispanic vote fell in the next presidential election.) Latino voters are not, as conservative strategists often claim, "natural" Republican voters -- notwithstanding their (moderate) social conservatism, they tend to lean leftward on economic issues, and to see government more as an ally than a foe. They can be wooed, gradually, if Republicans address their aspirations and anxieties, but they aren't going to be claimed in one legislative pander.
At the same time, a Republican Party that moves too far leftward on immigration risks alienating its white working-class supporters, an easily disillusioned constituency whose support the party cannot take for granted. These voters already suspect that Republican elites don't have their interests at heart: Mitt Romney lost last week because he underperformed among minority voters, but also because a large number of working-class whites apparently stayed home. If the party's only post-2012 adjustment is to embrace amnesty, they aren't likely to turn out in 2016 either.
What the party really needs, much more than a better identity-politics pitch, is an economic message that would appeal across demographic lines -- reaching both downscale white voters turned off by Romney's Bain Capital background and upwardly mobile Latino voters who don't relate to the current G.O.P. fixation on upper-bracket tax cuts.
As the American Enterprise Institute's Henry Olsen writes, it should be possible for Republicans to oppose an overweening and intrusive state while still recognizing that "government can give average people a hand up to achieve the American Dream." It should be possible for the party to reform and streamline government while also addressing middle-class anxieties about wages, health care, education and more.
The good news is that such an agenda already exists, at least in embryonic form. Thanks to four years of intellectual ferment, Republicans seeking policy renewal have a host of thinkers and ideas to draw from: Luigi Zingales and Jim Pethokoukis on crony capitalism, Ramesh Ponnuru and Robert Stein on tax policy, Frederick Hess on education reform, James Capretta on alternatives to Obamacare, and many more.
The bad news is that unlike a pander on immigration, a new economic agenda probably wouldn't be favorably received by the party's big donors, who tend to be quite happy with the Republican Party's current positioning.
But after spending billions of those donors' dollars with nothing to show for it, perhaps Republicans should seek a different path: one in which they raise a little less money but win a few more votes.

Full text:   BEIJING -- The Chinese economy grew faster than expected last month even as inflation slowed, official statistics showed on Friday, as the government continued heavy lending through its state-owned banks to rekindle growth.
The latest data, including industrial production, retail sales, fixed-asset investment and electricity generation, were stronger than most economists had anticipated. They presented a consistent picture of an economy that is starting to show real growth again after a very weak spring and summer.
"It has become increasingly clear that the Chinese economy is now moving in a better direction," Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said at a news conference Thursday, before the October figures were publicly released.
Bank economists increasingly agree. "October's growth data delivered pleasant upside surprises across the board, providing fresh evidence that the economy has indeed bottomed out thanks to the filtering through of Beijing's policy easing," Sun Junwei, a China economist at HSBC, wrote in a research report Friday afternoon.
To be sure, the economic statistics released by the government Friday showed a return to the fairly strong economic expansion that prevailed through much of last year and early this year, and not a return to the torrid, double-digit growth that China has enjoyed for much of the last decade.
Australia & New Zealand Banking said in a research note that the latest figures were consistent with 8 percent economic growth in the last quarter of this year and even faster expansion in the first quarter of next year.
Growth had weakened to 7.4 percent in the third quarter and 7.6 percent in the second quarter, according to official statistics. Many economists have been suspicious that even the figures from earlier this year might have been overstated, given the weakness in categories like electricity generation, which grew barely at all in the second quarter and only slowly in the third quarter.
By contrast, the economic expansion this autumn appears more broadly based. Business executives have begun to describe recovering exports and domestic sales, and cranes have begun moving again on the skylines of big cities like Guangzhou and Beijing.
Steel mills and concrete factories are busier. Power generation increased 6.4 percent last month from the same period a year ago, its strongest gain since March, although still well below the double-digit annual gains in previous years.
But the renewed growth has been fueled by rapidly mounting debt, as state-owned banks and the central bank have funneled hundreds of billions of dollars in additional lending to state-owned enterprises and government agencies to finance further investment projects.
Stock markets in China, Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea were all down about half a percent in late afternoon trading, or about half the loss Thursday on Wall Street, as good news from China seemed to partially offset global worries about the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States and economic troubles in Europe.
The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics said Friday that industrial production had risen 9.6 percent in October from the same month a year earlier, compared with 9.2 percent in September and 8.9 percent in August. Retail sales were up 14.5 percent in October from a year earlier, compared with 14.2 percent in September, even though slower inflation at the consumer level was acting as a brake on the increase in retail sales.
Fixed-asset investment was up 20.7 percent for the first 10 months of this year, after having been up 20.5 percent for the first nine months of this year. China releases only year-to-date figures for fixed-asset investment, partly because of the difficulty in tracking when money is actually spent on big construction projects.
Consumer prices were up only 1.7 percent in October from a year ago, compared with an increase of 1.9 percent in September. Western economists had expected inflation in China to stay steady in October instead of slowing.
Producer prices were down 2.8 percent in October from a year ago, a slightly faster pace than the 2.7 percent decrease that economists had expected but not as fast a decline as in September, when they were down 3.6 percent.
China has begun a once-a-decade leadership transition at its Party Congress, which began in Beijing on Thursday and will last through the middle of the coming week.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Central Banks in Europe Hold Interest Rates Steady

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank expressed satisfaction Thursday with progress toward resolution of the euro zone crisis, applauding "amazing" efforts by members of the currency union to reduce government spending.
While pessimistic on the immediate outlook for economic growth on the Continent, Mario Draghi, president of the central bank, pointed to a number of indicators of reduced tension in financial markets, including a return of United States money market funds to the region and successful bond sales by Portugal and Ireland.
"Fiscal consolidation that has taken place all over the euro zone is amazing," Mr. Draghi said after the bank joined the Bank of England in leaving its main interest rate unchanged. "All this poises the euro area for a recovery that is probably going to be slow, but is also going to be solid."
But Mr. Draghi seemed to leave the door open for a rate cut or other measures to stimulate growth without committing to one. He said that inflation would probably fall below the bank's target of about 2 percent next year and signaled that next month the central bank was likely to lower its forecasts for euro zone growth.
At its regular monthly monetary policy meeting, the central bank's governing council left its benchmark interest rate at 0.75 percent, a record low.
"As expected, the E.C.B. kept its powder dry," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients.
The Bank of England also kept its benchmark rate at a record low of 0.5 percent and left its bond-purchasing stimulus program at £375 billion, or $600 billion, after the British economy emerged from a double-dip recession in the third quarter.
The economy grew 1 percent in the third quarter, its strongest quarterly growth since the global financial crisis started in 2008. But growth was helped by Olympics ticket sales, and some economists said the outlook was gloomy.
"The big picture is that it's going nowhere, really," said Vicky Redwood, an economist at Capital Economics. "Output is essentially stagnating. It's a pretty dismal picture."
Mr. Draghi's appearance at a news conference Thursday came a bit more than a year after he became president of the central bank, and he used the occasion for a little self-congratulation. Mr. Draghi said that central bank measures like unlimited, low-cost loans to banks had helped eliminate the risk that some lenders would run out of cash.
"Compare the situation today with what it was even a year ago," he said. "There has been substantial progress."
He emphasized that the central bank remained ready to buy euro area government bonds to drive down prices and "avoid extreme scenarios."
So far, the mere threat of central bank intervention in bond markets has been enough to reduce Spain's borrowing costs from dangerous levels. Some analysts have questioned how long the calm can last, but Mr. Draghi refused to put pressure on Spanish leaders to ask for help, which they must do to receive it.
"We stay fully ready to act," Mr. Draghi said, adding, "It is entirely up to Spain and the Spanish government to take this decision."
Mr. Draghi offered rare praise for euro area governments, saying they had done more to control spending than Japan or the United States. The Greek Parliament's approval of a sweeping series of austerity measures on Wednesday "really represents progress, especially if you compare the situation to a few months ago," he said.
At the same time, he said the central bank would not forgive any of the Greek debt that it held as a result of an earlier bond purchasing program. There have been calls for the central bank to write off some of the debt or to extend the repayment period to take pressure off Greece, but Mr. Draghi reiterated that any debt forgiveness would violate a ban on the central bank's financing of governments.
In Britain, recent economic figures show that pressure on households is easing as unemployment and inflation start to fall. But the improvements have not been enough to translate into a marked improvement in consumer confidence. Debenhams and Marks & Spencer are among British retailers that recently gave cautious earnings outlooks.
Prime Minister David Cameron, whose government is pushing ahead with an austerity program that includes welfare cuts and higher taxes, said last month that the economy was healing. But Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said two days later that it was difficult to know whether some of the recent positive signs would persist and that the recovery was slow and uncertain.
On Wednesday, the European Commission cut its forecast for Britain's gross domestic product to a 0.9 percent rise in 2013 from the 1.7 percent increase it had predicted in May, partly because of risks from the euro zone. Even though growth remains weak, Britain is doing better than the euro zone. Germany, considered the growth engine of Europe, reported growth of 0.3 percent in the second quarter.
In response to a controversy about a vacancy on the central bank's executive board, Mr. Draghi conceded that top management at the bank needed to include more women. The governing council, which includes the six-member executive board and the 17 heads of central banks in the euro zone, is entirely male.
Last month, the European Parliament rejected the nomination of Yves Mersch, head of the central bank in Luxembourg, to the executive board, saying a woman should be named to the post. The vote was not binding on the 17 heads of government in euro zone countries, who must approve candidates for the board by majority vote.
"We know we have to improve at management level," Mr. Draghi said.

Full text:   Whether President Obama or Mitt Romney won Tuesday, the top Pentagon contractors had already begun preparing for a new reality of shrinking resources for the military.
Boeing, for one, has slashed $2.2 billion in costs, including 6,300 jobs, from its huge military business since 2010. It announced Wednesday that it planned to cut an additional $1.6 billion by the end of 2015 by consolidating office space and divisions.
Boeing's actions underscored the biggest question of the day in the industry: How soon and how deep will bigger cuts come?
For more than a year, the contractors have been pressing President Obama and the House Republicans to reach a deal to forestall $500 billion in additional military spending cuts set to start in early January.
With Mr. Obama's re-election, that issue will flare up over the next few weeks in the lame-duck Congress. Political leaders will search for ways to avert or delay the cuts while talks get under way again on a broader deficit-reduction package.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney had both promised to stop the spending cuts, and it would presumably have been easier for Mr. Romney to work that out with House Republicans than it will be for Mr. Obama.
But most military analysts say they believe that a deal will be reached that at least delays the cuts -- which would automatically lop off 10 percent of the money for nearly every weapons program -- because neither party wants to see them happen.
"I do expect a sausagelike budget deal where the really tough parts get deferred and the sequester mechanism is deferred or altered," said Gordon Adams, a professor of international relations at American University, who helped oversee military budgets in the Clinton White House.
But, he and other analysts said, the military budget is still likely to decline significantly in the next decade, as the war in Afghanistan ends and the military is required to share in reducing the $16 trillion debt.
Tom Captain, the United States aerospace and defense leader for Deloitte, the accounting firm, said perhaps $250 billion in military cuts could come as part of a bargain to reduce the deficit.
Mr. Adams added that in previous military drawdowns, like the one after the cold war, the Pentagon budget declined gradually in a steplike fashion, with the cuts becoming deeper than initially expected as policy makers re-evaluated the situation in preparing each year's budget.
He said he could see the current deficit-reduction efforts leading to cuts of at least 15 percent, and possibly as high as 30 percent, by the end of the decade.
The Pentagon's base budget, which soared after the 2001 terrorist attacks, has already declined modestly from a peak of about $530 billion in fiscal year 2010. Mr. Obama has proposed canceling plans for $487 billion in spending increases over the next 10 years. His plan would limit the growth in military spending to about the rate of inflation over that time.
Mr. Captain said that the biggest military contractors -- including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman -- all recognized that more cuts were inevitable and had been paring back, even though Mr. Romney had said he would sharply increase military spending. Mr. Captain said those companies and their vast networks of smaller suppliers had cut 55,000 jobs over the last two years to reduce costs.
Boeing's military unit said that it had been planning its newest cost-cutting effort for some time and that it would have made the same changes even if Mr. Romney had won. Given the reductions that started in 2010, the unit has cut nearly 30 percent of its executives and plans to reduce the number of middle managers. But the company has been able to reduce the impact of some of the cuts by transferring military workers to its thriving commercial aircraft business, a spokesman, Todd Blecher, said.
The big companies have been looking to increase foreign sales to offset the Pentagon cuts. But with other nations facing their own budget problems, Mr. Captain said, Deloitte has found that total revenue for military contractors across the globe declined by 3.3 percent last year and another 1 percent in the first six months of 2012.
So even with large weapons sales to countries like India and Brazil, he said, "all of that is not going to make up for the difference." CHRISTOPHER DREW

Full text:   For more than a century, for good or ill, New Jersey has led the nation in coastal development. Many of the barrier islands along its coast have long been lined by rock jetties, concrete sea walls or other protective armor. Most of its coastal communities have beaches only because engineers periodically replenish them with sand pumped from offshore.
Now much of that sand is gone. Though reports are still preliminary, coastal researchers say that when Hurricane Sandy came ashore, it washed enormous quantities of sand off beaches and into the streets -- or even all the way across barrier islands into the bays behind them.
But even as these towns clamor for sand, scientists are warning that rising seas will make maintaining artificial beaches prohibitively expensive or simply impossible. Even some advocates of artificial beach nourishment now urge new approaches to the issue, especially in New Jersey.
The practice has long been controversial.
Opponents of beach nourishment argue that undeveloped beaches deal well with storms. Their sands shift; barrier islands may even migrate toward the mainland. But the beach itself survives, because buildings and roads do not pin it down.
By contrast, replenishment projects often wash away far sooner than expected. The critics say the best answer to coastal storms is to move people and buildings away from the water, a tactic some call strategic retreat.
Supporters of these projects counter that beaches are infrastructure -- just like roads, bridges and sewer systems -- that must be maintained. They say beaches attract tourists and summer residents, conferring immense economic benefits that more than outweigh the costs of the projects. Also, they argue, these beaches absorb storm energy, sparing buildings inland.
New Jersey has embraced this approach with gusto. Stewart C. Farrell, a professor of marine geology at Stockton College of New Jersey, said that since 1985 80 million cubic yards of sand had been applied on 54 of the state's 97 miles of developed coastline: a truckload of sand for every foot of beach.
Dr. Farrell and his colleagues have calculated that the work cost more than $800 million -- before adjusting for inflation.
Typically, the federal government pays 65 percent of the cost; the state and towns share the rest.
By now in New Jersey, most beaches "are engineered dikes," said Thomas Herrington, a professor of ocean engineering at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, who has been working with the state to assess its coastal protection. About half of its coastal communities have projects still under way, so their beaches are already approved -- at least in theory -- for topping up with sand as needed.
But even if there is money for that work, engineers must find the sand. Around the nation, that is getting more and more difficult. The problem is particularly acute in New Jersey.
"We know from geological surveys -- and New Jersey is a prime example -- that offshore sand, high-quality sand, is a highly finite resource," said S. Jeffress Williams, a coastal scientist with the United States Geological Survey and the University of Hawaii.
Underwater ridges of sand lie offshore, but engineers must go farther and farther (and spend more and more) to find them, Mr. Williams said, adding that eventually "it is not going to be there."
And while it is theoretically possible to replenish a beach with material mined inland, that approach would create other problems, said Robert Young, a coastal geologist who directs the program for the study of developed shorelines at Western Carolina University. "Trucks full of sand weigh a lot," he added. "There is a tremendous toll on highway infrastructure." And excavating inland sand "would create holes that would be miles in diameter."
Howard Marlowe, a prominent advocate of replenishment projects, agrees that the nation needs "a better way of managing short supplies of sediment."
Mr. Marlowe is president of Marlowe & Company, a lobbying concern that represents many Atlantic and Pacific coastal communities. He said in an interview that sand supplies should be managed "holistically" -- and on a regional basis, not town by town, as is now largely the case.
Managers should look at inlets, ports and the Intracoastal Waterway, as well as offshore sand sources, Mr. Marlowe said, adding, "You have to have an interstate approach."
That is particularly true in New Jersey, he said, because towns in New York and Delaware also often find themselves on the hunt for sand. Elsewhere in the country, towns feud over who is entitled to offshore sand. Towns in Florida have gone to court over the issue.
Avalon, N.J., about 20 miles north of Cape May, looks to Townsends Inlet north of town for its sand, according to Harry deButts, who retired in 2008 as the town's director of public works and now works part time on its emergency management efforts. He said Avalon shares that sand with Sea Isle City, the town across the inlet.
Mr. deButts said the Army Corps of Engineers dredged about 450,000 cubic yards of sediment from the inlet in 2003, and applied "a couple hundred thousand cubic yards" more about five years later. The town is scheduled to receive more sand in December, to repair damage from Hurricane Irene last year.
He said "the beaches did their job" during Hurricane Sandy, saving buildings in Avalon from flood damage. The town had built a dune more than 20 feet high, adopting what he called "an education program" to explain the advantages of second-floor living rooms to residents whose views were blocked.
That can be a hard sell. In Harvey Cedars, on Long Beach Island, homeowners have sued for compensation over loss of ocean views because of a proposed project. The case is before the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Where artificial beaches failed to protect their communities, it was probably because "this storm just exceeded the design conditions," said Dr. Herrington, of the Stevens Institute, who has been working with the state to assess coastal protection. Typically, he said, projects in New Jersey are engineered to withstand the kind of storm that on average occurs only once every 75 years.
But as the climate warms, sea levels are rising and bad storms may come more frequently. And New Jersey is particularly vulnerable because of tectonic forces and changes in ocean currents.
When the glaciers retreated about 15,000 years ago, land in the region bounced up; now it is sinking again. Meanwhile, ocean circulation patterns are changing in ways that push water up against the mid-Atlantic coast.
"We cannot sustain the shoreline in the future as we have in the past," said Mr. Williams, of the Geological Survey. "Particularly from a beach nourishment standpoint."

Abstract: "Tax policy shapes almost everything individuals and enterprises do as they participate in the economy," he says on his "Mitt Romney for President" Web site. For the Romney plan, I took the proposals from his Web site that apply to taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000: a 20 percent cut in the top rate (to 28 percent from 35 percent); dividends and capital gains taxed at the existing preferential rate of 15 percent; and the abolition of the alternative minimum tax.

Full text:   What federal tax rate would you pay if Mitt Romney were elected president? And what would it be if Barack Obama were re-elected, assuming Congress goes along with the candidates' proposals?
Would you pay more or less in tax? And how would that stack up against the richest Americans like Warren Buffett, who's currently paying a lower rate than his secretary?
Considering how central these issues have been to the campaign, it's curious how hard it is to come up with answers, perhaps because both candidates want voters to believe that someone's else's taxes may have to rise, but not theirs. Whether Mr. Romney's math adds up and whether taxing the rich would make a dent in the deficit might make an interesting public policy debate, but those issues further obscure the most basic question, which is what effect the proposals will have on each of us.
I'm not saying voters should simply vote their pocketbooks. But I would at least like to know how much I'm being asked to pay and what I might expect in return. This has been especially true since I discovered this year that I paid a rate in federal income tax that's nearly twice as high as Mr. Romney's. As I said then, I'm not faulting Mr. Romney for taking advantage of the existing tax code, but that disparity continues to rankle.
Tax reform and the related issue of economic growth have been major themes in the campaign that will end on Tuesday. The economy has taken center stage, and both candidates have been making much of tax platforms that aim to spur growth and job creation while promoting fairness. Mr. Romney has been the more ambitious, calling for sweeping tax reform that would lower rates while broadening the base by limiting unspecified deductions and loopholes. "Tax policy shapes almost everything individuals and enterprises do as they participate in the economy," he says on his "Mitt Romney for President" Web site.
President Obama has called for a return to the top rates that prevailed in the Clinton administration and higher rates on capital gains and dividends. "We can't get this done unless we also ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on their incomes above $250,000 -- pay the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president," Mr. Obama said last month while campaigning in New Hampshire. "We created 23 million new jobs, and we went from a deficit to surplus. That's how you do it."
So what would the impact of their tax proposals be? After consulting several tax experts, I did the calculations both on my own returns for 2009 and 2011 as well as for the wealthiest 400 taxpayers.
For the Romney plan, I took the proposals from his Web site that apply to taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over $200,000: a 20 percent cut in the top rate (to 28 percent from 35 percent); dividends and capital gains taxed at the existing preferential rate of 15 percent; and the abolition of the alternative minimum tax. Mr. Romney hasn't said what itemized deductions he would abolish or limit, but he has said he might cap or eliminate those deductions for high-income taxpayers.
Mr. Romney has mentioned a cap on deductions of $17,000, and has also said: "One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount And then that number disappears for high-income people," meaning high-income people would be allowed no itemized deductions.
So in the spirit of Mr. Romney's comments, I eliminated all itemized deductions. I retained the self-employed health insurance deduction and the deduction for contributions to a qualifying retirement plan. So far as I can tell, Mr. Romney hasn't proposed abolishing those.
I took Mr. Obama's tax proposals from his proposed budget and subsequent campaign statements, in which he has called for a return to Clinton era rates of 36 percent (for single taxpayers in roughly the $200,000 to $400,000 bracket) and 39.6 percent for those earning over $400,000 for both ordinary and dividend income and a 20 percent rate on capital gains. While Mr. Obama has talked about repealing the A.M.T., he hasn't actually proposed doing so and has only suggested indexing it to inflation, so I retained the A.M.T. in the Obama calculations.
I assumed the Obama proposals would raise my rate and the Romney plan would lower it. But the Romney plan actually increased my rate to 25.5 percent from 22.2 percent in 2011, and to 27.6 percent from 26.7 percent in 2009. The Obama plan raised it even more substantially, to 30.6 percent in 2011 and 29.3 percent in 2009.
Including the minimum tax in the Obama plan had a significant impact. If Mr. Obama abolished it, my rate under his plan fell to 29.7 percent in 2011 and to 26.7 percent in 2009 -- lower than the Romney plan, in fact, in 2009. If Mr. Romney allowed me the $17,000 in itemized deductions he has mentioned, it would have only a negligible impact, lowering my rates 0.5 percent.
It's hard to generalize from one return. Since I live in New York, I have high state and local tax deductions, to some extent recaptured by the A.M.T. So I benefited from Mr. Obama's retention of most deductions (although he has talked of some limitations on higher-income taxpayers). I had some capital gains in 2011 (and benefited from Mr. Romney's lower rate) while, like many people, I had a net loss in 2009.
Still, the results suggest that Mr. Romney's plan, far from being a tax cut, would raise my taxes. Mr. Obama's proposals impose an even steeper increase, assuming he doesn't repeal the minimum tax. That's not surprising, since he hasn't masked his intention to make higher-earning taxpayers pay more. And my results for Mr. Obama don't include the 3.8 percent surcharge on investment income scheduled to go into effect as part of his health care legislation.
What about the fairness issue that set off my interest in the first place? I did the same calculations for the ultrarich who represent the top 400 taxpayers, using 2009 data, the most recent available, and 2007, a more representative year since incomes were depressed during the financial crisis.
Contrary to some attacks on Mr. Romney's plan, his proposals don't appear to disproportionately benefit the ultrarich. In 2009, they paid an average 20.6 percent in federal tax on adjusted gross income of nearly $81 million; in 2007 it was 17 percent on an average $138 million. Mr. Romney's plan would yield a 20.4 percent rate in 2009, a slight reduction, and 18.5 percent in 2007, which is 1.5 percentage points higher.
Still, Mr. Romney's plan doesn't affect the ultrarich much at all, since they derive so much of their income (as he does) from capital gains, and he has pledged to maintain the existing low capital gains rate. In both 2009 and 2007, the ultrarich paid a much lower rate than I would under Mr. Romney's plan.
Under Mr. Obama's proposals, rates on the top 400 would rise to 30.6 percent in 2009 (significantly higher than my rate for that year) and 32 percent in 2007. Mr. Obama's plan goes a long way toward resolving the fairness issue, at least in my case, even if it does raise my taxes.
I shared the outcome with both campaigns, and neither campaign directly responded to my question. Adam Fletcher, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said, "The bottom line is that you simply cannot check Romney's math without knowing more details about his plan, which he refuses to release." He added that the highest-earning taxpayers would benefit from the Romney plan, while middle-class families with children shoulder more of the burden.
In its statement, the Romney campaign said, "Governor Romney's plan will ease the tax burden on middle-income families and help small businesses grow and create jobs."
William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution and the author of a much-debated report on Mr. Romney's math, said my results bore out his point that "you can't pay for the Romney tax rate cuts without raising taxes on the middle class," adding: "That's not to say tax reform is useless. You could do a 1986, Reagan kind of reform. You increase the tax on capital gains and bring down the rates. But that's something Romney has explicitly sworn off."
The paradox is that many Republicans and Democrats support tax reform along those lines, but no one would know that from the campaign rhetoric. "President Reagan didn't really want to raise capital gains taxes," Professor Leonard E. Burman, a tax expert at Syracuse University and a member of the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force said. "But he did because it was the only way to cut rates without shifting the tax to middle-income people. Unfortunately, the campaign hasn't clarified the issue much. There's been a tremendous amount of obfuscation."
Still, a few things emerge from my exercise: President Obama's plan would impose higher rates on higher-income taxpayers, especially at the very top. My rate, although higher than I pay now, would be lower than that paid by the ultrarich. I'd pay higher rates under Mr. Romney's plan than I do now but lower than under Mr. Obama's. Still, they'd be significantly higher than the ultrarich pay, which leaves the fairness issue unaddressed.
Voters may disagree about who's right, but the choice seems clear. And now I have some idea what the tab will be.

Full text:   Voters due at the polls next week are feeling enormous anxiety about the economy. We mistrust government more than ever. Walloped by joblessness, disheartened by a decade of no income gains for the middle class, many of us have come to doubt our national self-image as a society that offers a shot at prosperity to all.
Faced with sharply contrasting approaches to our troubles, voters must grapple with two critical questions: What is the nature of our problem, and how did we get here? Above all, we must confront the way our choices, as a society, have shaped our predicament.
The sense of economic vulnerability weighing over the middle class has been building for decades, beginning well before the financial crisis and recession that scarred the last four years. We explain it to ourselves as a product of forces beyond our control: technology, which automated many formerly good jobs, or globalization, which put American workers in direct competition with cheaper labor in poor countries around the world. These relentless dynamics have sent unheard-of profits toward the prosperous few while threatening the jobs and eroding the wages of the rest.
This understanding, while broadly accurate, ignores the role of our choices in managing the powerful global dynamics. Over the last three decades, every country in the world has been buffeted by globalization and technology advancing at a breakneck speed. But we have charted a unique course through the turbulent global waters, building a more cutthroat form of capitalism than most other industrial nations. We are more skeptical of government and willing to accept market outcomes, including high inequality and deep poverty. More than citizens of other countries, we tend to believe that success, like failure, is deserved.
Our form of capitalism has led us to where we are today. The United States may be good at generating wealth. It is arguably one of the most innovative and entrepreneurial economies in the world, producing technologies that have been essential to powering global growth. But the American way has not been effective at transforming affluence into broad-based well-being.
It may look as if our social and economic woes are a product of rampant globalization. To a large degree, however, they are a consequence of how we have chosen to address the opportunities and challenges of our high-tech, globalized world. Our cutthroat approach to capitalism has exacted high social costs.
The United States is probably less globalized than most other rich countries. Our total trade -- the sum of our imports and exports -- peaked at about 31 percent of our total economic production in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By contrast, in Canada it amounted to 69 percent of the economy that year. In 2008, imports had only about 17 percent of the United States market, the smallest share among the industrialized nations in the O.E.C.D. In Germany that share was 44 percent.
In some ways we have reaped great rewards from our interconnected world. On average, income per person has grown 71 percent over the last 30 years, after adjusting for inflation. This puts us in 16th place among the list of 29 advanced countries tracked by the International Monetary Fund over the period. There are only a handful of places -- Singapore, Norway, Luxembourg and Hong Kong -- that enjoy a higher average income per person than the United States.
Yet for all the riches we have amassed, by the O.E.C.D.'s calculation, the income of Americans of working age in the middle of the distribution has grown less since the mid-1980s than in virtually every other developed nation. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we suffer from some of the worse social ills known to the industrialized world.
It is not just that income inequality is the most acute of any industrialized country. More American children die before reaching age 19 than in any other rich country in the O.E.C.D. More live in poverty. Many more are obese. When they reach their teenage years, American girls are much more likely to become pregnant and have babies than teenagers anywhere else in the industrial world.
We understand the importance of early childhood development. Yet our public spending on early childhood is the most meager among advanced nations. We value education. Yet our rate of enrolling 3- to 5-year-olds in preschool programs is among the lowest among advanced nations. Our 15-year-olds place 26th out of 38 countries on international tests of mathematical literacy, according to the O.E.C.D. The first nation to understand the value of widespread college education, the United States has dropped from the top to the middle of the pack of our economically advanced peers in terms of college graduation rates.
The American way has produced a high-tech health care system that offers sophisticated cures for those who can afford them, yet is astronomically expensive and poor at combating many run-of-the-mill ailments, and leaves millions uninsured.
Our safety net -- to protect the most vulnerable from globalization's ravages -- is threadbare. Where would you rather lose your job to cheap competition from China? In the United States you would lose health care, too -- unless you had the money to buy private insurance. If you were the breadwinner in a family of four earning the average wage, benefits would replace only 52 percent of it, even including any extra welfare payments you were entitled to, the O.E.C.D. found. And they would drop to 37 percent of your last wage after two years tops. In Britain, by contrast, you would still receive over 70 percent of your wage for 60 months after you lost your job. And your health care needs would be addressed by the public, universal National Health Service.
A particularly telling statistic speaks of how we deal with social dysfunction: there are 743 Americans in jail for every 100,000. That's more than in any other country in the world, according to the International Center for Prison Studies. The next country down the list is Rwanda, with 595.
Social ills like obesity and child mortality have, of course, multiple and complex causes. But the battery of dismal statistics suggests, at the very least, a troubling pattern. Yet though we seem to suffer more than our fair share of social ills, by the O.E.C.D.'s calculation our public spending to address them is smaller as a share of the economy than in any other country in the developed world.
Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, James Robinson of Harvard and Thierry Verdier of the Paris School of Economics have proposed an economic taxonomy that divides the world into two types: cuddly countries like those in Scandinavia, where robust governments manage big social welfare systems, and cutthroat capitalists like the United States, willing to tolerate more inequity to encourage effort and entrepreneurship. Life might be better in cuddlier spots. But harsh as life in cutthroat nations may be, the world needs us to grow.
Americans work longer hours than workers in any other highly developed country, the authors note, perhaps because handing over a smaller slice of our income in taxes makes us willing to do so. Most important, they argue, the United States produces the greatest share of the world's technological breakthroughs and innovations, the main fuel of the world's economic growth.
In trying to reconcile the entrepreneurial spirit that the American brand of capitalism provides with its social costs, American voters must choose between Mitt Romney, the businessman who offers to move the economy forward by making government smaller and more efficient, and President Obama, who offers the government as an agent to assist the less prosperous, to put a thumb on the scale on the side of the have-nots.
The taxonomy developed by Mr. Acemoglu, Mr. Robinson and Mr. Verdier may strike voters as too crude a rendering of societies' complexities. Their proposition that a cuddly America would lead to less innovation and growth around the world has come in for some harsh criticism. But they offer voters a fundamental insight: when it comes to dealing with the challenges brought about by overwhelming global forces, there is a choice.

Full text:   LONDON (Reuters) -- World shares rose modestly in subdued trading on Tuesday as investors and traders prepared for markets in the United States to reopen after a huge storm that wrought destruction across the Eastern United States.
The monster storm, Hurricane Sandy, was responsible for at least 30 deaths, left millions without power, and closed much of New York's financial district for two days.
Major stock exchanges in the United States are scheduled to reopen for trading Wednesday and a financial industry trade group said the fixed income market would also be open for trading on Wednesday, the final day of the month, which is important for pricing investment portfolios.
Early activity could be volatile after the closing of the world's largest financial market.
"You have earnings, a heavy economic data calendar, the election cycle -- it's a catalyst-rich market sitting idle for a few days, and there could be an unusual reaction," said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.75 percent at 1,101.75 points and, after gains earlier in Asia, the MSCI world equity index had risen 0.3 percent to 328.86 points.
Stock index futures in the United States, which continued trading in Europe, edged lower, but volumes were light.
"We're a bit lost without Wall Street, frankly," said Alexandre Tixier, a technical analyst at TradingSat in Paris.
Across European stock markets, attention was on corporate earnings, with results from well-known names like Germany's Deutsche Bank, the Swiss banking giant UBS and the oil company BP lifting prices. Shares of UBS increased more than 4 percent as it confirmed a plan to cut 10,000 jobs.
Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.75 percent, Germany's DAX index up 0.9 percent and Switzerland's SMI index up 0.5 percent.
In the currency markets, which remained open, the dollar lost ground against a resurgent yen after the Bank of Japan eased policy less aggressively than had been hoped for at its regular policy setting meeting.
The Bank of Japan increased its monetary stimulus for a second consecutive month, this time by 11 trillion yen ($138.2 billion), disappointing many who had positioned for a more aggressive increase.
"It was a very skeptical response to the B.O.J. policy meeting, made worse by the fact they have revised lower the growth and inflation outlook," said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. "That has seen the yen unwind a lot of the softer tone we saw going into this meeting."
The dollar hit a one-week low of 79.25 yen and was down 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies at 79.94 points.
The weaker dollar helped the European common currency climb 0.4 percent to $1.2958, while news that the Spanish economy had shrunk slightly less than expected in the third quarter.

Full text:   The economy, "super PAC" money, debate performances, the candidates' personalities. Roll it all together, and it's obvious who's going to win.
Or, uh, it will be.
Amid the many uncertainties of next Tuesday's presidential election lies one sure thing: Many people will feel in their gut that they knew the result all along. Not only felt it coming, but swear they predicted it beforehand -- remember? -- and probably more than once.
These analysts won't be hard to find. They will most likely include (in addition to news media pundits) neighbors, friends, co-workers and relatives, as well as the person whose reflection appears in the glare of the laptop screen. Most will also have a ready-made argument for why it was inevitable that Mitt Romney, or Barack Obama, won -- displaying the sort of false, after-the-fact "foresight" that psychologists call hindsight bias.
"The important thing to know about hindsight bias is that it not only changes how you see the world, but also how you see yourself in it," said Neal Roese, a professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, who just published a review paper on the bias with Kathleen D. Vohs of the University of Minnesota. "You begin to think: 'Hey, I'm good. I'm really good at figuring out what's going to happen.' You begin to see outcomes as inevitable that were not."
Long the province of political scientists, historians and pollsters, voters' behavior has more recently attracted the attention of psychologists. They have dug into the field over the past decade or so, finding a wide-open arena in which to test results from lab studies and in some cases drawing interest from campaign strategists. If politics is individual psychology writ large, then thinking about politics should be subject to the same shortfalls and quirks as thinking about anything else. And so it is, to some extent -- presenting some of the same opportunities for self-correction.
The most obvious carry-over to politics is confirmation bias, the reflexive instinct to begin with an assumption -- say, that poor people are lazy -- and notice only evidence that's supportive, like malingering, ignoring the efforts of the rest of the $5-an-hour night cleaning crew.
Hindsight bias is close to the reverse. People retrofit their opinions and judgments to the evidence, in this case to an election result, but just as often to a political decision (or nondecision) that went wrong. Of course it was clear that Saddam Hussein was bluffing about weapons of mass destruction. Anyone could have seen that. Of course the consulate in Benghazi needed beefed-up security.
Campaigns exploit this instinct, particularly when appealing to voters who second-guess decisions of someone they put in office, said Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and co-founder of No Labels, a nonprofit devoted to bipartisanship. "As the challenger, you need to win over some of those voters," Mr. McKinnon said in an e-mail. "You need to give them an out for their 'voters' remorse.' It's not them, you see, it was him."
Once they know an outcome, people tend to inflate their initial predictions by an average of 15 to 20 percent, Dr. Roese said -- ample wiggle room to retrospectively alter almost any prediction from "it's going to happen" to "it probably won't," be it a tennis match, a legal decision or a presidential race.
In 800 studies during the past few decades, researchers have demonstrated the effect consistently in predicting everything from legal decisions and stock movements to sports contests and world affairs.
In an experiment conducted during the Clinton administration, for instance, two psychologists at Loyola University in Chicago had 34 students predict the likelihood that the president would be convicted in his impeachment trial. The students' estimates ranged from about 50 percent 11 days before the decision to about 41 percent a few days before, as the news media were trending toward acquittal.
But 11 days after the Senate voted to acquit the president, the study found, the same students inflated their original estimates by about 10 percentage points. Their estimates of what a friend would have guessed showed no such inflation. The students identified themselves mostly as independents, with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats.
An experiment led by the one of the same Loyola researchers, Fred B. Bryant, found a similar pattern in students estimating the likelihood that O. J. Simpson would be acquitted in his murder trial. In both studies, participants remembered their initial predictions as more accurate when judged more than a week after the fact than in the first few days after.
"Even after it has been explained to you 100 times, you can still fall prey" to the bias, said Philip E. Tetlock, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "Indeed, even after you've written about it 100 times."
One reason it's hard to avoid this bias is that it mirrors how the brain operates biologically. The brain cannot possibly make sense of incoming sensory information instantaneously; it continually reconstructs, inserting meaning and making judgments very quickly, but post hoc.
"What consciousness does is tell the most compelling story it can come up with," Dr. Vohs, the University of Minnesota psychologist, said in an e-mail. "That means to tell a neat story, where all the pieces fit together. This means that the past becomes a lot more 'knowable' than it was in reality, and hence hindsight bias."
The downside of such distortion is not just the shock of being unmasked, when a rude friend or spouse points out your record of bad predictions. It also breeds contempt for others' judgments when those go south, which some inevitably do, especially in politics and diplomacy.
The solution is contained in the psychological processes that underlie the bias itself, studies suggest. Take the presidential race. It's a dead heat in the polls, and the fact that so many will argue after the vote that the winner was inevitable implies that they have front-loaded arguments to support both outcomes. One way to counteract the bias is to play out those possibilities before the final outcome.
In one study, for example, doctors read a case study describing a patient who arrived in a psychiatric clinic "in a confused and agitated state" and had a history of heavy drinking and unemployment as well as dementia in the family. Medical tests showed deficits in concentration and attention, but brain imaging results were inconclusive. The doctors rated the probability of three primary diagnoses -- alcohol withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease or brain damage from heavy drinking -- before learning the given answer.
But those who were prompted to explain reasons that each of the three diagnoses could be correct before making their decision showed significantly less hindsight bias later than those who made the call without playing out each possibility explicitly.
Other studies have shown the same for people predicting the outcomes of sports scores, legal decisions and finance. "This consider-the-opposite strategy is effective, but it does not completely erase the bias," Dr. Roese said.
All of which is simply a reminder to cue up some blues discs as well as dance music next Tuesday, hedge all bets and be prepared to confess that what you knew all along was, well, nothing. At least that's more agreeable than sounding like every other hindsight expert.

Full text:   The insurance industry could be responsible for paying for $5 billion to $10 billion in property and casualty claims from Hurricane Sandy, but it has the resources to make the payouts, industry experts said Monday.
Eqecat, a company that tracks natural disasters and estimates their cost, said it expected the storm's total economic damages to range from $10 billion to $20 billion, which includes damage to homes and cars, and business lost because of the storm. The company said the insurance industry would be responsible for covering $5 billion to $10 billion of that, a smaller amount in part because insurers generally don't cover the flooding of homes and businesses. A federal government insurance program would most likely pick up much of that uncovered cost.
Insurance payouts toward the lower end of the Eqecat estimate would be on par with the $6.4 billion insurers covered in Hurricane Rita in 2005. According to the Insurance Information Institute, the most expensive hurricanes, in inflation-adjusted dollars, were Katrina in 2005, with $47 billion in insured losses; Andrew in 1992, with $23 billion; Ike in 2008, with $13 billion, and Wilma in 2005, at $12 billion, all of it in Florida.
Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, said the property and casualty industry had the resources to absorb losses estimated for this storm. Until now, the industry had been having a year of minimal losses from natural disasters.
Eqecat noted that about 20 percent of the United States' population lived in the areas exposed to Hurricane Sandy's impact.
AIR Worldwide, a company that models hurricanes and estimates their damage, said the value of insured properties in New York State's coastal areas was $2.7 trillion. The only state with hurricane exposure that has a higher total property value is Florida, with $2.8 trillion. Texas is a distant third.
Homeowners' insurers with the biggest market share in New York State are State Farm, with 15.5 percent of premiums written; Allstate, with 15.2 percent; and Travelers with 10.9 percent. The figures, provided by SNL Financial, do not take into account reinsurance arrangements, which are typical in the property and casualty business and help spread risks across a larger group.
The largest auto insurers in New York State are Berkshire Hathaway, with 26 percent of the market; Allstate, with 18.1 percent; and State Farm, with 12.5 percent.
Leading commercial insurers in New York include the American International Group and State Farm, which has a large workers' compensation program.
AIR Worldwide's principal scientist, Tim Doggett, warned of possible record-setting storm surges in east-facing bays, such as Long Island Sound, Raritan Bay and the New York City Harbor. Manhattan's sea walls stand five feet above the average sea level, and storm surges up to 11 feet are being predicted.
Standard homeowners' insurance policies do not cover flood damage, nor do commercial policies, although auto insurance often includes coverage for flooding. This means much of Hurricane Sandy's cost is likely to be borne by the National Flood Insurance Program, in which the federal government covers flood claims in communities that have adopted local flood plain management ordinances.
The program paid out $1.3 billion to cover claims in all states affected by Hurricane Irene in 2011. The industry racked up $4.3 billion in losses in that storm.
AIR Worldwide said the biggest unknown was what would happen in the days immediately after landfall; although the winds would slow, the storm was expected to linger in the region and could continue to wreak destruction in Washington, Pennsylvania and New York until as late as Wednesday.

Full text:   ANYWHERE investors turned last week, they seemed to be approaching a cliff. But the Federal Reserve provided a margin of safety, and said it stood ready to do so for many months to come.
The stock market, which had climbed so steadily for so long, has been stumbling. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up more than 12 percent for the year, but it has declined 3.7 percent since its peak on Sept. 14.
"Cliffs are in fashion this fall," Ed Yardeni, an independent economist, wrote on Thursday. There are fiscal cliffs, earnings cliffs, revenue cliffs and political cliffs -- notably, the stark uncertainty of a presidential election lurching to a razor-close finish.
Mr. Yardeni said the market "is already stumbling off an 'earnings cliff,' " and investors worry that political gridlock could render the nation unable to avert a fiscal precipice, too.
That dreaded fiscal cliff came into unexpected view on Monday night, in a presidential debate that was putatively focused on foreign policy. President Obama told Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, that an automatic cut in military spending simply "will not happen" on Jan. 1. But it wasn't clear how Mr. Obama would manage to avoid the fiscal cliff -- a crushing combination of tax increases and budget cuts -- if he cannot reach agreement with a lame-duck Congress on how to avoid it.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in August that a crash off the fiscal cliff would mire the economy in a "significant" recession. And the International Monetary Fund warned this month that the "fiscal cliff" would trim roughly 4 percent from the growth rate of the American economy. Gross domestic product is already growing at an anemic annual rate: 2 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Friday.
One sign of heightened corporate concern about the danger of the fiscal cliff emerged on Thursday morning, when executives of more than 80 large American corporations signed a statement calling for a debt-reduction compromise that would "include comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform, which broadens the base, lowers rates, raises revenues and reduces the deficit." That implies a tax increase, which Mr. Romney and other Republican leaders have vowed to prevent. The executives said they would push for a bipartisan agreement once this contentious election season was over.
Wall Street, meanwhile, has been disappointed by the corporate earnings reports streaming in, with analysts expecting a 1.2 percent decline in earnings for the third quarter, which would be the first quarterly decrease since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue is expected to fall at the same rate.
Bellwethers like General Electric, 3M, Xerox and DuPont have issued downbeat forecasts. Bloomberg reported that since Sept. 1, North American-based companies have announced that they will eliminate 62,600 jobs, the biggest two-month toll since early 2010. Speaking of the market as whole, Mr. Yardeni said revenues seem to be at the edge of a cliff. "If they fall off of it," he said, "so will the profit margin."
Consumer confidence and the housing market continue to be haunted by the financial crisis and recession that ended in 2009, but they have rebounded considerably. But corporate investment remains constrained. Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays, said big business was engaging in a "capital strike" -- a reluctance to commit substantial sums for long-term projects "until the results of the election are known, and it's clear that the fiscal cliff can be averted." Until then, he said in an interview, "we're going to have a subpar recovery."
IN the midst of these unsettling portents, Fed policy makers said on Wednesday that they would take whatever measures were necessary to ensure that the economy grew and that unemployment declined.
What is more, they promised to continue their stimulative policies, not just while the economy is weak but "for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens." Fed policies now in place include ultralow short-term interest rates and intervention in the fixed-income markets, where the central bank is buying $85 billion of securities each month in an effort to keep longer-term rates, including mortgage rates, low.
The Fed's policy has come under attack from Republicans during the election campaign. Mr. Romney has said the Fed has raised the risk of runaway inflation, increasing uncertainty and dousing the enthusiasm of business, thus impeding the economic recovery. If elected, he says, he will replace Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, whose term expires in January 2014.
That could create a timing issue. In its statement, the Fed said it expected to hold short-term interest rates near zero "at least through mid-2015." And there are indications that the central bank is considering changes "that could ensure that Bernanke's growth-oriented policies will endure long after his term as Fed chairman expires," said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
It could do that if Fed members with years remaining in their terms embraced measures now that commit the central bank to an expansionary monetary policy until certain conditions are met. A future Fed chairman's power could "be circumscribed by a more formal policy-making process," Mr. Feroli said.
For example, the Fed might keep short-term rates "at zero until the unemployment rate is at least below 7 percent, provided inflation doesn't breach 3 percent," Mr. Feroli said. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, advocates that change.
This issue could come up at the Fed's December meeting -- after the election, but before the government reaches the fiscal cliff.

Full text:   Imagine getting a letter from the boss, telling you how to vote.
Until 2010, federal law barred companies from using corporate money to endorse and campaign for political candidates -- and that included urging employees to support specific politicians.
But the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision has freed companies from those restrictions, and now several major companies, including Georgia-Pacific and Cintas, have sent letters or information packets to their employees suggesting -- and sometimes explicitly recommending -- how they should vote this fall.
In these letters, the executives complain about the costs of overregulation, the health care overhaul and possible tax increases. Some letters warn that if President Obama is re-elected, the company could be harmed, potentially jeopardizing jobs.
David A. Siegel, 77, chief executive of Westgate Resorts, a major time-share company, wrote to his 7,000 employees, saying that if Mr. Obama won, the prospect of higher taxes could hurt the company's future.
"The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job, however, is another four years of the same presidential administration," Mr. Siegel wrote. "If any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, as our current president plans, I will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company."
In an interview, Mr. Siegel said he was not ordering his employees to vote his way. "There's no way I can pressure anybody," he said. "I'm not in the voting booth with them."
Mr. Siegel added: "I really wanted them to know how I felt four more years under President Obama was going to affect them. It would be no different from telling your children: 'Eat your spinach. It's good for you.' "
Dave Robertson, the president of Koch Industries, sent an information packet and letter this month to more than 30,000 employees of a subsidiary, Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp company. The letter attacked government subsidies for "a few favored cronies" as well as "unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses."
The letter added, "Many of our more than 50,000 U.S. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation and other ills."
The Georgia-Pacific letter, first reported by In These Times, included a flier listing several candidates endorsed by the Koch brothers, the conservative billionaires, beginning with Mitt Romney, as well as opinion articles that the brothers had written.
Travis McKinney, a forklift driver for Georgia-Pacific in Portland, Ore., said the company's political packet had spurred widespread discussion. "It leaves a bad taste," Mr. McKinney said. "I won't even wear my Obama pin to work because of the mailer."
In a statement, Koch Industries said its mailing contained pieces of information "we believe are important for our employees to know about." The company said the letter was in no way intimidation: "We make it clear that any decision about which candidates to support belongs solely to our employees."
Other companies whose top executives have sent out anti-Obama letters include Rite-Hite, a manufacturer of industrial equipment based in Milwaukee, and ASG Software Solutions, based in Naples, Fla.
Many corporate executives say they have stepped up their political activities to counter organized labor's efforts on behalf of Mr. Obama and other Democrats. Even before Citizens United, unions were allowed to promote candidates to their members. Democrats and Republicans alike acknowledged the effectiveness of labor's political efforts.
Mr. Romney has himself urged business owners to appeal to their employees. In a conference call in June organized by the National Federation of Independent Business, he said, "I hope you make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections."
Larry Gold, associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said some of the recent employer letters, by hinting at the possible loss of employees' jobs, appeared to cross the line into improper coercion. Federal law and the laws of several states bar anyone from coercing or intimidating voters into voting a certain way.
But Bradley A. Smith, a Republican former member of the Federal Election Commission and a professor at Capital University Law School, disagreed, saying letters like those sent by the companies were not firm threats to fire anyone if Mr. Obama won.
According to the Citizens United ruling, companies may recommend candidates to employees, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles.
"If the employer wants to say, 'This candidate is good or bad for our business and therefore good or bad for you, the employee, that's permissible -- that's protected by the First Amendment," Professor Volokh said. "But if the employer threatens to fire you based on how you vote, that's not protected."
But many liberal legal experts fear that employees could be discouraged from exercising their rights to free speech.
"The concern here is there is an unavoidable power disparity between management and employees," said Adam Skaggs, senior counsel at the liberal Brennan Center for Justice. "Put yourself in the shoes of an employee at any of those companies. Are you going to be comfortable putting an Obama bumper sticker on your car and driving into the company parking lot? If you're in a small community with a big employer, will you feel uncomfortable about putting up a yard sign for a candidate your boss doesn't favor?"
Richard Lacks, chief executive of Lacks Enterprises, an auto parts company based in Grand Rapids, Mich., wrote to his 2,300 employees this month warning that an Obama victory would mean higher health care costs and higher taxes that would eat into their paychecks. "It is important that in November you vote to improve your standard of living and that will be through smaller government and less government," he wrote.
Scott D. Farmer, chief executive of Cintas, the uniform supply company, sent a letter to his company's 30,000 employees on Oct. 19, denouncing the Affordable Care Act and saying it "amounts to the single largest tax on Americans and business in history." He warned employees that "the overregulation that business is facing today from the various administrative agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency" and the National Labor Relations Board "is suffocating many companies."
Mr. Farmer added, "This uncertainty felt by many of our customers about their ability to run and grow their businesses prevents them from adding jobs which hurts our ability to grow and add jobs."
Asked about Mr. Farmer's letter, Greg Hart, Cintas's vice president for government affairs, responded, "The communication was not an attempt to suggest to employees how to vote, but rather it was sent to help partners make an informed decision."
Election law experts did not point to any corporate efforts this year to urge employees to back Mr. Obama, although corporations have at times politicked for Democratic candidates. In 2010, Harrah's, the casino company, urged its employees to go to the polls to re-elect Nevada's senior senator, contending that "waking up to the defeat of Harry Reid Nov. 3 will be devastating."

Full text:   More optimistic consumers are propelling the economy forward, even as businesses pull back.
The pickup in spending by consumers, along with a burst of defense orders and a stronger housing market, helped the economy expand at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, a slightly better pace than had been anticipated, according to government data released Friday. In the previous quarter, economic growth had dipped to a rate of just 1.3 percent.
While growing more confident that the housing market has stabilized, households have been buoyed by lower energy prices, until recently a rising stock market and a slight improvement in employment. After years of shedding debt, there are also signs that consumers are starting to borrow again.
"Consumers are feeling wealthier so they are still out there spending," said Joshua Dennerlein, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Still, the pace of economic activity is short of what's needed to substantially reduce the unemployment rate, now at 7.8 percent and also well below the level of growth typical in this stage of a recovery after a sharp downturn.
What's more, fears are growing that the economy could slow again in the fourth quarter. Companies are preparing for the possibility of steep tax increases and sharp spending cuts if Congress cannot agree on a deal to reduce the deficit after the election, a combination of factors frequently referred to as the fiscal cliff.
In fact, a series of disappointing earnings reports from the nation's biggest companies this week, along with a handful of layoff announcements from corporate bellwethers, suggest businesses have already begun to retrench.
With the presidential campaign entering the final, desperate dash to Election Day, there was plenty of fodder in Friday's report for both candidates to cite as they spar over the direction of the economy.
For President Obama, the best news was that consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 2 percent last quarter, up from 1.5 percent in the second quarter, while residential investment increased at an annual rate of 14.4 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in the second quarter.
The business snapshot was much dimmer. The report showed that business investment fell 1.3 percent, a reversal from the 3.6 percent increase recorded in the second quarter, and a sign businesses are indeed clamping down on spending ahead of the fiscal cliff.
Inventories also were a notable factor with the summer drought in the Midwest shaving overall growth 0.4 percentage point as farm inventories dropped.
In addition to the uncertainty about government policy, corporate performance has been hurt by a recession in parts of Europe and weaker demand from China. Some economists fear that all these factors will keep a lid on growth in the final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of next year.
The Commerce Department data showed exports decreased by 1.6 percent in the latest quarter, compared with a 5.3 percent increase in the second quarter. It was the first time exports had fallen since the first quarter of 2009, when the global economy was reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis in the United States.
At a campaign appearance in Iowa, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, termed Friday's report "discouraging," adding, "slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay."
The new figure, released by the Commerce Department, is the government's first estimate of growth in the third quarter. Slightly better than the 1.8 percent increase economists had been forecasting, it showed the nation rebounding to the growth it had in the first quarter of the year after a spring slump.
"The report highlights the fact that businesses have already begun to react to the looming fiscal cliff while consumers march steadily ahead," said Mr. Dennerlein. Noting the jump in residential spending, he added that the slowly recovering housing sector is a bright spot.
Housing values and stock values certainly contribute to consumers' sense of financial well-being. And despite the hesitancy among businesses, optimism among consumers continues to rise. A separate survey released Friday showed consumer sentiment at its highest level in more than five years, with the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index rising to 82.6 in October from 78.3 in September, though it was lower than a preliminary October reading of 83.1 that had been previously reported.
To be sure, the latest growth in consumer spending was still well below the rate of increase in the first half of the last decade, when easy credit and a boom in home prices fueled growth in the 3 percent range.
But it was a crucial antidote to gloom pervading the business sector, experts said. "We'd really be in trouble if consumer attitudes were deteriorating like business attitudes," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Mr. Gault warned, however, that the outlook among consumers could erode if political leaders in Washington cannot break the deadlock over tax and budget policy. "Consumers are not so forward-looking as businesses," Mr. Gault said. "So there are two ways this can go. Either we clear up the uncertainty, or consumers start focusing on the fiscal cliff and we see consumer spending hurt as well."
In recent days, government data and a steady drumbeat of disappointing earnings reports from corporate bellwethers have underscored the threat to the job market posed by softness in sectors more dependent on exports, like manufacturing and chemicals.
Dow Chemical and DuPont announced job cuts earlier in the week, and that list grew Friday with Newell Rubbermaid, which makes commercial and consumer products like Calphalon and Paper Mate pens, announcing plans to cut more than 1,900 workers, or just over 10 percent of its work force. And Rockwell Collins, an aviation and defense giant, said it was considering eliminating up to 1,250 positions, equivalent to roughly 6 percent of its employees.
The latest data suggest a tug-of-war between countervailing economic forces that could shift at any time. For example, growth last quarter was unexpectedly bolstered by a 13 percent jump in military spending that few economists expect to be repeated in the fourth quarter.
Without the increase from military spending, the economy would have grown at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.
"Going forward, consumers might be able to continue at the current pace of spending but they're not going to be able to drive the growth rate higher," said Mr. Blitz. "And 2 percent isn't enough to get unemployment down."

Abstract: On Thursday, the European Central Bank report on loan activity in September showed a record 1.4 percent year-over-year decline in loans outstanding to private sector companies and individuals in the euro zone. "These numbers are rather consistent with the bleak picture painted by business surveys, showing an ongoing contraction of activity," wrote Francois Cabau and Phillippe Gudin of Barclays Capital in a note to clients. If peripheral countries simply had fixed exchange rates, rather than a common currency, they could and almost certainly would have devalued their currencies long before now.

Full text:   Remember the euro crisis?
Only a few months ago, it was front-page news. Would the euro collapse? Would most of southern Europe go broke, unable to borrow money at any reasonable rate? Would that bring on a new world recession?
But in this week's foreign policy debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the euro never came up. Europe was mentioned once, but the reference had nothing to do with economics. Mr. Romney did refer to Greece, but only to say we were in danger of going down the same path if we did not change our ways.
To a surprising extent, the perception seems to be that the European situation is under control. That is true if all you worry about is whether bondholders will get paid. It is false if you have a broader perspective.
The focus of the last couple of years on borrowing costs for peripheral members of the euro zone was, in retrospect, unfortunate. It was always clear that Europe, as a whole, had the ability to solve that issue if it wished to do so. The European Central Bank, like the United States Federal Reserve, has the ability to print money, and that is what it finally did.
But the real issue was - and remains - whether the peripheral countries could turn into successful economies while staying in the euro zone. On that issue, progress is painfully slow.
"The actions of the E.C.B. and other policy makers in Europe have generally had the effect of filling large financial gaps in periphery bank and sovereign funding," wrote Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates this week, "but have done relatively little to resolve competitive imbalances among these economies."
Banks are hesitant to lend. On Thursday, the European Central Bank report on loan activity in September showed a record 1.4 percent year-over-year decline in loans outstanding to private sector companies and individuals in the euro zone. "These numbers are rather consistent with the bleak picture painted by business surveys, showing an ongoing contraction of activity," wrote Francois Cabau and Phillippe Gudin of Barclays Capital in a note to clients.
If peripheral countries simply had fixed exchange rates, rather than a common currency, they could and almost certainly would have devalued their currencies long before now. That is the normal prescription for countries in financial distress. Couple it with austerity and revivals can be surprisingly rapid, as exports surge and imports plunge.
As it is, the process is sure to be long and painful, but not certain to succeed.
As Europe stumbles and slows, there has been a temptation in the United States to turn our attention elsewhere, to Asia for economic reasons and to the Mideast for political ones. Mr. Romney has tried to add South America to that mix. But neither the Romney nor Obama campaign has wanted to talk much about Europe, a fact that has been noted with a little alarm in Europe.
Richard Lambert, the chancellor of Britain's Warwick University - and a former editor of The Financial Times as well as a former central banker - was in New York this week trying to convince Americans that they should care, and predicting that the euro will survive.
"The European Union has the capacity to get its affairs into order, if it has the political determination to do so," he said in a speech at New York University. "This is a crisis about economic imbalances within the euro zone, more than it is about fault lines with the rest of the world."
That is a point worth remembering. The euro zone as a whole is running smaller budget and current account deficits than is the United States. If it were one country, there might be articles about depressed regions, but not talk of collapse.
But it is not one country. It is taking halting steps in that direction, with a move to unified bank supervision, but political union is not going to happen; Angela Merkel's name is never going to be on a ballot outside of Germany. Nor is there going to be easy labor mobility around Europe, even though that is supposedly guaranteed now. Cultural and language differences assure that.
Within the United States, there have long been depressed areas - sometimes changing, as when Texas went from boom to bust when oil prices collapsed in the early 1980s - and transfer of payments from one region to another. Europe does not have automatic transfer payments, but its various central bank programs, as well as the bailouts, amount to transfer payments from the rich countries to the poor ones.
It was not easy getting the Germans to agree to those programs, and ambiguity remains regarding future transfers as a way of persuading depressed countries to stick to the austerity programs Europe demands. It was critically important that Ms. Merkel, Germany's chancellor, was willing to approve the newest European Central Bank program despite the objections of Germany's own central bank, the Bundesbank.
Ireland is often painted as the periphery's success story, and in some ways it has been. Unit labor costs are down, and the country seems to be better able to compete in world markets. It did so with deflation, by slashing wages in the private and public sector, reducing unemployment benefits and raising the retirement age. Its exports are rising and - unusual for the periphery - its imports are also going up.
Those sacrifices amounted to a very large price to pay for the sin of having a housing bubble that devastated the country's banks, and then its government when it tried to stand behind the banks.
One reason that Americans have been dubious about the prospects for euro survival is that it is hard for us to imagine anyone accepting such a prescription when simply adopting a (quickly devalued) new currency would seem to be much less painful, even considering the financial chaos that might ensue for a brief time.
The wealth of the populace, measured in foreign currency, would decline, but nominal salaries would not. Fixed payments - such as car payments and mortgage payments - would not suddenly increase as a percentage of income, as they have with slashes in paychecks.
But the euro never was primarily an economic creation. The political reasons for binding Europe together were - and are - more important. "It is essential to understand the strength of the political glue that is holding the project together," Mr. Lambert of Warwick University said in his speech. "A whole generation of political leaders want this project to survive, and they have the economic resources to make it do so if they choose to use them."
He pointed out that polls in Greece - which seems to be in a never-ending depression - still show strong support for the euro, and so do polls in Finland, which has been upset over the need to support the periphery.
If countries in the periphery cannot devalue their currencies versus the German currency - that is, if they stay in the euro - then they must somehow get their labor costs in line with Germany's. There is talk of, and even some action, regarding labor market reforms, but that is a slow process.
In Portugal, the clever idea was something called "fiscal devaluation," in which taxes were to be adjusted to lower labor costs. The government proposed charging lower payroll taxes to companies and higher ones to workers. That would have cut take-home pay, and reduced wage costs for business. The populace was outraged, and the government backed down.
It is not only the troubled countries on the periphery that saw inflation, and unit labor costs, rise much faster than costs in Germany over the past decade, leading to the competitive problem. That is still true in Italy and France. Mr. Lambert argues that the most important issue facing Europe is whether France will get a handle on its competitiveness problem.
German inflation would help greatly, and that could be a side benefit of the central bank running its printing presses full out.
In the long run, the peripheral economies must become competitive with their neighbors, so they can earn their own way, or the result will be, in Mr. Lambert's words, "the permanent division of Europe into creditor and debtor nations, with the creditors dictating the terms." That, he says, "would not be politically sustainable over time."
The euro zone is not about to collapse. Whether it can be sustained over the long term is not as clear.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it would continue its economic stimulus campaign, aimed at reducing unemployment, amid fresh evidence of a housing recovery that could help to bolster those efforts.
Sales of new homes rose 5.7 percent in September to the highest level since 2010, when the government was offering tax credits to first-time buyers, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. The report joins other recent data showing rising prices and increased construction in affirming that the housing market is recovering from its prolonged downturn.
The Fed acknowledged that consumer spending, including spending on housing, has strengthened, but it said that it remained convinced that its efforts were necessary to bolster an inconsistent and lackluster recovery.
Unemployment remains stubbornly high, the domestic economy is growing slowly, the global economy is struggling and a so-called fiscal cliff looms at the end of the year.
"The committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions," the Fed's policy-making committee said in a statement released after a regularly scheduled two-day meeting.
This was the Fed's last meeting before the presidential election. In holding its course, the Fed again defied the criticism of the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, who has described the central bank's efforts as ineffective and inflationary and who has promised to replace its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
Indeed, the statement from the policy unit, the Federal Open Market Committee, once again emphasized that it remained prepared to expand its efforts "if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially."
The decision was supported by 11 members of the committee. The only opposition came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has dissented at each meeting this year.
The Fed announced after its last meeting, in September, that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage securities each month until the jobs outlook improved, a significant expansion of its stimulus campaign. It also said it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until mid-2015.
The new policy is aimed specifically at helping the housing market by reducing interest rates on mortgage loans. The more people who buy homes, the greater the benefit to the housing market and to the economy in general.
The housing market remains depressed by historical standards. New home sales have reached an annual pace of 389,000, better than the last two years but significantly worse than any other year since 1963.
And housing remains anchored to employment. People need jobs to buy homes.
"All the housing data has taken a turn for the better. Clearly, mortgage rates at such a low level and what appears to be an increase in banks' willingness to make loans has boosted activity off the lows," Steven Richiutto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, wrote in a note to clients. "But I would still not read too much into this unless employment picks up. We have seen false starts before."
The Fed's next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 11 and 12, will be more consequential. Under a separate program begun last year, the Fed also is buying about $45 billion in long-term Treasury securities each month. Those purchases are scheduled to end in December. Officials have said they will consider extending the program depending on the condition of the economy.
The central bank appears determined to press its campaign until it is certain of the results, so long as inflation remains under control. It has been chastened by a series of misjudgments, after declaring several times in recent years that the recovery was gaining strength only to conclude that more stimulus was needed.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech this month that, as a consequence, the Fed had not done enough to support the economic recovery. "With the benefit of hindsight," he said, "monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive."
A number of Fed officials also argue that the current policy would be more effective if the Fed defined a clear target for its efforts, like a level of unemployment or economic output. But consensus about the right target so far has proved elusive.

Full text:   Less than a year into a new administration, the nation's trade deficit is soaring. Manufacturers are complaining bitterly that an overvalued dollar is destroying the economy, driving businesses abroad. Congress is bubbling with proposals to punish countries that are flooding the United States with cheaper exports.
The gimlet-eyed realists in the new administration decide it is time to get tough, and it works. Within four years, the currencies of our main trading partners have risen sharply against the dollar; the exchange rate of our main Asian rival has jumped by a third. The trade deficit starts to recede. America -- undisputed leader of the free world -- gets to carve one more notch in its belt.
This is the type of success Mitt Romney hoped to conjure up during the foreign policy debate on Monday night when he promised to get tough on China from "Day 1," designating China a currency manipulator and opening the door for trade sanctions. It is also the image President Obama wanted to convey when he countered that he has been twice as tough on China as his predecessor, George W. Bush.
The vignette, however, is old.
It comes from Ronald Reagan's second term, when Japan rather than China inspired fears of American decline. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a k a the Velvet Hammer, summoned the finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to the White and Gold Room of the Plaza Hotel in New York on Sept. 22, 1985, to devise an agreement to weaken the dollar.
We also got tough with our trading partners in 1971, when the Nixon administration imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports to force them -- Japan, above all -- to revalue their currencies and help right an American trade balance that was sliding into deficit for the first time since the 19th century.
Tempting as it is, that approach to economic policy is unlikely to be very effective today. In the 1970s and '80s, the club of industrial democracies was bound by the common Soviet threat. Japan, protected by the American nuclear umbrella, would do what the United States wanted. Today the Soviet Union is gone. China may not be as powerful as the United States, but it is powerful enough to hit back.
More important, trying to push China around like a bulked-up version of 1980s Japan does not fit with our national interests. In fact, it puts at risk a central, long-term American objective: drawing China into the club of prosperous, rule-bound and democratic nations.
As the economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson warn in their new book, "Why Nations Fail," China's autocratic government will end up suppressing prosperity, stifling innovation as it clings to power and breeding instability as factions fight for the spoils of growth. Helping steer China away from such an unstable, dangerous course is a core American goal.
China's economy is slowing sharply. Political turmoil is swirling just weeks before only the second peaceful transition of power in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. Loud, unilateral American toughness at this stage is unlikely to help. It may prompt a reaction against the more outward-looking, reform-minded constituencies, strengthening conservative forces that are unwilling to cede any political control.
And for all this risk, getting tough is unlikely to deliver much.
The Chinese currency is the wrong target. Of course China has been manipulating its currency for years, buying mountains of dollars to keep the renminbi cheap and give its exporters a leg up. But Beijing appears ready to correct course.
Factoring in China's fast inflation, which makes its exports more expensive, the real value of the renminbi has risen at least 15 percent against the dollar since mid-2010. Beijing has curbed its dollar hoarding. And its broad trade surplus is falling fast: down to 2.3 percent of its economic output this year from more than 10 percent in 2007.
China's trade surplus with the United States is in part an illusion, because exports assembled in China from imported components are counted as 100 percent Chinese. Yuqing Xing, an economist at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, estimates that China contributed only 3 percent to the value of its exports of iPhones and laptops in 2009.
Chinese labor costs accounted for only $6.50 of the $178.96 wholesale cost of an iPhone 3G exported by China, according to a study by Mr. Xing and Neal Detert. Japanese components accounted for $60.60, German parts for $30.15, Korean components for $22.96 and American parts for $10.75. The numbers are rough. Some of the parts may have been made in China. Still, counting the entire $178.96 as a Chinese export vastly overstates its role.
Even if we conclude that currency manipulation alone is causing our bilateral trade deficit -- a highly unlikely proposition -- we can't blame it on China. "We have an Asian trade deficit," said Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade adviser to the Reagan administration. "If we were serious, we would say there are a number of countries manipulating their currency and distorting the world economy."
Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Federal Reserve official at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says 20 countries actively depress their currencies to bolster their exports, including Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan and Korea. Many may be following China's lead -- trying to stay competitive with the renminbi. Still, if we're going to get tough on currency manipulators, we might want to go after the lot.
China will continue to pose significant economic challenges for the United States in coming years. The cheap currency may recede as an issue. But there is China's theft of foreign intellectual property, its raft of hidden subsidies to domestic companies and its strong-arming of foreign companies to hand over industrial secrets to domestic joint venture partners, among other issues.
Still, getting tough is not the best way to address them.
In the State of the Union address this year, President Obama said he had saved more than 1,000 jobs in the tire industry by imposing tariffs to stop a surge of imports from China. Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute who worked in the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, estimated that each job saved cost Americans at least $900,000 in more expensive tires, reducing spending on other goods.
After all is said and done, Mr. Hufbauer concluded, the policy cost the economy 2,531 jobs. And that doesn't even count the effect of China's retaliation: antidumping duties on chicken parts that led to $1 billion in lost sales and reduced employment further.
There are tools to deal with China without setting off a trade war and undermining the national interest. Many economists have suggested changing the rules of the World Trade Organization to allow retaliation against currency manipulators. The European Union would probably support such changes. Interested countries could start the process by forming a voluntary nonmanipulation club and use carrots and sticks -- say, a tax on China's Treasury Bond purchases -- to get reluctant nations to join.
A multilateral approach, with tough talk in private, is also more likely to succeed against other egregious policies. President Obama may talk tough on China on the campaign trail. But his policy of engagement recognizes this. His administration's strategy of taking China's unfair practices to the World Trade Organization, where it has filed three cases since August, is likely to be more productive than unilateral action lacking the legitimacy of international law.
None of this has the gritty ring of a public proclamation to get tough on the cheaters across the Pacific. But all-American grit is unlikely to deliver the results that we need. After all, we still run an $80 billion deficit with Japan.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Taxes and government spending. Health care. Immigration. Financial regulation.
They are the issues that have dominated the political debate in recent years and have played a prominent role in this presidential campaign. But in many ways they have obscured what is arguably the nation's biggest challenge: breaking out of a decade of income stagnation that has afflicted the middle class and the poor and exacerbated inequality.
Many of the bedrock assumptions of American culture -- about work, progress, fairness and optimism -- are being shaken as successive generations worry about the prospect of declining living standards. No question, perhaps, is more central to the country's global standing than whether the economy will perform better on that score in the future than it has in the recent past.
The question has helped create a volatile period in American politics, with Democrats gaining large victories in 2006 and 2008, only to have Republicans return the favor in 2010. This year, economic anxiety, especially in industrial battlegrounds like Ohio, is driving the campaign strategies of both President Obama and Mitt Romney.
The causes of income stagnation are varied and lack the political simplicity of calls to bring down the deficit or avert another Wall Street meltdown. They cannot be quickly remedied through legislation from Washington. The biggest causes, according to interviews with economists over the last several months, are not the issues that dominate the political debate.
At the top of the list are the digital revolution, which has allowed machines to replace many forms of human labor, and the modern wave of globalization, which has allowed millions of low-wage workers around the world to begin competing with Americans.
Not much further down the list is education, probably the country's most diffuse, localized area of government policy. As skill levels have become even more important for prosperity, the United States has lost its once-large global lead in educational attainment.
Some of the disconnect between the economy's problems and the solutions offered by Washington stem from the nature of the current political debate. The presidential campaign has been more focused on Bain Capital and an "apology tour" than on the challenges created by globalization and automation.
But economists and other analysts also point to the scale of the problem. No other rich country -- not Japan, not any nation in Europe -- has figured out exactly how to respond to the challenges. "The whole notion of the American dream," said Frank Levy, an M.I.T. economist, "described a mass upward mobility that is just a lot harder to achieve right now."
For the first time since the Great Depression, median family income has fallen substantially over an entire decade. Income grew slowly through most of the last decade, except at the top of the distribution, before falling sharply when the financial crisis began.
By last year, family income was 8 percent lower than it had been 11 years earlier, at its peak in 2000, according to inflation-adjusted numbers from the Census Bureau. On average in 11-year periods in the decades just after World War II, inflation-adjusted median income rose by almost 30 percent.
Matching the growth rates of the postwar period -- when the country was poorer, when harsh discrimination against women and minorities was receding and when the rest of the world was weaker -- is probably impossible. Yet there is still a vast difference, both economically and politically, between incomes that are rising modestly and not at all.
Historically, periods of economic stagnation have tended to bring pessimism, political turmoil and a lack of social progress, said Benjamin Friedman, an economic historian and the author of "The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth." The political volatility and partisan rancor of the last several years seem to fit the pattern.
The recent stagnation has also led, economists say, to confusion and even scapegoating about the real sources of the problem. The causes that can seem obvious, and that often shape the political debate, are not necessarily the correct ones.
Take immigration, especially illegal immigration. Whatever other problems it may cause, evidence suggests that it has not played a significant role in the income slump.
It may have caused a slight decline in the wages of native-born workers without a high school diploma (and maybe not even that). But most illegal immigrants lack the skills to compete with the bulk of native workers, according to research by Giovanni Peri, Chad Sparber and others. Notably, incomes in some states with large immigrant populations, like California, have risen faster than in states with relatively few immigrants, like Ohio.
The minimum wage, similarly, appears to play only a minor role in the income slump. It has risen faster than inflation since 2000, even as overall pay at the bottom of the income distribution has not. And the size of the federal government also looks like a dog that is not barking: Washington collected taxes equal to 15.4 percent of gross domestic product last year, down from 20.6 percent in 2000.
A second group of much-cited forces have indeed played a role in middle-class stagnation and inequality, many economists argue, just not as big a role as automation, globalization or education.
Health care costs have grown sharply over the last decade, leaving employers with less cash to use on salaries. Labor unions have shrunk; all else equal, unionized workers earn more, often at the expense of corporate profits. Tax rates have fallen more for the affluent than for anyone else, directly increasing the take-home pay of top earners and indirectly giving them more incentive to earn large amounts.
But many of these factors are particular to the United States, while globalization and automation are obviously universal forces.
One of the more striking recent developments in economics has been economists' growing acceptance of the idea that globalization has held down pay for a large swath of workers. The public has long accepted the idea, but economists resisted it, pointing to the long-term benefits of trade. "That is starting to change only in the face of very strong evidence over the past decade," said Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations.
In particular, job growth and wage growth have been weaker in sectors exposed to global competition -- especially from China -- than in sectors that are more insulated.
Automation creates similar patterns. Workers whose labor can be replaced by computers, be they in factories or stores, have paid a particularly steep price. The American manufacturing sector produces much more than it did in 1979, despite employing almost 40 percent fewer workers.
Workers with less advanced skills have also suffered disproportionately. The pay gap between college graduates and everyone else is near a record. Despite the long economic slump -- and the well-chronicled struggles of some college graduates -- their unemployment rate is just 4.1 percent.
What is the solution to this thicket of economic forces?
That question is the one that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are trying to convince voters that they can best answer. They both accept that the government and the market have a role, but they put a different emphasis on those roles.
It is hard to see how either globalization or automation can be stopped. The proposed solutions instead tend to involve managing them.
If the economy can be made to grow fast enough, incomes can still rise across the board, as they did when the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent in the 1990s and briefly below 4 percent in 2000. If educational attainment rises, more people will be able to get jobs that benefit from technology and global trade, rather than suffer from it. And if inequality continues to soar, the government could choose to use the tax code to ameliorate it -- a solution that Democrats favor and Republicans say will hurt economic growth.
Maybe the biggest reason for optimism is that there is still a strong argument that both globalization and automation help the economy in the long run. This argument remains popular with economists: Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best, while technology creates opportunities to extend and improve life that never before existed.
Previous periods of rapid economic change also created problems that seemed to be permanent but were not. Neither the cotton gin nor the steam engine nor the automobile created mass unemployment.
"When technology reduces the need for certain kinds of labor, we know that some inventive people will one day come along and find a way to use that freed-up labor making things that other people want to buy," said Mr. Friedman, the economic historian. "That's what in the long run made the Luddites wrong."
He added, "How long does it take the Luddites to be wrong -- a few years, a decade, a couple of decades?"
Perhaps just as important, what happens to the workers who happen to be living during a time when the Luddite argument has some truth to it?

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- A proposal to require company boards to be made up of at least 40 percent women was set aside on Tuesday by the European Commission because of concerns about its legality and tough opposition from across the European Union.
Viviane Reding, the European commissioner for justice and the author of the legislation, said the postponement would give commissioners time to consider a compromise.
"There is still 40 percent," Ms. Reding said in Strasbourg on Tuesday. "But the way to arrive there has been looked at in a different way."
"The debate was very intense," she said, explaining that the discussion on the legality of any quota was one of the reasons the meeting took several hours.
The issue has divided the European Union, with Britain leading the countries that regard the rules as counterproductive and unworkable.
In the hours before the meeting, commission officials had sought to overcome the opposition while keeping the main features of the legislation. But those efforts were not enough to reach agreement.
Mark Gray, a spokesman for José Manuel Barroso, the president of the commission, said the body "decided to take a little more time so that it can reach an ambitious consensus" and that it would next meet on Nov. 14 to discuss the legislation.
Under one possible compromise, the commission could agree to modify the measure by letting national governments determine whether any sanctions should apply to companies and organizations that failed to take steps like introducing transparent selection criteria to give more consideration to women.
Ms. Reding had intended penalties like fines or the blocking of appointments if a board tilted too heavily toward one gender. The legislation had been written so that corporate boards that did not include at least 40 percent men could also risk sanctions.
"Such a controversial proposal was never going to get an easy ride," said Audrey Williams, a partner in London at Eversheds, a law firm. "To address concerns that the proposed directive could be unlawful, that could mean a significant watering down of the sanctions facing companies that don't reach any target."
Organizations in favor of tough measures warned against wholesale changes to the legislation.
"Already, the previous draft texts were excessively weak, applying only to non-executive positions on boards of the largest publicly quoted companies, and leaving the question of sanctions up to the discretion of the member states," Leanda Barrington-Leach of the European Women's Lobby, a private organization in Brussels, said. "How much weaker can it possibly get?"
Britain firmly opposed introducing legally binding provisions, on the ground that more time was needed gauge the results of voluntary national measures. The Netherlands and at least seven other countries, including Malta, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Bulgaria, shared this position.
In another case focused on gender equality, Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, told the European Parliament on Tuesday that the appointment of Yves Mersch to the executive board of the European Central Bank should proceed.
The Parliament's influential economic and monetary affairs committee voted to reject the appointment of Mr. Mersch on Monday night on the ground that it would keep the executive board as an all-male preserve. The full Parliament will vote Thursday on the appointment.
Although the Parliament does not have the power to require that women be considered for E.C.B. board appointments and is supposed to play only an advisory role in such selections, a vote on Thursday against Mr. Mersch could further complicate the nomination by putting governments in the position of rejecting the opinion of the only directly elected body representing the Union on the sensitive issue of gender equality.
Mr. Van Rompuy encouraged legislators to consider the "sole criteria of professional qualification and experience" in the case of Mr. Mersch.
Mr. Mersch is known for his hawkish stance on inflation and was nominated by euro area finance ministers in July to succeed José Manuel González-Páramo of Spain.

Abstract: The stimulus legislation, technically known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, was a mixture of tax cuts for families and businesses; increased transfer payments, like unemployment insurance; and increased direct government spending, like infrastructure investment. A growing literature examines the effects of such tax cuts and increases in government spending over history and across countries, and the overwhelming conclusion is that fiscal stimulus raises employment and output in the near term.

Full text:   AS a former member of President Obama's economic team, I have a soft spot for the fiscal stimulus legislation he signed just a month after his inauguration.
But I'm also an empirical economist who's spent a career trying to estimate the effects of monetary and fiscal policy. So let me put on my empiricist's hat and evaluate what we know about the legislation's effects.
After listening to Representative Paul Ryan in the vice-presidential debate, you might think that careful evaluation isn't needed. In his view, we spent $800 billion on the stimulus, yet unemployment still rose to 10 percent -- so obviously it wasn't helpful.
To understand what's wrong with that reasoning, think of someone who's been in a terrible accident and has massive internal bleeding. After lifesaving surgery, the patient still feels rotten. But we shouldn't conclude from this lingering pain that the surgery was useless -- because without it, the patient would have died.
Without knowing where the economy was headed in the absence of the stimulus, it's impossible to judge what it contributed just from what happened afterward. That's why empirical economists rely on other approaches.
One is to look at history. The stimulus legislation, technically known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, was a mixture of tax cuts for families and businesses; increased transfer payments, like unemployment insurance; and increased direct government spending, like infrastructure investment. A growing literature examines the effects of such tax cuts and increases in government spending over history and across countries, and the overwhelming conclusion is that fiscal stimulus raises employment and output in the near term.
When the Congressional Budget Office or leading private forecasters assess what the Recovery Act contributed, they use these estimates from history. They multiply the amounts of different types of stimulus in the act by their usual historical effects. This method suggests that at its peak, the act raised employment by about 1 million to 3 1/2 million jobs, compared with what would have happened without it.
But history isn't destiny. It's possible that the various elements of the Recovery Act worked better or worse than similar measures in the past. That's why a cottage industry has emerged of researchers looking explicitly at the recent experience.
The most successful of these studies focus on the variation in Recovery Act spending across states. Some of this variation resulted from differences in the recession's severity. For example, there was much more spending on unemployment insurance in Michigan than in Wyoming, because unemployment rose much more in Michigan. We wouldn't want to look at that variation and say Recovery Act spending caused unemployment to be higher, because causation clearly ran in the other direction.
But some Recovery Act spending was allocated via formulas unrelated to economic conditions in particular states. For example, some road-repair expenditures were based on the miles of highways in each state, and some aid to state governments was based on past Medicaid funding. This kind of spending provides a sort of natural experiment: some states received more treatment from the Recovery Act than others for relatively random reasons.
TWO careful studies have looked at the relationship between this formulaic spending and employment. Both find that states that received more money fared substantially better. This is the strongest direct evidence that the Recovery Act contributed to employment growth. Based on the estimated size of the effect, the studies suggest that the act created more than three million jobs.
Another study using a related method finds noticeably smaller effects. Even it, however, suggests that about a million jobs were created, and that estimate doesn't include the effects of the act's tax cuts.
In addition to its near-term jobs effects, the Recovery Act may also be having more lasting benefits. It's too early to measure the value of the roads, bridges and airports improved through stimulus funds. But a survey of influential studies looking at highway construction in the 1950s and '60s suggests that such investments contribute substantially to long-term growth.
Likewise, the Recovery Act's funding of basic research and clean-energy technology is only just beginning to pay dividends. And, contrary to some claims, the Government Accountability Office has found that those investments were accompanied by almost no fraud and abuse.
The act may have also helped prevent a permanent rise in unemployment. The longer workers are unemployed, the more likely they will never find steady employment again. By creating millions of jobs for unemployed workers in 2009 and 2010, the Recovery Act may have prevented some of these scarring effects.
THOUGH the Recovery Act appears to have had many benefits, it could have been more effective.
Most obviously, it was too small. When we were designing it, most forecasters estimated that the United States would lose around six million jobs during the recession without fiscal stimulus. Compared with this baseline, creating three million jobs would have filled roughly half of the employment hole.
As it turned out, even with the stimulus, we lost almost nine million jobs. Indeed, because of horrific job losses in late 2008 and early 2009, we'd nearly passed the six-million mark before the Recovery Act was even signed. Adding in the estimated effect of the act, the correct no-stimulus baseline was a total employment fall of nearly 12 million. With a loss that big, creating three million jobs was helpful, but not nearly enough.
A different mix of spending increases and tax cuts might also have been desirable. The money given to state and local governments to ease their budget problems appears to have been particularly effective for job creation in the near term. On the other hand, many families didn't even realize they had received a tax cut, so that part of the act may have had a smaller impact than was initially projected. And I desperately wish we'd been able to design a public employment program that could have directly hired many unemployed workers, especially young people.
Finally, there's little question that policy makers -- myself included -- should have worked harder to earn the public's support for the act. One frustrating anomaly is that many of its individual components routinely received favorable reactions in polls, while the overall act was viewed negatively.
That is more than a simple public relations problem. Recovery measures work better when they raise confidence -- as Franklin D. Roosevelt understood. His fireside chats, and his inaugural address proclaiming he would fight the Great Depression with the same resolve he would muster against a foreign foe, were aimed at reassuring Americans. Recent research suggests that New Deal programs may actually have had their primary impact on the economy by influencing consumer and business expectations of future growth and inflation.
Partly because of fierce political opposition, and partly because of ineffective communication and imperfect design, the Recovery Act generated little such rebound in confidence. As a result, it didn't have that extra, Rooseveltian kick.
The ultimate verdict on the Recovery Act will depend in part on further studies. I believe that as more research occurs and the political rancor fades, the fiscal stimulus will be viewed as an important step at a bleak moment in our history. Not the knockout punch the administration had hoped for, but a valuable effort that improved the lives of many.

Abstract: For future generations, the Romney-Ryan ticket would turn Medicare into a premium-support -- or voucher -- program in which the federal government provides a fixed amount of money to beneficiaries each year and allows it to grow by a small amount annually, which may not keep pace with medical costs.\n

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDThe outcome of the presidential election will determine which of two opposing paths the nation will follow on health care for all Americans. If voters re-elect President Obama, he will protect the health care reforms that are his signature domestic achievement. If they elect Mitt Romney, they will be choosing a man who has pledged to repeal the reform law and replace it with -- who knows what?
The competing visions are often difficult to evaluate because the Republican candidates -- Mr. Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan -- have become so artful about obfuscating their plans for Medicare, Medicaid and what they will do to reform the whole system. Almost nothing the Republican candidates say on these or other health care issues can be taken at face value.
Here are some of their bigger evasions:
REPLACING OBAMACARE Although Mr. Romney has said he wants to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act, he has provided few details on what he would replace it with. When challenged to do so at the first presidential debate, Mr. Romney never quite answered and made some egregious misstatements along the way, some of which were repeated by Mr. Ryan in the vice-presidential debate.
Mr. Romney asserted that his plans had already been laid out in "a lengthy description," implying that anyone could read the whole story by turning to his campaign Web site. As it turns out, the site has a page-and-a-half statement that says he would rely on private markets and state leadership but gives no hint of what it would cost or who would pay. A one-page list of frequently asked questions about his Medicare plan assures us that "Mitt continues to work on refining the details."
He continues to assert that his plan would cover people with pre-existing conditions when it clearly would not. People who have pre-existing conditions -- and are not already covered by insurance -- are often refused coverage or charged exorbitant rates by private insurers. Starting in 2014, the reform law will require insurers to accept all applicants and charge them without regard to health status. By contrast, Mr. Romney has simply pledged to protect people who had insurance but then lost it, provided they take out a new policy within a short time. But this protection is already required by law and offers absolutely nothing for millions of people who can't get or can't afford private insurance.
He has also implied that the reform law created an unelected board that's "ultimately" going to tell people what treatments they can have. The advisory board is specifically precluded by the law from recommending cuts in benefits or eligibility; its job is to propose cuts in payments to providers and insurers if necessary to meet budget targets.
A major goal of the law was to cover some 30 million more people by expanding Medicaid and subsidizing coverage for middle-income people. That goal would be lost if the law was repealed. The Republicans, of course, have no plans for covering the uninsured beyond assuming they can use emergency rooms, leaving the problem to the states.
MEDICARE Mr. Romney has misrepresented what would happen to both current beneficiaries and future generations under his proposals. He says his plans would have no effect on people now on Medicare or nearing eligibility. But if he succeeded in repealing the reform law, which has many provisions that hold down costs for Medicare enrollees, most beneficiaries would see their annual premiums and cost-sharing go up. The average beneficiary in traditional Medicare would pay about $5,000 more through 2022, and heavy users of prescription drugs about $18,000 more over the same period, if the act is repealed, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Mr. Romney also argues that the reform law will weaken Medicare because it cuts some $716 billion from future Medicare spending by slowing the rate of increase over the next decade. Of course, that is essentially the same amount of Medicare cuts in Mr. Ryan's budget resolutions, approved this year and last year by House Republicans.
The reform law justifiably reduces the excessive subsidies to private plans (known as Medicare Advantage) that enroll many beneficiaries. It also lowers the annual rate of increase in payments to providers, like hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies, to force them to become more efficient. Mr. Romney wants to keep overpaying the plans and providers simply to pander to elderly voters.
For future generations, the Romney-Ryan ticket would turn Medicare into a premium-support -- or voucher -- program in which the federal government provides a fixed amount of money to beneficiaries each year and allows it to grow by a small amount annually, which may not keep pace with medical costs. The whole point of turning to vouchers is to reduce federal spending on Medicare, so it seems likely that many beneficiaries would end up worse off than now. (At the vice-presidential debate, Mr. Ryan tried to pretend his premium-support proposal was bipartisan, but the sole Democrat who backed an early version -- Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon -- has disavowed his plan.)
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan insist that the magic of competition among health insurers -- both private plans and a public option like Medicare -- will bring down premiums. But if competition fails to do that, beneficiaries would almost certainly get socked with added payments or fewer benefits.
They say that lower-income beneficiaries would get more-generous premium support and wealthier individuals would receive less support. But, of course, they provide no numbers on what those support levels might be.
MEDICAID The Republicans want to repeal the reform law's expansion of Medicaid to cover millions of low- and middle-income people and instead shrink federal funding by turning Medicaid into a block grant. States would be given a fixed amount of money equal to what they had been getting in federal payments for Medicaid, and that grant would then grow at a rate tied to inflation. If those increases failed to keep up with medical costs, states -- faced with the necessity of balancing their budgets every year -- would probably have to cut enrollments or benefits or payments to providers. That could include cuts to coverage for long-term and nursing home care that millions depend on.
The block grant proposal in Mr. Ryan's budget resolution would reduce federal Medicaid payments to the states by more than $800 billion over 10 years and would cut federal funding by a third in 2022, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Mr. Romney blithely said that if a state got into trouble "Why, we could step in and see if we could find a way to help them." Or maybe not. It's another of those vague promises.
Correction: October 24, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this editorial misstated the additional amounts Medicare beneficiaries would pay if the health care reform act is repealed. The average beneficiary would pay about $5,000 more through 2022, not $4,200 more over the 2011-2012 period. Heavy prescription drug users, on average, would pay about $18,000 more through 2022, not $16,000 more over 2011-2012.

Full text:   "ARE you better off than you were four years ago?"
Ronald Reagan asked that memorable question at the end of the presidential debate of October 1980, one week before Election Day.
Millions of voters answered no -- sweeping President Jimmy Carter from office and installing the Republican Party in the White House for the next 12 years.
In the presidential debate last Tuesday on Long Island, and through much of this campaign season, Mitt Romney has been raising a similar question. He said last week that middle-class incomes have declined since President Obama took office, while gasoline prices have risen. And much as Mr. Reagan did several decades ago, Mr. Romney suggested that Americans are worse off today than they were four years earlier.
By some objective measures, we are worse off -- although that is at least partly because a severe recession was well under way and the economy was shrinking when Mr. Obama first walked into the White House as president. Based primarily on the grim fundamental economic data, several forecasting models have been showing for months that Mr. Obama faced a very difficult road to re-election.
Yet for the most part, he has been holding his own in the polls and the prediction markets. At the moment, he is widely considered to have an advantage in the all-important Electoral College.
But why? Elections, of course, are not decided on economics alone. "Campaigns matter, at least a little," said Thomas M. Holbrook, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. "The issues and the candidates matter, at least a little." Yet to the extent that the economy determines the election's outcome, it's possible that the stock market holds part of the explanation for Mr. Obama's outsize electoral strength.
Through Friday, since Mr. Obama's inauguration -- his first 1,368 days in office -- the Dow Jones industrial average has gained 67.9 percent. That's an extremely strong performance -- the fifth best for an equivalent period among all American presidents since 1900. The Bespoke Investment Group calculated those returns for The New York Times.
The best showing occurred in Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, when the market rose by a whopping 238.1 percent. Of course, that followed a calamitous decline. When his term started, the Dow had fallen to one-fourth of its former peak. In 2008, the year before Mr. Obama took office, the Dow declined by roughly one-third.
After Franklin Roosevelt, the next-best market performances occurred under Calvin Coolidge, Bill Clinton and Dwight Eisenhower. These exceptionally strong markets helped all of them win the next election -- and the stock market is undoubtedly helping Mr. Obama, too, even if he isn't saying much about it.
"What I find most ironic about these numbers is that one of Obama's weaknesses is said to be his economic record," said Paul T. Hickey, Bespoke's co-founder. "While the stock market isn't a complete reflection of the economy, it is an important indicator, and the stock market is one of the great things the president has working in his favor. But it's a sensitive subject. With Wall Street so despised by the average American right now, it's probably something he doesn't want to be too quick to trumpet. But facts are facts."
The market's relationship to the economy and to the political system is complex and varying from era to era. But a simple truth is that the market's rise and fall has an enormous effect on the wealth of ordinary Americans -- and on whether they feel themselves to be wealthy.
Some market effects on wealth are straightforward enough. With the relative decline of traditional pensions, and the rise of defined-contribution plans like 401(k)'s, the well-being of middle-class households is intimately connected to the stock market's fortunes. That was shockingly evident in 2008, when the Dow declined by more than 33 percent. That market fall, on top of a sharp drop in housing prices, contributed to a 19 percent decline in the total net worth of American households that year, according to figures compiled by the Federal Reserve.
Relatively low housing prices continue to depress aggregate wealth levels, the Fed's Flow of Funds report shows. But when stock market values are factored in, the rising value of financial assets -- including stocks -- has restored the total wealth of American households. Using this measure, it is now higher than when Mr. Obama's presidency began, Fed figures indicate.
Unfortunately for millions of Americans, that can't be said for median household income, which was only $51,023 last year, down from $53,206 in 2009, according to Census Bureau figures adjusted for inflation. While it appears to have risen in 2012, median household income almost certainly has not returned to its former level. And rising income inequality means that the hardship has been felt disproportionately by poor people, who face a double-whammy: they don't have financial assets that have grown in value.
Presidential election forecasting models using "objective data" like personal income, gross domestic product and unemployment have captured the gloomy realities of the economy, painting a relatively bleak picture of Mr. Obama's electoral chances. But Robert S. Erikson, a professor of political science at Columbia University, said, "If you include subjective data -- emphasizing expectations about the economy -- you get a very different forecast." In a paper, Professor Erikson and Christopher Wlezien of Temple University described a forecasting model using consumer sentiment measures and leading economic indicators. That model predicts an Obama victory "quite strongly," Professor Erikson said in an interview.
The performance of the stock market, at least to some extent, is a subjective rendering of market participants' expectations for the corporate economy. It's a complicated subject, partly because market prices tend to rise when interest rates are low, as they are now, thanks largely to efforts of the Fed and other central banks.
Do these relatively high prices really reflect the future outlook for the economy? It's not certain. But the stock market is an important component of many measures of leading economic indicators, and it is clearly painting a rosier picture than the retrospective headline numbers about the economy -- like the 1.3 percent annual growth rate of G.D.P. in the second quarter or the 7.8 percent unemployment rate in September.
IT'S often said that Wall Street prefers Mitt Romney to Mr. Obama, Mr. Hickey observed, yet the stock market has flourished under the president -- and under Democratic presidents generally. Since 1900, it has returned 7.1 percent annually when Democrats have occupied the White House, and only 3 percent under Republicans.
Mr. Carter was an exception. The market declined 0.3 percent in his first 1,368 days in office -- a performance more than 68 percentage points worse than that for Mr. Obama.
Are you better off than you were four years ago? For stock portfolios, at least, the last four years have been bumpy but they haven't been bad at all.

Full text:   I stopped seeing someone recently and decided, as one does in these situations, that it was time to change my life, or at least my bed. This bed and the set it is a part of have been an embarrassment to me ever since I told my mother I would take them. Big and overwrought, they are the sort of thing that might work in the European mountain house of a histrionic soprano, but in a New York City apartment they are too much. I was pretty certain that if a guy got a look at my bedroom he would reassess my character and be gone, although a good male friend, with whom I discuss this, told me that is not the case.
"Doesn't matter," he says. "By the time the guy is into the bedroom, the deal is closed. He won't even notice."
"It also creaks when things heat up," I say. "I'm worried one day it will collapse."
"That he would notice," my friend says.
Off I go, then, to find a bed with dignity. Something solid, stylish and assured, befitting a person of my age and taste, a bed that says this woman will put up with none of your nonsense, do not even think of trying it, pal. It takes about a minute and a half to find. It is dark wood, with a linen and mahogany headboard, and lots of storage drawers. Catherine the Great and the Preobrazhensky Life Guards could spend the night on this bed and it wouldn't collapse. And in the morning you could say, "How'd ya sleep, fellas?" and they'd pound their Wheaties bowls on the table and holler, ("Wonderful bed!!")
I also need a new mattress. There are seasons of mattresses, I have come to realize, that correlate with one's stages of maturity. When you are 17 and sneaking into abandoned hotels in the Catskills with your boyfriend, and the mattresses smell of mold and are so skinny they can be rolled up, you do not care one bit. You are enchanted to be on a surface that does not include rocks. When you are 24 and have your first newspaper job, you become more selective; a mattress on the floor is a sign of a very immature guy and you quickly move on. For the next few decades, there is a mattress and a human nonintervention pact: you live side by side, like the United States and Canada, without giving each other much thought. Mattresses have as much identity as gym socks.
Then you hit 60, and you wake up stiff and get out of bed in increments, as if you had extra joints, channeling your grandmother: "Oy. Oy vey. Vey iz mir." You don't need one of those "French Women Don't Do Whatever It Is You Do, You Pathetic American Slob" books to know that this is not hot. Also, you cannot keep kidding yourself that your back aches because of the gym. Your back aches because you are in your 60s. It is serious mattress time.
I trot into a mattress store that is having a sale, searching for a brand I slept on in a friend's house, for which she paid about $1,000. The current model, with tax and delivery, will cost $1,647, which throws me, but O.K., inflation. I try it. It is soft and welcoming, perhaps too welcoming. I might soon be pulled under, like in the quicksand scene in "Lawrence of Arabia." The salesman, aware that he has a live one, steers me to a firmer model. I love it. It is a magnificent mattress. Perfect. The sale price, however, with tax comes to $2,486. This is more than I paid for my first car. Say you spilled something on it. It could be like the 2008 market crash. A major investment would be wiped out.
"It's very nice," I tell the salesman, "but way over what I was planning to spend."
"Let me see what I can do -- I can make a call," the salesman says, and "If there is one thing I never want to do, it is make anyone feel pressured."
Whether this comes before or after, "I work on commission," I do not recall. I do know I am not about to make a $2,400 decision in 20 minutes.
"I have to think about it," I say. "I'll be back."
"Everybody says that," the salesman says. "And only nine out of 10 do."
"Look," I say, "I'm a very straight shooter. If I say I will be back, I will be back."
Now you might argue, as any adult who has not had a table dropped on his or her head should, that a promise made to a salesman does not count and, moreover, the salesman knows it does not count. It's like when a guy with whom you have had no chemistry all evening says, "I'll call you," an acceptable social lie and much nicer than the guy adding, "When you are the last woman on earth and I have a gun to my head, and even then, when we sleep together, I'll be picturing someone else."
And rationally, in the upper crust of my brain, I do know this. But there is a voice inside me saying: "You made a promise, you have to keep your word." It is very aggravating. Shouldn't the smartness train have pulled into the station by now? And, of course, even as I am returning to the mattress store, where I do not want to go, to speak to this pushy salesman, I know the answer: This wisdom-of-age stuff is nonsense; certain things are in the hardwiring, you will do the same dumb things over and over. I go back to the store, but this serious mattress purchase is too much for me. I do not buy it.
Which is just as well, as I am having second thoughts about the bed as well. I am concerned that the drawers will make me feel as if I am sleeping on a bureau or worse, a child's bed. Also, with the headboard and the new dresser and the side table, the set will come to $3,800. And the painting contractor who carries the insurance my building demands gives me an estimate of $2,400 to paint a 13-by-15-foot bedroom. Not only that, but people are so worried about bedbugs in New York that I can't take the old mattress out of the building unless it wears something like a mattress condom. And trying to coordinate all the pickups and paint jobs and mattresses coming and going has given me a headache.
To hell with the new bedroom.
If someone comes along, we'll do it on the couch.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- New economic data from China on Thursday showed that the world's second-largest economy after the United States expanded at its slowest pace since 2009 during the third quarter of this year -- though surprisingly strong data for the month of September also showed that the deceleration may, for now at least, have come to an end.
The Chinese economy has been a major engine of global growth in recent years, as the American and European economies have struggled to overcome the global financial crisis.
The weak global environment has, however, weighed on China's export sector, slowing China's once red-hot economy. Government policies aimed at combating inflation and soaring property prices in 2010 and 2011 also have slowed growth.
Beijing released gross domestic product data for the July-September quarter on Thursday that confirmed what has been known for some time: that China's days of double-digit economic expansion had halted.
The economy expanded by 7.4 percent in the third quarter, compared with a year earlier -- in line with analysts' expectations. The figure, which was below the 7.6 percent growth reported in the second quarter, was the slowest pace of growth since early 2009, when the global economy was still reeling from the financial crisis.
Separate data for September, however, appeared to show that the slowdown has been bottoming out, and that an improvement may now be on the way.
Industrial output grew 9.2 percent, compared with a year earlier, and retail sales expanded 14.2 percent, the statistics office said.
Both figures beat expectations and improved on the expansions in August, showing that stimulus measures announced by Beijing over the last year have gradually put a floor under the deceleration.
Investment in fixed assets rose 20.5 percent in the first nine months this year, from the comparable period in 2011, slightly better than analysts had expected.
"The data is mostly above consensus and confirms that growth is picking up and that China is not at risk of hard landing," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, an analyst at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, in a note to clients. "Clearly, concerns over continued slowdown can now be put to rest."
The Chinese authorities have loosened lending constraints for banks in a bid to encourage more loans and stepped up infrastructure project approvals. Two small interest rate cuts by the Bank of China in June and July also aimed to bolster growth.
This mild stimulus approach has contrasted with Beijing's approach in late 2008, when a large stimulus program of 4 trillion renminbi (about $635 billion) was announced in response to mass layoffs and collapsing exports. This time around, analysts say, the jobs market so far has not deteriorated sharply. At the same time, policy makers in Beijing are seeking to avoid reigniting an investment binge and property-price spike of the sort that occurred in 2009-10.
Still, even the more muted stimulus measures that Beijing has been feeding into the economy appears to be bearing fruit.
Thursday's data, Mr. Kowalczyk said, "means there is no room, or need, for any further major stimulus," such as another cut in interest rates.
At the same time, data released on Saturday showed that export demand has started to pick up.
China's exports rose 9.9 percent in September, compared with a year earlier, much more rapidly than analysts had expected, as shipments to the United States and Southeast Asia improved.
Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, wrote in an e-mailed commentary that the September data released Thursday sent "very positive signals" and helped "reinforce our view that growth will rebound visibly" in the fourth quarter of 2012.

China's Currency Policy, an Irritant to U.S., Provides Debate Fodder

Abstract: "Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low -- and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace." The central bank paid for those huge purchases, mostly of dollars, partly by issuing more renminbi and partly by forcing the country's state-controlled commercial banks to hand over a fifth of their renminbi deposits at near-zero interest rates.

Full text:   HONG KONG -- Is China a currency manipulator?
Some of the more complicated exchanges during the presidential debate on Tuesday involved how to deal with China's efforts to increase its exports by keeping its currency at artificially low levels, an issue that has had considerable effects over the years on competitiveness, trade deficits and, some economists contend, American jobs.
Both candidates on Wednesday repeated the arguments they had voiced on the campaign trail. Mitt Romney criticized President Obama for not doing more to persuade China to stop intervening in currency markets. Mr. Obama said he was tougher toward Beijing than Mr. Romney would be if he were in the White House.
The two arguments obscure a more nuanced reality: adjusted for inflation, China's currency has strengthened considerably through much of Mr. Obama's tenure.
Some economists who used to be critical of China for undervaluing its currency, the renminbi, are now much less so. "Romney's vow to label China a currency manipulator is a position that is not supported by recent economic data," said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell professor who specializes in Chinese currency and trade policies.
But for all the improvement, those gains have recently stopped or started to erode. At the same time, Chinese exports to the United States are strengthening again, rising 5.5 percent in September from a year ago. That partly reflects increased demand as the American economy begins to show signs of recovery.
Mr. Romney was caustic in accusing China of unfair policies.
"One of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency," he said. "Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low -- and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace."
Mr. Romney promised that if elected he would immediately name China a "currency manipulator," a designation that would mandate further negotiations with Beijing. It could lead to American retaliation if Congress passes legislation authorizing special tariffs for countries deemed to manipulate.
Mr. Romney was cautious, though, in threatening to actually impose tariffs on Chinese shipments to the United States, saying he would do so "if necessary."
"On Day 1, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as president to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers," he said.
Mr. Obama responded that the renminbi had strengthened 11 percent during his term of office. The value of one renminbi has actually risen 8.5 percent, to 15.9 cents, since he was sworn in.
But administration officials have tended to follow the practice of many economists in adjusting exchange rates based on the differences in inflation at the consumer level in two countries. Consumer prices have risen a little more than two percentage points more in China than in the United States since January 2009, according to official data, so the inflation-adjusted appreciation has totaled about 11 percent. Most of that took place in late 2010 and last year.
Economists say official data understates inflation in China much more than in the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing has acknowledged that there are shortcomings in the way it calculates inflation and said it had begun to fix them. So the actual inflation-adjusted appreciation of the renminbi may have been even greater over the last several years.
That trend appears to be changing. As China's economy has slowed over the last year, partly in response to its stronger currency, the pressure on prices has begun to ease. Exporters interviewed at the Canton Fair on Monday in Guangzhou, China, were unconcerned about inflation for the first time in years.
"Raw material prices are flat," said Bob Wang, the sales manager at the Kralle Tools Company, a manufacturer in Wenzhou, in eastern China, that makes circular saw blades for lumber mills.
Through 2009 and the first half of 2010, China spent heavily to block the renminbi from rising against the dollar. China seemed to have the world's healthiest economy during the global financial crisis that erupted in 2008. Its currency would have surged had it not intervened.
As it was, the central bank's foreign exchange reserves swelled by $540 billion in just 18 months. The central bank paid for those huge purchases, mostly of dollars, partly by issuing more renminbi and partly by forcing the country's state-controlled commercial banks to hand over a fifth of their renminbi deposits at near-zero interest rates.
The central bank compensated the commercial banks by ordering all of them to pay very low interest rates -- only half the rate of inflation -- to their depositors.
Obama administration officials warned at the time that China was risking inflation by issuing so much more money. China's broadly measured money supply ended up growing 55 percent in 2009 and 2010, much more than that of the United States.
Inflation in consumer prices soon accelerated to reach 6.5 percent in July last year -- nearly twice the American level, even before allowing for of China's tendency to understate inflation. Partly to brake inflation, by making imports cheaper, the Chinese authorities allowed the renminbi to start rising in the summer of 2010 after a two-year hiatus.
The combination of higher prices and a strengthening currency erased much of the undervaluation that institutions like the International Monetary Fund perceived early in the global financial crisis. The I.M.F. responded three months ago by reclassifying the renminbi to "moderately undervalued" from "substantially undervalued."
Chinese inflation has now largely disappeared because of strict controls on bank lending and a slump in the real estate market. Consumer prices are now rising at about the same pace in China as in the United States, while wholesale prices are dropping much faster in China than in the United States.
The daily fixing of the renminbi's value by the Chinese central bank is now almost exactly where it started the year, as the Chinese government has tolerated only small movements up and down this year. But there is little evidence the central bank is intervening on a large scale to suppress the value of the renminbi. It might even be acting to prevent it from going lower to avoid a political reaction in the United States.
Foreign reserves are essentially unchanged this year. The renminbi has been under downward pressure because Chinese businesses and households have been moving more money out of the country to diversify their investments and hedge against the possibility of political change at home; this has offset the tide of dollars still sweeping in from the persistent trade surpluses.
Chinese exporters have taken heart as the currency has stabilized and inflation has rapidly disappeared -- although wages are still rising at a double-digit percentage pace. Vicky Leung, the sales director at the Xiangli Home Appliance Manufacturing Company, which makes electric fans in Shunde, in southeastern China, is one who is relieved.
"The dollar is good for us," she said.

Full text:   In campaign stops across college campuses, and again in the debate on Tuesday, President Obama has promoted his efforts to make college more affordable. His record, more activist than any recent predecessor's, includes greatly expanding the federal government's role in granting college loans, increasing aid to community colleges, and even taking steps to try to stem soaring tuition.
Though none of the questions in the presidential debate were on college affordability, Mr. Obama pivoted to that topic on his own. In answering a question about gender equity, he said, "We've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people, including millions of young women."
But while many education experts laud his efforts, analysts of varying political stripes have also questioned how much impact some of the president's policies will have, noting that the prices charged by colleges, and student borrowing, continue to climb.
"I think the president deserves a lot of credit for putting emphasis on things that weren't being talked about much -- raising educational attainment, expanding community college, cost containment," said Derek Bok, the former Harvard president who has written extensively on the problems and future of higher education. "But I think the jury's out on whether it's effective."
Some conservatives have pushed that critique further, saying that Mr. Obama's policies are too costly, often assist the wrong people and could have the paradoxical effect of driving up college costs. The dispute turns not just on different assessments of how policies play out, but on differing philosophical views about the role of government. During his time in office, Mr. Obama has sharply increased aid to low- and middle-income students, notably through the Pell Grant program, which grew from $14.6 billion given to 6 million students in 2008, to nearly $40 billion for almost 10 million students this year. His administration also made it easier to request aid, shortening the complex federal application and allowing people to transfer their financial information electronically from the Internal Revenue Service database.
"On the area of assisting students to gain a college opportunity, President Obama has exerted the most impressive leadership of any president in my memory," said Molly Corbett Broad, president of the American Council on Education, an association of college and university presidents.
But conservative critics of the Pell Grant program contend that as government pours more money into higher education -- whether in grants or loans -- the law of supply and demand dictates that it contributes to price increases.
"Could the colleges charge what they're charging now in the absence of federal aid?" asked Neal McCluskey, an education analyst at the Cato Institute, a conservative policy research group. "The answer is no."
Mitt Romney has also called the aid expansion unsustainable, and his campaign's education plan says he would "refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most." His stance was widely interpreted as meaning that he would cut the program, primarily by making fewer students eligible -- the same approach that his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, took in his proposed budget.
Yet in the presidential debates, Mr. Romney seems to have shifted his position. In the first debate on Oct. 3, he said, "I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college." He went further in the debate Tuesday, promoting a state aid program he created as governor of Massachusetts, saying, "I want to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing."
College costs have risen dramatically. In the last school year, tuition, fees, room and board averaged $38,589 at private colleges, up almost $15,000 from a decade earlier, according to the College Board. At public four-year colleges, the total bill came to $17,131, up more than $8,000.
But behind the headlines about soaring costs, the reality is more complex and wildly uneven, because a growing number of students receive financial aid, and only relatively high-income families pay those fast-rising sticker prices. Adjusted for inflation, the College Board calculates, the average "net price" changed little over the last decade at private schools, and rose only modestly at public ones.
Defending federal spending, Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, said that for more than 30 years, college prices had risen even when federal aid had not, leading him to believe there was "zero correlation." And he noted that the big increases under Mr. Obama had come at a time of declining state support for public colleges.
Conservatives have criticized Mr. Obama's other college affordability programs.
Mr. Obama removed banks as middlemen in making federal student loans, saving billions of dollars a year in lender fees, some of which was used to pay for increased student aid. Mr. Romney has said he would replace that policy with a marketplace approach. The president also strengthened programs that limit the size of student loan payments, based on a debtor's income, and forgive unpaid loans for some borrowers after 10 or 20 years. So far, few borrowers have taken advantage of such options, and Mr. Obama has directed the Department of Education to publicize them more aggressively.
Scott Fleming, an education policy adviser to Mr. Romney, said those changes would cost the government billions of dollars by increasing unpaid loans. Shrinking monthly payments means extending the life of a loan, he noted, so some borrowers could end up paying much more.
The administration repeatedly makes the case that more people need to go to college -- or back to college -- and that much of that education should take place at community colleges. Mr. Obama has sought $10 billion in new aid for community colleges over several years, much of it to teach job skills; so far, Congress has approved $2 billion.
Experts from across the political spectrum say expanding college enrollment is not enough, that both quality and price must be addressed. Mr. Obama has taken steps to curb rising prices and link federal assistance to performance.
"We're not just investing in the status quo; we're investing in reform," Mr. Duncan said.
Experts say those attempts are limited, and may not work, but they go well beyond what other presidents have done.
"The idea that the government has put colleges on notice not to just expect a blank check is a huge change," said Kevin Carey, director of education policy at the New America Foundation.
But Mr. McCluskey, the Cato analyst, said Mr. Obama misses the system's fundamental flaw: that federal aid and loans are often awarded to mediocre students and schools, with poor odds of producing economically successful graduates.
The president wants to tie some aid to colleges' efforts to keep prices in check, and he has called for a contest among states to win $1 billion in grants for the best cost-control ideas; both proposals would require Congressional approval. This summer, his administration released a "shopping sheet," a form allowing students to make apples-to-apples price comparisons among colleges. About 400 schools have pledged to use it.
The administration also imposed what is known as the gainful employment rule, mandating that schools, mainly aimed at for-profit colleges, meet benchmarks for graduation rates, student employment and debt, or risk losing access to federal loans and aid. The rule was struck down in court this year, but the administration is planning a new version.
"Obama has done big things on higher education that just haven't gotten a lot of attention," Mr. Carey said. "He's taken on issues that had been largely neglected."

Full text:   BETWEEN now and the end of the year, investors who are paying even the slightest bit of attention to the news will hear the term "fiscal cliff" repeated so often that it will surely either strike fear into their hearts or numb them to possible risks ahead.
For some, it may sound like the warning they wished they had received ahead of the 2008 crash, or a signal that it is time to retrench. For others who have their money in cash or bonds, the chatter may confirm their worst fears about living in an uncertain time and persuade them to wait longer to invest in stocks. It should do neither.
The phrase itself refers to a confluence of tax increases and spending cuts that will happen automatically on Jan. 1, 2013, if Congress and the president do not come to an agreement to avert them. Think of skid marks ahead of a precipice.
If the government does not hit the brakes and all the provisions that make up the fiscal cliff come to pass, however, the impact on gross domestic product will be to reduce it 4 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center made the impact more personal: 90 percent of Americans will see their taxes rise, with an average increase of $3,500. The United States economy will slide back into recession.
As if this were not scary enough, the news from other major economies is not encouraging. China appears to be slowing down
just as its leaders are distracted by the once-a-decade leadership change. While events in Europe are not making headlines as they did last year, the debt situation there is not vastly improved. And don't forget the numerous flash points of the Middle East and the peril they could pose to global energy markets.
What should investors do? Neeti Bhalla, head of the tactical asset allocation team at Goldman Sachs, said they needed to learn to live with uncertainty for quite some time. "We won't have an answer to the fiscal situation after the election," Ms. Bhalla said. "We won't have an answer to the European crisis after they come up with some fiscal union. We won't have an answer to China after they transfer power. The issues everyone is concerned about don't have a finite end to them."
That's the bad news. The good news is no analyst interviewed for this article thought the government would drive over the fiscal cliff, since many of the expiring provisions have bipartisan support.
"Our belief is Congress is going to punt," said Thorne Perkin, a managing director at Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management, which advises very wealthy investors. "They will turn the fiscal cliff into a fiscal hill and do some form of compromise people can live with. I don't think anyone wants to go through the full shock."
But even a hill implies some pain to an economy that is not experiencing strong growth now. "You might not get compromise on capital gains rates going from 15 to 20 percent, but Lockheed Martin's stock price does not reflect $500 billion in defense cuts over the next 10 years," said Rex Macey, chief investment officer of Wilmington Trust, referring to mandatory defense budget cuts in the worst case. "We're not ones to believe it makes sense to panic at this point."
However sober that view is, Mr. Macey said he still had days when he was concerned that lawmakers seemed ambivalent about addressing the tax and spending issues at hand. "I feel like I'm in this bus heading over the fiscal cliff, and I'm looking at everyone and I'm nervous but no one else is," he said. "I know they see the cliff because everyone's pointing at the cliff."
This is one of those times when fretting about all of these bad things may be useless: average investors cannot control them. That still leaves the question of what to do with their money.
There are two complementary schools of thought on getting through the turmoil of the next six months. Both involve restraint and planning. The first requires investors to return to their plan.
What advisers are asking is not that investors necessarily take big risks in the face of the fiscal cliff -- after all, really bad economic things could still come to pass at the beginning of 2013. But they are asking that they return to a normal asset allocation and get back to being broadly diversified.
This sounds simple. But it may not be for investors who have been putting their money in cash, whose value is eroded by inflation, and low-yielding United States Treasury bonds.
"The people we are advising have been overallocated to asset classes that they consider to be safe and conservative -- cash and fixed income," said John Taft, head of RBC Wealth Management in the United States. "Cash has the certainty that your purchasing power will be eroded by the rate of inflation. Bonds have the risk that when and if monetary policy tightens, rates will go up and they'll be exposed to principal loss."
Bond interest rates move in the opposite direction of bond prices, so a one percentage point increase in rates on new bonds would result in about a 15 percent loss in the price of a previously issued bond on the open market.
For those who are skittish, and want to cling to their cash and low-yielding bonds, G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, advises a mental accounting fudge. He has told clients to have enough money in cash to pay expenses for a period of years that makes them comfortable and put the rest into an investment plan meant to increase the value of the portfolio for years after that.
"If an investor has set aside three years of spending needs, she's bought three years of time horizon for the rest of the portfolio," he said.
He acknowledged that it was tough to tell people to put money into low- or negative-yielding assets, but he saw it as a trade-off.
"This is the price I have to pay for liquidity," he said. "It's a measure of comfort. You won't worry what the market does tomorrow."
Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Private Bank, has a more daring way of urging clients to return to diversification: adopt a hit-and-run strategy.
"It's like when you see a bully in the schoolyard -- you hit him and run away," Mr. Nerbrand said. He is telling clients now, "You sit with a very conservative portfolio and from time to time you add a bit of risk."
For those with more gumption, who think the fiscal cliff will lead to buying opportunities when falling asset values prompt sell-offs, recommendations vary.
One favorite is dividend-paying stocks, which may seem counterintuitive because the tax rate on dividends could increase to as high as 43.4 percent from the current 15 percent.
But Barbara Reinhard, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse Private Bank, sees two reasons to favor dividend stocks: First, the stocks themselves are inexpensive relative to their historical earnings, and second, companies that are paying and increasing dividends now are strong and often diversified, so they are best positioned to weather any volatility over the next few months.
Ms. Reinhard said that all else being equal, an increase in the dividend and capital gains rate to 20 percent would be preferable to having capital gains taxed at 20 percent and dividends taxed as income, which could go as high as 43.4 percent for the highest earners.
She and other analysts were not worried about the impact of an increase on most investors. Mr. Taft estimated that a third of dividend-paying stocks were owned by foreign investors and another third were owned in pension funds or retirement accounts that did not pay taxes.
For the other third, particularly those who depend on the dividend for income, the increased taxes will be a hit. "If you have a $40 stock and it's been paying you 85 cents after taxes, next year it will pay you 60 cents," Mr. Macey said. "That's a big difference. But we'll know early enough next year, maybe after one or two dividend payments, what's going to happen, so we'd rather wait."
On a less positive note, Keith Voight, a spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a lobbying group running a 'defend my dividend' campaign in warning of the fiscal cliff, said his group feared a domino effect in which higher earners sell their dividend-paying stocks, depressing the value for all owners.
But Rob Lutts, president and chief investment officer for Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass., said he was not worried about the long-term effects of a tax increase on capital gains or dividends. "We can adapt to that," he said. "The market could have some indigestion when we get there, but the valuations are so lopsided toward bonds that it supports equities going forward."
Still, he has moved 10 to 12 percent of his clients' money into gold and precious metals as a hedge against the effect on the dollar of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates low. "There is a cost to that support," Mr. Lutts said. "We are going to create a fairly high level of inflation down the road."
There are other hedging strategies for people worried about volatility. Harry Clark, chairman and chief executive of Clark Capital Management, which oversees $3 billion for smaller investors, said his firm had bought a combination of exchange-traded funds and notes to cap any loss for clients at about 10 percent. "We don't worry about a massive decline," he said. "But there are other ways to make a portfolio defensive, like buying companies in the materials, energy, consumer essentials and utilities spaces."
The thinking here is that if the worst happens, there are still some essential things, like soap and gas, that people will need to buy. "I think the biggest risk is in the bond market," Mr. Clark said. "That's the next disaster waiting to happen. They're going to drop like a rock when rates go up."
For those with the deepest risk appetite -- or deepest wallets -- the best strategy is one that allows them to look beyond all the noise the fiscal cliff will create. Real estate and private equity come to mind.
Mr. Perkin said he was putting together a group to invest in a unique way in the oil boom in North Dakota: lodging.
"Every oil company in the world is going gaga over the Bakken oil fields," he said. "The problem is there is zero infrastructure: terrible roads, no restaurants, nowhere to stay, the airport is awful, no hospitals or schools, nothing."
Despite all that, he said, he has a group of clients investing $60 million into a hotel project with another $40 million of investments planned.
"It's the kind of thing people are looking for -- infrastructure and a hard asset," he said. "It's like the California gold rush. Who made the most money on the gold rush? Levi Strauss. We're looking at the ancillary businesses that come out of the demand for oil."
This is not without risks beyond the lack of liquidity in the deal. If the price of oil drops below $60 a barrel, the demand for Bakken crude could slow, he said. But now, he said, clients like investments that appear uncorrelated with the market volatility the fiscal cliff could cause.
Still, for most investors, even those with many millions of dollars, the best strategy may be to take a similarly long view without as much risk.
"Most investors are best served by the following strategy, and I say this with 100 percent conviction," Mr. Taft said. "Sit down with yourself or your adviser and figure out what you're trying to accomplish over the rest of your life. Develop a plan with as few moving parts as possible and then stick to that plan."
"Individual investors are notoriously bad about making tactical, short-term changes to their portfolios," he added. "That's basic advice, but it's the best advice there is."

Abstract: Running with this argument, Glenn Hubbard and Kevin Hassett, economic advisers to the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, have accused the administration of providing a misguided short-term fiscal stimulus that ultimately contributed to a long period of below-par growth. The Fed was nonetheless far more aggressive than the European Central Bank, quicker to drop interest rates to zero and pump money into the economy, buying government debt and other bonds.\n

Full text:   With financial markets careening around the world, in January 2009 a newly inaugurated President Obama acknowledged he had to fix the problem pretty fast. "If I don't have this done in three years," he told NBC's Matt Lauer, "then there's gonna be a one-term proposition."
Today, Republicans around the country are largely campaigning on the president's words. Conservative economists like Michael Bordo of Rutgers and John B. Taylor of Stanford have written columns for op-ed pages and blogs arguing that by the standard of previous American recessions, the economy should have rebounded much more strongly.
Running with this argument, Glenn Hubbard and Kevin Hassett, economic advisers to the Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, have accused the administration of providing a misguided short-term fiscal stimulus that ultimately contributed to a long period of below-par growth. And Mr. Romney has borrowed a tactic used by Ronald Reagan to defeat Jimmy Carter in 1980, using his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention to intone "this president cannot tell us that YOU are better off today than when he took office."
Whether you are better off today than in 2009 may not be the most useful question to ask about an economy emerging from its most severe downturn in 80 years. A more illuminating question is how we have done relative to other countries that were caught in the global financial cataclysm. By that standard, economic growth in the United States has done surprisingly well.
The president's early assessment of our economic troubles was wildly optimistic. By the administration's early forecast the economy would be growing by 4.6 percent this year. Instead, it is probably going to expand just over 2 percent this year and next. Economic production per person has not recovered to its level before the recession. Unemployment is still painfully high, at 7.8 percent. The share of the population with a job remains near its lowest in 30 years.
But glance across the Atlantic. The economy of the European Union will shrink by 0.2 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. It is smaller than it was five years ago, while the American economy is 2.9 percent bigger. Even Europe's most competitive countries are slipping. The Dutch economy is shrinking. Germany and Austria are expected to grow at half the rate of the United States this year and next.
Some will argue that Europe makes for an easy comparison. The European Central Bank held the economy back for many months by refusing to slash interest rates aggressively or pump money into the economy. Germany's insistence that indebted Mediterranean countries cut government spending deepened recessions in those nations. And some other developed countries are growing faster than the United States: Canada, which didn't have a banking crisis to begin with; Australia, a big exporter of raw materials that benefited greatly from China's growth; the oil exporter Norway.
Yet the United States has recovered more quickly than other countries that don't use the euro -- including Japan, New Zealand, Denmark and Britain. The performance is all the more remarkable considering that the financial crisis that sent much of the world into recession was set off by American homeowners defaulting on their mortgages, taking down a big chunk of the nation's banking sector.
The one crucial area in which the United States has performed worse than its peers is in jobs. Joblessness is at record highs in countries like Spain and Greece. But many European countries have done a much better job of protecting employment than the United States. In Austria, Germany and Belgium, the governments paid companies to put workers on short-time work rather than lay them off. Sweden also has a longstanding wage subsidy.
Alongside stronger unions and stiffer employment regulations that make it tougher to fire workers, these countries managed to prevent soaring unemployment. Total employment in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, France and even Italy has recovered more since the financial crisis than it has in the United States. Though the United States has grown faster than France since 2007, the unemployment rate has risen higher here.
Yet the president's critics are not suggesting the government should have subsidized wages or financed more public works. Rather, they have championed the type of budget-cutting policies that have played such a large role in thwarting economic growth in Europe.
Federal Reserve officials today concede they were too slow to respond to the crisis. The Fed was nonetheless far more aggressive than the European Central Bank, quicker to drop interest rates to zero and pump money into the economy, buying government debt and other bonds. Fiscal stimulus -- an initial $800 billion package in 2009 followed by about $600 billion in payroll tax cuts and other efforts -- was bigger and more sustained than in other advanced countries. Banks in the United States were forced to raise billions in new capital, which allowed them to cope with the turbulent financial markets better than their European peers.
Every step was an uphill battle. The Republicans who took control of the House of Representatives in 2010 argued that fiscal stimulus was wasted and counterproductive, and pressed for German-style austerity. During the Republican primaries, the Texas governor, Rick Perry, accused the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, of treason for debasing the currency by printing money to buy debt.
Today, most economists say they believe that these policies provided vital support to the economy. In its most recent World Economic Outlook, published this month, the I.M.F. acknowledged that the fiscal stimulus was probably much more effective at bolstering growth than it had previously allowed.
So where does this leave President Obama's record? The Harvard economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, whose 2009 book "This Time Is Different" is the most comprehensive study of financial crises and their aftermath, contend that the comparison by Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Bordo and others is flawed. It mixes relatively mild recessions with deep financial crises that blew up the banking system. Recovering from the latter, they say, is painfully slow and difficult.
By Ms. Reinhart's and Mr. Rogoff's accounting, the Obama administration's record on economic growth is pretty good: "If one really wants to focus just on United States systemic financial crises, then the recent recovery looks positively brisk," they conclude. Among countries that suffered as deep a financial crisis as we did since 2008 -- from Greece and Iceland to Germany and Britain -- "the United States' output performance is, in fact, among the best." Even the American jobs market looks brighter when compared with other big financial crises in history.
Charles Dumas, chairman of the economic consulting firm Lombard Street Research in London, sees an American economy poised to rebound in the next presidential term. Household debt has fallen from its peak, and rock-bottom interest rates mean homeowners are spending only 14 percent of their disposable income on debt payments, the lowest level since 1992. The budget deficit is already down to 8.7 percent of economic output, from 13.3 percent in 2009. Even China is less of a problem, as high inflation has mostly eliminated its currency undervaluation.
According to most polls, President Obama is still the favorite to lead the country through such a rebound. If he loses in November, it won't be because he provided too much fiscal stimulus. It will more likely be because on arguably the most important economic variable for American voters, jobs, he didn't try hard enough.

Full text:   BRUSSELS -- The European Union toughened sanctions against Iran over its disputed nuclear program on Monday, banning trade in industries like finance, metals and natural gas, and making other business transactions far more cumbersome.
The measures were the latest in a long series of sanctions from Europe, the United States and the United Nations Security Council, and were evidence of the worsening damage to Iran's economy.
In a joint statement, European Union foreign ministers, meeting in Luxembourg, expressed "serious and deepening concerns over Iran's nuclear program." They added that in continuing to enrich uranium, despite Western concerns that it is aiming for a bomb, Iran was "acting in flagrant violation of its international obligations."
Ahead of the meeting, Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said: "We want to see a negotiated agreement. But we will continue to keep up the pressure."
Ms. Ashton represents six major powers, including the United States, in nuclear talks with the Iranians. There have been five rounds of discussions since late 2010, the last of which ended in frustration in June. Ms. Ashton said the major powers would keep in contact with Saeed Jalili, Iran's negotiator, to assess when to convene another meeting.
Iran is suffering acute inflation from the weakness of the rial, the national currency, which lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar in recent weeks. Outside economists have pointed to Iran's currency troubles as evidence that the sanctions, which have severely restricted Iran's ability to sell oil and conduct international banking transactions, are having a profound impact. Iran has been showing new signs of problems, including severe drops in monthly oil and automotive production and in the number of foreign commercial ships docking at its ports. How to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions has become an issue in the American presidential race.
The new European sanctions were necessary as a result of a "continued failure to satisfy the world that the program was for peaceful purposes," said William Hague, the British foreign secretary.
But Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, emphasized the need for a more intensive diplomatic effort alongside the sanctions.
"I think there are voices that sound like they want a war," Mr. Bildt said. "We don't want war."
The latest measures make business deals between Europe and Iran far more complicated. The European Union "agreed to prohibit all transactions between European and Iranian banks unless authorized in advance under strict conditions with exemptions for humanitarian needs," according to an official statement.
The statement said that the European Union also had "decided to strengthen the restrictive measures against the Central Bank of Iran. Further export restrictions have been imposed, notably for graphite, metals, software for industrial processes, as well as measures relating to the shipbuilding industry."
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has described the Western sanctions as economic warfare, said the latest measures were nothing new.
"Creating instability is among the arrogant powers' insidious policies," the semiofficial Fars News Agency quoted him as saying during a speech in Shirvan, in eastern Iran. He praised Iran's "exemplary political stability and tranquillity," adding: "The enemies wanted to make our people depressed and exhausted through their sanctions. Our nation's will and resolve to defend the ruling Islamic system should be a lesson to them."

Abstract: All in all, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney do see the future similarly -- over the next decade, they want government spending reduced to about 20 percent of the United States' gross domestic product, below the historic average of around 21 percent.

Full text:   MITT ROMNEY, moderate. That earnestly sought post-debate public image contrasts starkly with Mr. Romney's actual positions on many issues, especially the future trajectory of government spending.
Clinging tightly to a studied vagueness when pressed for unpopular specifics, Mr. Romney has put forward a budget framework that would not eviscerate Medicare and Social Security, as is commonly believed, but would slash everything else that's not defense.
President Obama should use Tuesday night's debate to press Mr. Romney to defend -- or even just explain -- these proposed cuts, which would be far more draconian than those advanced by his running mate, Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Ryan is widely viewed as the real fiscal hawk, but in key areas, his views on spending levels are actually closer to Mr. Obama's than to Mr. Romney's.
All in all, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney do see the future similarly -- over the next decade, they want government spending reduced to about 20 percent of the United States' gross domestic product, below the historic average of around 21 percent. (Recognizing that an aging society costs more, Mr. Obama proposes to hold spending at its current level, 23 percent.)
These differences may not sound like much, but by 2023, each percentage point of G.D.P. could represent about $250 billion in federal spending.
Though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought it up repeatedly in his debate with Mr. Ryan on Thursday, Social Security -- the single biggest government expenditure -- is not on the battlefield. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each backed away from threats to privatize or cut it and now propose to spend the same amount on it as Mr. Obama would in the coming decade.
That's not the case with Medicare. Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan have each endorsed similar packages of about $950 billion of savings over 10 years, while Mr. Romney has opposed any reduction, making it virtually impossible for him to achieve his overall spending limit.
To be sure, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan agree -- and differ with Mr. Obama -- on many matters, like how to contain the growth in Medicare spending and whether to raise the eligibility age.
And they part company from Mr. Obama when it comes to the Affordable Care Act (the Republicans demand its repeal, claiming it would save about $1.6 trillion) and Medicaid (Messrs. Romney and Ryan want it turned over to the states and want to cut nearly 20 percent from Mr. Obama's planned levels).
But with respect to nearly half the budget, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan widely diverge from each other.
Mr. Romney is calling for a huge increase in defense spending -- roughly $2 trillion more over the next decade than Mr. Ryan wants to spend, which is only $400 billion above Mr. Obama's budget -- even though the military is not asking for such an increase. Such an increase would force giant reductions, about 40 percent, in everything that's left.
"Everything else" isn't some catchall of small items, like feeding Big Bird. We're talking about a vast array of programs including civilian and military pensions, food stamps, unemployment and disability compensation, the earned income and child tax credits, family support and nutrition, K-12 education, transportation, public safety and disaster relief. And on and on.
All told, Mr. Romney would allocate $6.9 trillion for these items, compared with the $9.3 trillion proposed by his own running mate (and Mr. Obama's $12 trillion, which itself represents a 9 percent reduction from current levels, after adjusting for inflation).
No doubt some of what is buried within "other mandatory and nondefense discretionary spending" can be eliminated. Perhaps Americans won't miss a few national parks or the space program.
But also nestled within this category are critical outlays for investments in infrastructure and research.
Eating the seed corn is never advisable, yet that's what Washington is already doing. The share of spending on infrastructure (roads, airports, dams and the like) fell from 2 percent of G.D.P. in 1971 to 1 percent in 2010.
More -- not less -- government money needs to be invested in these kinds of growth-generating projects (not to mention education and training).
I recognize that in the real world, cuts on the scale envisioned by Mr. Romney will prove politically untenable, which would force a President Romney to rethink his agenda.
But as a statement of intent, it's Mr. Romney -- not Mr. Ryan -- who has produced the budget that would more dramatically reduce the services offered by government, and in ways that would shock and outrage most Americans. We can only hope that Mr. Obama will draw those contrasts clearly in the debate.

Bernanke Says the Fed's Latest Monetary Policy Could Benefit the Global Economy

Full text:   TOKYO (Reuters) -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, defended the central bank's monetary policy on Sunday from claims that it was hurting the economies of emerging countries.
Mr. Bernanke has often defended Fed actions against domestic critics, who argue the policy of keeping interest rates near zero while ramping up asset purchases hurts savers and risks future inflation.
But in a speech here, he addressed critics abroad by saying that stronger growth in the United States bolsters global prospects as well, countering the likes of Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, who has labeled the Fed's latest stimulus effort "selfish."
Critics say the Fed's unorthodox policies weaken the dollar and bolster the currencies of developing countries, hurting their ability to export.
"It is not at all clear that accommodative policies in advanced economies impose net costs on emerging market economies," Mr. Bernanke said at an event sponsored by the Bank of Japan and the International Monetary Fund.
The Fed last month announced a program of open-ended bond purchases that will be continued until there is substantial improvement in labor market conditions, barring a sustained and unexpected spike in inflation. To start off, the central bank will buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month.
"This policy not only helps strengthen the U.S. economic recovery, but by boosting U.S. spending and growth, it has the effect of helping support the global economy as well," Mr. Bernanke said.
In 2010, when the Fed started its second round of monetary policy stimulus, known as quantitative easing, many finance ministers accused the United States of pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy. Criticism of the current round of bond purchases has been more muted, but nonetheless evident.
Mr. Mantega told the 188 member countries of the monetary fund here on Friday that the policy was selfish and harming emerging markets by stealing their share of exports and by spurring destabilizing capital flows and currency movements.
"Advanced countries cannot count on exporting their way out of the crisis at the expense of emerging market economies," he told the fund's governing panel. "Brazil, for one, will take whatever measures it deems necessary to avoid the detrimental effects of these spillovers."
In opening remarks at the conference that Mr. Bernanke addressed on Sunday, the head of the monetary fund, Christine Lagarde, said steps by the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were "big policy actions in the right direction."
But she took note of the distress those policies were causing elsewhere and called for central banks to step up their dialogue and cooperation.
Critics of the Fed's policy, both foreign and domestic, contend that it is likely to do little to help the American economy, while risking unwanted inflation.
Central banks "should consider draining excessive liquidity injected into the market and eliminate inflationary pressure in the long-term," the governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou Xiaochuan, was quoted as saying by the official state news agency Xinhua.
Russia is also concerned.
"For now, this excess liquidity is not contributing to inflation, but it could happen at some point," the Russian finance minister, Anton Siluanov, told reporters here.
While Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that bond buying was "no panacea," he argued that the open-ended nature of the latest round should make people feel more certain that American economic growth would pick up.

Full text:   AUDI says the introduction of a new Allroad wagon for the American market, after an eight-year absence, signifies the "return of the icon."
When the original model was withdrawn from the United States after the 2005 model year, it seemed less like an icon than a sales disappointment -- some 26,000 were sold over four years, well below initial estimates. But Audi now considers the first Allroad "quite the success, for its day, for not being an S.U.V.," a company spokesman, Mark Dahncke, said last week.
Audi wagons are quite popular in Europe, and the Allroad continued to sell well there even after it became an orphan over here. Surviving Allroads still have a devoted following in the United States, selling even now at five-figure prices.
The original car's $40,000 sticker price seemed steep in the early 2000s, and that is surely one reason it didn't sell better. The handsome new Allroad is still around $40,000 -- $39,600 and a $875 delivery fee, to be exact. At a glance, given the inflation in German luxury cars of late, such a price seems more palatable than it did a decade ago. But unlike its predecessor, which came pretty well equipped in basic trim, the new Allroad's window sticker can easily zoom higher. The top-line Prestige trim package adds $9,200 by itself, and Audi offers many, many more options.
But one deal-making feature is not available, even as an option: a height-adjustable pneumatic suspension that raised the original model 2.6 inches for additional ground clearance when off-roading or storming through snow drifts. The air suspension is one of the features that made the Allroad more than a station wagon.
So the new Allroad's ground clearance is a rather modest 7.1 inches, just 1.5 inches more than the A4 Avant wagon it replaces. For comparison's sake, a Subaru Outback offers 8.7 inches. The Allroad does have a stainless steel skid plate, ostensibly to protect the underside from rocks, underbrush and other debris, but it seems more ornamental than utilitarian.
Most measurements are either the same, or about a half-inch greater, than the A4 Avant's. The dimensions are also similar to the 2001-5 Allroad, even though that wagon was based on the A6 of the time. Put simply, the A4 has a larger footprint now, as does the A6.
The Allroad offers the same 50 cubic feet of cargo capacity, with the rear seat folded, as the outgoing A4 Avant, but Audi says the space is more usable. The interior is thoroughly updated and quite plush; standard leather seating is an advantage over rivals like the Volvo XC70 or the BMW 328i xDrive Sports Wagon.
The Allroad shares the A4 Avant's 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, which makes 211 horsepower and 256 pound-feet of peak torque. Mileage is rated 20 m.p.g. in the city and 27 on the highway on premium fuel (compared with 21/29 for the outgoing Avant). Audi says the Allroad will accelerate from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a sprightly 6.6 seconds.
On the road, the Allroad's ride height, extra weight and big 18-inch wheels and tires make it handle more like an S.U.V. and less like an Audi sedan. And while the ride is as butter-smooth as the Avant's, the Allroad can tackle a broader spectrum of light-duty driving challenges.
Still, it's no off-roader.
Most disappointingly, despite the capable quattro all-wheel-drive system, the Allroad is no longer equipped to scramble up rocky hillsides or bound through deeply rutted trails, or pull itself out of mud-bog gumbo like the original model. Audi does not even list performance measures like the towing capacity or the approach and departure angles -- matters of interest to off-roaders -- for the Allroad.
For more diabolical on- and off-road conditions, the far less expensive Outback may be a more capable choice.
When merely crunching numbers, there is a temptation to dismiss the Allroad as little more than an A4 Avant with skid plates, plastic cladding on the wheel arches and a $3,000 price bump.
But beyond the specifications, on a purely subjective basis, the well-proportioned, generally pleasing Allroad falls somewhere between the Avant station wagon and Audi's quite capable, less expensive Q5 sport utility. In that regard, it fills a niche in the lineup rather handsomely.

Full text:   Andrew F. Brimmer, a Louisiana sharecropper's son who was the first black member of the Federal Reserve Board and who led efforts to to reverse the country's balance-of-payments deficit, died on Sunday in Washington. He was 86.
His death, after a long illness, was confirmed by his daughter, Esther Brimmer.
Dr. Brimmer, an economist, held a number of high-ranking posts in Washington and taught at Harvard, but the economic conditions of poor, powerless, uneducated blacks was an abiding concern. He spoke about what he called the "schism" between blacks who were educated and had marketable skills and those who did not. In later years he spoke frequently about how government policies no longer supported programs to help blacks enter the economic mainstream.
Dr. Brimmer was the assistant secretary of commerce for economic affairs when President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to the Fed board in 1966.
At the time, the Federal Reserve was bitterly divided over monetary policy. The chairman, William McChesney Martin Jr., threatened to resign if Mr. Johnson appointed a liberal who would vote in favor of lower interest rates.
At Dr. Brimmer's swearing-in ceremony, the president said he did not expect Dr. Brimmer to be "an easy money man or a tight money man." Rather, Mr. Johnson said, "I expect him to be a right money man."
The Wall Street Journal expressed skepticism, with a front-page article headlined "Desire to Aid Negroes Could Make New 'Fed' Member More Liberal." It quoted an anonymous source saying that the appointment was yet another example of Mr. Johnson's political foxiness. "The president has Martin in a box," the source told The Journal. "If Martin resigned now, it would look like it was because he didn't want a Negro on the board."
Early in his tenure, Dr. Brimmer followed the lead of Mr. Martin and other "tight money" board members by supporting a gradual increase in interest rates to fight inflation. But when Congress raised taxes in 1968 and cut spending to cut inflation, he was one of the first Fed governors to call for lowering rates.
At the Commerce Department, Dr. Brimmer's primary responsibility was to reverse the country's balance-of-payments deficit. He spent a good deal of time persuading American businesses to voluntarily slow their use of dollars in foreign investments. He also encouraged foreign companies to use their own currency to make investments in the United States.
In a speech in December 1965, he reported that his efforts had resulted in a drop in direct American investments overseas, to $515 million in the third quarter of that year from $1.12 billion in the first quarter.
That work built on his interest in foreign affairs, which started when he went to India with the Fulbright Program and wrote papers on the Indian economy.
As a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the late 1950s, he was part of a team that visited Sudan to explore the feasibility of a central bank there. He later wrote an article on banking and finance in Sudan for The South African Journal of Economics. He became known as the international monetary policy expert on the Federal Reserve Board.
Dr. Brimmer served a little more than eight years of his 14-year term, leaving the board in 1974 to join the faculty of the Harvard Business School and start a consulting firm, Brimmer & Company. His academic career also included study in India at the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Bombay.
In 1995, he was chosen to head a five-member financial control board to help the District of Columbia deal with a financial crisis. He stepped down after a contentious three years in the job.
Andrew Felton Brimmer Jr. was born on Sept. 13, 1926, in Newellton, La. After graduating from high school he went to Washington State, where one of his sisters lived. He joined the Army near the end of World War II and attained the rank of staff sergeant, remaining in the United States.
Besides his daughter, who is the assistant secretary for international organization affairs at the State Department, he is survived by his wife, Doris Scott Brimmer.
Dr. Brimmer attended the University of Washington in Seattle on the G.I. Bill of Rights, earning an undergraduate degree in economics in 1950 and a master's degree the next year.
He then went to India before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, where he earned a doctorate. In 1965, Dr. Brimmer was part of a federal delegation sent to Los Angeles after rioting in the Watts neighborhood left 34 people dead and tens of millions of dollars in property damage. He commissioned a Census Bureau study that found that the purchasing power of the average family in Watts had declined by $400 in the five years before the riots while incomes had risen in the rest of America.
"I do feel that the economic plight of blacks is a serious matter," he told The New York Times in 1973. "So I bring the same economist's tool kit to that subject as other economists bring to examine other national economic problems."
