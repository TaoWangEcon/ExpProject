Full text: WASHINGTON
The classic way for lobbyists to defend their client's interest is to insist that they are not actually defending their client's interest. Really, they say, they are just looking out for ordinary Americans.
Tobacco lobbyists spent years fighting regulation by claiming to be defending individual freedom, not the profits of tobacco companies. Detroit's lobbyists did much the same to push back against seat belt and pollution laws. Wall Street has spent months opposing the financial regulation bill in the name of families and small businesses.
The latest example comes from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the rest of the soda industry, which is trying to defeat a soda tax now before the District of Columbia Council. The industry has succeeded recently in beating back similar taxes in New Yorkand Philadelphia, and in keeping one out of the federal health overhaul bill. But the Washington Council seems to be seriously considering a penny-per-ounce tax on nondiet sodas, energy drinks and artificial juices. Council members are set to vote on the issue next week.
This soda debate is probably going to be around for some time. Cities and counties, desperate to find money to pay for schools and roads, are starting to see a soda tax as a way to raise revenue. The tax also appears to be one of the most promising ways to attack obesity, given the huge role sugary drinks play in the epidemic.
"It's wrong for the government to stand idle in the face of an epidemic of obesity that's hurting the quality of life and the health of our residents," says Mary Cheh, the Council member who has proposed the tax, "when we have policy choices in front of us that can materially affect the problem."
The soda industry, of course, is fighting back with newspaper and radio advertisements, among other things. It says a tax would most hurt "hard-working, low- and middle-income families, elderly residents and those living on fixed incomes" and would destroy jobs. Ellen Valentino, an industry official, recently told The Washington Post that companies would spend "whatever it takes" to make their case.

The argument for a soda tax is the same as the argument for a tax on tobacco, pollution or, for that matter, banks that take big, expensive risks. When an activity imposes costs on society, economists have long said that the activity should be taxed. Doing so accomplishes two goals: it discourages the activity, and it raises money to help pay society's costs.
In the case of soda, those costs come in the form of medical bills for diabetes, heart disease and other side effects of obesity. We're all paying these bills, via Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance premiums. Obesity has become a significant cause of our swelling long-term budget deficit.
And soda is a huge reason the country is so much more obese. The typical American consumes almost three times as many calories from sugary drinks as in the late 1970s. This increase accounts for about half the total per-capita rise in calorie consumption over the same period. Remember, many of these drinks have zero nutritional benefit -- unlike meat, cheese or juice.
As Kelly Brownell, a Yale researcher, says, the link between obesity and soda is scientifically stronger than the link between obesity and any other type of food or beverage.
We're drinking more soda for several reasons. Above all, the inflation-adjusted price has fallen 34 percent since the late 1970s, largely because it can be manufactured more cheaply than in the past. Meanwhile, the average real cost of fruits and vegetables has risen more than 30 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Coincidentally, Ms. Cheh's proposed tax would roughly reverse the drop in the price of soda over the last three decades, at least for the popular 12-pack of cans. An extra penny per ounce on a 12-pack would add $1.44 -- or about 30 percent -- to the current typical $4.75 price. (The tax rate would be lower for single-serve bottles and higher for bulk purchases.)
Most of the revenue would then be used to improve the miserable quality of many school lunches in Washington. One blog, Better D.C. School Food, has taken to documenting these lunches, with a series of photographs of bland bread, processed cheese and reconstituted beef.
So what about Coke's and Pepsi's arguments against the tax?
They are certainly right that less soda consumption could cost the soda industry some jobs. But it would eliminate jobs from the overall economy only if people put the money they had been spending on soda into their savings accounts. That's highly unlikely. Instead, people will probably spend more on other food and drinks or, say, go to the movies more often -- and create jobs in those industries.
The argument that the tax will hurt the poor is a little more serious. The average American now drinks almost a gallon of sweetened beverages each week. If the tax passes, any Washington resident who continued to do so would have to pay about $1.20 each week in soda taxes.
Yet even that number overstates the cost, because the tax would surely affect how much soda many people drank. One of the lessons of the recent rise in cigarette taxes is that big price changes can lead to big behavior changes, even with an addictive product like tobacco. Teenagers, the biggest soda drinkers of all, are especially price sensitive. People who cut their soda drinking from a gallon a week to merely three-quarters of a gallon -- that's still 96 ounces, more than twice the consumption level of the late 1970s -- would be spending no more on soda than they are now.
I suspect that some Washington Council members, in the face of opposition from the soda makers and distributors, may be tempted to support a weakened version of the tax. One option would simply be to extend the normal 6 percent sales tax to sweetened beverages. Like food, they are currently exempt.
But here's the problem with that idea: small tax changes don't always change behavior, as a recent study by the RAND Corporation found. So a small soda tax could actually have a worse impact on some families' budgets than a substantial one -- by raising the price of soda without affecting consumption. No wonder the American Heart Association supports the penny-per-ounce proposal.
Such a tax would certainly raise the cost of living for some heavy soda drinkers, just as cigarette taxes have stretched the budgets of some smokers and mandatory seat belts have added costs to car production. But consider the benefits from those other public health initiatives. They have vastly outweighed the costs.
Someday, we will probably look back on our gallon-a-week soda habit the way we now look back on allowing children to ride without seat belts or listening to doctors who endorsed Camel cigarettes. We will wonder what we were thinking.
Coke and Pepsi, unfortunately, seem willing to do whatever it takes to delay that day.

Abstract: The Chinese government has continued to intervene heavily in currency markets in recent weeks to prevent the renminbi from rising against the dollar, maintaining an informal peg of 6.827 renminbi to the dollar, the level since July 2008. Because American companies in particular compete in the Chinese market with European companies in many industries, the euro's weakness against the renminbi is putting American companies at a disadvantage.

Full text: HONG KONG -- The pain of the European debt crisis is spreading as the plummeting euro makes Chinese companies less competitive in Europe, their largest market, and complicates any move to break the Chinese currency's peg to the dollar.
Chinese policy makers reached a rough consensus early last month about breaking the dollar peg and letting the currency, the renminbi, rise in value somewhat, according to people close to Chinese currency policy makers. Uncoupling the currencies would make American goods more competitive against Chinese products. But for various reasons, China has not yet put that policy into place.
And in light of the euro's nose dive, such a move could be difficult. Letting the renminbi rise against the dollar would also mean a further increase in the renminbi's value against the euro, creating even more problems for Chinese exporters to Europe.
The euro has plunged against the renminbi in recent weeks, at one point Monday reaching its lowest level since late 2002.
The steep rise of the renminbi prompted a Commerce Ministry official in Beijing to warn Monday that China's exports could be threatened.
The official's comments were the most explicit yet on the implications for China of Europe's recent financial difficulties. The comments also suggest that even China -- the world's fastest-growing major economy and increasingly the engine of global growth -- is not immune to the crisis that started in Greece and threatens to spread across much of Europe.
"The yuan has risen about 14.5 percent against the euro during the last four months, which will increase cost pressure for Chinese exporters and also have a negative impact on China's exports to European countries," Yao Jian, the ministry's spokesman, said at a news conference in Beijing, according to news services, using another term for China's currency.
It is a potentially awkward moment. The American secretary of commerce, Gary Locke, is in China this week leading the first cabinet-level trade mission of the administration of President Obama.
Some economists warn that China may face more problems. The biggest reason Chinese exports plunged early last year was not weakening demand in industrialized countries but a sudden, temporary disappearance of trade finance from Chinese and foreign banks. The availability of trade finance could easily become a serious problem again soon, said Dong Tao, the chief Asia economist at Credit Suisse.
Chinese exporters rely very heavily on bank letters of credit to finance their shipments. The availability of the letters of credit is closely linked to overnight lending rates between banks. When banks have trouble borrowing money themselves -- as has been happening as a result of worries about European banks' possible losses from the region's sovereign debt crisis -- they tend to cut sharply the issuance of letters of credit for trade finance.
The banks see that as a quick, easy way to conserve cash without violating the terms of other financial obligations, like established lines of credit for big corporations.
Interbank lending rates surged late last week and on Monday and must now come back down very quickly to persuade banks to keep issuing letters of credit, Mr. Tao said. "Without trade finance, trade won't happen," he said.
The Shanghai stock market plunged Monday, with the composite index falling 5.1 percent on worries about global demand as well as concerns about possible further moves in China to limit a steep rise in real estate prices this spring.
Some Chinese companies are already running into difficulty because of the euro's fall against the renminbi.
"We have been receiving calls from some European clients who signed contracts with us earlier this month, and they all want to cancel their orders, since the depreciation of the euro has eroded all their margins and then some," said Elvin Xu, the sales manager of Guangdong Ouyi Electrical Appliance in Zhongshan, China, which makes gas stoves, heaters and water heaters.
"They say they cannot increase the prices at their end to their customers, given intense competition in their marketplace," Mr. Xu added.
The renminbi is rising along with the dollar against the euro. The Chinese government has continued to intervene heavily in currency markets in recent weeks to prevent the renminbi from rising against the dollar, maintaining an informal peg of 6.827 renminbi to the dollar, the level since July 2008.
Because American companies in particular compete in the Chinese market with European companies in many industries, the euro's weakness against the renminbi is putting American companies at a disadvantage. The American commerce secretary, Mr. Locke, said Monday in Hong Kong that Mr. Obama's goal was to double American exports by 2015. Short-term currency fluctuations do not detract from that goal, he said in an interview, adding, "Who knows what the euro will be next month, six months from now or a year from now?"
Steve Jennings, one of the American executives traveling with Mr. Locke, said that the weakness of the euro would help European companies compete against American companies in export markets all over the world.
"As the euro continues to decline, they're going to have some advantages," said Mr. Jennings, the chief marketing officer of BPL Global, a company based in Oregon that manufactures electricity monitoring equipment.
Chinese leaders reached a consensus in early April to break the renminbi's peg to the dollar. That ended a dispute that had spilled into public view in March when Commerce Ministry officials warned in speeches and interviews in Beijing and Washington about the dangers of any change in the renminbi's value. The ministry halted those warnings immediately after the consensus was reached, and Chen Deming, the commerce minister, even reversed himself publicly by saying that China's trade deficit in March was nothing to worry about.
But events since then have delayed adoption of the consensus, including public attention paid to a visit to Beijing by the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, followed by the Qinghai earthquake and now the euro's slide.
The United States is far from alone in calling for China to let the renminbi rise.
Government officials in Singapore, India and Brazil have also called publicly in the last three weeks for the Chinese government to break the renminbi's peg to the dollar.
Continued Chinese inaction would antagonize many commercial rivals of China, and could fuel pressures in Washington for Congress to draft trade legislation threatening restrictions on Chinese exports.
The euro's difficulties have also inflicted tens of billions of dollars in losses on the value of China's $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, according to Western economists. China had been trying to limit its dependence on United States Treasury securities for those reserves in recent years, fearing that the United States might someday suffer from budget problems or inflation, and did so by expanding its holdings of European government bonds.
But China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which administers the reserves, does not have to mark them to market daily -- record their fluctuating value -- so it is not clear what effect, if any, the losses will have on policy.

Abstract: Analysts said the falling euro raised concerns about economic recovery and pulled down the price of crude oil, which fell briefly below $70 a barrel and weighed on energy stocks.

Full text: Stocks staged a late rally and closed slightly higher on Monday, rebounding from a broad early decline rooted in concern that Europe's debt problems could slow the global economic recovery.
"There was volatility, but people felt pretty comfortable. They were just waiting for a rally," said Bart Barnett, head of listed trading at Morgan Keegan.
"Earnings were halfway decent and people were not in such a hurry to sell stocks. I felt like there was a little more confidence in the market today," he said.
The Dow Jones industrial average dipped more than 180 points during the day, but started rallying in the afternoon. The index closed up 5.67 points, or 0.05 percent, at 10,625.83.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.26 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,136.94, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.38 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,354.23.
The market has emerged from several days of losses amid uncertainty over the European debt troubles.
The euro led the trend on Monday, falling to $1.2235, its lowest since April 2006, and then recovering late in the day to $1.2392.
The European Central Bank disclosed on Monday that it bought 16.5 billion euros (about $20 billion) in bonds in the first week since taking the unprecedented step of intervening in markets to halt a sell-off of Greek and other European debt.
The bank also announced steps to prevent the bond purchases from increasing the total money supply and fueling inflation.
The European Central Bank said it would take in a similar amount from banks, which will be able to deposit funds and earn interest.
European stock markets spent most of Monday in positive territory before slumping at the close. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro-zone blue chips and the FTSE 100 index in London were flat.
On Wall Street, stocks in the energy sector were hardest hit. Exxon Mobil was 0.5 percent lower, to $63.27; and Halliburton was down 0.85 percent, to $27.85.
Analysts said the falling euro raised concerns about economic recovery and pulled down the price of crude oil, which fell briefly below $70 a barrel and weighed on energy stocks. Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.53, to settle at $70.08 a barrel.
Stocks in the financial and retail sectors were among the most active.
Citigroup fell 3 percent, to $3.86, and Wells Fargo dropped 7 cents, to $31.97. Bank of America rose a penny, to $16.35.
Lowe's, the home improvement retailer, reported higher net income of $489 million, or 34 cents a share, in the first quarter. But its full-year outlook fell short of analysts' expectations and its shares fell $3.11, to $25.26.
Other major retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target, are scheduled to release quarterly reports this week.
John Lonski, chief economist for Moody's Capital Market Economics, said that a better-than-expected housing-related report might have helped lift sentiment during the day.
The National Association of Home Builders said in a report released on Monday that builders' confidence in the market for newly built, single-family homes had improved in May.
It "raised the possibility that home-buying activity did not fall off of a cliff following the end of April when the homebuyers tax credit expired," Mr. Lonski said.
A survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on manufacturing was mixed. New York manufacturers expect conditions to improve over the next six months, "but the level of optimism was noticeably lower in May than in recent months," the report said.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 9/32, to 100 3/32, and the yield rose to 3.49 percent, from 3.45 percent late on Friday.

Abstract: To be sure, a big euro devaluation would be good for some of the countries that have the most serious problems. Besides alarming debt levels, countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal have allowed wages to rise faster than productivity, and now have trouble competing on world markets.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- In Europe, businesses are generally giddy to see the euro fall and exports rise. But the currency's plunge in recent days is starting to make the Continent nervous.
After falling to an 18-month low relative to the dollar last week, the euro declined again early Monday, falling at one point to a new four-year low.
For exporters like the German carmaker Daimler, the decline has been a boon. Sales of its Mercedes-Benz models surged 22 percent in the United States during the first four months of the year, and those sales in dollars are worth 15 percent more when converted to euros than they would have been at the beginning of the year.
But the volatility of the euro -- sliding more than 8 percent in the last month -- is unnerving managers at factories across the Continent, even at Daimler in Stuttgart. More than anything at this point, Europe longs for stability. And business people worry that the euro sell-off reflects a broader loss of faith in the common currency.
"The volatility can really create a lot of problems," said Olaf Wortmann, a business-cycle specialist at the German Engineering Federation, a manufacturers' association. Sharp currency swings complicate contracts with foreign suppliers and upset investment plans, he said.
"A cheaper euro helps us in certain markets," agreed Christoph Liedtke, a spokesman for SAP, a maker of business software based in Walldorf, Germany. But, he said, "We have a strong interest in a stable currency. The stronger the currency fluctuations, the more difficult it is for all companies."
The euro's decline accelerated last week after European Union leaders agreed on a nearly $1 trillion aid package intended to guarantee that Greece, Spain and other countries could pay their debts. The European Central Bank also began buying government and corporate debt to prevent a market freeze. The moves were unprecedented.
Businesses generally applauded the huge commitment to stabilize the euro area, and stocks ended the week higher. But after a brief rally last Monday morning, the euro began moving in the opposite direction. Investors are concerned that the central bank's relentless focus on price stability is now in question, analysts said.
Investors were also shaken by the abrupt reversal in policy. On Thursday, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, had insisted that its governing council not even discuss bond purchases.
"They have lost credibility because they are now acting against their own talk from before," said Jurgen von Hagen, a professor of economics at the University of Bonn. Faced with the need to supply cash to European banks, the central bank will have to keep its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent for the foreseeable future, said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
The Federal Reserve is likely to begin raising interest rates sooner than the European Central Bank, Mr. Kramer said, making it more attractive for investors to hold assets in dollars. He predicts that inflation will rise to an annual rate of 3 or 4 percent in coming years, rather than the official target of about 2 percent.
Mr. Trichet insists that the central bank will never deviate from its mandate to preserve price stability. "Those who believe -- or even worse, are suggesting -- that we will tolerate inflation in the future are making a grave error," he told the German magazine Der Spiegel.
The euro, which was trading around $1.25 on Friday, is still above "purchasing power parity," the point at which the currencies are aligned with how much they buy in the real world. The fair value of the euro is about $1.20, analysts say.
If the euro settles at something close to parity, businesses will be happy. But experience shows that rarely happens.
"The exchange rates always over- or undershoot," said Mr. Wortmann of the Engineering Federation. "We wouldn't be happy about an undervalued euro."
To be sure, a big euro devaluation would be good for some of the countries that have the most serious problems. Besides alarming debt levels, countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal have allowed wages to rise faster than productivity, and now have trouble competing on world markets.
A depressed euro would make their products cheaper in foreign markets, and help restore competitiveness. A stronger dollar would also help tourism, which is an important industry in Mediterranean countries. Bookings from the United States at Silversea Cruises are up about 10 percent, said Manfredi Lefebvre d'Ovidio, deputy chairman of the cruise ship operator. But he attributes most of the gain to the improved American economy.
For most exporters, though, a cheaper euro brings problems as well as advantages. Oil and raw materials, which are often priced in dollars, become more expensive. Currency hedging, like any other kind of insurance, becomes more expensive when the risk rises, as it does during big exchange rate moves.
Many international companies have moved some of their manufacturing abroad, in part to cushion themselves against currency fluctuations.
SMA Solar Technology, a maker of inverters for solar plants that is based in Niestetal, Germany, is setting up a factory in Denver that is expected to employ 700 people, partly to serve the American market but also to guard against a gyrating euro.
"SMA will be able to reduce transportation and interim storage costs as well as currency exchange risks," Gunther Cramer, the company's chief, said in a statement.
For such companies, a swing in the dollar-euro rate may simply be a wash. While Daimler cars made in Germany become more profitable, Daimler S.U.V.'s made in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and exported outside the United States -- as more than half are -- become less profitable in euro terms.
Mr. Wortmann said that the machinery makers in the Engineering Federation were more concerned about the state of world trade and the health of the European economy than they were about the dollar-euro exchange rate.
"Demand is what is decisive," Mr. Wortmann said. "We are getting one or the other new contract, but it's not a flood."
Greece May Pursue U.S. Banks
Greece is considering taking legal action against American investment banks that may have contributed to the country's debt crisis, Prime Minister George Papandreou said.
"I wouldn't rule out that this may be a recourse," Mr. Papandreou said, in response to questions in an interview on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS" on Sunday.

Full text: After a brief respite following the announcement last week of a nearly $1 trillion bailout plan for Europe, fear in the financial markets is building again, this time over worries that the Continent's biggest banks face strains that will hobble European economies.
In a sign of the depth of the anxiety, the euro fell Friday to its lowest level since the depth of the financial crisis, as investors abandoned the currency as well as stocks in favor of gold and other assets seen as offering more safety.
In trading early Monday morning, the euro declined again, managing at one time to reach a four-year low relative to the dollar.
The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, in an interview published Saturday, warned that Europe was facing "severe tensions" and that the markets were fragile.
For Europe's banks, the problems are twofold. Short-term borrowing costs are rising, which could lead institutions to cut back on new loans and call in old ones, crimping economic growth.
At the same time, seemingly safe institutions in more solid economies like France and Germany hold vast amounts of bonds from their more shaky neighbors, like Spain, Portugal and Greece.
Investors fear that with many governments groaning under the weight of huge deficits, the debt of weaker nations that use the euro currency will have to be restructured, deeply lowering the value of their bonds. That would hit European financial institutions hard, and may ricochet through the global banking system.
Bourses and bank shares in Europe plunged on Friday because of these fears, with Wall Street following suit. Shares were also down in Tokyo and Australia in early trading on Monday.
"This bailout wasn't done to help the Greeks; it was done to help the French and German banks," said Niall Ferguson, an economic historian at Harvard. "They've poured some water on the fire, but the fire has not gone out."
The European rescue plan, totaling 750 billion euros, is intended to head off the risk of default but would vastly increase borrowing. That could hamstring Europe's nascent recovery.
Indeed, it was too much debt that caused the problem in the first place: a new report by the International Monetary Fund warns that "high levels of public indebtedness could weigh on economic growth for years."
The world's budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product now stands at 6 percent, up from just 0.3 percent before the financial crisis. If public debt is not lowered back to precrisis levels, the I.M.F. report said, growth in advanced economies could decline by half a percentage point annually.
To be sure, not all of the trends are negative. A lower euro will actually make European exports -- be it German automobiles or Italian leather -- more affordable and more competitive around the world. And Greece, Spain and Portugal took the first steps last week toward enacting austerity measures that would reduce their budget deficits.
Those steps were not enough to prevent a flare-up in money market funds, a crucial but little-noticed corner of the financial system in which American investors provide more than $500 billion in short-term loans to help European banks finance their daily operations.
The cash comes from conservative funds that hold the savings of big American corporations and individual American consumers.
So far, the proposed rescue package has failed to ease worries at these funds, which have cut back on loans to European banks and are demanding higher rates and quicker repayment.
"More people are making the yes or no decision to pull out of the market and keep their money closer to home," said Lou Crandall, the chief economist of Wrightson ICAP, a money market research firm.
Initially, it was Greek and Portuguese banks that got the cold shoulder from American lenders. But over the last two weeks big banks in Spain, Ireland and Italy have struggled to secure short-term funds from the United States as the anxiety has spread.
By Friday, even banks in solid European economies like France, Germany and the Netherlands were caught in the undertow, according to market analysts and traders.
"Investors are waiting to see whether the stability package can be put into place," said Alex Roever, a short-term fixed-income analyst for J.P. Morgan Securities.
"Until investors get a better feel, we are hung in limbo."
Because of the pullback by American lenders, the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans, known as Libor for the London Interbank Offered Rate, has been steadily climbing. And the significance of Libor stretches far beyond Europe's shores: that is the benchmark that helps determine the interest rate on many mortgages and credit cards held by American consumers.
Bank borrowing rates are still well below where they were at the height of the crisis. Fears that the problems in Europe could rebound in the United States, however, led the Federal Reserve to restart lines of credit to the European Central Bank and other central banks in conjunction with the European rescue package announced a week ago.
The move ensured that European institutions would be able to borrow dollars to lend to their clients, but that is more expensive than relying on private investors.
"We didn't do so out of any special love for Europe," Narayana R. Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, told a group of small-business owners in Wisconsin on Thursday. "We're American policy makers, and we make decisions to keep the American economy strong." However, he said, "The liquidity problems in European markets were showing signs of creating dangerous illiquidity problems in our own country's financial markets."
That is not the only domino that could fall.
While the direct exposure of American banks to Greece is minimal, American financial institutions are closely intertwined with many big European banks, which in turn have large investments in the weaker European nations.
For example, Portuguese banks owe $86 billion to their counterparts in Spain, which in turn owe German institutions $238 billion and French banks $220 billion. American banks are also big owners of Spanish bank debt, holding nearly $200 billion, according to the Bank for International Settlements, a global organization serving central bankers.
Furthermore, financial policy makers find themselves running out of weapons in their arsenal.
After borrowing trillions to stimulate their economies and ease credit concerns during the last wave of fear in late 2008 and early 2009, governments cannot borrow trillions more without risking higher inflation and shoving aside other borrowers like individuals and companies. Short-term interest rates, already near zero in the United States, cannot be lowered any further. And vital steps like raising taxes or cutting spending increases could snuff out the beginnings of a recovery in northern Europe and worsen the pain in recession-battered economies like Spain, where unemployment recently passed 20 percent.
With the exception of wartime, "the public finances in the majority of advanced industrial countries are in a worse state today than at any time since the industrial revolution," Willem Buiter, Citigroup's top economist, wrote in a recent report.
"Restoring fiscal balance will be a drag on growth for years to come."

Full text: There has been a feeding frenzy at the Pentagon budget trough since the 9/11 attacks. Pretty much anything the military chiefs and industry lobbyists pitched, Congress approved -- no matter the cost and no matter if the weapons or programs were over budget, underperforming or no longer needed in a post-cold-war world.
Annual defense spending has nearly doubled in the last decade to $549 billion. That does not include the cost of the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan, which this year will add $159 billion.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has now vowed to do things differently. In two recent speeches, he declared that the nation cannot keep spending at this rate and that the defense budget "gusher" has been "turned off and will stay off for a good period of time." He vowed that going forward all current programs and future spending requests will receive "unsparing" scrutiny.
Mr. Gates isn't proposing cutting his budget. He's talking about 2 percent to 3 percent real growth after inflation, compared with 4 percent a year in 2000 to 2009. Given the nation's dire financial state, it's still a lot.
The Obama administration has already chopped some big-ticket, anachronistic weapons. (It stood up to the lobbyists and Congressional boosters to kill the F-22 fighter jet.) There has been more investment in needed new weapons, most notably unmanned drones. The Quadrennial Defense Review talked sternly about the need for "future trade-offs," although it failed to start making the hard choices.
Mr. Gates said he wants to trim the bloated civilian and military bureaucracy (including excess admirals and generals) for a modest savings of $10 billion to $15 billion annually. He wants more cuts in weapons spending, and he deserves credit for naming specific systems.
Why should the Navy have 11 aircraft carriers (at $11 billion a copy) for the next 30 years when no other country has more than one, he asked at the Navy League exposition in Maryland. He questioned the need for the Marines' beach-storming Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (vulnerable to advances in anti-ship systems) and $7 billion ballistic missile submarines for the Navy.
We're sure the irate calls from Capitol Hill and K Street haven't stopped since. It must be noted that Mr. Gates didn't say for sure whether he would slash any of these systems -- or how deeply.
Perhaps the most politically volatile issue is military health care costs, which rose from $19 billion to $50 billion in a decade. Active-duty military and their families rightly do not pay for health care. But what retirees pay -- $460 annually per family -- has not risen in 15 years.
Mr. Gates said that many retirees earn full-time salaries on top of their military retirement pay and could get coverage through their employer. We owe our fighting forces excellent care, but this is a time when everyone must share the burden.
Even if Mr. Gates begins to get a real handle on other costs, budget experts warn that exploding personnel costs -- wages, health care, housing, pensions -- will increasingly crowd out financing for new weapons. Once the United States commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down, Washington will have to consider trimming troop strength, beginning with the Navy and Air Force.
Mr. Gates is an old Washington hand and we're sure he is going into this fight with his eyes wide open. Still, if there was any doubt about what he's up against, a House Armed Services subcommittee gave him a reminder last week. It added nearly $400 million to the Pentagon's $9.9 billion 2011 request for missile defenses. That included $50 million for an airborne laser that experts agree doesn't work and Mr. Gates largely canceled last year.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON
NINE days ago, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, caught a Friday-night flight from here so he could address 1,100 graduates at the University of South Carolina the next morning about "The Economics of Happiness." After the speech, he took a call in his hotel room from Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, and the next day pledged billions of dollars to help Europe stave off a financial crisis -- a flashback to the huge lending programs the Fed put together in 2008 to forestall economic collapse at home.
Mr. Bernanke, 56, hasn't had much time to reflect on whether history's verdict on his extraordinary actions of recent years will be harsh or forgiving. Nor has he had time to read the spate of new books about how he and two Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Timothy F. Geithner, navigated a maelstrom that left millions of Americans jobless, homeless or broke.
Nominated last August to a second four-year term by President Obama, Mr. Bernanke nearly saw his career in public service scuttled by widespread discontent about lax regulation of Wall Street and historic federal bailouts that rescued well-heeled bankers from their own mistakes. After a raucous debate in January, the Senate confirmed Mr. Bernanke by a vote of 70 to 30 -- the lowest vote of support for any Fed chief since the central bank's creation in 1913.
Today, early in his fifth year as chairman, Mr. Bernanke faces challenges far different from any that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, confronted in his 18-year tenure. As the nation's all-powerful arbiter of interest rates, which directly affect banks' willingness to lend the funds that fuel the economy, Mr. Bernanke has held the benchmark short-term rate at nearly zero since December 2008, aiming to shore up faltering financial institutions.
He has to figure out not only when to start raising rates -- weighing high unemployment against the fear of inflation -- but also how to begin shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which has more than doubled, to $2.3 trillion, since the crisis started.
Despite the Fed's now-notorious failure to rein in years of pell-mell, subprime mortgage lending, the Senate is considering entrusting the Fed with added regulatory powers: oversight of the largest financial institutions, including nonbanks like insurers, and an enhanced duty to monitor the kind of risky behavior that brought the American economy to the precipice.
Just last week, the Fed fought off proposals that would have subjected its monetary policy decisions to routine audits and transferred oversight of thousands of Fed-regulated state-chartered banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But it is also likely to be forced to disclose much more about how, exactly, it went about rescuing the financial sector in the last few years -- a matter of heated debate in Congress and the courts.
"Responsible people in Congress have recognized that you can't have a strong economy without a solid independent central bank that has appropriate regulatory roles," Mr. Bernanke said in an interview. "I continue to count on good sense and wisdom to trump short-term political advantage."
He's also aware that new mandates might just set up the Fed for future rounds of criticism. "We have to manage expectations," he says. "There is no possibility of eliminating financial crises, even severe ones, but that does not mean there isn't a meaningful opportunity to reduce the risks and reduce the effects, which is what this is all about."
A POST-CRISIS conventional wisdom has arisen around Mr. Bernanke, who as a scholar produced ground-breaking research exploring the intersection of macroeconomics and finance.
Some see his failure to anticipate the nature and severity of the financial crisis -- and his role in helping Mr. Greenspan keep interest rates at a level that might have fed housing speculation -- as unforgivable lapses. Others say there was no one better equipped, once the crisis began, to respond with the force, resolve and imagination he deployed to prevent an economic apocalypse.
The two views are not mutually exclusive, as Mr. Bernanke concedes.
"Some people have asked, 'Why didn't the Fed stop this from happening?' " he says. "Well, like other regulators, there were some things we could have done, at least with hindsight. But we had neither the mandate nor the tools to be the financial system's supercop. We had well-defined responsibilities that excluded many of the areas that turned out to be problems."
Mr. Bernanke says the regulatory apparatus that grew out of the Depression, oriented around commercial banks, didn't adapt to the dizzying pace of financial innovation and interconnected, fast-moving markets.
In fact, markets can now move so fast that regulators sometimes seem winded just trying to catch up. When the stock market plunged 1,000 points on May 6 before reversing direction almost as quickly, regulators were at a loss to explain why. They still are.
For his part, Mr. Bernanke says he was concerned but not shocked by the drop. He says he and deputies had been girding for spillover effects from the European debt crisis for months and had been in regular contact with their European counterparts.
The brief market plunge "was just a small indicator of how complex and chaotic, in the formal sense, these systems have become," he says. "Our financial system is so complicated and so interactive -- so many different markets in different countries and so many sets of rules. What happened in the stock market is just a little example of how things can cascade or how technology can interact with market panic."
More than ever, he suggests, the Fed's supervisory role needs to be reoriented around financial stability.
"I just think it's not realistic to think that human beings can fully anticipate all of possible interactions and complex developments," he says. "The best approach for dealing with this uncertainty is to make sure that the system is fundamentally resilient and that we have as many fail-safes and backup arrangements as possible."
Crisis-fighter was not the primary role that Mr. Bernanke expected when he initially signed on as Fed chairman in 2006. His first two years were dotted with missteps. He memorably and erroneously described the subprime mess as "contained" and underestimated the depths of the broader housing crisis and how intertwined it had become with complex Wall Street trading.
As the crisis accelerated, the Fed lent $29 billion to engineer Bear Stearns' sale in March 2008 to JPMorgan Chase. The following August, the mortgage behemoths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized. Then, in September, after a desperate search for a buyer, the Treasury and the Fed let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt.
The Fed helped broker Merrill Lynch's sale to Bank of America; swooped in with $85 billion in a controversial rescue of the insurance giant A.I.G., and supported Mr. Paulson's plea to Congress for a $700 billion bank bailout.
Only after this first, experimental and headlong rush to place outsized Band-Aids on the financial system did the Fed seem to get its footing -- aggressively dropping rates and deploying an alphabet soup of lending programs. It spent last year acquiring mortgage bonds, Treasury securities and debts owed by Fannie and Freddie, while also conducting "stress tests" of the largest financial institutions.
Friends and acquaintances say that all the effort and creativity needed to wrestle with the crisis have taken a visible toll on Mr. Bernanke.
"You could see it weighed very heavily on him," says Alan N. Rechtschaffen, a lawyer and derivatives expert who sees Mr. Bernanke periodically. "He understood the gravity of what was going on. You could see it in his face."
L. Douglas Lee, an economic forecaster, worried that the chairman might be on the brink of a meltdown of his own during the height of the crisis. "He just looked like he was fatigued," Mr. Lee says. "He doesn't look that way now."
And Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been a friend since graduate school, says of Mr. Bernanke: "I don't know how he has made it through the ordeal that he had to go through."
Mr. Bernanke, accustomed to working every day of the week, says that he is logging fewer hours, but as he describes his labors he seems more motivated by duty than pleasure.
"My training and experience equipped me to serve the public, and I believe that I have a responsibility to provide that service," he says. "I am not doing this for personal enjoyment."
"The world has a great deal more to offer than money."
-- Ben S. Bernanke, June 9, 2006
BEN BERNANKE was first quoted in a newspaper, The Charlotte Observer, in 1958, asking, "Grandma, why don't you teach my mommy how to make blintzes?" He was 4 at the time.
His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who traced an uncommon route to the Carolinas. His paternal grandparents, Jonas and Pauline, immigrated from what is now Poland and owned a modest Manhattan drugstore. Their son Philip, Mr. Bernanke's father, was born in Washington Heights, and the family moved in 1941 to Dillon, S.C., where it opened the Jay Bee drugstore, later run by Philip and his brother.
Mr. Bernanke's maternal grandparents, Harold and Marcia Friedman, were Lithuanian immigrants who ended up in Charlotte, N.C., where Mr. Bernanke's mother, Edna, was raised. Marcia, who made the blintzes, worked in a shoe factory. After she died, when Ben was 13, Harold, a cantor and kosher butcher, moved in with the Bernankes.
Philip and Edna met while studying at different campuses of the University of North Carolina; Ben was the oldest of their three children and could add and subtract as a toddler. He skipped first grade, memorized baseball statistics and, deploying the Hebrew his grandfather taught him, helped lead services in Dillon's small synagogue. At 11, he was a spelling-bee champ but flubbed a national round by misspelling "edelweiss."
At Dillon High School, he played saxophone in the marching band, scored a near-perfect 1,590 on the SAT and won a $500 scholarship and a tour of Europe, thanks to Pan Am. He held summer jobs in hospital construction and at South of the Border, a souvenir hub along Interstate 95. He wore his black hair long and eventually adopted a prominent handlebar mustache.
His high school didn't integrate until his senior year, but he had black friends -- including Kenneth R. Manning, six years older, who was already at Harvard and urged Mr. Bernanke to apply there. The Vietnam war draft was still active when he arrived at Harvard; he had a high lottery number in the draft -- 335 -- and was never called.
He had planned to study math, then flirted with physics and English before settling on economics. "Ben Bernanke, I learned more from sitting behind you in Ec 10 than from the class," a classmate, Suzanne Powell Bishopric, wrote in a report for a Class of 1975 reunion that takes place next month. (Mr. Bernanke isn't attending.)
Dale W. Jorgenson taught Mr. Bernanke econometrics at Harvard and supervised his senior thesis, which used economic models to examine natural-gas pricing -- a timely topic in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis.
Mr. Bernanke lived in Winthrop House, a dorm along the Charles River, where classmates included Lloyd C. Blankfein, now C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs (who didn't know Mr. Bernanke well).
At Mr. Jorgenson's direction, Mr. Bernanke entered the Ph.D. program in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Fellow graduate students there included Paul Krugman and Kenneth S. Rogoff, who would become two of the best-known economists of their generation. (Mr. Krugman also writes a column for The New York Times.)
Alexander S. Kelso Jr., who shared an M.I.T. office with Mr. Bernanke, says his classmate "may have been the smartest one of us, but he had plenty of competition."
In 1978, Mr. Bernanke married Anna Friedmann, whom he had met on a blind date. A Wellesley alumna, she had been born in Rome, the daughter of Jewish refugees from Croatia, and grew up in Denver.
Mr. Bernanke's 1979 dissertation explained why firms delay decisions to invest in times of uncertainty. He turned down Harvard for a job at Stanford's business school. (His wife, a Spanish teacher, received a master's in Spanish from Stanford and recently founded a school for disadvantaged teenagers.)
"He was an extremely good teacher from the first," says Jeremy I. Bulow, a friend from M.I.T. who joined Stanford's business school at the same time and still teaches there. "He's probably had to make an effort to learn how to be less clear to do his current job."
Stanley Fischer, Mr. Bernanke's adviser at M.I.T., had urged his student to read "The Great Contraction, 1929-1933," in which Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz blamed the Fed's failure to expand the money supply for the Depression's severity and duration.
The book ignited a passion.
"I guess I am a Depression buff, the way some people are Civil War buffs," Mr. Bernanke once wrote.
In his writings, Mr. Bernanke explained how credit market disruptions -- in particular, bank failures and debt deflation -- worsened the depth and length of the Depression, and identified a "financial accelerator," the idea that conditions in financial markets amplify developments in the real economy.
In 1985, he left Stanford for Princeton. His children -- Joel, born in 1982, and Alyssa, born in 1986 -- enrolled in public schools, and for six years he served on the school board in Montgomery Township, N.J.
It was not his only taste of leadership. In 1996, he became chairman of Princeton's economics department, where he helped strengthen the finance program.
"There's a very strong group of egos here, so to get anything done requires a certain amount of diplomatic ability," recalls Harvey S. Rosen, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor as department chairman.
Mr. Rosen was surprised when Mr. Bernanke signed up for a second term as chairman; many professors consider the task a distraction. "I think he had accomplished a lot his first term," Mr. Rosen says, "and he just wanted to go see it through."
"Because I appreciate the role of chance and contingency in human events, I try to be appropriately realistic about my own capabilities. I know there is much that I don't know."

IN 2002, R. Glenn Hubbard, a top economic adviser to President George W. Bush, asked whether Mr. Bernanke would consider serving as a Fed governor. "I was mildly surprised that Ben wanted to come," Mr. Hubbard recalls. "I reached out to him expecting him to say, 'No way.' "
That Mr. Bernanke was a Republican came as a surprise even to longtime colleagues like Alan S. Blinder, a Princeton economist who had been the Fed's vice chairman during the Clinton administration. Mr. Bernanke, who is soft-spoken, is socially liberal but fiscally conservative.
The economy was slow to recover after the 2001 recession, and Mr. Bernanke and his Fed colleagues backed Mr. Greenspan as the Fed gingerly began to raise rates in 2004, while still keeping them at historically low levels. Critics have argued that easy loans born from artificially low rates helped fuel the housing bubble, an accusation Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke have denied.
In 2005, the White House tapped Mr. Bernanke to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. By then, he and his wife had bought a house on Capitol Hill, leaving open what they would do next.
Seven months later, he was Mr. Bush's choice to lead the Fed. He had never worked in the markets and was neither politically active nor close to Mr. Bush, but was considered a safe pick. The Senate confirmed him on Jan. 31, 2006, the day Mr. Greenspan retired.
"I never thought I would get this job," says Mr. Bernanke, adding that 9/11 had spurred his interest in public service. "But now that I have it obviously it's important to do the very best I can -- which is all I can do."
In a 2006 open letter, the Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw urged Mr. Bernanke to "accept a lower public profile than Greenspan" and "become as boring a public figure as possible." The Fed's job, he wrote, "is to create stability, not excitement."
Mr. Bernanke fits that bill. He is reserved, has a dry wit and doesn't appear to relish the trappings of office. He once lamented that joining the Fed meant he couldn't wear Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts to work.
"Whatever political skills I have, have been gained painfully over many years," he says. "I'm not naturally that kind of person."
In January, as senators took turns denouncing Mr. Bernanke before his reconfirmation vote, he didn't follow along on television or the Web. He did not learn the vote's outcome until two aides interrupted a meeting to tell him.
"I had two principal objectives in accepting a second term," he says. "First, I wanted to see through the process of financial regulatory reform, which will have long-lasting impacts on our economy. Second, I felt that I could play a useful role in managing the exit from our extraordinary policies, including our highly accommodative monetary policies."
Ever the economic historian, Mr. Bernanke added, "Reflecting on the problems that were caused by the long transition between Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt during the Great Depression, I hoped to provide some policy continuity during the period of presidential transition."
"Keep a 'gratitude journal,' in which you routinely list experiences and circumstances for which you are grateful."

WILL future economists view Mr. Bernanke more charitably than some current ones?
John B. Taylor, a monetary policy expert, has accused Mr. Bernanke of bungling interest rates and conducting ad hoc bailouts. The leading historian of the Fed, Allan H. Meltzer, writes that the institution has been reduced to "a financing arm of the Treasury." Anna Schwartz, whose work had so influenced the young Mr. Bernanke, called on Mr. Obama to replace him.
And Richard A. Posner, a judge and an authority on law and economics, fumed in a new book, "Bernanke has been shameless in refusing to assign any share of responsibility for the crisis to mismanagement of monetary policy."
Mr. Bernanke defended the Fed's monetary policy decisions in a January speech to the American Economic Association. But in private, he seems puzzled and dismayed by the attacks. Friends don't dispute that.
"When you've gone your whole professional life with people always ecstatic about everything you've done, to have people now go on TV and say, 'This guy is an idiot' -- that just can't be fun," Mr. Bulow says.
Others say that whatever critics think about the Fed's various maneuvers over the last few years, they believe that Mr. Bernanke helped stave off a much deeper crisis that would have occurred if he had merely sat on his hands.
"People just don't get how close the economy was to falling off the cliff," says Mark Gertler, a New York University economist and one of Mr. Bernanke's closest friends. "Yes, you can say the Fed didn't see it coming, but the way it responded after the crisis started to unfold was incredible. I honestly think there's nobody who could have handled the crisis as well as he did."
Mr. Bernanke's given names, Ben Shalom, mean "son of Peace" in Hebrew. Acquaintances say his name is apropos.
"He has been extraordinarily calm throughout -- at least he's projected that on the surface," says the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, a close ally.
While Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan share certain views -- that a global "savings glut" helped drive down long-term interest rates; that monetary policy is a poor tool for identifying, much less pricking, asset bubbles; and that the Fed's interest-rate policies didn't cause the crisis -- the men differ in crucial ways.
While Mr. Greenspan tightly controlled Fed meetings, Mr. Bernanke is more collaborative. Unlike Mr. Greenspan, he avoids Washington's cocktail circuit. Mr. Greenspan would weigh in regularly with policy recommendations; Mr. Bernanke warns that the United States is on a fiscally unsustainable path but hasn't suggested specific tax increases or spending cuts.
Recently, he has seemed to be regaining his confidence and bearing. John H. Makin, an economist who shares with Mr. Bernanke an interest in Japan and deflation, says that "certainly in the last few months, he's looked a lot more self-possessed."
Mr. Bernanke reads avidly on his Kindle; Agatha Christie is a favorite. Recently, he read "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks," by Rebecca Skloot, about the donor of a cell line used in research; the novel "Push" by Sapphire; and "The Help," by Kathryn Stockett, about maids in early-1960s Mississippi.
He is tempted to buy an iPad but isn't sure he can justify the cost. He likes to drive, but stays under the speed limit, friends say.
To relax, Mr. Bernanke shoots hoops in a squash court at the Fed. As a graduate student at M.I.T., he once skipped classes to cheer the Boston Red Sox against the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series, but he says his loyalties are now with the Washington Nationals.
"Bernanke is normal, which is fairly abnormal in that position," says John Hope Bryant, a financial literacy advocate who credits Mr. Bernanke for speaking on that topic last June in Anacostia, a low-income neighborhood in southeast Washington.
And, colleagues say, he has grown wiser about how reality has a habit of intruding on well-formed academic theories about the economy.
"Maybe early on, there were some who believed Ben did not fully appreciate the rhythms of the markets," says Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who has been Mr. Bernanke's liaison to Wall Street. "But he sure understands the flows of the markets now."

Correction: May 23, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the challenges facing Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, misidentified the university he attended when he went to a 1975 World Series game. He was a graduate student at M.I.T. that fall, not a senior at Harvard. A spokeswoman for the chairman also says now that because it was an evening game, he might not have skipped class to attend, as he said in a 2008 speech.

Full text: WASHINGTON
NINE days ago, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, caught a Friday-night flight from here so he could address 1,100 graduates at the University of South Carolina the next morning about "The Economics of Happiness." After the speech, he took a call in his hotel room from Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, and the next day pledged billions of dollars to help Europe stave off a financial crisis -- a flashback to the huge lending programs the Fed put together in 2008 to forestall economic collapse at home.
Mr. Bernanke, 56, hasn't had much time to reflect on whether history's verdict on his extraordinary actions of recent years will be harsh or forgiving. Nor has he had time to read the spate of new books about how he and two Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Timothy F. Geithner, navigated a maelstrom that left millions of Americans jobless, homeless or broke.
Nominated last August to a second four-year term by President Obama, Mr. Bernanke nearly saw his career in public service scuttled by widespread discontent about lax regulation of Wall Street and historic federal bailouts that rescued well-heeled bankers from their own mistakes. After a raucous debate in January, the Senate confirmed Mr. Bernanke by a vote of 70 to 30 -- the lowest vote of support for any Fed chief since the central bank's creation in 1913.
Today, early in his fifth year as chairman, Mr. Bernanke faces challenges far different from any that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, confronted in his 18-year tenure. As the nation's all-powerful arbiter of interest rates, which directly affect banks' willingness to lend the funds that fuel the economy, Mr. Bernanke has held the benchmark short-term rate at nearly zero since December 2008, aiming to shore up faltering financial institutions.
He has to figure out not only when to start raising rates -- weighing high unemployment against the fear of inflation -- but also how to begin shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which has more than doubled, to $2.3 trillion, since the crisis started.
Despite the Fed's now-notorious failure to rein in years of pell-mell, subprime mortgage lending, the Senate is considering entrusting the Fed with added regulatory powers: oversight of the largest financial institutions, including nonbanks like insurers, and an enhanced duty to monitor the kind of risky behavior that brought the American economy to the precipice.
Just last week, the Fed fought off proposals that would have subjected its monetary policy decisions to routine audits and transferred oversight of thousands of Fed-regulated state-chartered banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But it is also likely to be forced to disclose much more about how, exactly, it went about rescuing the financial sector in the last few years -- a matter of heated debate in Congress and the courts.
"Responsible people in Congress have recognized that you can't have a strong economy without a solid independent central bank that has appropriate regulatory roles," Mr. Bernanke said in an interview. "I continue to count on good sense and wisdom to trump short-term political advantage."
He's also aware that new mandates might just set up the Fed for future rounds of criticism. "We have to manage expectations," he says. "There is no possibility of eliminating financial crises, even severe ones, but that does not mean there isn't a meaningful opportunity to reduce the risks and reduce the effects, which is what this is all about."
A POST-CRISIS conventional wisdom has arisen around Mr. Bernanke, who as a scholar produced ground-breaking research exploring the intersection of macroeconomics and finance.
Some see his failure to anticipate the nature and severity of the financial crisis -- and his role in helping Mr. Greenspan keep interest rates at a level that might have fed housing speculation -- as unforgivable lapses. Others say there was no one better equipped, once the crisis began, to respond with the force, resolve and imagination he deployed to prevent an economic apocalypse.
The two views are not mutually exclusive, as Mr. Bernanke concedes.
"Some people have asked, 'Why didn't the Fed stop this from happening?' " he says. "Well, like other regulators, there were some things we could have done, at least with hindsight. But we had neither the mandate nor the tools to be the financial system's supercop. We had well-defined responsibilities that excluded many of the areas that turned out to be problems."
Mr. Bernanke says the regulatory apparatus that grew out of the Depression, oriented around commercial banks, didn't adapt to the dizzying pace of financial innovation and interconnected, fast-moving markets.
In fact, markets can now move so fast that regulators sometimes seem winded just trying to catch up. When the stock market plunged 1,000 points on May 6 before reversing direction almost as quickly, regulators were at a loss to explain why. They still are.
For his part, Mr. Bernanke says he was concerned but not shocked by the drop. He says he and deputies had been girding for spillover effects from the European debt crisis for months and had been in regular contact with their European counterparts.
The brief market plunge "was just a small indicator of how complex and chaotic, in the formal sense, these systems have become," he says. "Our financial system is so complicated and so interactive -- so many different markets in different countries and so many sets of rules. What happened in the stock market is just a little example of how things can cascade or how technology can interact with market panic."
More than ever, he suggests, the Fed's supervisory role needs to be reoriented around financial stability.
"I just think it's not realistic to think that human beings can fully anticipate all of possible interactions and complex developments," he says. "The best approach for dealing with this uncertainty is to make sure that the system is fundamentally resilient and that we have as many fail-safes and backup arrangements as possible."
Crisis-fighter was not the primary role that Mr. Bernanke expected when he initially signed on as Fed chairman in 2006. His first two years were dotted with missteps. He memorably and erroneously described the subprime mess as "contained" and underestimated the depths of the broader housing crisis and how intertwined it had become with complex Wall Street trading.
As the crisis accelerated, the Fed lent $29 billion to engineer Bear Stearns' sale in March 2008 to JPMorgan Chase. The following August, the mortgage behemoths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized. Then, in September, after a desperate search for a buyer, the Treasury and the Fed let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt.
The Fed helped broker Merrill Lynch's sale to Bank of America; swooped in with $85 billion in a controversial rescue of the insurance giant A.I.G., and supported Mr. Paulson's plea to Congress for a $700 billion bank bailout.
Only after this first, experimental and headlong rush to place outsized Band-Aids on the financial system did the Fed seem to get its footing -- aggressively dropping rates and deploying an alphabet soup of lending programs. It spent last year acquiring mortgage bonds, Treasury securities and debts owed by Fannie and Freddie, while also conducting "stress tests" of the largest financial institutions.
Friends and acquaintances say that all the effort and creativity needed to wrestle with the crisis have taken a visible toll on Mr. Bernanke.
"You could see it weighed very heavily on him," says Alan N. Rechtschaffen, a lawyer and derivatives expert who sees Mr. Bernanke periodically. "He understood the gravity of what was going on. You could see it in his face."
L. Douglas Lee, an economic forecaster, worried that the chairman might be on the brink of a meltdown of his own during the height of the crisis. "He just looked like he was fatigued," Mr. Lee says. "He doesn't look that way now."
And Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has been a friend since graduate school, says of Mr. Bernanke: "I don't know how he has made it through the ordeal that he had to go through."
Mr. Bernanke, accustomed to working every day of the week, says that he is logging fewer hours, but as he describes his labors he seems more motivated by duty than pleasure.
"My training and experience equipped me to serve the public, and I believe that I have a responsibility to provide that service," he says. "I am not doing this for personal enjoyment."
"The world has a great deal more to offer than money."
-- Ben S. Bernanke, June 9, 2006
BEN BERNANKE was first quoted in a newspaper, The Charlotte Observer, in 1958, asking, "Grandma, why don't you teach my mommy how to make blintzes?" He was 4 at the time.
His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who traced an uncommon route to the Carolinas. His paternal grandparents, Jonas and Pauline, immigrated from what is now Poland and owned a modest Manhattan drugstore. Their son Philip, Mr. Bernanke's father, was born in Washington Heights, and the family moved in 1941 to Dillon, S.C., where it opened the Jay Bee drugstore, later run by Philip and his brother.
Mr. Bernanke's maternal grandparents, Harold and Marcia Friedman, were Lithuanian immigrants who ended up in Charlotte, N.C., where Mr. Bernanke's mother, Edna, was raised. Marcia, who made the blintzes, worked in a shoe factory. After she died, when Ben was 13, Harold, a cantor and kosher butcher, moved in with the Bernankes.
Philip and Edna met while studying at different campuses of the University of North Carolina; Ben was the oldest of their three children and could add and subtract as a toddler. He skipped first grade, memorized baseball statistics and, deploying the Hebrew his grandfather taught him, helped lead services in Dillon's small synagogue. At 11, he was a spelling-bee champ but flubbed a national round by misspelling "edelweiss."
At Dillon High School, he played saxophone in the marching band, scored a near-perfect 1,590 on the SAT and won a $500 scholarship and a tour of Europe, thanks to Pan Am. He held summer jobs in hospital construction and at South of the Border, a souvenir hub along Interstate 95. He wore his black hair long and eventually adopted a prominent handlebar mustache.
His high school didn't integrate until his senior year, but he had black friends -- including Kenneth R. Manning, six years older, who was already at Harvard and urged Mr. Bernanke to apply there. The Vietnam war draft was still active when he arrived at Harvard; he had a high lottery number in the draft -- 335 -- and was never called.
He had planned to study math, then flirted with physics and English before settling on economics. "Ben Bernanke, I learned more from sitting behind you in Ec 10 than from the class," a classmate, Suzanne Powell Bishopric, wrote in a report for a Class of 1975 reunion that takes place next month. (Mr. Bernanke isn't attending.)
Dale W. Jorgenson taught Mr. Bernanke econometrics at Harvard and supervised his senior thesis, which used economic models to examine natural-gas pricing -- a timely topic in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis.
Mr. Bernanke lived in Winthrop House, a dorm along the Charles River, where classmates included Lloyd C. Blankfein, now C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs (who didn't know Mr. Bernanke well).
At Mr. Jorgenson's direction, Mr. Bernanke entered the Ph.D. program in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Fellow graduate students there included Paul Krugman and Kenneth S. Rogoff, who would become two of the best-known economists of their generation. (Mr. Krugman also writes a column for The New York Times.)
Alexander S. Kelso Jr., who shared an M.I.T. office with Mr. Bernanke, says his classmate "may have been the smartest one of us, but he had plenty of competition."
In 1978, Mr. Bernanke married Anna Friedmann, whom he had met on a blind date. A Wellesley alumna, she had been born in Rome, the daughter of Jewish refugees from Croatia, and grew up in Denver.
Mr. Bernanke's 1979 dissertation explained why firms delay decisions to invest in times of uncertainty. He turned down Harvard for a job at Stanford's business school. (His wife, a Spanish teacher, received a master's in Spanish from Stanford and recently founded a school for disadvantaged teenagers.)
"He was an extremely good teacher from the first," says Jeremy I. Bulow, a friend from M.I.T. who joined Stanford's business school at the same time and still teaches there. "He's probably had to make an effort to learn how to be less clear to do his current job."
Stanley Fischer, Mr. Bernanke's adviser at M.I.T., had urged his student to read "The Great Contraction, 1929-1933," in which Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz blamed the Fed's failure to expand the money supply for the Depression's severity and duration.
The book ignited a passion.
"I guess I am a Depression buff, the way some people are Civil War buffs," Mr. Bernanke once wrote.
In his writings, Mr. Bernanke explained how credit market disruptions -- in particular, bank failures and debt deflation -- worsened the depth and length of the Depression, and identified a "financial accelerator," the idea that conditions in financial markets amplify developments in the real economy.
In 1985, he left Stanford for Princeton. His children -- Joel, born in 1982, and Alyssa, born in 1986 -- enrolled in public schools, and for six years he served on the school board in Montgomery Township, N.J.
It was not his only taste of leadership. In 1996, he became chairman of Princeton's economics department, where he helped strengthen the finance program.
"There's a very strong group of egos here, so to get anything done requires a certain amount of diplomatic ability," recalls Harvey S. Rosen, Mr. Bernanke's predecessor as department chairman.

"Bernanke is normal, which is fairly abnormal in that position," says John Hope Bryant, a financial literacy advocate who credits Mr. Bernanke for speaking on that topic last June in Anacostia, a low-income neighborhood in southeast Washington.
And, colleagues say, he has grown wiser about how reality has a habit of intruding on well-formed academic theories about the economy.
"Maybe early on, there were some who believed Ben did not fully appreciate the rhythms of the markets," says Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who has been Mr. Bernanke's liaison to Wall Street. "But he sure understands the flows of the markets now."

Full text: Investors, who had started the week reassured by the huge rescue of Europe's indebted nations, expressed second thoughts on Friday, sending markets lower and further devaluing the euro on concerns that the austerity measures required by the bailout would stunt the Continent's already anemic economic growth.
The euro fell to its lowest level in 18 months, and bank stocks on both sides of the Atlantic took a beating.
Investors seemed fearful that the $957 billion bailout package for Greece and other nations, while providing short-term protection against default, might drag out the economic pain and hurt the financial system in the process.
A continued hammering of the euro would make European exports cheaper, but the side effect would be weaker American exports, potentially dragging the United States -- and the rest of the world -- back toward recession.
"What you get is markets worrying about a whole cascading of weakness stemming from Europe being transmitted through the euro to the United States," said Martin Murenbeeld, chief economist at DundeeWealth Economics in Toronto.
One by one on Friday, markets across Asia, Europe and then the United States sank lower under the renewed pessimism about European growth and the instability stemming from the Continent.
The price of oil continued to fall as traders bet on slower global growth, and gold continued to rise as an asset perceived by investors as a safer, long-term store of value in times of stress.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been seesawing since the rescue package was announced on Monday, declined 162.79 points, or 1.51 percent, to 10,620.16 on Friday.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.76 points, or 1.88 percent, to 1,135.68.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 47.51 points, or 1.98 percent, to 2.346.85.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 20/32, to 100 12/32. The yield fell to 3.45 percent, from 3.53 percent late Thursday.
Bank stocks led the market decline, mainly over worries about Europe. Another factor might have been the Senate's approval of a proposal on Thursday that could cut bank revenue by imposing limits on fees they can charge businesses to process debit card transactions.
The Senate also approved an initiative to end reliance on major credit rating agencies, putting further pressure on financial stocks.
Last Friday, United States markets gave back all their gains for the year amid the immediate concerns over European defaults. Then on Monday, they roared back at the opening bell on the news of the nearly trillion-dollar intervention, sending the Dow up 404.71 points.
Despite Friday's losses, the Dow still managed to end the week up 239.73 points and is up 1.84 percent so far this year.
The S.& P. 500 finished 24.8 points higher for the week and is up 1.85 percent so far this year. The Nasdaq was up 81.21 points for the week and is up 3.42 percent so far this year.
In European trading on Friday, the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue chips ended the session down 3.7 percent. In Paris, stocks slumped 4.6 percent; in London, the FTSE 100 lost 3.1 percent; and in Germany, the benchmark DAX index lost 3.1 percent of its value. The stock market in Spain fell 6.6 percent.
The euro had rallied briefly to start the week, signaling initial enthusiasm about the rescue package. But then it dropped steadily as the week wore on and fell again on Friday, to $1.2385.
Since the start of the year, the currency has fallen 13 percent against the dollar and 14 percent against the yen.
Economists have begun worrying that the dollar's appreciation might push up the price of American exports to Europe enough to place a further drag on growth in the United States.
The sharp worldwide market decline came only five days after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund hoped their package would signal a "shock and awe" commitment to ending the Continent's crisis.
But economists said that while the package had eased concerns that countries like Greece would encounter trouble in rolling over old debts or borrowing new money, it had done nothing to help them grow.
"It's not a game changer, just a game extender," said Jim Caron, the global head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley.
As far as the markets are concerned, Mr. Caron said, "It does not fix the problem of whether Europe will be able to climb out of this hole."
There was also a growing worry Friday about how governments would find the $957 billion to pay for the rescue package, economists said, and a growing suspicion that central banks might eventually resort to allowing inflation to lessen groaning debt loads.
The European Central Bank agreed to help calm the financial turmoil by buying government bonds for the first time in its history this week.
Some economists regard that step as a troubling departure from the bank's mandate to focus solely on price stability, and as a result is adding to the pressures undermining the euro.
"The reputation of the E.C.B. has been dented," said Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Although the market swoon amounted to an unwelcome return to the turmoil that preceded the bailout package, Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York, emphasized that Friday's decline was different in that it did not involve a big sell-off in government bonds.
Interest rates on bonds in Greece, Spain, Portugal and other countries had risen sharply in recent weeks as investors feared governments might default on their debts. The rescue package appears to have quieted those fears somewhat. But now investors seem to be worried about a slowdown in growth caused by governments cutting back spending.
On Friday, finance officials from the Group of 7 nations, including the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, met by conference call to discuss the continuing market turmoil. They did not comment publicly afterward, however.
The uneasy mood in the markets was not helped by remarks by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now an adviser to the Obama administration, who in a speech in London on Thursday raised the possibility of a "potential disintegration of the euro."
There are also indications that the rescue deal has worsened tensions among the European capitals.
El Pais, the Spanish newspaper, reported Friday that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France had pressured Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to back the rescue effort, pounding his fist and saying France would leave the common currency without Germany's support.
At a news conference in Zagreb, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, described the El Pais report as "rubbish."
But with rumors like that swirling through markets, investors were saddled with uncertainty, a sure prescription for selling.

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of people filing for jobless benefits fell only slightly last week, the Labor Department said Thursday, maintaining the year's modest downward trend.
Initial claims for state unemployment aid slipped 4,000, to 444,000, in the week ended May 8, the department said, above the 440,000 that economists had been expecting.
"The labor market is clearly improving, but it has a long, long way to go before it gets to any semblance of normalcy," said Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.
The four-week moving average, which smoothes out weekly fluctuations, fell by 9,000, to 450,500, the department said.
Though claims continued to fall, the number of people still receiving jobless benefits after an initial week of aid unexpectedly rose 12,000, to 4.63 million, in the week ended May 1, the department said.
In a second report, the department said import prices increased 0.9 percent last month, on higher petroleum costs, after rising 0.5 percent in March. Excluding the volatile petroleum category, prices were up 0.3 percent.
"In spite of higher commodity costs, prices for imported finished goods appear sluggish, suggesting firms' pricing power remains limited," said Anna Piretti, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
The tame inflation outlook was underscored by the mild rise in nonpetroleum import prices, which were up 3.3 percent in the 12 months through April.
Analysts generally expect the strength of the dollar and excess capacity in the global economy to keep a lid on prices of imported merchandise, excluding petroleum.
The department also said export prices rose 1.2 percent in April, building on the previous month's 0.7 percent advance. In the 12 months through April, export prices increased 5.7 percent, the largest gain since July 2008.
Separately, in another positive sign for the economy, lenders initiated far fewer new actions against struggling homeowners last month, RealtyTrac said Thursday.
April foreclosure filings fell 9 percent from March and 2 percent from a year ago, the first year-over-year drop since RealtyTrac started tracking annual foreclosure rates in January 2006.

Abstract: "The trade deficit may have widened in March, but this was a positive report for the U.S. and global growth outlook," Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said in a research note. According to Bloomberg News, James P.

Full text: Wall Street indexes climbed higher on Wednesday amid new evidence that the United States economy could be staging a recovery.
"The rally is pretty much across the board," Peter Cardillo, a chief market economist at Avalon Partners, said. "It appears that some of the fear factors that have been in the market have started to subside a bit."
Global markets have been buffeted by weeks of uncertainty over the European debt crisis. And worries about the possibility of inflation from governments printing money to ease deficits persisted. That led gold prices to another record high, rising $6.05 to $1,238.93 an ounce.
"It is a bit of an insurance policy against the financial market broadly," said Bart Melek, global commodity strategist for BMO Capital Markets.
William Smith, president of Smith Asset Management, said he thought much of the rush to buy gold was now momentum trading, and attention could return to stock markets in America.
"The United States economy is way stronger than most people think," said Mr. Smith, referring to the higher equities market. "Corporate earnings are unbelievable. We are going back to where we were before the circus event of last week."
The latest economic data released Wednesday supported that view. The government reported that America's trade deficit widened in March, but it also showed a 3.2 percent increase in exports.
"The trade deficit may have widened in March, but this was a positive report for the U.S. and global growth outlook," Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said in a research note. "It showed sharp increases in both export and import volumes, indicating that the world trade recovery still has plenty of momentum."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 148.65 points, or 1.38 percent, to 10,896.91. The Dow has recovered all of its losses since it plunged nearly 1,000 points in less than 20 minutes on Thursday.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.37 percent, or 15.88 points, to 1,171.67 and the Nasdaq rose 2.0 percent, or 49.71 points, to 2,425.02.
Shares in Morgan Stanley fell 2 percent to $27.80 after The Wall Street Journal reported that prosecutors were looking into several mortgage-based investments the firm created several years ago.
According to Bloomberg News, James P. Gorman, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday, "We have no reason to believe there is any substance behind any supposed investigation that appeared in The Wall Street Journal article."
Mr. Cardillo noted that the financial sector appeared to have been spared any immediate impact. "The rise today is pretty much across the board," he said.
Technology shares led the rise. I.B.M. was 4.5 percent higher at $132.68 and Intel rose 3.6 percent to $23.09. Cisco was up 3 percent at $26.74 in anticipation of its earnings report, which was released after the markets closed.
Industrials and energy stocks were also strong. Exxon Mobil was actively traded, ending up 0.7 percent at $64.91.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 100 14/32. The yield rose to 3.55 percent, from 3.52 percent late Tuesday.
Crude oil spot prices fell 72 cents, to $75.65 a barrel.
The euro continued to struggle, trading at $1.26 against the dollar.
Still, European stock markets seemed to stabilize after Spain announced budget cuts and Portugal had a successful bond sale. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 1.24 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London was up 0.92 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris gained 1.1 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt rose 2.41 percent.
As part of an effort involving the European Union and International Monetary Fund to give European nations like Greece time to sort out their troubled finances, the European Central Bank said it would buy government and corporate bonds directly "to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional."

Full text: SHANGHAI -- Data from China released on Tuesday showed explosive growth in some segments of the country's economy, renewing concerns that Beijing may have to do more to prevent it from overheating.
China's National Bureau of Statistics said that retail sales and bank lending soared in April, while pressure on inflation rose. It also said that home prices jumped a record 12.8 percent from a year earlier, despite many measures aimed at cooling the sizzling property market.
Analysts say the new data will probably increase pressure on Beijing to raise interest rates and allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate against the dollar -- a move that would make imports cheaper but exports more expensive.
"Right now, the growth is very strong," said Wang Tao, an analyst at UBS Securities in Beijing. "The lending number was bigger than expected. We're expecting a rate hike in June."
It was the latest indication that China's economy had more than recovered from the global recession and was booming, much as it was in 2007 and early 2008. In the first quarter of this year, China's gross domestic product jumped 11.9 percent compared with the same period in 2009.
The Tuesday data showed that retail sales climbed 18.5 percent in April, and the People's Bank of China said that domestic banks had issued about 774 billion renminbi in new loans, or about $113 billion. In March, banks issued about 510 billion renminbi in such loans.
Industrial production and fixed-asset investment -- two main measures of growth -- each slowed slightly in April from their pace in March but remained robust, growing 17.8 and 25.6 percent from a year earlier.
The new statistics are fueling a debate among economists about whether China's economy is a bubble about to burst or the engine of sustained global growth.
Many economists credit Beijing with managing its growth relatively well over the last year. But Chinese officials have expressed serious concern in recent months about soaring property prices and the threat they pose to the economy and social stability.
For months, the government has been introducing new measures aimed at taming the property market, like requiring home owners to make larger down payments. It has also raised the prospect of introducing property taxes.
But prices have continued to rise at a spectacular pace. In April, for instance, the government said home prices in 70 large and medium-size Chinese cities had risen 12.8 percent, climbing for the 11th consecutive month.
"They've just announced several property measures, so we'll probably see a little correction in prices in May," said Wang Qian, an analyst at JPMorgan.
Also of concern is the consumer price index, which rose 2.8 percent in April -- indicating greater inflationary pressure. Banks have already been told to put more reserves aside, which should reduce money available for lending, and slow thus purchases.
Analysts say the government is facing the delicate task of reining in property prices without undermining an important driver of economic growth.
The Shanghai composite index has tumbled 19 percent this year (after an 80 percent jump in 2009) amid fears that the government's steps to cool the economy will clip profits. The index is down more than 20 percent from its peak in November.
But the rest of the economy seems oblivious. In April, China sold about 1.1 million passenger cars -- 32 percent more than in the same month a year earlier.
And on Monday, the government said it had recorded a $1.7 billion trade surplus for April, rebounding from a monthly trade deficit of $7.2 billion in March -- the first such deficit the country had recorded in years.
Beijing is under growing pressure from the United States and the European Union to allow its currency to appreciate. American and European officials have complained that China is keeping its currency artificially weak, making its exports more competitive and harming competitors trying to climb out of the recession.
After letting the renminbi appreciate gradually against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, the Chinese government has kept the currency at about 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008.
But recently, Chinese officials signaled that the government could allow the currency to appreciate soon.
Many analysts expect that to begin within weeks -- especially since the American secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, are scheduled to visit China this month for the so-called Strategic Economic Dialogue.
"It may happen by then," Ms. Wang said. "The trade numbers for China showed a surplus in April again, and so it seems the fundamentals are right for appreciation to happen."

TO many people, the notion of living without oil -- at least the various forms of oil sloshing around in their cars and S.U.V.'s -- is a scratchy-shirt, nuts-and-twigs kind of idea. But with electric vehicles of various degrees -- pure battery, hybrids and plug-in hybrids -- on the way from major automakers, more drivers will be finding out how scratchy that shirt might be.
As the wide variety of designs poised for delivery indicates, there is no general agreement bouncing through the drivosphere over which technology will be the one to deliver us onto a squeaky-clean, chirping-bird Electric Avenue. For many, myself included, the answer seems simple. Plug-in hybrids are here -- well, almost -- now.
While it is true that a lot of coal stands to be burned recharging the batteries of these cars, let me point out that they can also wring many of their miles from cheap, potentially carbon-free energy sources -- like those 36 sparkly blue photovoltaic panels on the roof of my Southern California home.
Typically, the plug-in hybrids on their way to showrooms will enable the first 10, 20 or even 50 miles of a trip to be electron-based, which in my case would be spotlessly solar-powered. Effectively these would be electric cars for most of my driving -- short around-town errands -- yet retain the useful range of a gas-powered vehicle for those few times a year when I pack up the family and head over the river and through the wood to Grandmother's house.
A plug-in car, of course, is optimized for neither type of trip. The weight of its gas engine cuts into the distance it can drive in battery-only mode, and the mass of the extra batteries squanders some petroleum when the engine is providing the drive power.
On the balance, though, a plug-in makes sense for my situation. And thanks to the solar array that generates enough electricity to power this 3,200-square-foot home -- our family is close to being "off the grid" for a Los Angeles residence -- I would also come closer to being freed from oil dependency.
Toyota, which has the biggest footprint on the hybrid field, is promising to sell a conservative plug-in Prius to the public in 2012. The Chevrolet Volt, which General Motors says will drive 40 miles on its battery pack before a gas-powered generator takes over, is poised to hum off the assembly line late in 2010, hungry for available wattage. The Fisker Karma, an $88,000 plug-in luxury sedan, is also scheduled for delivery late this year. And last week Volkswagen announced that the Blue-E-Motion, based on the Golf, would be offered in the United States in 2013.
A number of independent companies already offer conversions that transform existing hybrids into plug-ins with the addition of battery packs and associated power control hardware. A converted car can fuel up from a wall outlet, topping off its batteries with electricity from the utility grid, or in my case, power that is homegrown.
To learn whether this was more theory than reality, I spent a week driving a 2005 Toyota Prius converted by Plug-In Solutions of San Juan Capistrano, Calif., which offers a system designed to allow electric-only driving as far as 50 miles at up to 52 miles per hour. By virtue of sheer numbers, the 2004-9 Prius is the popular basis for conversions: in those four calendar years, nearly 750,000 were sold in the United States, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
The Plug-In conversion uses all of the factory-installed Toyota electrical parts, mechanical parts and software, with some additional tricks. A 300-pound bank of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, made by China Aviation Lithium Battery, is stowed in the compartment behind the rear seat, over the spare-tire cavity but under the floor. To accommodate the extra weight, stiffer rear springs are installed.
A 110-volt charger goes underneath the battery pack in the now-empty spare-tire cubby (an aerosol inflator replaces the spare), where it also warms the batteries in cold weather. A discreet plug in the rear bumper provides the electrical connection.
As built by Toyota, the nickel-metal-hydride battery of this second generation Prius has an electrical capacity of about 1.3 kilowatt hours -- the power equivalent of 13 100-watt bulbs left on for an hour in your teenager's bedroom. In the interest of battery life, the Prius's control software limits how deeply the battery can be charged and discharged. Less than half of its 1.3 kilowatt hours is available to move the car, Toyota says.
The conversion by Plug-In adds 10 kilowatt-hours to the overall electrical capacity. An owner whose daily commute is less than 25 miles each way and does not include freeways or steep hills could theoretically get through the work week without burning any gasoline or having to recharge at the office.
How much will it cost to refill the battery pack? At the average cost of electricity in the United States, about 11 cents per kilowatt hour, it's just over a dollar a fill-up -- about 2 cents a mile. In California, electricity averages about 16 cent per kilowatt hour, making the cost slightly over 3 cents a mile.
The converted Prius has three driving modes: all-electric, blended and standard Prius. Selecting the all-electric mode with the tiny toggle on the top of the dashboard limits the top speed and acceleration. Only the 76-horsepower electric motor is moving the car in this mode, so the initial acceleration is best described as eventual.
On my first outings in stoplight-to-stoplight traffic, I often found myself tapping my fingers on the steering wheel. As speed gathers, the Prius does a reasonable job of keeping pace with the flow up to its 52-m.p.h limit.
Because of a quirk in the software marriage between the stock Prius and the plug-in system, it is necessary to stop completely, shut off the car and reboot out of all-electric mode should you want to go, say, 53 m.p.h. On most local trips this is not a big problem; you just have to know where you are going, as you would for any daily trip. Even the archeological pace of initial acceleration soon becomes routine.
Blended mode, activated by a rocker switch illuminated in red just left of the steering column, feels like driving any other second-generation Prius, but with an added 25-50 m.p.g. showing on the LCD mileage display. The system uses as much battery power as possible, delaying the signal to spin up the gasoline engine until absolutely necessary. Plug-In Solutions says that blended mode can yield more than 100 m.p.g. and that the car can run this way for up to 100 miles.
My results differed. Keeping up with traffic on Interstates 5 and 405 required speeds of 75-80 m.p.h. on the 56-mile trip between my home and Plug-In's headquarters. And relatively little of my mileage was spent at slower urban speeds. Final mileage was 67.2 mpg for the full tank (nearly 700 miles), but I routinely saw readings over 80 m.p.g. on the dashboard display.
When the auxiliary battery pack starts to run low -- the 50-mile range seemed plausible based on my week of varied driving -- the car switches over to the native Prius mode, relying more on the gas engine. The gasoline engine-generator cannot recharge the auxiliary battery pack; you'll have to plug into a 110-volt outlet for that, a 10-hour process when the battery is depleted.
Driving on the batteries alone requires a modicum of practice. I managed to run the rolling Pacific Coast Highway north of Malibu in the all-electric setting for about 35 miles, after burning a significant part of the auxiliary battery's charge in blended mode on the way north from Los Angeles. The speed limitation of 52 m.p.h on battery power gave me just enough margin to stay with traffic.
The full 10-kilowatt-hour system in the car I tested costs $11,995 with the battery pack, or $6,995 without batteries. A 4-kilowatt-hour system is $6,995 with batteries, $3,200 without. Estimates for installation from several of the 20 dealer-installers around the country started at $1,000. The systems carry a three-year warranty, which does not cover the batteries (those are warranted by the battery maker).
The company says that because the system does not alter the Toyota hybrid components, it should not affect the car's factory warranty. This is not a clear-cut matter, though. A Toyota spokeswoman, Jana Hartline, said that the company's policy calls for a case-by-case evaluation of whether a modification has caused a particular failure.
The I.R.S. allows a tax credit equal to 10 percent of the cost of converting a vehicle to a qualified plug-in electric-drive motor vehicle. The maximum credit, which runs through 2011, is $4,000. Some states have game-changing tax credits as well. Colorado offers an 85 percent credit, up to $6,000, for conversions.
What makes the most sense to me is choosing the 4-kilowatt-hour system that Plug-In Solutions sells, as the major benefits of a plug-in hybrid system accrue in the first 10-15 miles of each trip. Converting the car your family uses for the most frequent, shortest-distance trips -- to mall, school or market -- offers the best value.
Remember those solar panels on my roof? Since the system was installed about three years ago, our electric bill has averaged $166. A year. We make virtually all the power we consume -- and that's in a house with two adults, two teenagers, four flat-screen HDTVs, seven computers -- you get the idea.
The cost? After I factored in second-mortgage-interest, tax writeoffs and inflation over the 40-year projected life of the system, it looks like we'll save about $78,000 compared with the cost of buying electricity from the utility. And prices of systems have plunged since we took the plunge: our 6 kilowatt system that cost about $39,000 three years ago is about $28,000 today.
Is it worth it to convert your existing Prius when plug-in hybrids from established automakers seem just around the corner? It depends on your Prius. If you already have one you love -- ideally, one that happens to be out of warranty -- it just might make sense. Or, for a little more than $6,000 you could turn a $15,000 used Toyota into a near-zero carbon conveyance that's still capable of taking off for Burning Man when the spirit moves.

Full text: For all the recent talk about recovery, the economy's vulnerability was on full -- at times stomach-dropping -- display this week.
Job growth was up sharply in April, but unemployment also rose, as the number of out-of-work job seekers overwhelmed the number of jobs on offer. The stock market, which had surged most of this year, gyrated and sold off steeply, driven down mainly by fears of contagion from the Greek debt crisis.
For several minutes on Thursday, the market went into a tailspin, apparently accelerated by computerized trading strategies. By the end of the day on Friday, it had suffered a 771-point drop over four days and was down 5.7 percent for the week, its worst weekly decline in more than a year.
Political leadership also was put to the test this week, with uninspiring results. European leaders finally agreed to a rescue package for Greece, but there are serious fears that it may be too little and too late to stop the crisis from spreading.
In the United States, senators began a series of votes on a bill to reform the financial system; more votes are to come and a strong bill could still emerge. But for now it's not clear if lawmakers will do all that is needed to protect the taxpayers from another meltdown or bow to the banks and their lobbyists.
Both Congress and the White House need to show strong leadership. Congress has yet to make good on its promise to pass broad legislation to boost employment. What is needed is bolstered aid to states and an extension of unemployment benefits through the end of the year, as well as programs targeted on small-business lending, infrastructure projects, green technology and summer youth jobs.
Without a concerted job creation effort, recovery cannot take hold. The economy added an impressive 290,000 jobs in April, but job losses from 2008 to 2010 were so deep that it would take more than four years of monthly growth of that magnitude just to fill the hole.
On the Greek debt crisis and the threat of spillover damage, Europeans must take the lead. But Washington must use its considerable influence, as well as the strength of its example.
Bailouts and stimulus are contentious here. Republicans are determined to play their faux deficit hawk role -- despite the utter hypocrisy and destructiveness -- through the November polls. Expansionary policy, and its corollary, higher inflation, are especially distressing to European powers given their dark history. The potential alternatives -- renewed, deep recession and rifts in the euro-era -- would be even worse.
Market regulators must also act quickly to monitor and rein in trading techniques that may provoke the kind of volatility seen on Thursday. So-called high-frequency trading, flash trading and dark pools all employ a combination of speed, privileged information and opacity -- violating principles of market fairness, transparency and efficiency. That is unacceptable under any circumstances, but especially dangerous now, when nervous markets are prone to panic.
And, yes, all this must occur against the backdrop of debate on financial reform. The past week provided more evidence, if any more were needed, that the system is still in need of repair.

Full text: Combine one part nervous traders, one part Greek crisis and one part trader error. Stir in one part central bank complacency. Bring to boil. Panic.
That combination produced one of the wildest days ever in financial markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average, at one point, down almost 1,000 points while the euro sank to its lowest level in more than a year. There were substantial declines in emerging markets, whose economies had seemed to be booming, and in developed markets fearful of renewed recessions.
Even though a substantial part of the worst plunge appeared to be linked to a trader error -- one $40 stock fell for a time to one penny -- prices had fallen around the world even before such mistakes began to happen.
It appears that investors are again growing more hesitant to own assets like stocks and bonds, particularly since many now cost far more than they did only a few months ago. Another sharp retrenchment by investors, consumers and businesses could threaten the current global recovery by choking off financing and new orders for companies.
For much of the last 14 months, the prices of risky assets around the world have been rising rapidly. That recovery, from lows reached in March 2009 amid talk of a new Great Depression, both reflected and encouraged a revival in economic activity. Manufacturers in most countries this week reported rapidly growing order books.
The most recent recession was made in the United States, and to a large extent it was unmade here as well. If it was the subprime mortgage market and other credit excesses that sent markets reeling, it was also a willingness of the American government, including the Federal Reserve Board, to plow in money when fears were at their highest that helped to bring those markets and economic activity back.
For the last several months, worries have been alternately rising and receding that the next crisis would be made in Europe, where Greece has faced the possibility of default. Europe and the International Monetary Fund have announced plans for a bailout, but there have also been riots in Greece amid anger over the steep budget cuts being forced on the country.
On Thursday, Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference that the bank's governing council had not even discussed the possibility of buying government bonds. That was taken as a disappointment by some traders, who had hoped the central bank would follow the Fed's lead in spreading liquidity around if conditions grew worse.
Instead, fears are growing that Europe, which is worried that the crisis in Greece could be followed ones in Portugal and Spain, will follow the pattern laid down by the United States government in 2007, when officials offered frequent reassurances that the subprime mortgage problem was "contained" but delayed taking the bold action that finally did stop the panic.
The height of panic on Thursday was reached shortly after lunchtime in the United States. First some currencies began to fall rapidly, with the euro suffering especially against the Japanese yen.
That could have been an indication that some large traders were unwinding positions. It has been popular to borrow yen at low interest rates and then use the money to speculate in higher yielding assets denominated in other currencies. Anyone unwinding such a trade would buy yen to repay the loan.
Then, within a few minutes, the United States stock market appeared to be collapsing. Some of the decline was real, but another part of it was simply trading gone awry.
Temporary plunges in the price of Procter & Gamble and 3M, the former Minnesota Mining, cost the Dow about 300 points, and appeared to be the result of errors, not intentional sell orders. Similarly, Accenture, a large consulting firm, fell from more than $40 a share to one penny.
By the close of the day, the Dow was down 347.80 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,520.32.
There were also substantial declines in most major European and Asian indexes. In Greece, however, the stock market put on a small rebound after falling to a 13-month low on Wednesday.
Europe faces many obstacles in trying to deal with the growing crisis there. The European Central Bank, which handles monetary policy for the 16 countries in the euro zone, has fewer powers than the Fed does, and there is no Europe-wide government with powers to act quickly. Even now, after months of talking, the Greek bailout has not been approved by all whose approval is needed. The German parliament is expected to approve it on Friday.
Moreover, the American crisis developed before budget deficits spiraled upward. Coming up with cash now would be harder, a fact Mr. Trichet pointed to when he called on European governments to cut their budget deficits.
Spending large amounts of cash to bail out European governments is unlikely to be popular with voters in countries that are not in trouble, but a failure to do so could threaten many financial institutions around the continent.
A traditional way to reduce debt is to devalue currencies, which leaves the outstanding debt worth less. Countries in the euro zone cannot do that, which is one reason Greece is in such difficulty.
But some investors seem to expect that eventually worldwide inflation will form a significant part of the solution, enabling governments and other debtors to pay back loans with currencies worth less than when the loans were made. In the last three days, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost 6 percent of its value, the price of 30-year inflation-indexed Treasury security has risen by almost 4 percent.
There is no way to know whether this week's jitters will be put aside as more good economic news is released, or whether Europe's woes will create a repeat of the growing panic that engulfed American markets not that long ago.
In the second case, this could be another one of those times when markets move from one extreme to the other. In the fall of 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent investors fleeing. The following spring, hopes that the bailouts and stimulus plans were working helped to begin a strong bull market in nearly every asset category.
If this is another turning point, some of the winners will be those who, by luck or vision, managed to sell securities while the selling was easy. On Tuesday, Beazer Homes, a builder that was almost given up for dead in 2009 -- when its shares traded for less than 25 cents -- managed to raise $350 million selling new shares and new bonds. The money will go to refinance debt that otherwise could have forced the company into bankruptcy.
By the close on Thursday, investors who bought shares at that offering, paying $5.81, had lost almost 10 percent of their money as the stock closed at $5.25.
All this is taking place as the Senate debates financial reform amid considerable public hostility to banks. That no doubt will lead some on Wall Street to say that the markets are warning against making regulation too harsh, but the wild gyrations also serve as a reminder that the efficient markets hypothesis is not a very good model of what actually happens.
Markets turn out to be very bad at assessing values under some circumstances. They were far too optimistic is 2006, and ridiculously pessimistic in early 2009.
That is not a reason to get rid of markets, if only because any alternative, like letting judges and government officials set values, would likely be worse. But it does serve as a counterpoint to the infatuation with markets that led to the creation of a virtually unregulated shadow financial system. Those who believe in regulation will point to that, and say that if this wild ride continues, it will provide further evidence that markets need adult supervision.

Abstract: Whoever wins will be forced to make deep and unpopular cuts, a task made all the more difficult if the closely contested election produces a hung Parliament or a fragile coalition government that could delay important economic decisions.

Full text: LONDON -- Even with rioters on the streets of Athens and the 16 countries using the euro threatened with mounting turmoil, the economy remained the most frequently -- and least candidly -- discussed topic here as the three main parties entered the last hours of a monthlong general election campaign.
Much of the wrangling centered on arguments about which party was hiding most from the voters on the true state of the economy and its plans for dealing with it. With government deficits in Britain second in Europe only to those of Greece, some analysts even suggested that this might be a good election to lose.
But one conclusion seemed clear: Whoever wins will be forced to make deep and unpopular cuts, a task made all the more difficult if the closely contested election produces, as many commentators have forecast, a hung Parliament or a fragile coalition arrangement that might delay important economic decisions.
"This is a ticking time bomb," said Ruth Lea, an economic adviser at the Arbuthnot Banking Group who worked at the Treasury in London in 1976 when Britain, in its worst financial crisis since World War II, was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for assistance. "If the next government does not come to grips with this, the I.M.F. will have to come in. I remember, it was very, very humiliating."
If victory on Thursday could be a poisoned chalice, there has been little in the last-minute campaigning by the three main contenders for 10 Downing Street -- Prime Minister Gordon Brown for Labour, the Conservative opposition leader David Cameron and the Liberal Democrats' leader, Nick Clegg -- to suggest it. On the contrary, veteran political reporters said they could not recall a campaign since at least 1992 that involved such a frantic dash to the finish line, above all by the man who is heavily favored to win the largest bloc in the 650-seat House of Commons, Mr. Cameron.
He campaigned through the night on Tuesday, racing from one encounter with night-shift workers to another.
Mr. Cameron, at least, is no stranger to financial crises. At 43, and like many of those likely to serve in a Conservative cabinet, he has limited experience in government. But he was an aide in the Treasury on what became known as "Black Wednesday" in 1992, when the pound sterling was withdrawn from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism at cost of more than $6 billion to British taxpayers.
While Mr. Cameron seems most likely to emerge from Thursday's vote as prime minister, it is far from a done deal. Polls in recent days have shown the Conservatives pulling out a narrow lead of about 5 percentage points. The polls have shown Labour and the Liberal Democrats vying for second place, with their ratings one side or another of about 30 percent of the vote.
All three party leaders have centered their campaigns on vague pledges to cut government spending, which has caused deficits on a scale not seen since World War II, when Britain fought Germany and Japan largely on borrowed money.
The comparisons with Greece begin with the current year's deficit, which at 11.5 percent of gross domestic product is not far off the 13.6 percent figure for Greece and considerably larger than the figures for Spain and Portugal, which some economists fear may be the next European countries bidding for international bailouts.
The immediate political liability for this lies with Mr. Brown and the Labour Party, which engaged in a spree of epic proportions after taking power in 1997, spending at a rate that has outstripped inflation by 41 percent. The current budget of about $1.1 trillion includes more than $150 billion on the state-run National Health Service, triple the amount when Labour came to power.
One in every four pounds the government spends is borrowed, a pattern that economists say will require the next government to make cuts on a scale not experienced since the Great Depression, as well as painful tax increases.
When these issues have been discussed at all in the campaign, it has usually been in the context of which of the parties could get away with being most evasive in setting out deficit-reduction plans that economists say fall far short of the cuts that will be needed.
One man who knows more than most about the scale of the problem is Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, Britain's central bank. David Hale, a Chicago-based economist, said last week that Mr. King had told him that "whoever wins will be out of power for a whole generation because of how tough the fiscal austerity will have to be." Mr. Hale, speaking on Australian television, met in off-the-record sessions with Lord King in London in March, according to a bank spokesmen, who did not deny the accuracy of the American's account.
Still, few people here think that the austerity measures needed to right the country's finances could lead to Greece-style chaos. One important measure, according to financial experts, is that interest rates on British treasury bonds have remained low at around 4 percent even as interest rates on Greek debt have at times soared well into double digits, reflecting market confidence that Britain's leaders will find responsible ways of reducing the debt.
Yet, the measures that will be needed are likely to require deep cuts in the public services on which the vast majority of Britain's 62 million people depend, as well as in the state-employed work force of more than six million. .
On the campaign trail, Mr. Brown has focused his fire on the Conservatives, saying their plans for sharp cuts immediately after the election would endanger the economic recovery in Britain.
But others say that delaying or restraining the cuts poses a greater risk. Kenneth Clarke, a former chancellor of the Exchequer and one of the few veterans of previous Conservative governments on Mr. Cameron's team, has said that any postponement in attacking the deficit could lead to a run on the pound and to Britain having to go cap-in-hand to the I.M.F., as a Labour government did in 1976.
But even Mr. Cameron has had to trim his sails. Among other things, he has fenced himself in by promising to continue to increase the politically sensitive National Health Service budget, and to protect Britain's "most vulnerable" people from cuts in social spending.
The Conservatives could emerge from the election short of a majority and dependent on the Liberal Democrats' support to govern. That could lead to an impasse, because Mr. Clegg favors huge defense cuts that the Conservatives are likely to reject, and he agrees with Labour on delaying the deepest cuts until the economic recovery is secure.
British commentators have said that one option for the Conservatives would be to take office with a minority government and go to Parliament within a matter of weeks, saying that their new access to details of the public finances had convinced them that much deeper cuts were required than even they realized. The prospect then would be for a second election in the autumn, in which voters would be asked for a mandate supporting the Conservative cuts.

Full text: The United States is a great distance from Greece, and its economy is moving in a better direction. But the subprime crisis showed how fast and how far local financial problems can spread. If the euro zone gets into real trouble, the United States may be safe-ish, but it can't hope to escape unscathed.
American investors got a sampling this week of what further deterioration in the euro zone could taste like. On the good side, investors rushed into perceived harbors: the dollar and Uncle Sam's own debt. On the bad side, the swoon in prices of American shares and corporate debt indicated the long reach of a foreign crisis.
An encumbered euro zone economy isn't good news for global growth, an essential ingredient in the still developing economic recovery in the United States. A new European recession would slow demand for American exports, which would be less competitive in any case, thanks to the crisis-strengthened dollar.
Then there is the interconnected global financial system. Few envisioned that lax lending standards for subprime loans would start a chain reaction ending in a global crisis and recession.
The European Union is trying to keep its problems local, by helping Greece and stamping out brush fires breaking out in Portugal and Spain. But troubles could spread rapidly, especially if European politicians balk at offering aid or some banks begin to buckle under their sovereign debt holdings. In a complex system, the woes might rapidly cross borders and oceans.
The International Monetary Fund's involvement in the bailout also means that the United States is stretching itself further. As the largest shareholder in the fund, it is effectively lending Greece money when private markets will not.
Of course, the United States government benefits from the crisis in one important way, at least for a while. If Europe were sound, investors would probably be more worried about the American fiscal deficit of $1.5 trillion, even if the latest budget news is more positive. Unfortunately, the ease of placing government debt could give policy makers the idea that huge deficits don't matter. They will, though, a crisis or two from now.
Art as an Indicator
Pablo Picasso was never called a financier. But the Spanish artist can now claim to teach a financial lesson. The $106.5 million sale of his "Nude, Green Leaves and Bust," a record price for the one-day masterpiece, underlines the disparate fortunes of the financial and the real economy.
Though Christie's did not reveal the painting's buyer, it was almost certainly an oligarch or hedge fund mogul. The auction house's chief pointed to "depth of buying from Russia, China and the Middle East." Christie's brought in nearly 30 percent more than the bottom of its expectations from the New York sale of 56 artworks.
Moreover, the gaggle of emerging market heavyweights like Roman Abramovich of Russia were said to be bidding against some of the hedge fund world's most prolific collectors, including the Citadel Investment founder Ken Griffin and the Connecticut billionaire trader Steven Cohen.
Although consumers in much of the world are still limping out of recession, the auction extravaganza is not all that surprising. The real world may still be licking its wounds, but the financial economy is in fine fettle.
Robust prices for financial assets may reflect easy money or hopes that the recent evidence of economic strength in the United States has entered a sort of V-shaped recovery. But whatever the reason, junk bonds are back at par for the first time in three years and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained nearly a third since last May's art sales. Then, Sotheby's fetched a quarter less than its presale low estimates and failed to find buyers for a Picasso painting and a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti.
There were unsold pieces at Tuesday's auction, suggesting that any bubble in the art market is concentrated around stars like Picasso. That, too, stands to reason, particularly in a period where currencies are perceived to be vulnerable to sovereign mishap or rising inflation. As financial theorists argue, specie backing for money does not have to have any intrinsic value, just a shared appreciation. And so the global financial elite have found their store of value -- in a nude mistress from Paris.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
PARIS -- A few weeks after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the world plunged into a financial crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany offered some common-sense advice to reckless bankers, indebted consumers and profligate governments.
"One should simply have asked a Swabian housewife," Mrs. Merkel said during an address to fellow Christian Democrats in December 2008 in the southwest German region of Swabia, hub of the Protestant work ethic. "She would have told us her worldly wisdom: in the long run, you can't live beyond your means."
Now, as Europe struggles to avoid its own Lehman experience -- saving Greece and thus the euro -- the episode says much about the Germans.
Led by France, European neighbors have been pressing for months for Germany, which has the Continent's biggest economy, to throw its financial weight behind a bailout package and a new system of economic governance for the euro zone. In the process, a reluctant Berlin has been called irresponsible, selfish and even un-European.
But if France wants Germany to be more European, Germany wants Europe to be more Swabian. To bring Europe to a compromise required a deal between Mrs. Merkel and a Frenchman, Dominique Strauss-Kahn of the International Monetary Fund, who met in Berlin last week to pull Greece and the euro zone back from the brink.
The Greek episode has heated up the long culture clash between the European Union's traditional drivers: federal Germany with its Prussian attachment to rules and an instinctive frugality rooted in past economic traumas, and republican France with its tradition of state intervention and a more Mediterranean attitude toward public debt.
Paris and Berlin have had many disagreements in the postwar world, but few are as deep-rooted as those on economic governance, said John C. Kornblum, a former United States ambassador to Germany.
"This comes from the gut, it's emotional," said Mr. Kornblum, who as assistant secretary of state for Europe in the 1990s watched successive French and German leaders spar over how to govern the future single currency.
If there is no political structure in place to safeguard the euro -- a weakness exposed in the current debt crisis -- Mr. Kornblum said it was because Germany and France could never agree on one. "There are profound philosophical differences between the two sides," he said.
These differences are in many ways personified by Mrs. Merkel, daughter of a Lutheran pastor, and two flamboyant Frenchmen: President Nicolas Sarkozy, a conservative, and Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist.
Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Strauss-Kahn are rivals and may even run against each other in the 2012 presidential election. But they share a belief in state intervention that unites most of the French political elite.
Mr. Sarkozy, a Gaullist whose millionaire friends and taste for expensive brands have not gone unnoticed across the Rhine, first roused German suspicions as finance minister in 2004 when he prevented a takeover by Siemens of Alstom, the French maker of trains.
As president, he allowed the budget deficit to rise above the 3 percent euro zone limit even before the economic crisis erupted, and he repeatedly criticized the European Central Bank's interest rate policy.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a native of a suburb of Paris who speaks German, has been called "Mr. Euro" in France and is credited with steering his country into the euro zone as finance minister in 1997. In Germany, he is also remembered for serving under President Jacques Chirac, a staunch advocate of a political counterweight to the European Central Bank.
So when the two men independently revived calls for an "economic government" of the 16 countries that share the euro, resistance in Germany was instinctive.
In a country where many lost their savings twice in the 20th century -- once to hyperinflation in 1923 and again to currency reform after World War II -- central bank independence and budgetary discipline have become part of the German narrative.
Fear of inflation and broad-based aversion to debt also help to explain a striking divergence in the perception of Germany's wealth at home and abroad. At 3.3 percent of gross domestic product, Germany's budget deficit is low by crisis standards and frequently cited as a justification to appeal to Berlin for solidarity with poorer countries.
In contrast, the French budget deficit has widened to 7.5 percent of G.D.P. But Germans, who have absorbed East Germany and face a declining population, do not feel rich.
"Germans fear going bankrupt themselves," said Mr. Kornblum, now a consultant in Berlin.
Jean-Pierre Jouyet, a former minister of European affairs who now leads the French stock market regulator, said: "The fundamental difference between France and Germany is that, for the French, budgetary, financial and currency stability is a means to an end. For the Germans it is an end in itself."
Mrs. Merkel, a physicist raised in communist East Germany, has a hard-working, parsimonious lifestyle and an analytical, somewhat bland personality that in many ways reflect the national value system, said Gerd Langguth, author of a 2005 biography of her.
While Mr. Sarkozy resides in the majestic Elysee Palace and has an army of staff members, Mrs. Merkel still lives in the central Berlin apartment she occupied before her election in 2005 and has been seen doing her own shopping.
There are limits to national stereotyping. Mrs. Merkel's more outgoing predecessor, Gerhard Schroder, made common cause with the French in breaking the euro zone's budgetary limit.
And no German could have defended the legacy of the Bundesbank more vigorously than the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, referred to by some in Paris as "that Frenchman in Frankfurt."
But understanding the radically different contexts in which German and French positions are honed is crucial as Europe's two foremost powers grapple with the crisis, said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of Bruegel, a research institute based in Brussels.
"Ultimately this is about whether Germany is ready to lead," he said. "And leading means compromising, rather than only insisting on red lines."

Correction: May 7, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the cultural traits that divide Germany from some of its European neighbors in the Greek debt crisis misidentified the birthplace of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Frenchman who is managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He was born in Neuilly, a suburb of Paris -- not in Alsace.

Full text: Call it Senator Edward M. Kennedy's final bequest.
The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or Class Act, the first national plan to help the great majority of Americans who have no insurance for long-term care, became law in March. Even though there was little fanfare -- the measure was just one piece of the broader health care overhaul -- the idea had been hugely important to Mr. Kennedy and his staff, who had been working on the current version of the plan since 2003.
The program underwent a number of changes during the health care debate, so some projections are now out of date. And many details have yet to be established by the secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, who is going to be one busy woman for the next couple of years.
But we do know enough to answer some basic questions. Four experts helped respond to some of the many queries from readers on the New Old Age blog. They are Howard Bedlin, vice president for advocacy at the National Council on Aging; Barbara Manard, a health economist with the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging; Jesse Slome, executive director of the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance; and Connie Garner, who after 17 years is about to leave her job on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
WHO'S ELIGIBLE? The simplest answer: Working people. Not those who are already retired (unless they continue to work part time), or nonworking spouses, or the unemployed. Participants must pay premiums for a vesting period of five years before they can receive benefits, and they have to continue working for three of those years.
Part-time workers are eligible, though they must earn enough each year to pay Social Security taxes, a threshold that is now about $1,200. The self-employed and anyone whose employer declines to offer Class Act coverage will also be able to sign up through a mechanism yet to be determined.
WHAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN ILLNESS OR DISABILITY? You can still enroll, as long as you can work for three years and pay premiums for five. The law prohibits excluding people with pre-existing conditions like diabetes.
WHEN DOES IT START? The act takes effect next Jan. 1, but the health and human services secretary has until October 2012 to present the full rules. Experts expect enrollment to begin in 2013.
WHAT WILL IT COST? We're all waiting for Ms. Sebelius and a panel to tell us. In November, the Congressional Budget Office assumed an average monthly premium of $123 (less for young enrollees, more for older ones).
That estimate is based on the assumption that only 5 to 6 percent of those eligible will participate. But that assumption may be conservative: Class is an "opt out" program, meaning that if your employer participates, you're automatically included unless you decline. Premiums will be lower if there are more people in the risk pool.
WHAT WILL IT PROVIDE? A cash benefit, to be determined by Ms. Sebelius. The Congressional Budget Office assumed a cash benefit of $75 a day, available once a participant needed help with two to three activities of daily living (eating, bathing, dressing, using the toilet, transferring from bed to chair to wheelchair, continence care) or the equivalent amount of assistance required because of cognitive impairment. The law says the average minimum benefit must be at least $50 a day. Once you qualify, those benefits continue as long as you need care. Remember that about 40 percent of the people receiving long-term care are not elderly; they're young people who have accidents or develop chronic illnesses, so a lifetime benefit can mean many years of payments. And yes, those benefits will rise with inflation.
Isn't that -- as Laurs2 from Florida commented in the blog -- a "pitifully inadequate" amount?
The Class Act was never intended to pay the full cost of 24-hour home care or a nursing home. But many disabled people can stay out of nursing homes, or delay admission, with moderate levels of assistance that supplement family care.
Even $50 a day could bring in a home care aide for a few hours to help with bathing, laundry or meals. It would also pay most of the cost of an adult day program ($67 a day). Nationally, the average cost of an assisted-living facility was $37,572 last year, according to the annual MetLife Market Survey; a $75 daily benefit would pay almost three-quarters of that.
HOW WILL IT BE PAID FOR? WON'T PREMIUMS AND COSTS INEVITABLY SOAR? The law specifically states that no tax dollars shall be used to support it; the premiums it takes in must pay for the benefits it pays out.
Since this represents the country's first effort at public long-term-care insurance, we can't say with assurance whether the optimists who helped get the law passed or the pessimists who tried to derail it are correct.
"It hasn't been tried," said Ms. Manard, the economist. "But what we have tried isn't working. We have to try something new."
WHAT IF SICK AND OLD PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR COVERAGE BUT YOUNG AND HEALTHY PEOPLE DON'T? This phenomenon, known as adverse selection, is a legitimate worry. People whom no private insurer would accept -- who already have diagnoses of, say, multiple sclerosis but can work part-time for three years -- are sure to jump in. They'd be foolish not to. But that is a problem only if too few others sign up and pay premiums.
So a marketing campaign for the Class Act will take aim at the young and the healthy -- many of whom will also unexpectedly need long-term care insurance.
Mr. Slome, who heads the insurance industry group, says that the law is a Trojan horse, that the government will eventually convert it into a tax-financed entitlement program. "Inevitably, it will morph into Medicare Part E," he said. Though the law prohibits the use of tax dollars, Mr. Slome said, "If you're 30 today and you think the rules aren't going to change in 50 years, you're living in a state that's legalized marijuana."
WHAT'S THE OUTLOOK? Long-term care insurance rarely comes cheap. Either you buy it earlier in life and pay less per year -- but for more years -- or you buy it later in life and pay much higher premiums. But it's far more expensive not to have it. Two-thirds of older Americans will need long-term care, the best projections indicate.
In a way, the Class Act will give the country an option as appealing or as unattractive as we deserve. If we understand that paying for long-term care is largely a personal responsibility, then large numbers of people will buy insurance through the Class Act, which becomes a sustainable, affordable and helpful program. If too many people close their eyes and shrug their shoulders, trusting that their children or Medicare or God or someone else will provide, the Class Act will run into trouble. And so will they and their families.
This is the fourth in a series of articles on how the health care overhaul will affect everyday lives. This week's author, Paula Span, writes the New Old Age blog, which can be found -- along with previous articles in the series -- at nytimes.com/health.

Full text: PARIS -- Greece, effectively bankrupt and with a European gun to its head, committed itself to years of austerity on Sunday when it signed a financial bailout deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.
But there are serious questions about whether the deep cuts in salaries and benefits the agreement calls for are politically sustainable over time, even as deflation will make it impossible for Greece to grow its way out of debt.
There is a consensus that the Greek economy is broken and needs major structural reform, and the deal done on Sunday is intended to give Athens a couple of years of breathing room to change the fundamental pattern of Greek behavior.
The government is now committed to whack back the public sector, including pensions and popular social benefits; to raise consumption taxes to record highs; and to promote tax reform, in an effort to shrink the enormous black market, reduce tax evasion and increase government receipts.
Some influential economists, however, fear that such harsh measures risk killing the patient, even as they see the intensity of Greek pain as a serious warning to other countries that use the euro to get their own economies in order before the currency union itself is undermined by rampaging market speculation.
This new wave of austerity also risks pushing the entire European Union into a period of artificially low growth just as economies are trying to recover from the recession of last year, caused by the huge housing and banking crisis that started in the United States. Negative or low growth will increase already sizable unemployment and put new pressure on government spending, as well as on the banks themselves, and make it harder for everybody to reduce their debts.
"How can Greece grow out of its debt if there is deflation?" asked Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. "Deflation increases the debt burden, so we are following this virtuous circle that is bringing us toward hell. Economics has nothing to do with virtue, which can kill an economy."
There is also some doubt whether this latest package of 110 billion euros over three years will be enough to calm the markets, which may then turn on other vulnerable countries, like Portugal or Spain.
Some countries that use the euro -- Germany, in particular -- need to pass legislation to come up with the money, although European Union officials said Sunday night that funding would be in place before May 19, when the next major tranche of Greek debt must be rolled over.
Embedded in the euro and thus no longer in control of its own currency, Greece cannot take the easy way out of its debt by devaluing. So Greece must either cut its spending sharply or default on its loans -- which would badly damage German and French banks carrying a lot of Greek debt.
That is considered one reason President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has been so quiet on the Greek crisis, Mr. Fitoussi said. The Greek deal "is an indirect way of bailing out French and German banks," he said. "The French understood this from the start, but Germany didn't seem to."
Katinka Barysch, an economist and deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, said that that realization had hit home in Germany. "It might be unpopular for the Germans and Europeans to bail out Greece, but it will be even more unpopular for them to bail out the banks that owned Greek bonds," she said.
Thomas Piketty, the founder of the Paris School of Economics and a professor there, thinks that the demands on Greece, driven by a market frenzy, are simply too high.
"Austerity can be justified, but 8 percent interest rates on a debt that amounts to more than 100 percent of gross domestic product is just crazy," he said. "They will have to restore their public finances and then pay back this huge debt at the same time -- and Greek debt amounts to so little when you compare it to what was needed to bail out the banks" last year.
"Not only is this not going to help growth, it's going to end very badly, politically speaking," Mr. Piketty said, referring to Greece. "Taxpayers cannot accept this in the long run."
On Sunday, the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, forecast a deeper than expected recession of 4 percent for 2010 and 2.6 percent in 2011, before the economy supposedly returns to growth of 1.1 percent in 2012. "We will be in recession for the next few years, which means that we have to run faster to reduce the deficit," he said.
But no one really knows what will happen in 2012, or if the Socialist government of Prime Minister George A. Papandreou, elected on a platform of increased prosperity, will still be in office. Standard & Poor's suggested last week that the euro value of Greece's gross domestic product may not return to last year's level until 2017.
"Unfortunately for economists, there is democracy," Mr. Fitoussi said. "If you impose too strict a program, the population will refuse." Some countries, he acknowledged, have responded quietly so far to deep cuts, like Ireland and Latvia. "But Greeks are not Latvians," he said, citing serious worker demonstrations already this weekend.
Yet the problem is deeper for Greece than for other vulnerable and relatively uncompetitive countries, like Portugal and Spain, where the budget situation before the crisis was fairly good, even if overly reliant on a housing bubble. "If growth stays negative or low in Greece, the fiscal debt will continue to increase, whatever they do," Ms. Barysch said, while difficult structural reforms to liberalize the economy will take time.
The economists she speaks to "don't really see a solution for Greece in the longer run," she said. Some argue that Greece should stop using the euro, as Argentina dissociated itself from a peg to the dollar in 2002, devaluing its currency and soon returning to growth, although with high inflation. But others say that since Greek debt is denominated in euros, leaving the euro zone will be too expensive and disruptive for a society in crisis.
Greece is functionally bankrupt, Ms. Barysch said. "For most European officials and experts, it's not about fostering Greek growth, it's about the stability of the euro zone."
For Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an economic policy research organization in Brussels, Greece is paying for its past sins of easy credit and false statistics, and has no choice now but to restore the health of its public finances.
"I don't think there is an economic debate on this, because restoring fiscal sustainability must be the first step," he said. "They can focus on growth afterward. But at this point, there is no way for Greece to escape this very painful process."
Still, Mr. Fitoussi warns that the crisis is not over -- that the market will move against other countries, to see if the Europeans have the will and the funds to protect them, and that the Greek government will not survive the painful adjustment.
"There will always be another government," he said. "But in the process Europe will have lost its credibility, by imposing on a country an unbearable program."

Full text: A planned demonstration in which Iranian workers were to join reformists in an antigovernment protest failed to materialize on Saturday, apparently the result of intimidation and a large police presence.
Two Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hussein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, had called Thursday for workers and teachers to join the reformists in a broad-based coalition.
The call went unheeded on Saturday, analysts said, largely because of government intimidation.
But the lack of action may also reflect a failure of the opposition leaders to win over workers and teachers, who have their own grievances, to the antigovernment cause. And it raised questions about the ability of the opposition to mobilize a mass protest planned for June 12, the anniversary of Iran's disputed presidential election.
"This was a strategic mistake for opposition leaders," said Mehdi Jalali, an Iran analyst in New York. "They must first address the workers' demands and then expect them to join the movement. The leaders had not offered a plan, and people don't know why they should come to the streets and face brutality."
Across Tehran on Saturday, major intersections that had been filled with protesters last summer were filled instead with police officers in riot gear, witnesses said. Helicopters hovered over Azadi Square and Azadi Street, where the Ministry of Labor is located and workers had been expected to gather.
"There were groups of young men in military clothes at the corner of every alley standing next to black vans," said a Tehran resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The black vans are used by security forces to take protesters to detention centers.
In addition to the police presence, the government's recent moves to execute political dissidents may have scared off potential protesters. The Supreme Court upheld two death sentences last week while lower courts have ordered capital punishment for 11 protesters. Many demonstrators from earlier street protests remain in jail, and there have been reports of torture.
An aide to Mr. Karroubi, however, said the government's clampdown indicated that it was the government that feared the protesters rather than the other way around.
"I don't think it matters if people stage a protest when the government takes extraordinary measures to put forces at every single corner in the capital," said the aide, Mojtaba Vahedi, who has been in exile in the United States since last summer. "This shows that the government fears that without those forces there might be protests all over the capital. That is a demonstration of the dissent as well."
Workers had pledged to stage protests on Saturday, and teachers had said they would demonstrate on Teachers' Day on Sunday. Workers' and teachers' groups have often demonstrated on May 1, International Workers' Day, but apart from the reformists.
There were reports of protests in the cities of Qazvin, Shiraz and Tabriz on the opposition Web site Kaleme, but those reports could not be independently verified. A picture posted on several blogs showed a group of recently fired workers outside the governor's office of Shiraz holding a banner that said "Congratulations on your unemployment."
Authorities had warned that they would prevent protests. The supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, cautioned workers in a meeting on Wednesday that they "not to be used as a political leverage" by "the enemy."
Workers and teachers have long complained of low wages, lack of benefits and the effects of economic mismanagement on their lives. On the BBC Persian service on Saturday, workers called in during a live program to complain about lack of independent unions that could address their demands, like unemployment and inflation.
The official minimum wage is $300 a month, but those who called the BBC program on Saturday said the wage was too low.

Abstract: Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday, President Obama acknowledged that many Americans might find little comfort in the numbers because " 'you're hired' is the only economic news they're waiting to hear." Economists are hopeful that families will continue to pick up the pace of purchasing and make the recovery more sustainable, although consumers may remain cautious about spending given the tepid growth in job creation and personal income.

Full text: The United States economy has expanded for three quarters in a row, the Commerce Department said on Friday, helped along by consumer spending. Now the question is, Will the jobs follow?
The broadest measure of the overall economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the Commerce Department reported. It had expanded 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2.2 percent in the third quarter.
While the expansion is welcome, it has not delivered the level of hiring needed to recover the ground lost during the recession.
Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday, President Obama acknowledged that many Americans might find little comfort in the numbers because " 'you're hired' is the only economic news they're waiting to hear."
Still, economists are hopeful that news of solid, continued growth may bolster business confidence and persuade more companies to expand.
"It's been a case of, when will they stop worrying and learn to love the boom?" said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG, who added that many analysts and companies had underestimated the economic turnaround.
After dragging their heels for many months, consumers were at last a major contributor to economic growth in the first quarter. Consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, a big gain from the 1.6 percent rate of the previous three months. Purchases of durable goods like cars led the way.
Whether Americans might retrench for the long haul after seeing their homes lose value has been one of the biggest questions about the aftermath of the Great Recession. Consumer spending makes up more than 70 percent of the economy, and it usually drives growth during economic recoveries.
Economists are hopeful that families will continue to pick up the pace of purchasing and make the recovery more sustainable, although consumers may remain cautious about spending given the tepid growth in job creation and personal income. Consumer sentiment dipped slightly in April, according to a Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index released on Friday.
"We haven't had consumer spending growth this strong in three years," said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. "But the caveat is that with real disposable incomes not growing, this was all done through the saving rate. We cannot rely on consumers continually driving down their savings. They need income support from hiring."
Small businesses say Americans are loosening up a little after a bewildering period of debt reduction and uncertainty.
Nate Evans, who owns a pottery-making business with his wife, Hallie, in New Albin, Iowa, said sales in 2009 were the worst ever but that business was just starting to pick up. The Evanses sell their wares from their Allamakee Wood-Fired Pottery home studio as well as in galleries in nearby states, and at craft shows in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois.
"I felt like the energy of the crowd was better," Mr. Evans said of the first fair this year, in Minnesota, adding that other craft sellers seemed to agree. "Most of the people we talked to said it was better than last year. Hey, it's not great, but it's better than last year."
Just as Americans stepped up their purchases of autos and other products in the first quarter, companies invested more in capital goods. Business purchases of equipment and software, for example, grew at an annual rate of 13.4 percent, building on a 19 percent increase in the final quarter of 2009.
For the first time in two years, businesses started increasing their stockpiles of goods. This inventory growth accounted for about half of the expansion in the first quarter. In the previous quarter, about two-thirds of economic growth resulted from a decision by companies to draw down their inventories more slowly -- that is, not clearing their stockroom shelves so quickly but still not adding to them.
Additional spending by companies "is very good news, since it indicates businesses are feeling more confident about the expansion to start spending some of their cash," Mr. Gault said. "If businesses are spending more on equipment, usually that would go along with more hiring, too."
Federal government spending, including some remaining money from stimulus programs, grew at an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter. But this was more than offset by continued cuts by state and local governments, whose spending decreased 3.8 percent. It was the third consecutive quarterly decline for state and local spending.
"Government spending contracted, for all the ballyhoo about stimulus," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. "This recovery is going to have to stand on the backs of private-sector demand, not on government demand, given all the current fiscal challenges."
Modest expansion in business activity may not be enough to ease the lasting pain of the recession, many economists say.
Hiring only recently began to materialize, with the economy adding 162,000 jobs in March, of which 48,000 were temporary Census-related positions. The economy had shed about eight million jobs since the recession began in December 2007.
Job growth hasn't been as strong as economic growth for several reasons, economists say. Businesses have found ways to make more with fewer resources, meaning that they have been able to meet additional demand for their products without bringing on many new workers. And companies are sitting on a tremendous amount of cash and appear unwilling to spend it.
"Companies may be reluctant to invest because there's an enormous amount of uncertainty ahead for them, not just in health care policy but tax policy," said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. "This isn't just about the sustainability of the recovery itself."
Mr. Obama, in his remarks on Friday morning, rejected criticisms that his policies were bad for hiring by talking about tax cuts for small businesses, loans backed by the government and investments in areas like clean energy -- policies intended in part to encourage job creation.
Even if hiring does finally start to grow at the same rate with demand, the economy is simply not growing fast enough to make a big dent in unemployment, economists say.
The nation's gross domestic product -- a broad measure of goods and services produced in the country -- is far below its potential, according to projections of where the economy would have been had it followed its long-term trend.
Output would need to grow at least 5 percent annually for several years to get back on track -- and perhaps what is more important, to stimulate enough job creation to employ the 15 million Americans already out of work and the 100,000 new workers joining the labor force each month.
Right now, many economists expect the nation's output to expand 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year.
"Unless the pace of growth picks up significantly, we will see high unemployment rates for years to come," said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Europe's collective anguish over Greece was interrupted by some good news on Thursday. German unemployment fell more than expected, while earnings surged for some of the country's biggest companies.
No one is going to complain about signs of robust growth in Europe's largest economy, which has 10 times the economic output of Greece. But the recovery of the northern half of the euro zone as the southern periphery sinks deeper into crisis sets up a quandary for monetary policy makers that could increase the already serious tensions within Europe.
If growth in Northern Europe continues to gain during the rest of the year, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will eventually face pressure to raise interest rates to contain inflation.
But a rate increase could harm Greece as well as Spain, Portugal and other countries with debt problems, raising the high cost of borrowing for governments and business.
The central bank "cannot risk inflation in the euro area for the sake of these three countries," said Zsolt Darvas, an economist at Breugel, a research organization in Brussels. "They will have to face higher interest rates, and it will be very difficult for them to sort out their fiscal problems."
That view is commonly held in Germany and countries near it. Another view is that relieving the suffering of Southern Europe should trump trying to stamp out future inflation with a heavy hand.
For the central bank, fortunately, the day of reckoning probably will not come until early next year. With no signs yet that inflation is an imminent danger, most economists do not expect an increase in the benchmark interest rate -- it is now 1 percent -- until March 2011, according to a Reuters poll.
But Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the central bank, and other members of its governing council face plenty of other tough choices in the weeks and months ahead.
One risk is that the loss of faith in Greek solvency will spread to Portugal and perhaps Spain, threatening another bank crisis and forcing the central bank to act.
The central bank has begun to gradually cut back on the nearly unlimited cash it lent to European banks after interbank lending froze in 2008. But some analysts say they believe the central bank could stop that process or even reverse it.
The bank "may have to go back and reopen some of its unconventional measures," said Nick Matthews, senior European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The central bank could also face pressure if the United States Federal Reserve began raising rates. Higher rates in the United States would encourage investors to move assets into dollars to earn a better return, causing the euro to fall even more.
A weaker euro would be good for Greece and European exporters in general by making their products less expensive in foreign markets. But the downside is that a weaker euro would increase the cost of oil and other commodities, which are usually priced in dollars. Higher energy costs would feed inflation, adding pressure on the central bank to raise rates.
For now, that risk seems to have eased after the Fed signaled Wednesday that it was in no hurry to raise rates.
The downgrading of Greek debt to junk status by the ratings agency Standard & Poor's, and the risk of Moody's and Fitch following suit, presents a more immediate problem for the central bank. Under the central bank's rules, that would make Greek debt ineligible as collateral for central bank loans, creating serious problems for banks in Greece that use their holdings of domestic bonds to borrow cash.
"The E.C.B. doesn't want to be the one to push Greece over the edge," said Janet Henry, chief European economist at HSBC. "If push comes to shove, they would bend the rules."
But a shift in policy could also damage the credibility of the central bank, said Mr. Darvas, the economist for Breugel. The central bank has already loosened its collateral requirements to help Greece, despite Mr. Trichet's insistence that the bank would not tailor policy to specific countries.
The central bank also changed course on whether the International Monetary Fund should play a major role in rescuing Greece. Members of the bank's governing council first said that Europe could deal with its own problems, then pivoted as they were forced to acknowledge that the I.M.F. was indispensable.
Such missteps notwithstanding, bickering among European Union leaders has underlined the importance of the central bank as the one institution in the euro zone able to move decisively in response to an economic crisis.
Alessandro Leipold, former acting director of the I.M.F.'s European department, speculated that the central bank could stretch its mandate even further if Europe's politicians were too slow to agree on the terms of a rescue package for Greece.
For example, the central bank could organize a bridge loan to allow Greece to meet its immediate financing needs and avoid a default, Mr. Leipold said. "I don't know the technicalities but it should be possible," he said. Other analysts said they thought such a move was unlikely.
Another option, according to analysts at R.B.S., entails the central bank buying government bonds, which the bank has avoided.
The central bank "will defend the region using all the tools at its disposal," the R.B.S. analysts said in a note on Monday. As global trade recovers, German exporters like Siemens, the electronics conglomerate, and the software maker SAP have reported strong earnings, helping seasonally adjusted unemployment fall to 7.8 percent, from 8 percent.
Economists recall that when Germany was struggling in the middle of the decade, the central bank kept interest rates low even though the policy led to overheated economies in Ireland and other countries. "Then they were setting policy for Germany rather than smaller countries -- where conditions were far too loose," Ms. Henry of HSBC said.
In the coming year, "Germany will feature more prominently than the periphery," she added. "The E.C.B. has its 2 percent inflation limit, and they will do what it takes to achieve that."

Full text: Not that long ago, European economists used to mock their American counterparts for having questioned the wisdom of Europe's march to monetary union. "On the whole," declared an article published just this past January, "the euro has, thus far, gone much better than many U.S. economists had predicted."
Oops. The article summarized the euro-skeptics' views as having been: "It can't happen, it's a bad idea, it won't last." Well, it did happen, but right now it does seem to have been a bad idea for exactly the reasons the skeptics cited. And as for whether it will last -- suddenly, that's looking like an open question.
To understand the euro-mess -- and its lessons for the rest of us -- you need to see past the headlines. Right now everyone is focused on public debt, which can make it seem as if this is a simple story of governments that couldn't control their spending. But that's only part of the story for Greece, much less for Portugal, and not at all the story for Spain.
The fact is that three years ago none of the countries now in or near crisis seemed to be in deep fiscal trouble. Even Greece's 2007 budget deficit was no higher, as a share of G.D.P., than the deficits the United States ran in the mid-1980s (morning in America!), while Spain actually ran a surplus. And all of the countries were attracting large inflows of foreign capital, largely because markets believed that membership in the euro zone made Greek, Portuguese and Spanish bonds safe investments.
Then came the global financial crisis. Those inflows of capital dried up; revenues plunged and deficits soared; and membership in the euro, which had encouraged markets to love the crisis countries not wisely but too well, turned into a trap.
What's the nature of the trap? During the years of easy money, wages and prices in the crisis countries rose much faster than in the rest of Europe. Now that the money is no longer rolling in, those countries need to get costs back in line.
But that's a much harder thing to do now than it was when each European nation had its own currency. Back then, costs could be brought in line by adjusting exchange rates -- e.g., Greece could cut its wages relative to German wages simply by reducing the value of the drachma in terms of Deutsche marks. Now that Greece and Germany share the same currency, however, the only way to reduce Greek relative costs is through some combination of German inflation and Greek deflation. And since Germany won't accept inflation, deflation it is.
The problem is that deflation -- falling wages and prices -- is always and everywhere a deeply painful process. It invariably involves a prolonged slump with high unemployment. And it also aggravates debt problems, both public and private, because incomes fall while the debt burden doesn't.
Hence the crisis. Greece's fiscal woes would be serious but probably manageable if the Greek economy's prospects for the next few years looked even moderately favorable. But they don't. Earlier this week, when it downgraded Greek debt, Standard & Poor's suggested that the euro value of Greek G.D.P. may not return to its 2008 level until 2017, meaning that Greece has no hope of growing out of its troubles.
All this is exactly what the euro-skeptics feared. Giving up the ability to adjust exchange rates, they warned, would invite future crises. And it has.
So what will happen to the euro? Until recently, most analysts, myself included, considered a euro breakup basically impossible, since any government that even hinted that it was considering leaving the euro would be inviting a catastrophic run on its banks. But if the crisis countries are forced into default, they'll probably face severe bank runs anyway, forcing them into emergency measures like temporary restrictions on bank withdrawals. This would open the door to euro exit.
So is the euro itself in danger? In a word, yes. If European leaders don't start acting much more forcefully, providing Greece with enough help to avoid the worst, a chain reaction that starts with a Greek default and ends up wreaking much wider havoc looks all too possible.
Meanwhile, what are the lessons for the rest of us?
The deficit hawks are already trying to appropriate the European crisis, presenting it as an object lesson in the evils of government red ink. What the crisis really demonstrates, however, is the dangers of putting yourself in a policy straitjacket. When they joined the euro, the governments of Greece, Portugal and Spain denied themselves the ability to do some bad things, like printing too much money; but they also denied themselves the ability to respond flexibly to events.
And when crisis strikes, governments need to be able to act. That's what the architects of the euro forgot -- and the rest of us need to remember.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Obama will nominate Janet L. Yellen on Thursday to be vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and fill two remaining seats on the central bank's board of governors, officials said Wednesday evening.
News of the nominations came hours after the Fed's open market committee decided to keep short-term interest rates near zero and maintained, as it has for nearly a year, that rates would stay at that level for "an extended period."
Ms. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is a leading macroeconomist and a former Fed governor, but the two other nominees, Peter A. Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Sarah Bloom Raskin, the Maryland commissioner of financial regulation, do not have backgrounds in monetary policy. The White House floated all three names last month, but delayed the nominations pending a review of the candidates' backgrounds.
After its meeting Wednesday, the central bank disclosed nothing about when or how it would reduce the size of the $2.3 trillion balance sheet it accumulated as it acquired mortgage-backed securities to prop up the housing market, suggesting that it had no plans to start selling the assets anytime soon.
Concluding a two-day meeting, the Fed's policy-making panel voted to keep the target range for the benchmark federal funds rate at zero to 0.25 percent, the "exceptionally low" level it has been at since December 2008.
While a few Fed policy makers have raised doubts about the wisdom of sticking with the unusually low rates for too much longer, others have pointed to the 9.7 percent unemployment rate to argue that the Fed is still a long way from needing to tighten the supply of credit.
Members of the panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, said at their previous meeting, in March, that the "extended period" language did not mean anything specific, and that the Fed could act at any time if it thought conditions warranted it.
In a statement, the committee offered glimmers of a rosier economic assessment. The committee found that the labor market "is beginning to improve," a change from the last meeting, when it said the market was "stabilizing."
It stated that the growth in household spending had "picked up recently"; in March, such spending was merely "expanding at a moderate rate." And it concluded that housing starts, described as "flat" in March, had "edged up but remained at a depressed level."
The Fed did not change its basic characterization of the economic recovery, which it continued to describe as moderate, or of its expectations for inflation, which it maintained was "likely to be subdued for some time."
Ms. Yellen, 63, would replace Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn, a 40-year Fed stalwart who plans to retire in June. Ms. Raskin, 49, is a former lawyer for the Senate Banking Committee, and Mr. Diamond, who turns 70 on Thursday, is an authority on Social Security and pensions.
If confirmed by the Senate, they will join the Fed as it strives to return to normal after making emergency loans and scooping up assets to bolster an economy stricken by the financial crisis. Mr. Obama has already named one Fed governor, Daniel K. Tarullo, and renominated the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to a second four-year term.
On March 31, the Fed completed buying $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, an action that helped keep home loan rates at near-record lows. But now the central bank has to figure out what to do with all of those assets.
If the Fed were to do nothing, and wait for the underlying mortgages to be paid and for the securities to roll off its books, the unwinding would take decades.
Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, urged in speeches this month that the Fed consider selling $15 billion to $25 billion in mortgage-backed securities each month. He said that carrying mortgage-related assets on its books for a long period would expose the Fed to interest rate risks.
Two other regional Fed presidents, Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond and Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, have also said they think that asset sales will not disrupt the still-fragile housing market.
Other Fed officials, including Ms. Yellen, have said that asset sales are a viable option but not necessarily the best one.
Laurence M. Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, said that any decisions about selling the securities should not be made too hastily.
"Nothing too bad would happen to let them roll off slowly," he said. "The Fed is not in business to make savvy investments to increase its net worth. That's pretty secondary to the broader impact on the economy. Practically speaking, I don't think there's any urgency."
Along with selling securities, the Fed is testing alternative means for eventually draining the reserves it created as it bought assets -- mortgage bonds, debts owed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and Treasury securities -- to hold down long-term interest rates.
Mr. Bernanke holds the view that short-term rates are to remain low for an extended period, but dissenters have become more vocal. Thomas M. Hoenig of the Kansas City Fed was the sole no vote in the last two meetings of the committee, though he has not called for raising rates.
Mr. Hoenig dissented once again Wednesday, saying the language "was no longer warranted because it could lead to a buildup of future imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability, while limiting the committee's flexibility to begin raising rates modestly."
Other regional Fed presidents -- James Bullard of St. Louis, Mr. Plosser of Philadelphia and Mr. Lacker of Richmond -- have said that the language should be amended at some point because it could otherwise constrain the central bank's ability to raise rates promptly if necessary.
"It seems like there's an internal momentum behind the recovery," said Peter N. Ireland, an economist at Boston College. "This is the dilemma the Fed has always faced after easing policy during a recession. It doesn't want to tighten policy too soon and choke off recovery, but it doesn't want to wait until it's too late and inflation is on the upswing."

Full text: Stocks pushed past concerns over a widening European debt crisis and closed higher on Wall Street on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve reassured investors that the economy was improving and left interest rates untouched as predicted.
Standard & Poor's cut the debt rating of Spain on Wednesday, the third European downgrade in two days. Greece and Portugal were marked down on Tuesday, setting in motion a global flight from equities to fixed-income investments, particularly those in United States dollars.
As the euro fell to a one-year low, European leaders scrambled to control market instability springing from the Greek debt crisis and to stave off contagion. Investors want to see some stability emerge from a timetable on a proposed bailout plan for Greece. On Wednesday, Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, said the government could present draft legislation on such a plan as early as Monday.
But much still depends on negotiations with Greece over the terms, which could conclude by the end of this week.
"The market is looking for some stability that they can grab onto, that this is not getting out of control," said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer, McQueen, Ball & Associates. "How they handle Greece will dictate how they deal with any weaker units out there. Portugal is on the fringes, and you have Italy and Ireland sitting out there. Maybe they are not as bad, but maybe they will need some support as well."
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.28 points, or 0.48 percent, at 11,045.27. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index showed a gain of 7.65 points or 0.65 percent, at 1,191.36, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 0.26 points, or 0.01 percent, at 2,471.73.
The market has been grappling with fears that financial troubles in Europe might spread. But Spain's downgrade was not expected to have as much of an effect as that of Greece, which "basically forces the hand of a lot of portfolio managers who cannot hold junk or high-yield debt," said Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global.
"Double A is not the end of the world," said Mr. Kalivas, referring to Spain's new credit rating. "And it does not force people to rejigger their portfolios or put a lot of Spanish debt on the market looking for a home."
If anything, Mr. Kalivas said, the Spanish downgrade would "give a little tailwind" to the talks to aid Greece.
European stocks closed mostly lower.
In the United States, investors had been waiting for cues from the Federal Reserve on the economy, and in the afternoon they got what they expected. Although the Fed said there were still constraints on household spending, it did not change its basic characterization of the economic recovery or of its expectations for inflation, which it maintained was "likely to be subdued for some time." As expected, it kept short-term interest rates near zero.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 19/32, to 98 28/32, and the yield rose to 3.76 percent, from 3.69 percent late Tuesday.
The market is continuing to rely on corporate earnings for economic signals. Financials and energy shares were higher, while the consumer discretionary sector slipped.
Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Investments, said it appeared more companies were profiting by increasing revenue, a transition from earlier quarters when they raised profits by cutting costs.
"The large story here in our opinion in that the first-quarter earnings reports are confirming that we are in a powerful profits recovery," Mr. Smith said.
Comcast, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical were the latest companies to exceed earnings expectations.
Dow Chemical rose $1.76, or 5.85 percent, to $31.83. Comcast rose 35 cents, or almost 2 percent, to $18.81. Northrop Grumman rose $1.49, or 2.2 percent, to $68.67.

Ship Attack Shows South Korean Quandary Over How to Respond to North

Abstract: South Korea's defense minister on Sunday said a torpedo attack was the most likely cause for the sinking of a South Korean warship that killed at least 40 sailors last month, a statement that inched the country closer to placing blame on North Korea and added urgency to the question of how the South might respond.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's defense minister on Sunday said a torpedo attack was the most likely cause for the sinking of a South Korean warship that killed at least 40 sailors last month, a statement that inched the country closer to placing blame on North Korea and added urgency to the question of how the South might respond.
Still, the minister did not mention the North, continuing a cautious government approach that reflects the lack of good options available to South Korea's leaders if they decide that North Korea was responsible for what would be one of the most serious attacks since the Korean War ended in a truce.
Any military retaliation could provoke a response from a country with the capacity to strike Seoul and a mercurial leader who has proved to be violent and unpredictable. A lesser response, hard-liners in the South argue, could lead North Korean leader Kim Jong-il to conclude that he could lash out again without facing consequences.
The announcement on Sunday by Defense Minister Kim Tae-young appeared to fit a pattern that some analysts say shows the government is carefully building a case for a limited response -- doling out information slowly enough so emotions ease before a final assignment of blame.
Mr. Kim's statement came two days after South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, met with two former presidents in what was understood in Confucian Korea as an attempt to consult elders and build consensus about how to proceed. The two former presidents, Chun Doo-hwan and Kim Young-sam, once again proved their bona fides as hard-liners on the North, speaking emotionally about past attacks by Pyongyang -- including a bombing in 1983 that killed several cabinet members.
Both men also expressed certainty that North Korea was behind the ship's sinking and urged Mr. Lee to deal "resolutely" with the North. But, significantly, neither mentioned the possibility of even a limited military attack, instead recommending harsh economic punishment, including the possibility of further dismantling the "Sunshine Policy" of reaching out to the North with aid and business ventures.
The meeting could provide political cover for Mr. Lee with fellow conservatives since Mr. Chun, a former military dictator, remains one of the country's most prominent anti-Communists. During his brutal rule, those who argued for better relations with the North were often imprisoned and sometimes tortured, as were those who wrote or read books that cast the North in anything but an intensely critical light.
So far, few South Koreans have called for military retaliation if it is determined that North Korea is responsible. Even under its most virulent anti-Communist leaders, South Korea has responded to past attacks, including the 1987 downing of a South Korean airliner, with palpable anger, but little action. In at least one of those cases -- the bombing that killed the cabinet members -- a revenge attack was planned, but never carried out. In others, under a liberal government, leaders reacted by trying harder to nudge the North back to the negotiating table on its nuclear program.
Those relatively mild responses were before the North effectively changed the calculus of retribution by forging ahead with a nuclear program, making what intelligence experts say is fuel for at least eight nuclear weapons, or possibly the bombs themselves. Although it remains unclear if the North has the ability to deliver a viable nuclear weapon, it threatened last week to use what it called its "nuclear deterrent" if it was attacked; Pyongyang has denied sinking the South's ship. Any tough reaction from the South now could also frighten investors and harm the economy, which has been recovering quickly from the global financial crisis.
Given the stakes, analysts have been speculating for weeks about how Mr. Lee, who came to office promising a tougher stance against the North, would respond to the warship's sinking.
Some speculated that even if he became convinced that North Korea was responsible, he would hide the evidence rather than put his country in jeopardy. North Korea, though impoverished, bristles with conventional weapons, including missiles, rockets and artillery that could ravage Seoul.
Other analysts have argued that Mr. Lee was planning just the opposite -- calling in international inspectors for the ongoing examination of the ship to build support for a strong multilateral reaction if the North is guilty. Such a finding, they say, could help him bolster his argument that neither the United States nor China should give the North incentives to return to long-stalled nuclear talks, especially if those negotiations are unlikely to yield real change.
A determination of North Korean culpability could also help make the case for economic sanctions with teeth. History has shown that sanctions against Pyongyang cannot work unless China and other countries besides the United States join in. China has been loath to push North Korea hard, fearing a collapse in Pyongyang's struggling leadership that could send refugees flooding over the border.
Still, even Mr. Lee might be reluctant to go too far. He has been pushing for months to hold a summit meeting with Kim Jong-il and might not want to give up that chance to show that his tougher approach, after years of what he calls liberal coddling, might yield results.
In the end, should it be determined that Pyongyang sank the ship, the greatest danger could be to the "Sunshine Policy," a legacy of the last two liberal presidents.
The policy has already been faltering, with the South cutting all shipments of fertilizer and food after the North pulled out of nuclear talks and with the shutdown of a jointly operated tourist resort in the North after the North's military killed a South Korean tourist.
Any further cutbacks could leave North Korea, which continues to grapple with food shortages and crippling inflation, even more desperate -- a danger in itself.

Full text: "It's tough to handle this fortune and fame.
Everybody's so different; I haven't changed."
-- Joe Walsh, "Life's Been Good"
LOS ANGELES
FOR a man who sits atop one of the most feared corporations in the music business, Irving Azoff seems surprisingly proud of his middle finger. Images of it, raised high and defiant, are hard to avoid in his home, a 12,000-square-foot mansion in one of the richest neighborhoods in this city.
There he is, the chairman of the newly merged Ticketmaster and Live Nation, staring from behind his digit of choice in a photograph on his stationery. And there he is again, grinning from the same vantage point in an image on a sweatshirt that he wears one afternoon when he offers a tour of his estate.
Somehow, when deployed by Mr. Azoff, this obscene gesture seems less a profanity than a very succinct statement of personal philosophy. At roughly 5-foot-3 and at the age of 62 -- imagine an accountant who used to be a jockey -- he has a teenager's sense of humor and a rascally, triumphant style that has been the bane of his enemies and the delight of his allies for four decades.
"He who dies with the most toys wins," read the front of a T-shirt that he once had made for employees of his artist management firm, which has handled acts like the Eagles, Steely Dan, and the Go-Gos. The back of the shirt read, "Irving wins!"
He has won often over the years, but his biggest victory might well have come on Jan. 25. That day, the Justice Department blessed a merger between Ticketmaster, the ticketing giant that Mr. Azoff has led since 2008, and Live Nation, the world's largest concert promotion company.
Live Nation Entertainment, as the new company is called, is a colossus unlike anything the industry has ever seen. Ticketmaster has roughly 70 percent of the concert ticket market in the United States and is known for the ever-rising cost of an assortment of tacked-on fees, now as much a part of concert experience as sticky floors and shoving. Live Nation, led by Michael Rapino, 43, is a roll-up of regional promoters that now runs more than 22,000 events a year, many in the 127 amphitheaters and clubs that the company owns or operates. Total annual attendance is more than 50 million.
Then there's the company's not-so-secret weapon, Front Line Management, a consortium of artist management agencies that Mr. Azoff started cobbling together in 2005. Front Line shepherds the careers of roughly 200 marquee solo artists and bands, ranging in age from Miley Cyrus to Willie Nelson and including Van Halen, Neil Diamond, Christina Aguilera, Kid Rock, Maroon 5 and the Kings of Leon.
To say this new conglomerate has inspired fear in the live-concert business doesn't capture the extent of the quaking. A coalition of consumer groups and independent promoters lobbied hard against the merger, warning that Live Nation Entertainment could quietly threaten venue owners by hinting that if they dropped Ticketmaster, they would have a hard time booking Live Nation tours or Front Line talent. The coalition also said the new company would have something close to a monopolist's hand when it came to setting ticket fees.
"Now that it's united with Ticketmaster, the sky will be the limit when it comes to fees," says Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League. "It's not enough to say 'If you don't like the high prices, don't go to the show.' We need a concert market that has real and robust competition."
In their first interviews since the merger was completed, Mr. Azoff and Mr. Rapino denied having much weight to throw around, saying that it's established artists who are really in charge.
They say they are still trying to figure out new ways to generate revenue, and the two men acknowledged that if their companies weren't allowed to merge, Live Nation in particular would have been in awful financial shape.
"There's an old saying, 'It's easier to kill a business than to change,' " says Mr. Rapino, now Live Nation Entertainment's C.E.O. "We wanted to make sure we got married before we spent four years too long saying, 'God, we should have put these companies together.' "
That the Justice Department went along with this marriage surprised many who were expecting the Obama administration to pursue possible antitrust questions more aggressively and take the companies to court. But department officials contend that they extracted real concessions in a consent decree that prohibits an assortment of bullying tactics by the new company. The department also tried to gin up some competition in the ticketing market by, among other moves, forcing Ticketmaster to sell off a subsidiary called Paciolan in the hopes that it would become a serious competitor.
Maybe that will happen, but for now, Mr. Azoff is as close to a commissioner for live music as this country has ever had. And he occupies this job at a time when labels, as a force in the market, are withering and bands are making the bulk of their income from concerts. Which is to say, more power than ever is concentrated in the live-music side of the business, and the business of live music is more concentrated than ever.
Other executives in this industry have made greater fortunes, but Mr. Azoff is arguably the most powerful man in the history of pop music.
"This business has always had a lot of guys who wield a lot of decision-making power," he says, in a tone that suggests he doesn't have more influence than the music titans before him.
IRVING AZOFF has never broken through as that staple of pop culture, the nationally known mogul. But it is not for lack of charisma, money or a flair for the outlandish. On occasions when he has found a restaurant's service slow, he has lit the menu on fire. He once had a gift-wrapped boa constrictor delivered to a manager whose wife he considered a bit treacherous.
The accompanying happy-birthday note said: "Now you have two of them!"
"My wife was involved in that one," says Mr. Azoff, chuckling. "But it was a baby boa constrictor, in a cage. It actually was kind of a nice gift."
In music circles, he's been known as a savvy negotiator and a ferocious advocate for his artists, capable of sonorous shouting jags. "Let's just say you had a ringing in your ears for a few days after he yelled at you," says Dave Lucas, a former concert promoter now with Live-360, which consults with music venues. "You waited a while before you called back unless you wanted more."
Mr. Azoff is also known for bending the truth when it suits his purposes or those of his clients, a propensity that long ago earned him the nickname Swerving Irving. He has been surprisingly honest about his penchant for dissembling -- even saying so under oath, in a deposition in a lawsuit over the band Boston. After calling two music executives liars, he said, "Come to think of it, you can't believe much of what I say, either."
"That's Irving," says Don Engel, a lawyer who has worked both for and against Mr. Azoff. "His game is, 'I say whatever I want, and if I change my mind, that's the new truth.' "
It's all part of the game, Mr. Azoff says: "Various jobs that I've had require me to stand behind the curtain and -- what's the word? -- create an illusion. This is a business that requires different tactics at different times."
One recent afternoon, Mr. Azoff was sitting in his office, recovering from strep throat. He was about to hit the phones for a few hours of the quick conversations and messages that consume most of his waking life. First, however, he wanted to listen to Ms. Aguilera's newest single, "Not Myself Tonight," which had just been uploaded to her Web site. It takes a minute or two to find the play button on the right Web page -- Internet-proficient, the man is not -- and suddenly the tune is blasting out of a pair of speakers at concert volume.
"It's dance-y," he yells over the din.
During this three-hour visit, Mr. Azoff is flip, funny and kind of cuddly, at least when he talks to his musician clients. His wife, Shelli, is home and visiting with a few friends, but the house is so large that we won't cross paths. His 12-year-old son is in the backyard getting a tennis lesson. There's also a guest cottage here that's been turned into a gym and a separate building for a pool table and a Ping-Pong table.
His favorite toy, though, is a gleaming $110,000 black Tesla, an electric car he says is the fastest car he's ever owned. ("And I've owned Ferraris. I've owned Porsches.") He offers a demonstration and we inch down his driveway, past his koi pond, through a set of slowly opening gates. When Mr. Azoff reaches the street, he punches the accelerator, and the car lunges to about 70 m.p.h. in under four seconds.
"Need I say more?" he cackles, barely braking in time for a stop sign. "It's insane!"
As he drives, he narrates a tour of the neighborhood. That's David Geffen's house, that's where Lucille Ball lived, Michael Jackson died in a house over there. He points to land beside his. "This is an old widow, who's 86 years old," he says. "I've got an option to buy this when she kicks."
Mr. Azoff is the last of a generation of rock entrepreneurs who started as young men in the early '70s, when rock transitioned out of its hippie, anti-establishment phase and into its professional, stadium-tour era. Some of his contemporaries retired rich. Most were flattened by trends and competition they never saw coming. For those without the instincts of a survivor, this is an industry with few happy endings. Its nearest analog isn't an industry at all; it's politics. Alliances shift, backs are stabbed and most people have at least three agendas, only one of which they will discuss candidly.
Consider the saga of Ticketmaster and Live Nation.
IN the years before their courtship, these companies were on the verge of war.
For a long time, Live Nation had been Ticketmaster's biggest customer: if you wanted a ticket to a Live Nation site, Ticketmaster sold it to you. But Mr. Rapino looked enviously at Ticketmaster's balance sheet, which showed a steadier business with higher margins and less agita. Today, if you buy a ticket to a Lady Gaga concert, you'll need to hand over a $2.50 "facility charge," as well as a $15.45 "convenience charge" and $2.50 if you want to print your ticket at home.
Some of that money goes back to promoters as rebates -- a practice that Ticketmaster pioneered -- but Ticketmaster keeps most of it. So, in 2007, Live Nation told Ticketmaster that it would not renew its contract and began developing a ticketing platform of its own.
For a fleeting moment, it looked as if price competition was coming to the concert business.
But ticketing technology is notoriously tricky, and Live Nation's ran into a rather infamous glitch in February 2009, when Phish fans briefly overwhelmed the system. Even so, Live Nation's ticketing ambitions helped persuade Ticketmaster to merge, in part because Live Nation was starting to make overtures to venues with Ticketmaster clients. Ticketmaster had a choice: it could either merge with the company that had once provided about 15 percent of its revenue, or compete against it.
For Live Nation, there were plenty of reasons to join Ticketmaster. Live Nation was saddled with so much debt -- about $800 million, much of it for maintaining venues and for upfront fees for artists -- that Mr. Rapino worried about becoming a takeover target. In March 2009, its stock traded for less than $3 a share.
To Mr. Rapino, it was either an all-out battle, which could have devastated his company, or a merger he regards as win-win for everyone. Certainly, Live Nation Entertainment has benefited. When Ticketmaster and Live Nation announced the merger in February 2009, as Wall Street neared its bear-market low, they said the new company would be worth $816 million. It's now worth $2.8 billion.
But Mr. Rapino says that fans and artists will come out ahead, too. His goal is to turn Ticketmaster's Web site into live music's answer to Amazon.com, allowing him to sell merchandise, fan club memberships and so on. "Now," he says, "I'm not just a guy with the stage who puts on the show."
Mr. Rapino is sipping a Fresca in Live Nation's office in a sleek, modern building in Beverly Hills. He has a closely trimmed beard and black hair in what could be described as a mulletlike cut. He was raised in Thunder Bay, Ontario, and started his own promotion company after college, which was bought by Clear Channel Communications, the radio and concert giant. He went to work there and became known for assembling facts for snazzy presentations. He was also regarded as a ruthless infighter and a shameless, if slightly tin-eared, self-promoter.
On this particular afternoon, he has just come from a meeting with Dave Stewart, best known as the male half of the Eurythmics. Before Mr. Stewart leaves, he drops by Mr. Rapino's office to say goodbye.
What was he doing there?
"When the Internet came about," Mr. Stewart replies, "the artist realized, well hang on, you can't steal a ticket for a seat, so we started to lean more toward, I don't really want a record deal, I want to be aligned with somebody who can help me sell tickets. But then I want a company that can use that music and that seat to get ancillary revenues" -- from things like food, beverages and sponsorships -- "to help me survive."
Mr. Rapino nods through all this. "He said it better than I can," he says, sounding awed.
The relationship between Mr. Rapino and artists is complicated. On the one hand, he must be deferential and accommodating, because without a regular caravan of acts, he has nothing but empty seats and red ink. At the same time, some artists are exasperating, though Mr. Rapino is far too diplomatic to say so.
Instead, he'll simply note that artists -- at least the famous ones -- are in a position these days to define their own destiny. And without question, that destiny includes higher ticket prices. The average price of a ticket to one of the top 100 tours soared to $62.57 last year from $25.81 in 1996, according to Pollstar, far outpacing inflation. The interesting question is why.
Mr. Rapino's theory is that musicians are just benefiting from the same trends that have enriched other superstars, like athletes and actors.
"The ticket was underpriced 40 years ago," he says.
Rival promoters see another culprit in high ticket prices: Live Nation. The company, they say, represents a consolidation of regional promoters that didn't just coincide with rising ticket prices but also helped cause them. Ticket prices, in this telling, have gone up because the largest promoter has been paying whatever-it-takes sums to get bands in the door -- both to drive out competitors and to bring in desperately needed revenue to cover fixed overhead costs and to fill up seats. The company's biggest outlays include "360 deals" with Jay-Z, Madonna, U2 and others, giving the company a stake in tours, recording and merchandise profits in exchange for nine-figure paydays. Jay-Z's deal was reportedly worth more than $150 million.
"Look at what has happened to ticket prices, and the price of everything else at a concert, over the last 10 years, right when consolidation was happening," says John Scher, who books shows in Madison Square Garden, at Radio City Music Hall and elsewhere in New York. "I talk to college kids all the time and they tell me that going to a show at an arena or an amphitheater is just beyond what they can afford. And it's because Live Nation has been paying the acts these outrageous sums, which is just alienating the fan base."
Mr. Rapino denies overpaying for bands, and says that the price of tickets often triples when they're sold by scalpers, which suggests that they were actually underpriced.
Then again, when Mr. Rapino was describing the parlous condition of the concert business in front of Congress last year, he noted that 40 percent of concert tickets go unsold, a statistic that he offered as a symptom of an industry in distress but that might just be evidence that Live Nation and its rivals don't know how to price and sell their products. Today, as high as ticket prices are, Live Nation earns none of its profit from ticket revenue. The artists get nearly all of that. Live Nation's earnings come from stuff sold on site, like beer, parking and advertising.
While there is plenty of argument about what combination of forces caused ticket prices to go up as Live Nation's share of ticket money went down, there is a broad consensus about one of those forces.
The force is named Irving Azoff.
MR. AZOFF started by booking rock concerts in high school and later dropped out of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to work as an artist manager. The folk rocker Dan Fogelberg, whom he met in college, was his first client, and then came REO Speedwagon, an unknown at the time. Next was the future Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh.
"We met one night at the Whiskey a Go Go," says Mr. Walsh, referring to a club on the Sunset Strip. Mr. Walsh says his solo career was in a rut, and he was broke. "So I said: 'You can manage me. But first you have to help me trash this dressing room.' And we threw everything everywhere."
This was one of the secrets to Mr. Azoff's career: He didn't just join the juvenile behavior of his acts. He encouraged and led it. He started food fights on planes. He reveled in pranks. He assumed that there was no amount of mayhem that a few $100 bills couldn't fix. When Mr. Walsh wanted a room that connected to Mr. Azoff's and a hotel had none to offer, Mr. Azoff dispatched an underling to a hardware store to buy a chain saw, which Mr. Walsh used to cut a makeshift door.
"Then he bought me a case so I could bring the chain saw on the road," Mr. Walsh says. "Just having a chain saw when you're on the road, you can accomplish an awful lot. You don't even need to start it."
For all his frat-boy shenanigans, Mr. Azoff had a Doberman's instincts about protecting his clients. Plenty of managers at the time became rich by keeping clients in the dark about their finances, arguing that mixing commerce and art was bad for the music. He did the opposite.
"Irving basically said, 'I'll bring you into the negotiation,' " says Cameron Crowe, who wrote a profile of Mr. Azoff for Rolling Stone and became a friend. "You'd go to his office and Dan Fogelberg would be sitting across from Irving, just watching the show."
Mr. Azoff was part of the defiant counterculture but was fluent in the language of contracts and comfortable mixing it up in corporate suites. He also had great intuition about how to psychologically size up both foes and friends, and he could sweet-talk and charm as convincingly as he could erupt in rage.
"We met him in 1975 right when my partner Walter Becker and I had decided to give up touring," says Donald Fagen of Steely Dan. "We expected him to say, 'You guys have to tour if you expect a career.' Instead, he said, 'I'm going to triple your album sales without you touring.' Maybe he kind of guessed at what we wanted to hear, which is a kind of business genius itself."
But the place where Mr. Azoff's style would have the widest and most lasting impact was on the road.
The concert business was regional at the time, and many promoters had rather creative ways of divvying up the spoils. Some would subtract fictional overhead costs from the band's share -- for replacing the hockey ice under the stage, for instance, even if the ice was intact through the entire show. In the movie "Almost Famous," a slick new manager pitches his services to a band by asking, "Do you know to keep from getting charged for the ice below the floorboards at Chicago Stadium?"
That was an Irving Azoff line, says Mr. Crowe, who wrote and directed the movie.
"He'd come out of Urbana-Champaign with a knowledge of where the bodies were buried because he was a booking agent in his previous life, and he'd buried them," Mr. Crowe says. "At the time, there was a lot of mystery about promoting concerts and a lot of promoters had a wonderful ride until Irving came to town."
His expertise was determining exactly how much money the promoter stood to pocket from a show, always a closely guarded secret. He'd send an employee into the parking lot to count the number of cars paying parking fees. He'd call the food concession and ask for sales data. What he couldn't sleuth out on his own, he would coax from one of the promoter's underlings, who were often eager to curry favor with the great Irving Azoff.
"Every guy working at the lower level in this business dreams of moving up," says Mr. Azoff, shrugging as though this particular idea didn't take a genius.
He added up all the numbers and argued that when it came time to split the proceeds, this revenue should be considered, too. Why not? Without the talent, there were no fans to pay for food and parking. Knowing how much the promoter was earning on a given night, Mr. Azoff could ask for a larger cut of ticket revenue.
The promoters, he'd say, could keep the money earned at the venue, but in exchange they'd have to give Mr. Azoff and his acts a greater cut of ticket revenue than they typically handed over. Ninety percent, to be precise. It became known as "the Irving deal."
THE Irving deal pinched the margins of every promoter. But none were pinched quite like those of an entrepreneur named Robert F. X. Sillerman, who began a buying spree of regional promoters in late 1996, ultimately spending more than $1 billion, most of it borrowed. How would Mr. Sillerman turn a profit? By selling more ads and sponsorships, he said. Great, replied Mr. Azoff. His bands will take 90 percent of that income.
"I said, 'Of course you're going to give me 90 percent of the money, Bob,' " says Mr. Azoff, remembering a contentious phone call. "'That's our standard split or we're not going to play. How many people do you think will pay to see Robert Sillerman at the Boston Garden?"
This was posturing, to a degree -- Mr. Azoff didn't really expect 90 cents of every ad dollar. But he was reminding Mr. Sillerman of a simple principle. If a promoter was going to earn money from some new source, he'd have to share some of it with Mr. Azoff's bands.
Ultimately, Mr. Sillerman didn't even try to make his conglomeration, SFX, a viable long-term venture. Instead, in 2000, he sold the company to Clear Channel for $3.3 billion in stock and the assumption of $1.1 billion in SFX debt, a sum that seemed preposterously high to many in the industry. Five years later, as Clear Channel stock languished, the concert business was spun off -- and Live Nation was born.
That same year, Mr. Azoff decided to "fight clout with clout," as he puts it. He started consolidating management firms, reportedly with more than $100 million raised from sources including the Warner Music Group and a private equity firm, Thomas H. Lee Partners. Many of the management firms took a lump-sum check against a share of future profits.
"His pitch was, 'Let's create a big company that gives the artists a power base,' " says Clint Higham, a manager at Morris Artist Management in Nashville, whose clients include Kenny Chesney.
In 2008, Ticketmaster, which had owned a piece of Front Line, bought Warner Music's minority stake for $123 million. As part of that deal, Mr. Azoff became the C.E.O. of both companies.
A year later, Mr. Azoff set aside his ambition to "fight clout with clout," and Live Nation and Ticketmaster unveiled the mother of all music industry mergers.
THE Justice Department considered the merger, and negotiated with the parties, for just under a year. Ultimately, officials approved the deal after what they described as significant changes.
First, there is an attempt in the consent decree to jump-start two ticketing competitors -- Paciolan, the aforementioned subsidiary, which was sold to Comcast; and the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which was granted the right to sell tickets using Ticketmaster's technology for the next five years, in exchange for a royalty fee to Live Nation Entertainment. A.E.G., Live Nation's closest rival in the promotion business, has the option after five years to build its own platform or buy Ticketmaster's source code.
"Our hope is that there will be competitive choice for venues," Christine Varney, the department's antitrust chief, said in a phone interview. "Whether that'll mean lower prices for fans, we'll see, but we think that the more competitors there are in this field, the more likely it is that prices will go down."
To many, the government's effort to nurse a couple of Ticketmaster rivals into fighting shape seems a long shot at best. But the government also won from Live Nation Entertainment a promise that it would not engage in certain anticompetitive behavior. The company's ticketing side, for instance, is barred from sharing data with the promotion side.
That reflects the worry of promoters with Ticketmaster contracts that the hugely valuable information collected through ticket sales -- the e-mail addresses and the musical appetites of customers -- will be quietly exploited by Live Nation. There are penalties for violating the consent decree that Ms. Varney described as $10,000 a ticket, but a lot of promoters worry that the company could break the rules and that nobody would know.
"There is supposed to be this Chinese wall at the company," says Mitchell Frank, who books shows for a Los Angeles club, Echoplex. "But really, what is to stop them from mining all the data that I collect?"
If the merger presents so many potential hazards, why did the Justice Department approve it?
Several people familiar with the negotiations inside the department said that officials didn't think they had much choice. According to Jim Hurwitz, a former Federal Trade Commission lawyer who wrote a paper for the American Antitrust Institute arguing against the merger, Live Nation told the government that it was going to exit the ticketing market no matter what happened with this deal and that it would enter an informal alliance with Ticketmaster if it wasn't allowed to merge. On the other hand, if it was allowed to merge, the government could exert some control through a consent decree.
In other words, Mr. Hurwitz explained, the choice presented to the Justice Department was this: either let us get married and have a say in our union or try to stop us -- in which case, we're just going to start seriously dating. "My sense also is that Justice was worried about its prospects if it went to court, and it didn't want to lose its first major case," Mr. Hurwitz says.
Ms. Varney of the Justice Department has disputed that notion, saying that it would have litigated if it hadn't won the concessions it wanted.
NOW that Live Nation Entertainment is a reality, how does it intend to grow? Mr. Azoff and Mr. Rapino are still coming up with answers. They want to improve Ticketmaster's e-commerce site and look for ways to sell merchandise, fan club memberships and so forth to people buying tickets. The two executives talk about new pricing models and a better fan experience.
Potentially, these changes are revolutionary. For years, neither promoter nor ticketer has considered fans as the first priority. Ticketmaster's most important clients are venue owners. The promoter, of course, worries foremost about the artist. If you've ever attended a concert and felt treated like an afterthought, now you know why.
But as Live Nation Entertainment tries to create this fan-friendly concert experience and improve its margins, it has tough trends to fight. The number of new bands with arena-packing power is dwindling. The company has made few inroads in hip-hop and rap. We live in a world of downloadable singles, but albums and artists' repertoires are what traditionally sell big tours.
Then there is the problem that Mr. Azoff can blame only on himself. No matter what ideas Live Nation Entertainment conjures to generate more cash, artists are likely to demand part of the upside. They'll want the Irving deal. And why wouldn't they?
"We've squeezed every drop that there is to squeeze," Mr. Azoff replies, using "we" to refer to artists and managers. "We've probably squeezed too much. But we're not going backward," and here the "we" switches to Live Nation Entertainment, "so with this merger we're going to form new businesses through e-commerce so we don't have to go to artists and say 'We want to take back some ground.' "
When it comes time to negotiate the deals between artists and promoters, Mr. Azoff in many instances will have a seat on both sides of the table, a potential conflict of interest that he dismisses -- because he's been at this a long time, he says, and because everyone trusts him to do what it is fair for everyone.
Does that group include fans? We are about to find out. Much about the concert business is now an open question, but what's clear is how much of the future resides in Mr. Azoff's impish little hands.

Full text: Wall Street overcame concerns about Greece's financial troubles on Thursday and rebounded from early losses, helped by enthusiasm for shares of consumer-oriented companies.
The major indexes recovered from sharp declines at the open after the European Union said Greece's budget deficit was larger than expected in 2009.
In addition, the ratings agency Moody's Investors Servicecut the country's credit rating, resurrecting worries that Greece would have trouble paying its debt even as European officials work on a plan.
The worries about Greece brought added volatility. Traders remain concerned that countries in Europe and elsewhere might soon face similar debt woes.
"It isn't Greece itself, it is the fear of contagion," said Hank B. Smith, chief investment officer for Haverford Investments.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.37 points, or 0.08 percent, to 11,134.29 on Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 2.73 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,208.67, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 14.46 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,519.07.
Much of the market's strength came from consumer discretionary stocks, with traders enthusiastic about shares of home builders after upbeat data on the housing market.
In addition, shares of Amazon, which announced first-quarter earnings after the market closed, rose during regular trading. Shares of Amazon jumped 2.77 percent, or $4.06, to $150.49 in anticipation of the earnings announcement, but fell in after-hours trading.
Investors also reacted to renewed efforts to strengthen regulation of the financial industry.
President Obama was in Manhattan on Thursday to press his case for a financial overhaul, outlining ways of giving consumers more power and scrutinizing complex financial products like derivatives.
Bank shares initially dropped on worries that profits would fall if the government reined in risky trading practices. By the end of trading, some of those concerns seemed to fade, however.
Citigroup shares fell 1.22 percent, to $4.87, and JPMorgan Chase declined just 1.35 percent, to $44.74.
Goldman Sachs rose 12 cents, to $159.05, and Morgan Stanley jumped 22 cents, to $31.90.
Utilities, materials and health care stocks were among those that fell. The health care sector continued to grapple with uncertainty over how new legislation would affect business, and some firms have revised their outlook.
Baxter International, a medical products maker, said on Thursday that it anticipated slower sales growth and was lowering its outlook for the year to $3.92 to $4 a share, from $4.20 to $4.28. Baxter shares plunged 13.27 percent, or $7.82, to $51.13 on Thursday.
Indexes in Europe declined Thursday. The FTSE 100 in London fell 58.10 points, or 1.02 percent; the CAC 40 in Paris dropped 53.02 points, or 1.33 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt fell 61.66 points, or 0.99 percent.
Before Wall Street opened, the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims decreased last week.
A separate report showed a larger-than-expected increase in wholesale prices in March, though a closely watched measure of inflation remained tame.
A third report, from the National Association of Realtors, showed that sales of existing homes climbed more than expected in March, rising 6.8 percent.
But the day's economic reports had little influence.
"It doesn't seem to be the economic data that is driving the market down," said James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global.
"Jobless claims went down, and nobody is really worried about inflation right now with the core number pretty tame."
Mr. Smith said the market had been due for a pullback after an extended rally.
"We have gone 14 months without a correction, and that is a bit unusual," he said.
Crude oil continued to push slightly higher, settling up 2 cents, at $83.70 a barrel in New York trading.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 10/32, to 98 25/32, and the yield rose to 3.77 percent from 3.74 percent late Wednesday.

Full text: Sales of existing homes rose sharply in March, an indication that a government tax credit was luring buyers to the market.
Sales were up 6.8 percent from February to an annual rate of 5.35 million, according to a report by the National Association of Realtors. Analysts had expected a 5.3 percent increase.
The association said the results suggested the beginning of a spring surge as buyers moved to take advantage of a tax credit of up to $8,000 that expires April 30.
"The home buyer tax credit has been a resounding success as these underlying trends point to a broad stabilization in home prices," the chief economist for the association, Lawrence Yun, said.
Sales have been propped up recently by the appeal of the tax credit, low mortgage rates and perceptions of a slowly improving economy. But analysts expect home buying to slow in the months ahead.
"The tax credit is compressing the purchasing into a narrow time span," said Steven Blitz, a senior economist for Majestic Research. "The big question is what happens after April. We know sales will go back down again."
But prices have remained steady in recent months, kept lower by weak demand and an influx of bargain-priced foreclosures. A report released Thursday by the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed that home prices fell 0.2 percent in February from January.
A third report on Thursday showed wholesale prices climbed 0.7 percent in March, largely because of a jump in food prices. But a closely watched gauge of inflationremained unchanged, signaling interest rates may remain low for some time.
The Labor Department said food prices rose for a sixth month, increasing 2.4 percent, primarily because of a 49.3 percent surge in vegetable prices. Those prices tend to be volatile, and a separate measure that excludes food and energy prices climbed 0.1 percent.
Economists said the jump in food prices was probably a one-month aberration.
"It is hard to believe that this type of gain in food prices will repeat," said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, an investment firm, who characterized the overall report as "benign."
Mr. Greenhaus said the increase in food prices was the largest since 1984.
Despite the rise in food prices, which analysts attributed to a cold weather snap in agricultural regions, the year-over-year core index remained steady -- in line with expectations -- and analysts said prices would probably remain steady.
"In a blink of an eye it will be gone," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a consulting firm. "It is not going to leak into core inflation. You are seeing other prices going down. "
While food prices have steadily increased, the March data was not expected to reverse the Federal Reserve's outlook for relatively low levels of inflation for the foreseeable future.
The Fed's policy-setting committee will meet next week but it is not expected to raise interest rates until the second half of this year at the earliest.
The Fed has kept interest rates low to stimulate growth amid widespread unemployment and an unsteady recovery.
Wholesale prices had been increasing since October until they dipped 0.6 percent in February. In March, food prices contributed to more than 70 percent of the index's rise but it was also bolstered by a 0.7 percent increase in prices for energy, the index showed.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve transferred $47.4 billion, a record sum, to the Treasury Department last year, a result of the central bank's actions to support the fragile housing market.
The transfer to the public coffers rose roughly 50 percent, or $15.7 billion, from $31.7 billion transferred in 2008, the Fed announced on Wednesday in releasing its annual financial statements, which were audited by Deloitte.
"Central banking is a great business," joked Vincent R. Reinhart, a former director of monetary affairs at the Fed.
Unlike private banks, the Fed does not exist for the purpose of making a profit, though it inevitably does so. Historically, it paid no interest on the currency and bank reserves that represent its liabilities, while it made interest on the Treasury securities that make up its assets.
The Fed's profitability increased as an incidental result of the financial turmoil that began in 2007.
To hold down long-term interest rates and support the housing market, the Fed greatly increased its holdings of Treasury securities and acquired mortgage-backed securities and debts owed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance companies that are now controlled by the government. The Fed made $20.4 billion in interest on those mortgage-related securities and debt holdings in 2009.
In addition, the Fed profited as troubled banks turned to its discount window and other emergency lending programs.
The Fed paid for the assets by creating reserves and, although it began paying interest, currently 0.25 percent, on those reserves in October 2008, the payments are only a small drag on the central bank's profitability.
Those seeking to use the Fed to help cover the nation's steep deficits and debts, however, will inevitably be disappointed.
"The Fed can only play this game as long as the public is willing to hold its liabilities," said Mr. Reinhart, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. "If it tried to increase its balance sheet tenfold, say, the public would be unwilling to hold those reserves. You'd get dollar depreciation and inflation."
As it is, the Fed's balance sheet is now roughly $2.3 trillion, about 2.5 times its size before the crisis. Its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, now faces a set of challenges as the Fed prepares to eventually tighten monetary policy and return its balance sheet to a more normal size.
All told, the Fed's comprehensive income was $53.4 billion in 2009, a $17.9 billion increase from 2008. After deducting operating expenses, the Fed transferred $47.4 billion to the Treasury.
Along with financial statements for the Fed's board of governors in Washington and the 12 Fed district banks, the Fed released details about the assets held by five limited liability companies that were created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in response to the crisis.
Three of those companies, known as Maiden Lane I, II and III, were created to hold troubled assets, including mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, acquired as a result of the government-brokered sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008 and the takeover of the American International Group, the stricken insurance giant, that September.
The Fed expects to recover the full value of the loans made to those special entities and does not expect any loss to taxpayers from them, senior Fed officials said in a conference call.
The Fed spent $243.7 million on salaries for its roughly 2,200 employees in Washington in 2009. Those numbers could change substantially if Congress creates an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within the Fed, as a Senate bill to overhaul financial regulations seeks to do.
The annual financial statements also showed that the Fed spent $479.3 million on currency printing last year. "In just the past 25 years, the value of Federal Reserve notes in circulation has grown from $180 billion to $890 billion, an increase of almost 400 percent," Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference on Wednesday at the Treasury Department to unveil a new design, incorporating additional anticounterfeiting features, for the $100 note.
"And while in the past, most U.S. dollars were held domestically, today many of these notes circulate outside of our borders," he added.

Full text: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan -- Shortly before the uprising in Kyrgyzstan two weeks ago, online news sites posted a series of hard-hitting exposes accusing the family of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev of skimming money from the public coffers, an allegation that touched a nerve in this poor country and galvanized opposition to his government.
When the authorities responded by blocking the Web sites on local servers, complaints came in from the usual places -- the Committee to Protect Journalists and Freedom House -- but also from an unlikely advocate for free media in the wired world: the Russian Foreign Ministry.
Rather than a change of heart on press freedoms, still stifled at home, Russia's stance in Kyrgyzstan appeared to be a new tactic in dealing with the former Soviet republics it regards as within its sphere of influence. Backing freedom of expression -- in this case to oppose a leader with whom it was unhappy -- was just one element of a wider, behind-the-scenes role in the uprising that may help Russia win influence in the new government.
Russia and the United States have been dueling for the upper hand in this small but strategically important Central Asian country, where the United States maintains an air field outside the capital as a logistics and refueling hub for the war in Afghanistan.
But Russia appears to have learned well the lessons of the so-called color revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan in the past decade. In those uprisings, which overthrew governments allied with Russia but that had become alienated from their own populations, the West provided open support for opposition elites and free media.
This time, the Russians staked out a remarkably similar position and used it to their advantage. In Kyrgyzstan, an American diplomat said, the Russians "had a color revolution of their own color."
Russia's use of so-called soft power mirrored a long policy of American support for civil society in the former Soviet republics, under programs like the Freedom Support Act and financing for nongovernmental groups. Just five years ago that support, including United States financing for a publishing house in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, which produced reports of corruption, was credited with preparing the ground for the previous Kyrgyz uprising, the so-called Tulip Revolution.
Russia's newfound influence is likely to affect elections scheduled in six months to establish a permanent government in Kyrgyzstan, and it could also ripple throughout the region as the authorities in Moscow have cultivated ties with opposition figures in Georgia and Belarus.
In Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Bakiyev had been trying to play the Russians and the Americans against each other for his own benefit. He had particularly angered the Kremlin by accepting $450 million in Russian aid tacitly linked to an agreement to close the American base at Manas airport but then allowing the base to remain, renamed as a "transit center."
In July, the same month the Bakiyev government concluded the base renewal agreement with the United States, Kyrgyz opposition leaders began to get audiences with leaders in Moscow, according to Aleksandr A. Knyazov, then director of a Russian-backed nongovernmental group in Bishkek, the CIS Institute.
Mr. Knyazov said he brokered the meetings, which he said began with relatively unimportant members of the Russian Parliament but evolved into audiences with influential figures, whom he declined to name.
In March, Roza Otunbayeva, now the head of the interim government, traveled to Moscow to attend a conference of former Soviet political parties and to meet Sergei M. Mironov, speaker of the upper chamber of the Russian Parliament and a close ally of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin. According to Mr. Knyazov, she warned the Russians that popular discontent in Kyrgyzstan was exploding and that a mass protest would soon take place.
While it is not clear whether she received any explicit commitments from the Russians, Moscow was already applying pressure on the Kyrgyz government.
That month, Russian state television and local opposition media in Kyrgyzstan stepped up the publication of incriminating stories about the Bakiyev government, which responded by blocking access to the news Web sites Ferghana and Bely Parus and the blog site LiveJournal, and by seizing the print runs of two newspapers.
The Russian Embassy in Bishkek then issued a statement saying that it had "heard from a large number of Russian and Kyrgyz citizens who had trouble accessing Russian Internet sites because they are blocked" and that the Russian government was "concerned" about online censorship.
On April 1, Russia raised tariffs for refined petroleum products exported to Kyrgyzstan, causing a spike in gasoline prices and inflation that further fanned discontent. Russia also shut down some banking transactions with Kyrgyzstan, and Russia's allies Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan tightened their borders, curtailing Kyrgyzstan's lucrative trade in smuggled Chinese consumer goods.
With these tactics gaining traction, the United States was at a loss for how to respond, according to the American diplomat in Bishkek, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Though the negative reporting on Mr. Bakiyev dovetailed with a Russian agenda, to counter Russian influence would have required the United States to publicly support the closing of newspapers and blocking of Internet news sites.
To have thrown support behind the president, no great friend of the United States anyway, would have meant "we would have been seen as aiding in the repression" of civil society and the free press that the United States had spent years and millions of dollars building, the diplomat said.
By early April, the role reversal for the United States was clear when one of the leaders of the Kyrgyz opposition walked into the American Embassy and told a political officer, "The revolution begins on Wednesday."
The diplomat said he replied by saying, "Really?"
On Wednesday, April 7, protests broke out around the country to protest the government's brutality and corruption, as well as the increase in utility rates. Within 24 hours, the government had fallen.
But it was hardly a clean sweep for Russia, producing an interim government that includes members with close ties to Russia and the United States.
Since then, both countries have actively courted the new leaders, resuming the contest for influence in this rugged, landlocked country of about five million people. The United States has offered support for the new government, which has promised to extend the lease on the American air base. Russia has offered $50 million in aid and subsidized fuel in the future.

Full text: Overall book sales in the United States dropped 1.8 percent in 2009, to approximately $23.9 billion not adjusted for inflation, according to the annual estimate released by the Association of American Publishers this month, though there is some hope for the beleaguered industry.
E-books accounted for just 1.3 percent of all book sales. But their sales skyrocketed 176.6 percent over the previous year. The introduction of the Nook from Barnes & Noble and the iPad from Apple are expected to bolster sales further in 2010.
Educational books for kindergartners through 12th graders took the steepest hit among several categories, declining 13.9 percent, yet books for higher education rose by nearly the same percentage. "K-12 school textbook spending, unlike higher education, is driven predominantly by government procurement funding by local municipality and state budgets, many of which were either cut or deferred across the country in 2009," said Tina Jordan, vice president of the association.
Ms. Jordan attributed growth in costlier adult hardcover books to a "welcome upward readjustment following the recessionary impact on hardcover sales at the end of 2008," when sales fell 13 percent from 2007.

Full text: AMERICA'S long-run fiscal outlook is bleak, mostly because of an aging population and rising health care costs. To close the gap between expenditures and revenue, we'll likely see a combination of revenue increases and spending cuts. And we'll need to focus especially on reducing spending, largely because that taxes on the wealthy can be raised only so high.
Consider the tax burden on high earners once the Bush administration's tax cuts expire next year. Add up the federal, state, city and sales taxes for a lawyer in New York City who earns $300,000 a year. Depending on the circumstances, this individual could be facing marginal tax rates in the range of 60 percent. Higher income tax rates would discourage hard work and encourage tax avoidance, thereby defeating the purpose of the tax increases.
The most potent way to add revenue is to impose a value-added tax. As its name indicates, a V.A.T. takes some percentage of the value added at each stage of production. V.A.T.'s raise money so readily and so invisibly that they often climb to a range of 15 to 20 percent; politicians like the revenue, and voters don't always notice the burden.
A move toward a V.A.T., however, also brings price inflation, a big increase in the tax-collecting bureaucracy and the emergence of favored sectors with exemptions or lower rates. Though we may well end up with a V.A.T., it isn't obviously the best option.
Burdening citizens with much higher taxes would fundamentally change what this country is about. Our founders envisioned a government that would provide public goods but not guarantee everyone's well-being against every possible obstacle. Immigrants would be offered a franchise to come here and make good if they could -- while bearing considerable risk themselves. To this day, this openness has elevated many millions in health, prosperity and liberty -- and enabled many newcomers to innovate and offer new goods and services, or scientific ideas, to the world.
Higher levels of government spending and taxation would also soak up resources that might otherwise foster innovation and new businesses. And sentiment would most likely turn ever stronger against those immigrants who consume public services and make the deficit higher in the short run. Current residents might feel more secure in a larger welfare state, but over time the loss of commerce and innovation takes a toll.
The macroeconomic evidence also suggests the wisdom of emphasizing spending cuts. In a recent paper, Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna, economics professors at Harvard, found that in developed countries, spending cuts were the key to successful fiscal adjustments -- and were generally better for the economy than tax increases. Their conclusion was based on data since 1970 from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The received wisdom in the United States is that deep spending cuts are politically impossible. But a number of economically advanced countries, including Sweden, Finland, Canada and, most recently, Ireland, have cut their government budgets when needed.
Most relevant, perhaps, is Canada, which cut federal government spending by about 20 percent from 1992 to 1997. The Liberal Party, headed by Jean Chretien as prime ministerand Paul Martin as finance minister, led most of this shift. Prompted by the financial debacle in Mexico, Canadian leaders had the courage and the foresight to make those spending cuts before a fiscal crisis was upon them. In his book "In the Long Run We're All Dead: The Canadian Turn to Fiscal Restraint," Timothy Lewis describes Canada's move from fiscal irresponsibility to a balanced budget -- a history that helps explain why the country has managed the current global recession relatively well.
To be sure, the spending cuts meant fewer government services, most of all for health care, and big cuts in agricultural subsidies. But Canada remained a highly humane society, and American liberals continue to cite it as a beacon of progressive values.
Counterintuitively, the relatively strong Canadian trust in government may have paved the way for government spending cuts, a pattern that also appears in Scandinavia. Citizens were told by their government leadership that such cuts were necessary and, to some extent, they trusted the messenger.
IT'S less obvious that the United States can head down the same path, partly because many Americans are so cynical about policy makers. In many ways, this cynicism may be justified, but it is not always helpful, as it lowers trust and impedes useful social bargains.
Forces like the Tea Party movement argue for fiscal conservatism, though it isn't obvious that they are creating the conditions for success. Over the last year, we have been treated to the spectacle of conservatives defending Medicare against proposed cuts, in large part to curry favor with voters and mobilize sentiment against the Democratic health care plan.
Right now there is plenty of concern about debt and deficits, but little consensus on which expenditures should be cut or reined in. Sooner or later, we'll have to reconsider virtually every segment of the federal budget.
The issue of fiscal responsibility isn't going away. So the question is now this: How deeply will we dig ourselves in before we create a more mature and more forward-looking political culture?

Full text: WASHINGTON
ON a recent afternoon, Neal S. Wolin entered the ornate limestone headquarters of the United States Chamber of Commerce, across Lafayette Park from his office at the Treasury Department here, and stood before scores of corporate chieftains, financiers and lobbyists.
And then he blasted away.
"The Chamber of Commerce -- funded, no doubt, with a good deal of your money -- has launched a lavish, aggressive and misleading campaign to defeat the proposed independent agency," said Mr. Wolin, who, as deputy Treasury secretary, is helping to shape the Obama administration's proposal for a new federal entity charged with monitoring financial products sold to consumers.
As Mr. Wolin spoke, some of the executives shifted uncomfortably in their seats. When he was done, there was scant applause. Then Thomas J. Donohue, president of the chamber, one of the most potent lobbies in the capital, spoke up.
"I think the Constitution is very clear on our right to raise our issues," he responded. "And you have every right to raise the government's issues."
As Congress and Wall Street wrestle over the contours of what may be the most far-reaching and pivotal overhaul of financial regulations in nearly 80 years, the White House is intensifying its effort to cajole or browbeat Republicans into supporting changes that so far have been almost entirely the handiwork of Democrats.
Behind the scenes, for more than a year, the White House has relied on Mr. Wolin and two other officials -- Diana Farrell, deputy director of the National Economic Council, and Michael S. Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions -- to handle the day-in, day-out bargaining, battling and drudgery that such efforts entail.
In countless meetings with lobbyists and legislators, they have pressed the case for enhanced oversight. They know the minutiae of the legislation better than their bosses do (and their bosses include President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner). As the regulatory battle heats up, they are absorbing much of the collateral damage while enjoying little of the glory.
"They're the front-line generals, and this is trench warfare," said Scott E. Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry association that represents banking interests.
Mr. Barr, who works until midnight and sees his family in Ann Arbor, Mich., only on weekends, concedes that the process has been grueling. "It's a hard slog," he says. "We're up against a financial industry that's willing to spend enormous sums to get what they want out of the bill. That makes it tough."
He adds: "The intensity, ferocity and the ugliness of the lobbying in the financial sector -- it's gotten worse. It's more intense."
Ms. Farrell, one of two deputies to Lawrence H. Summers, Mr. Obama's top economic counselor, said she has had "darker days" but expressed hope that the legislation would pass.
When Mr. Obama took office 15 months ago, his financial team -- and Mr. Geithner in particular -- were criticized as being slow off the mark and too friendly to Wall Street. Since then, political setbacks and calls for more vigorous action have catalyzed the White House. Mr. Wolin, Ms. Farrell and Mr. Barr have emerged as the on-the-ground leaders of the effort.
Mr. Geithner, for one, is appreciative. "They're very secure," he says of the three. "They have no ego. They're not worried about how things appear, or who gets the credit."
MR. WOLIN and Mr. Barr worked at Treasury during the Clinton administration. After George W. Bush was elected, Mr. Wolin went to the Hartford Financial Services Group, and Mr. Barr to teach at the University of Michigan. Ms. Farrell had been in San Francisco directing the McKinsey Global Institute, the consulting firm's research arm.
Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner, along with Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, brought the trio together. Mr. Wolin was sent to Treasury from the White House counsel's office, and Mr. Barr from the National Economic Council, where Ms. Farrell works. The three have formed a strong alliance, especially by Washington standards.
"They've created a very congenial team that has not been off-message once," says Stuart E. Eizenstat, a veteran of the Johnson, Carter and Clinton administrations who was deputy Treasury secretary under Mr. Summers. "The conjunction of politics and substance -- and the interest groups -- are as ferocious as you can imagine. But these guys have hung together."
Mr. Barr, 44, has been the architect of much of the policy-making, particularly the proposal for an independent consumer financial protection agency. He tends to wear his passion on his sleeve; some critics find him grating.
In a debate at a forum last September, Mr. Barr butted heads with Peter J. Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization, and a critic of the regulatory overhaul.
"He's very smart and he's a good advocate for his position, but he's not someone who is willing to listen," says Mr. Wallison, who was the Treasury's top lawyer and White House counsel in the Reagan administration. "That's just not in his nature. He has an inflexibility about him that I think is somewhat off-putting."
Mr. Barr brushes off the criticism. "I enjoy the rough-and-tumble of it," he says. "It would be a disadvantage if I were stiff-necked and not willing to learn from other people. I certainly have seen that trait in some people, and I don't admire it."
Raised in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, the son of a union lawyer and a high school teacher, Mr. Barr was a Rhodes scholar and a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter before joining the policy planning staff at the State Department.
Mr. Barr quickly moved to the Treasury, as an assistant to the secretary, Robert E. Rubin, in 1995. He worked on community development financial institutions, which offer credit in low-income neighborhoods. After the administration released an 89-page financial reform blueprint last June, Mr. Barr helped transform it into concrete language.
Although Mr. Rubin has been widely criticized for the deregulatory policies he oversaw at Treasury, and for problems that emerged at Citigroup during his subsequent tenure there, Mr. Barr says he "learned a tremendous amount" from Mr. Rubin, adding, "I have no regrets."
Some critics who are sympathetic to the administration say its regulatory effort hasn't gone far enough. "There is only one plausible way to ensure banks that are currently 'too big to fail' can actually fail, and this is to make them substantially smaller," says Simon Johnson, an M.I.T. economist and a critic from the left.
Others have slammed the Obama administration as backing the Bush-era bailouts while being slow to aid homeowners facing foreclosure -- another part of Mr. Barr's portfolio. Mr. Barr points to the homebuyer tax credit, help for mortgage refinancings and the rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but adds that "I certainly agree that not all of our programs have been perfect."
And Mr. Barr has had to endure losses so far in putting together the proposed regulatory overhaul. For example, an effort to force issuers to offer simplified, "plain vanilla" financial products met fierce resistance from banks, which would have seen some of their most profitable lines of business wither. It was dropped after intense industry lobbying, but Mr. Barr says he still believes the provision would have been reasonable.
After the legislation went to Congress, Mr. Barr continued to hone and refine it, working with aides to Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, its chief sponsors.
"The job of walking them through, section by section, subsection by subsection, page by page, line by line, semicolon by semicolon, fell to Michael and to his team," notes Mr. Wolin.
Mr. Barr accepts that he may have to settle for whatever emerges from the horse-trading in Congress. "It's not 100 percent what we would want, but Washington is not that kind of town," he says of the legislation.
In January, two days after a Republican upstart, Scott Brown, won the Massachusetts Senate seat of the late Edward M. Kennedy, in an election widely viewed as a negative referendum on the Obama administration, the White House veered left on financial reform.
The president endorsed a proposal by the former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker to limit the free-wheeling trading and heady expansion banks had enjoyed ever since financial deregulation accelerated in the 1990s. The Volcker Rule, as it came to be known, was seen as an overtly political and populist maneuver, one made with only grudging support from Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers, who were on the opposite side from Mr. Volcker in the White House's own financial reform debate.
Two weeks later, Mr. Volcker and Mr. Wolin appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to explain the proposal. Mr. Volcker said the timing of the announcement was "sheer coincidence," but senators from both parties seemed unpersuaded.
But it was Mr. Wolin -- not the 82-year-old Mr. Volcker, a revered inflation fighter -- who took the heat.
Mr. Dodd said the announcement "seemed to many to be transparently political and not substantive, and it's adding to the problem of trying to get a bill done."
In the end, the Volcker Rule stayed in the bill, although much of the fine-tuning would be left to regulators. One of Mr. Wolin's overseers, Mr. Summers, acknowledges that Mr. Wolin has sat on the firing line but isn't the only member of Team Obama to have done so.
"Everybody has been part of the to-and-fro, the cut-and-thrust, of this thing," says Mr. Summers.
Mr. Wolin is, in some ways, an accidental deputy. He wasn't the administration's first choice for the No. 2 job at Treasury. But the slot opened when two previous candidates, H. Rodgin Cohen, a mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer, and Annette Nazareth, a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, withdrew.
It helped that as a young lawyer in the 1990s, he worked for William H. Webster and Robert M. Gates (now the defense secretary), two directors of the Central Intelligence Agency appointed by Republicans. He had been through the confirmation process before, serving as the Treasury's general counsel at the end of the Clinton administration. He sailed through again this time.
At 48, Mr. Wolin is three months younger than Mr. Geithner. Their offices are adjacent, and they have an easy rapport. "He's the best combination of policy smarts, legal judgment and political strategy," Mr. Geithner says.
While Mr. Geithner is routinely intense, Mr. Wolin is relentlessly cheerful. He laughs at his penchant for legalese.
At a recent press briefing, he said the White House would resist efforts to weaken consumer finance protections. "A carve-out for auto dealers would be sort of a paradigmatic example of such a weakening move," he said.
"It would be a what example?" one reporter asked.
"A good example," he replied.
AT a briefing last fall with members of the House Financial Services Committee, lawmakers kept trying to find divisions within the Obama administration.
"They were fishing and fishing," Ms. Farrell recalls. "At which Michael turned very serious and said, 'I'm sure I'm not supposed to tell you, but the deepest and most profound conflict is when we have our lunch meetings: Diana insists on having salad and I insist on having grilled cheese."
For her part, Ms. Farrell, 45, is the suave, poised member of the trio, a former consultant who makes sure deadlines are met. At McKinsey, she oversaw research on productivity, information technology and financial systems.
"She's not a Ph.D. in economics, but she's more on top of the issues than many Ph.D.'s you'll meet," says Martin N. Baily, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former colleague of Ms. Farrell at McKinsey. Her training and her natural inclination, he said, "are to avoid theoretical debates and focus on what are the facts and what do they tell us."
Ms. Farrell's diplomacy softens the rougher edges of her boss, Mr. Summers. The daughter of a Colombian mother and an American father, she attended boarding school and college in Connecticut. She was an analyst at Goldman Sachs before attending Harvard Business School.
"Without her efficiency, it would have been a slower-moving process," says Mr. Summers. "Without her idealism, it would have been a process with less vision."
Ms. Farrell is comfortable explaining such concepts as securitization in Spanish (as she did in a recent Univision interview) but acknowledges that the transition from McKinsey to government wasn't always smooth.
"I would get frustrated every time the process slowed down," she recalls. "But colleagues who've spent time in government would say, 'You have no appreciation for how fast this is going.' "
For three people with five Ivy League degrees among them, Mr. Wolin, Ms. Farrell and Mr. Barr are hardly ordinary consumers. But asked about the bill's provisions that most affect taxpayers' pocketbooks, they offered examples from their own lives. Mr. Wolin, who recently bought a house, said that closing that purchase was an eye-opener.
"The documents are literally impenetrable," he notes. "Here I was -- former general counsel of the Treasury, former general counsel of a Fortune 100 financial services company -- asking my lawyer to help me through 100 pages of incomprehensible, turgid gobbledygook."
All three say finance has a crucial role in allocating savings and investment, but should not be the sole driver of economic growth."We created a false sense of wealth creation in a sector of the economy that was not necessarily creating sustainable wealth," says Ms. Farrell.
And Mr. Wolin, who helped work on Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the signature deregulatory measure of the Clinton era, says officials were "intoxicated by the success of the markets" and went too far. He thinks current reform proposals could address that problem, but acknowledges not knowing how the story will end.
"Only in Washington," Mr. Wolin said in his speech to the Chamber of Commerce last month, "would anyone think of saying that we are 'rushing' to enact financial reform."

Full text: BEIJING -- China's accelerating economic recovery without signs yet of a surge in inflation may give the government some leeway in making two crucial decisions: raising interest rates and revaluing the Chinese currency.
But the government cautioned that risks remained, like high unemployment and booming real estate prices.
China's gross domestic product jumped 11.9 percent in the first quarter, the government said Thursday. That growth rate, the highest in three years, not only surpassed most economists' forecasts but it also handily beat the 10.7 percent expansion recorded for the final quarter of 2009.
China's National Bureau of Statistics also reported that the consumer price index rose 2.4 percent in March from a year earlier and that the producer price index was up 5.2 percent. Those figures were generally in line with analysts' expectations.
"The basic conclusion is that the recovery is on track," said Tao Wang, an economist at UBS Securities in Beijing.
The statistics bureau apparently agreed, repeating in a statement that China would maintain its "appropriately loose" monetary policy and an expansionist fiscal policy.
China has come under increasing pressure at home and overseas to let the value of its currency, the renminbi, rise and to lift interest rates. The latest figures could give it a chance to do both.
Both the United States and, increasingly, China's Asian trading partners, complain that Beijing has held the renminbi's value artificially low, giving Chinese exports a price advantage on global markets. Letting the currency rise would address that and reduce inflationary pressures by making imports less expensive.
"They would prefer not to hike both rates and the currency simultaneously," said Ben Simpfendorfer, the chief China economist for Royal Bank of Scotland in Hong Kong. An increase in the consumer price index of less than 3 percent "presents them with that window to adjust the currency first before hiking rates later."
Ms. Wang said that the comparatively modest inflation figures might dissuade the government from quickly raising interest rates, as many analysts have recently forecast.
She added, however, that the low inflation rate stemmed in part from a seasonal decline related to the end of the Lunar New Year holiday and that inflation would probably pick up in coming months.
The government said consumer prices were "basically stable." In an apparent indication of its confidence that inflation was in check, the government raised retail gasoline prices by as much as 5 percent on Wednesday, the first increase in those prices in more than five months.
First-quarter growth figures were largely driven by economic stimulus spending, the statistics bureau said.
Gross domestic product growth appeared especially high because it was in comparison with a relatively low base in 2009. The Chinese economy grew 6.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009, when the global recession was at its depths.
The State Council, an important body similar to the White House cabinet, said in a statement late Wednesday that "there are still many conflicts and difficulties in the process of economic recovery," including high unemployment, the threat of inflation and sovereign debt problems abroad.
The statistics bureau also reported that overall investment increased at an annualized rate of 25.6 percent in the first quarter, while urban fixed-asset investment expanded 26.4 percent.
Industrial production rose 18.1 percent in March from a year earlier, in line with the 20.7 percent gain for the January-February period.
The government has sought in recent weeks to wind down the stimulus program begun in 2009, fearing that the economy was overheating. Ms. Wang, the UBS economist, said that the latest growth figures, while strong, offered little indication of that danger but that other alarming signals were apparent.
In particular, she said, officials appear to have had little success in reining in the country's real estate boom, despite efforts to limit borrowing and to ban some state-owned companies from the land market altogether.
The statistics bureau said that investment in property leapt 35.1 percent in the first quarter from the period a year earlier, the fastest growth rate in more than two years. And on Wednesday, the government said housing prices were up a record 11.7 percent year over year in March.
Separately, the State Council said on Thursday that it had raised the minimum down payment required for some house purchases, in another effort to curb real estate speculation.
The council said it would require a 30 percent down payment on first homes larger than 90 square meters, or about 1,000 square feet, and 50 percent on second homes.

Abstract: John S. Glass, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the uptick in restaurant sales paralleled recent gains in retail sales, which also had been hailed as a sign of returning consumer confidence. In the first three months of 2010, the restaurant and food service industry added 42,500 jobs, adjusted for typical seasonal hiring patterns, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Full text: On many weeknights last year, in the depths of the recession, Tursi's Latin King restaurant in Des Moines closed one of its three dining rooms and pared its kitchen to a skeleton crew.
Now, all three rooms are open on most nights, and the kitchen is busy again.
"These last couple of months are a lot better than they were last year," said Robert James Tursi, whose family owns the restaurant, an upscale establishment that specializes in steaks and Italian food. Food sales were about 10 percent higher in February and March than they were during the same months a year ago, he said.
Restaurants all over the country are beginning to see signs of a potential recovery after a dismal 2009. Sales at some restaurants have risen in the last few months, and the industry has hired thousands of additional workers.
"There's no question about this," said Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm that tracks sales at 47 restaurant chains with a total of 103,000 outlets. "There's a recovery going on."
Mr. Balzer said that March sales at restaurants open for at least a year were up 1 percent compared with March of last year. While that might not seem like much, it broke a string of 10 months of negative sales. He cautioned that while the sales trends were uneven across the industry, almost half the chains he tracks -- mostly fast-food and family dining restaurants like Denny's -- had begun showing gains.
Still, many restaurant owners and executives said they expected the rebound to be slow and halting.
"Right now, we're starting to see a few more people come in," said Larry Reinstein, chief executive of Fresh City, a chain that sells sandwiches, salads, burritos and stir fry dishes at 18 outlets in the Northeast. But he quickly added, "The typical consumer is still cautious of what they're spending."
Echoing other industry executives, Mr. Reinstein said that as long as overall unemployment remained high, restaurants would struggle.
John S. Glass, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the uptick in restaurant sales paralleled recent gains in retail sales, which also had been hailed as a sign of returning consumer confidence.
"Going out to eat is an emotional decision, not a considered purchase," Mr. Glass said. "It's not like thinking about a new car or an appliance. It's, 'I feel better, let's go out and treat ourselves.' It's probably a combination of the end of a long winter and the end of a long recession."
And for the entire restaurant industry, the recession has been long indeed.
Total industry sales were down 2.9 percent last year in inflation-adjusted terms, according to Hudson Riehle, senior vice president for research at the National Restaurant Association. The year before they fell 1.2 percent. The association predicts a third year of decline this year, although the projected drop is just 0.1 percent. Mr. Riehle said that the industry had never before experienced even two consecutive years of real sales declines, making the current contraction unprecedented.
But now, restaurant owners are clearly feeling optimistic enough to do some hiring. In the first three months of 2010, the restaurant and food service industry added 42,500 jobs, adjusted for typical seasonal hiring patterns, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even so, Mr. Riehle noted that the industry still had 251,000 fewer jobs than it did in December 2007, when the recession began.
Several major restaurant companies will report first-quarter financial results this month, offering more insight into the health of the industry.
On Wednesday, Yum Brands, the parent company of Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell, reported that sales at Pizza Hut rose 5 percent in the first three months of the year, compared with sales at the same stores a year ago, while same-store sales fell 2 percent at Taco Bell and 4 percent at KFC.
The increase in Pizza Hut sales was partly the result of a heavily marketed promotion offering any pizza for $10, the company said.
"We're still in a challenging environment," said Jonathan Blum, a Yum spokesman. But he said the results were an improvement over the last quarter of 2009, when sales fell 12 percent at Pizza Hut, 8 percent at KFC and 5 percent at Taco Bell.
"We're trending in the right direction," he said.
Malcolm M. Knapp, an industry analyst, said that even higher-price restaurants like steakhouses recently began showing some improvement.
That would be welcome news to white-tablecloth chains like Ruth's Chris Steak House. Although Ruth's Chris has not yet reported its first-quarter financial results, the company reported a sales decline of 19.5 percent last year, on the heels of a 10 percent drop in 2008.
Mr. Knapp said he had also seen an encouraging trend in sales at casual dining restaurants, a category that includes chains like Applebee's, Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Monthly sales are still below year-ago levels, he said, but the declines are moderating.
Among fast-food restaurants, Sonic was hit especially hard during the recession. The drive-in burger chain, known for its roller-skating car hops, said sales at its approximately 3,500 stores declined 13 percent from December through February, compared with the same period a year ago. The chain said the drop was partly caused by harsh winter weather, but the ailing economy also played a major role.
Buddy McClain, who owns 71 Sonic stores in the South, said that while sales were not growing, they had finally stopped falling in March at his Mississippi and Alabama outlets.
But in Florida, a state hit hard by the recession and the collapse of the real estate market, year-to-year sales comparisons have been negative for 17 consecutive months. In March, he said, sales at his Florida stores were 15 percent below the already reduced levels of a year ago.
"Everybody's working harder and making less money, which is not what we call the American way," said Mr. McClain, who has owned Sonic franchises for 32 years. "We've been through four so-called recessions since I've been in Sonic, and nothing has been near to this."

Full text: IN the midst of a wave of post-election political violence in Zimbabwe in 2008, Brian James, a white farmer who had been evicted from his property years earlier during President Robert Mugabe's seizure of white-owned lands, found himself surrounded by a throng of black Zimbabweans in downtown Mutare, my hometown. The 50-strong crowd danced, sang and chanted political slogans for more than 20 minutes before Mr. James was finally able to raise his hand, thank them for their support and announce that he was honored to have been elected mayor of the country's third-largest city.
This Sunday is the 30th anniversary of Zimbabwe's independence from white rule and President Mugabe's rise to power. Back then, Mr. Mugabe was hailed as a liberator and conciliator. "If yesterday I fought you as an enemy, today you have become a friend," he told nervous whites at the time. For a long while he was true to his word. By the mid-1990s, Zimbabwe had become one of the most stable and prosperous countries in Africa.
But in 2000, within weeks of losing a constitutional referendum to entrench his power, Mr. Mugabe began the catastrophic land invasions that resulted in the eviction of almost all the country's 4,500 white farmers and the ruin of what was once a model post-colonial African country. Ever since, the narrative of Zimbabwe has been one of race. Rare is the speech in which Mr. Mugabe does not rail against whites, colonialists, imperialists or the West. Members of his ZANU-PF party have spoken of a "Rwandan solution" for Zimbabwe's whites.
Westerners have simply accepted this narrative of blacks and whites pitted against one another. But, in doing so, they have missed the inspiring story of what has actually been happening in Zimbabwe over the past decade. After years of mass unemployment, mutant inflation, chronic shortages and state violence, Zimbabweans simply don't care about skin color. In fact, Mr. Mugabe has managed to achieve the exact opposite of what he set out to do in 2000: the forging of a postracial state.
Brian James's story, taken in full, stands as proof of Mr. Mugabe's unwitting accomplishment. Mr. James was barely interested in politics before losing his land in 2003 -- "I just wanted to farm and play cricket on weekends" -- but afterward he joined the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, quickly rose through the ranks and was elected mayor by a virtually all-black constituency.
And Mr. James is not a singular example. One of the most popular politicians in the country is Roy Bennett, another former farmer, known to his legion of black supporters as Pachedu, "one of us." When Mr. Bennett was arrested on trumped-up treason charges last year, hundreds of black Zimbabweans surrounded the prison so that intelligence agents would not be able to smuggle him out to a more remote location where it was feared he might be tortured.
Then there is the inspiring sight of white farmers, who have been contesting the legality of the land expropriations in a regional human rights tribunal, marching into court arm in arm with their black lawyers, often dynamic women who know the laws and Constitution of the land better than those sitting in judgment. This belies Mr. Mugabe's image of a country divided by race.
My parents, owners of a backpacker resort, are part of this new Zimbabwe. Like most whites, they once steered clear of politics. But in 2002, when their home came under siege, my father joined the M.D.C. By 2005, their lodge had become a meeting place for black political dissidents who would disguise themselves as priests to avoid detection by Mr. Mugabe's militia.
In 2008, the lodge became a safe house for three black activists, Pishai Muchauraya, Prosper Mutseyami and Misheck Kagurabadza, who had won seats in Mugabe strongholds and were now on the run from government death squads. My mother, as tough-as-nails a white African as any, still gets emotional when she talks of the courage of her three "fugitives," all of whom are now friends and in Parliament, part of the fractious national unity government set up between Mr. Mugabe and the M.D.C. in 2009.
Mr. Mugabe knows exactly what he is doing in constantly invoking race-based rhetoric. By framing the crisis in Zimbabwe as a struggle against the West -- against the white world -- he escapes censure from other postcolonial African leaders who understand their own countries' histories in the same way. And when the West allows Mr. Mugabe's narrative to go unchallenged, it plays right into his hands.
Overlooked in the racial invective are some basic and important facts. Mr. Mugabe has accused white farmers of being colonial-era "settlers," but about 70 percent of them actually purchased their land after independence, with signed permission from Mr. Mugabe himself. And far from owning 70 percent of the land in the country, as was widely believed, those white farmers owned only half of our commercial land -- just 14 percent of Zimbabwe's total land. With that land, however, they used to produce more than 60 percent of all agricultural crops, and 50 percent of all foreign earnings. One only has to look at the decline in food production and collapse of the economy since 2000 to appreciate how vital white farmers were to the well-being of the nation.
All but ignored was the other major target of the land grabs: black farm workers. Some 300,000 blacks were employed on white farms up until 2000 -- two million people, if one counts their dependents -- and they overwhelmingly supported the M.D.C. By destroying white farms, Mr. Mugabe wiped out a major base of black opposition. It is hardly surprising, then, that black workers often stood with white employers to resist Mr. Mugabe's violent invaders. When has that ever happened in post-colonial Africa?
I am often asked by friends in the United States if there is any hope for Zimbabwe, and I always answer yes. Then I tell them a story about a funeral.
Not long before he was elected mayor, Brian James lost his wife, Sheelagh, in a car crash in Mutare. Her funeral was held on the lawns of the local golf club and 300 mourners turned up, among them white farmers, black friends and an M.D.C. choir. The day before the funeral, my father was with Pishai Muchauraya, the former M.D.C. fugitive and soon-to-be member of Parliament, when he received a phone call from the leader of the choir. They had a problem, they told Mr. Muchauraya: they had never been to the funeral of a white woman before and did not know what to sing.
"What's that got to do with it?" Mr. Muchauraya snapped. "Mrs. James was an African just like you. Sing what you normally sing." When he turned to apologize for the interruption, he saw my father had tears in his eyes.

Full text: Wall Street has always loved the fees generated by deal-crazy oil companies. But the recent flurry of activity in the energy industry -- $130 billion so far this year and counting -- is once again making them the most valuable clients for the world's merger advisers.
Oil and gas producers often jostle with financial services firms for the top sector spot in merger activity. High oil prices, above $80 a barrel on Wednesday, may be helping to give the energy sector the edge by increasing company valuations. So far this year, the industry has spawned 46 transactions worth $500 million or above, racing past the financial sector, which had just 31 deals, according to Thomson Reuters.
But resurgent energy prices are only part of the story. After all, natural gas -- which has been at the epicenter of much deal-making -- still languishes at less than a third of its 2005 peak. Instead, the recent flurry of activity is mainly a result of a race to lock up resources. With 87 percent of the world's oil reserves controlled by foreign governments or national champions, big private energy companies are finding it harder to replace lost production. From 2002 to 2008, Exxon Mobil, for instance, managed to replenish just 39 percent of production through new exploration. This has put the burden squarely on deal-making.
Merger advisers also owe a debt of gratitude to China, which is trying to feed surging domestic demand for energy. Acquisitions by Chinese national oil companies made up nearly 40 percent of the value of deals outside the United States in the first quarter of the year, according to IHS Herold. Bidding pressure from deep-pocketed Chinese companies -- including Sinopec's purchase of a piece of Conoco's business in Canada's oil sands this week -- pushes up the value of deals.
In addition, as old-style cheap oil gets harder to find, resources that were once fringe, like gas shale, oil sands and subsalt oil, are receiving more attention. The greater technical challenge of extracting these hoards helps explain the recent wave of deals in the oil services sector, including Schlumberger's pending $11 billion takeover of Smith International.
The widening so-called contango in oil -- with near-term contracts trading at a discount to longer-dated ones -- may point to an ominous glut. But with so many broad trends driving energy deals, even a retreat in the price of oil is unlikely to end the party for M.& A. bankers.
Asian Revaluation
Singapore may just be a dot on the map, but it has long been viewed as a leader in economic policy by other Asian countries, including China. That's why investors took so much notice when the city-state revalued its currency by about 1.3 percent on Wednesday.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore shifted its currency band to contain imported inflation. This approach is not open to China, where inflationary pressures are homegrown and the currency looks more significantly undervalued. Nevertheless, Beijing can learn from Singapore's model, which offers a better balance between stability and flexibility.
China needs to make its exchange rate less rigid to counter accusations that it has been manipulating its currency, the renminbi. However, Beijing doesn't want too much currency fluctuation. That's why Singapore's "basket, band and crawl" model might be appealing to leaders in Beijing.
The Singapore dollar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies, and allowed to fluctuate within a 4 percent band. However, the contents of the basket are secret, as are the upper and lower limits of the band. Singapore can also move the midpoint of the band, as it did on Wednesday.
Of course, there are huge differences between a city-state and the world's third-largest economy. Singapore, whose foreign trade is three times its gross domestic product, has to allow enough freedom in its exchange rate to achieve domestic price stability. In China, where foreign trade accounts for 50 percent of G.D.P., that incentive is much smaller.
Moreover, China could not adopt Singapore's approach without a significant one-time appreciation in its currency. Otherwise, it would be hard to create a two-way trade: China currently restricts the renminbi's movement against the dollar to just 0.5 percent every day.
Nevertheless, as China considers making its exchange rate more flexible, the Singapore model is worth studying.

Bernanke Says a Plan to Address the U.S. Deficit Could Keep Rates Down

Abstract: Under a more gloomy situation -- one that assumes 60,000 American troops in overseas operations by 2015, discretionary spending growing at the rate of nominal gross domestic product, the extension of expiring tax cuts and an inflation-indexed alternative minimum tax -- the deficit could reach 9 percent of G.D.P. by 2020, he said. Letting its currency, the renminbi, appreciate would give China's central bank more flexibility in monetary policy and help stimulate domestic demand and consumption, Mr. Bernanke said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman said Wednesday that the government had to make "difficult choices" to address its gaping deficits and warned that "postponing them will only make them more difficult."
The chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that a credible plan for reining in federal deficits could help lower long-term interest rates. "Although sizable deficits are unavoidable in the near term, maintaining the confidence of the public and financial markets requires that policy makers move decisively to set the federal budget on a trajectory toward sustainable fiscal balance," he said.
In testimony to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Mr. Bernanke said that a moderate recovery had begun, but that it would take "a significant amount of time" to restore the 8.5 million jobs lost in the last two years. Of particular concern, he said, was that 44 percent of the unemployed in March had been jobless for at least six months.
Inflation, the other side of Mr. Bernanke's mandate as Fed chairman, remains low. Personal consumption spending, the index of inflation the Fed uses the most, has been rising at an annual rate of 1.25 percent. Excluding the more volatile prices of food and energy, core inflation has slowed to an annual rate of 0.5 percent.
Mr. Bernanke did not provide new details on the Fed's policy stance that short-term interest rates would remain near zero for "an extended period." He said that time frame was contingent on high unemployment, subdued inflation and stable inflation expectations.
"If those conditions cease to hold, and we anticipate changes in the outlook, then of course we will respond to that," he told the committee's chairwoman, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York.
Mr. Bernanke's fiscal admonitions came a week after he gave a speech in Dallas warning that the country must prepare for the aging of the population. They could give momentum to the bipartisan fiscal commission created by President Obama. He did not specify whether he believed the government should raise taxes, make cuts to Social Security and other benefits programs, or do something else.
He did warn the nation's debts and deficits could at some point alarm investors and raise the government's borrowing costs.
"At some point, the markets will make a judgment about, really, not our economic capacity but our political ability, our political will, to achieve longer-term sustainability," Mr. Bernanke told Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. "At that point interest rates could go up and that would be, of course, a negative for economic growth and recovery."
Could it happen now? Mr. Bernanke replied, "It's absolutely possible, certainly."
Later, he told Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, that "right now the markets are essentially signaling a lot of confidence that our political system will deliver a sustainable trajectory of fiscal policy" over the next few decades.
"If we don't do it, or we give a strong indication that we're not going to be able to do it," he warned, "then it would not be something that we have to worry about in 2040; it could be something we have to worry about on Wednesday."
The deficit will start to "recede somewhat" over the next two years as the stimulus winds down and the recovery brings in more revenue, but is projected to remain around 4 to 5 percent of gross domestic product through 2020, Mr. Bernanke said.
Under a more gloomy situation -- one that assumes 60,000 American troops in overseas operations by 2015, discretionary spending growing at the rate of nominal gross domestic product, the extension of expiring tax cuts and an inflation-indexed alternative minimum tax -- the deficit could reach 9 percent of G.D.P. by 2020, he said.
Mr. Bernanke also addressed the politically heated issue of China's currency. He told Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, that "most economists agree the Chinese currency is undervalued and has been used to promote a more export-oriented economy. I think it would be good for the Chinese to allow more flexibility in their exchange rate."
Letting its currency, the renminbi, appreciate would give China's central bank more flexibility in monetary policy and help stimulate domestic demand and consumption, Mr. Bernanke said.
He also told Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, that the Fed would not try to monetize debts by increasing the money and credit supply and stimulating inflation.
"Given that so many of our obligations are either short-term or indexed or are real obligations, such as medical obligations or Social Security obligations, which are indexed, it wouldn't have a substantial effect, even if there were a willingness to do that, which, of course, there is not," he said. "Inflation is just not an answer, either for economic reasons and just because it wouldn't affect the balance very much."
Mr. Bernanke said the economy had begun to recover in the second half of 2009, as companies worked down excess inventories and expanded production.
Since the middle of last year, consumer spending has been rising at a rate of about 2.5 percent a year, and car sales picked up in March. Manufacturing in the eight months ending in February grew at an annual rate of 8 percent, in part because of stronger demand from foreign markets.
But Mr. Bernanke also described "significant restraints on the pace of the recovery." Sales of new and existing homes fell in January and February, the pace of housing starts is sluggish, and the commercial real estate market is still shrinking, he said. State and local governments, he added, have cut back on jobs and construction spending.
Mr. Bernanke said that banks and financial markets had recovered since the 2008 crisis, in part because of the Fed's extraordinary lending programs and "stress tests" that bolstered investor confidence.
However, lending to households and businesses has continued to fall, a result of a sluggish demand and a fall in creditworthy borrowers, he said.

Full text: Strong earnings reports excited Wall Street on Wednesday, pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index above the 1,200-point threshold for the first time since the beginning of the financial crisis.
An energetic banking sector drove much of the momentum. JPMorgan Chasesaid its profit had surged 55 percent in the first quarter and raised its outlook for 2010, sending shares up 4.1 percent to $47.73.
As confidence about the profit-making potential of the financial sector improved, shares of other banks rose, too: Citigroup rose 6.7 percent; Bank of America, 3.9 percent; Wells Fargo, 3.5 percent; and Goldman Sachs, 3.2 percent.
Technology stocks soared after Intelsaid that its net income had nearly quadrupled in the last year. The company also upgraded its outlook for the year amid signs that businesses were replacing aging computer systems.
Intel rose 3.3 percent to $23.52 a share. Microsoft climbed 1.2 percent, and Apple rose 1.3 percent, partly because it reported stronger-than-expected demand for its iPad device.
Shares of the transportation company CSX surged 4.1 percent, to $55.46, after it said it was poised for strong profit this year.
The bright earnings results reinforced a sense that companies had found revenue streams and would benefit from a steady rise in consumer and business spending later this year.
"Investors are wanting to get visibility, to achieve certainty, so they know the money they put in now isn't going to come back to bite them in a few months," said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management. "The next two quarters are critical."
At the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 103.69 points, or 0.94 percent, to 11,123.11, its first triple-digit gain this month. The S.& P. 500 gained 13.35 points, or 1.12 percent, to 1,210.65, its highest level since September 2008. The Nasdaq was the day's best performer, helped by Intel's surge, climbing 38.87 points, or 1.58 percent, to 2,504.86.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 10/32, to 98 3/32. The yield rose to 3.86 percent, from 3.82 percent late Tuesday.
Recent rallies have been small and trading had been light, raising doubts about whether a 13-month rally on Wall Street would endure. But Wednesday's performance broke that pattern.
Investors' hopes were reinforced a report from the Commerce Department showing that retail sales rose 1.6 percent in March.
In addition, an anecdotal survey by the Federal Reserve described improving economic conditions across the country in March, with sales and production of manufactured goods picking up. Unemployment remained high, but the Fed said an increase in hiring was evident.
A report from the Labor Department suggested inflation remained subdued in March, with consumer prices rising 0.1 percent. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices were unchanged.
In addition, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, emphasized the challenges facing the American economy in testimony to a Congressional committee on Wednesday. Wall Street analysts viewed his remarks as a sign that the Fed was in no hurry to raise rates. Mr. Bernanke reiterated the threat of rising deficits to growth, and he offered no firm timetable on the central bank's plans to scale back extraordinary interventions.
"The market is not excessively worried about inflation right now," said Alan M. Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Investments.

Full text: Sales rose robustly in March across a wide range of retail stores, another sign that American consumers were beginning to spend more freely even as the job market remained weak.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales climbed 1.6 percent last month compared with February, largely because of a jump in car sales. Analysts had expected a 1.2 percent increase.
The report provided the latest evidence that consumers were gaining confidence, despite pervasive unemployment and large debt burdens. Pent-up demand is anchoring much of the growth, economists say, though there are signs that credit is becoming more available.
Increasingly, economists are saying that consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, may be more robust this year than previously thought. But they say that the recent burst of enthusiasm could fade as government stimulus spending wanes and if the labor market remains weak.
"Across the board, you've got robust gains," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. "To maintain this momentum, we've got to see a pickup in job creation."
Sales were up at stores of many types: building materials climbed 1.3 percent and clothing sales increased 2.3 percent.
Spending is "growing more than we originally anticipated," Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, an investment firm, wrote in a research note. "This is a fact that cannot be ignored."
Car sales were the report's bright spot, climbing 6.8 percent. Earlier this month, carmakers reported that incentives helped them post a 24 percent increase in March sales, the industry's largest year-over-year increase in eight years.
Total retail sales in March also surged compared with their level a year earlier, rising 7.6 percent, the Commerce Department said.
Whether that trend will continue is unclear. While the unemployment rate has remained steady at 9.7 percent, some analysts expect that number to climb.
In addition, the government is likely to begin scaling back stimulus efforts, including incentives to buy homes. Interest rates, kept at record lows during the financial crisis to spur lending, may also rise.
The rosier outlook for sales was underscored in a report by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, which showed economic activity picking up across most of the country.
The Fed's "beige book" survey found that businesses generally reported better sales and increased production last month. Many employers, however, remained reluctant to hire permanent workers.
"While overall labor markets remained weak, some hiring activity was evident," the Fed report said.
A separate report on Wednesday suggested that the stimulus efforts had not yet spurred inflation. Consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in March, the Labor Department said, largely because of higher prices for fruits and vegetables. The price of medical care and new and used vehicles also rose. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices were flat.
"Inflation as measured by the government is going nowhere but down," Mr. Greenhaus wrote.
The data will probably give the Federal Reserve breathing room as it seeks to keep the benchmark federal funds rate near zero.
Still, some economists point to increases in food and energy prices, coupled with a weak dollar, as evidence that inflation may be in the pipeline.
The Consumer Price Index has increased 2.3 percent in the last year -- slightly higher than the Fed's target rate -- and some costs, including energy and education, have surged. Tuition costs surged more than 6 percent last month.
Prices have been held back by a weak real estate market, with rents continuing to decline.
Some economists say they believe that prices are so subdued that the more pressing concern is deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Whether deflation emerges as a threat may depend largely on the strength of the recovery and whether demand can remain robust even in the absence of government efforts.
The Labor Department said Wednesday that the average weekly salary increased 0.1 percent in March over the previous month.
Economists are watching that number closely as they try to gauge when the job market might begin to improve more substantially. Businesses typically begin to add hours and wages before making permanent hires.
In its report on retail sales, the government said sales were stronger in February than originally estimated. They rose 0.5 percent rather than 0.3 percent.

Abstract: After Mr. Obama met with President Hu Jintao of China in Washington on Monday, the White House made a low-key statement that Mr. Obama had pressed Mr. Hu on the need to "move toward a more market-oriented exchange rate" and played up China's pledge of cooperation on sanctions for Iran. Ministry officials latched on to the fact that China recorded its first monthly trade deficit in six years in March -- a one-time blip because of fast imports of raw materials for China's export industry -- to argue that their cheap currency is not the cause of global trade and financial imbalances.

Full text: We think President Obama made the right decision -- for now -- not to pick too public of a fight with China over its currency manipulation.
The administration postponed a report to Congress due this week on Chinese monetary policy. After Mr. Obama met with President Hu Jintao of China in Washington on Monday, the White House made a low-key statement that Mr. Obama had pressed Mr. Hu on the need to "move toward a more market-oriented exchange rate" and played up China's pledge of cooperation on sanctions for Iran.
Beijing's aggressive undervaluation of the renminbi is a serious problem for the American economy and the global economy. Going one on one is likely to backfire. The best hope for persuading China to change its ways is with sustained pressure from many countries. It will certainly make it harder for Beijing to hide behind claims of sovereignty and accusations of big power bullying.
That means that Mr. Obama will have to work hard to rally others to jointly press the issue. The best forum is coming in June when the leaders of the world's biggest economies gather at the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto. They need to use that occasion to tell China, in no uncertain terms, that it cannot keep building up its own economy by undercutting the rest of the world's exports.
They need to leave no doubt in Beijing's mind, that its global standing will suffer if it does not listen. Few countries have benefited as much as China from the open trading system. Under sufficient pressure from its trading partners, Beijing would be likely to relent.
It's still not clear how hard they will have to push.
At Monday's White House meeting, Mr. Hu reportedly told Mr. Obama that China planned to move away from its fixed currency peg to the dollar. He didn't say when. And according to remarks released by the Foreign Ministry, he also stated that the objective of changing China's currency strategy "won't be advanced by any foreign pressure." Mr. Hu's next stop is Brazil. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said last week that China's exchange rate peg is hurting Brazil's manufacturing. We hope that Brazilian officials are just as direct in their meetings with the Chinese president.
This is a global problem. The renminbi's fixed and artificially cheap exchange rate is undercutting exporters throughout the developing world. It also is seriously complicating economic policy-making among China's neighbors. So long as the Chinese currency remains so cheap, they cannot afford to combat burgeoning inflation by allowing their own currencies to rise because it could further undercut their exports.
China would also benefit from shifting from exports to internal consumption as a source for growth. It would improve the living standards of its citizens. It would ease the job of its central bank in trying to keep inflation at bay. And it would establish China as a more responsible player on the global economic stage.
The Chinese bureaucracy is clearly split. Central bank officials have been arguing for some time that a stronger currency would help them combat rising inflation. The Commerce Ministry is adamantly opposed. Ministry officials latched on to the fact that China recorded its first monthly trade deficit in six years in March -- a one-time blip because of fast imports of raw materials for China's export industry -- to argue that their cheap currency is not the cause of global trade and financial imbalances.
It is. China should not be allowed to forget it. Barring a change of exchange rate policy, China's trade surpluses are going to bloat again in the months to come.
This is not a problem just between the United States and China. It is a problem between China and most of the world. The challenge for President Obama now is to get the rest of the world's leaders to deliver that message as clearly and urgently as they can.

Full text: HONG KONG -- Even though China's leaders appear to have reached a consensus that the nation's currency policy must change, the timing of any shift has been complicated by surging nationalism, a media frenzy in China over the issue and visits by top officials in recent days.
China has spent several trillion renminbi in the last 21 months to prevent its currency from rising against the dollar. American lawmakers have become increasingly critical of the policy, complaining that it keeps Chinese exports artificially cheap.
The Chinese news media, which have far more freedom to report on economic issues than political ones, have framed the currency issue mainly in terms of protecting Chinese sovereignty. That has prompted a series of assurances by Chinese officials in the last four days that China will not be pushed by foreign pressure into doing anything against its own interests.
President Hu Jintao told President Obama in Washington on Monday that China would set its currency policy according to its own social and economic development needs, according to Xinhua, the official China news agency.
Xinhua, the People's Daily newspaper and Chinese state television all gave prominent coverage to what they described as an assurance by Mr. Obama to Mr. Hu that the United States respected Chinese sovereignty regarding the currency. White House officials confirmed that the two leaders had talked about the currency, but provided few details.
Mr. Hu's visit to Washington followed a brief trip by the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to Beijing last week, which drew considerable attention to the currency issue even though he tried to keep a low profile. Mr. Geithner flew into the airport, met with Vice Premier Wang Qishan at the airport V.I.P. lounge and quickly left without making any public statements.
American officials have been concerned that public opinion in China against revaluing the currency might make it harder for the government to act. Robert D. Hormats, the United States under secretary of state for economic, energy and agricultural affairs, said during a visit to China last weekend that a flurry of public discussion about the renminbi late last week had proved "counterproductive."
Allowing the renminbi to appreciate would make Chinese-made goods more expensive overseas. But many economists, both in China and in the West, say revaluation would be in China's interest.
Appreciation of the currency would help control inflation, limit China's need to buy low-yielding United States Treasury securities and free China to raise interest rates to halt an emerging real estate bubble.
Investment bank economists are generally skeptical that China will change its currency policy before June, and possibly later. People close to Chinese policy makers say that officials would prefer to do it much sooner, but that it became impossible to act in the days before Mr. Hu's visit to Washington, as the issue suddenly drew broad public attention.
Mr. Hu's trip to Washington for a nuclear security summit meeting has made any immediate policy shift more difficult, added these people, who asked not to be identified by name because of the financial and diplomatic implications of the issue.
An official close to Chinese currency policy makers said that Mr. Geithner's visit had also made it harder to handle the issue quietly.
Several people close to Chinese policy makers said that the matter had been complicated by an article last week in The New York Times, which said that Chinese officials were very close to announcing a shift in currency policy and might even act before Mr. Hu's Washington visit if no problem emerged.
The problem for Chinese officials is that the sovereignty issue arose just as they had finally reached consensus that it was in China's interest to make the exchange rate more flexible and allow the renminbi to appreciate gradually against the dollar, people with knowledge of the Chinese policy development said.
Through the National People's Congress in Beijing in mid-March and in the following weeks, senior Commerce Ministry officials had led a chorus of criticism of the United States and vowed resistance to any change in the value of the renminbi.
On March 21, Chen Deming, the commerce minister, warned that China would post a trade deficit for the month, its first in nearly six years, and said that pressuring China to change its policy was "irrational" in light of the trade gap. China's vice commerce minister, Zhong Shan, visited Washington three days later and said that appreciation of the renminbi was "not a good recipe for solving problems."
But the Commerce Ministry did an about-face at the end of last week. Shortly before the customs agency disclosed on Saturday that China had indeed run a $7.2 billion deficit in March, Mr. Chen declared that the deficit was "only a blip on the radar and will in no way hamper the country's strong economic growth." He added that China would resume trade surpluses in the months ahead.
Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China's central bank, also seemed to lend support to the idea of a stronger currency when he said last weekend that fighting inflation was the central bank's top priority. A weak currency tends to fan inflation, by making imported goods more expensive.

NASA, We've Got a Problem. But It Can Be Fixed.

Abstract: [...] space exploration has become so costly that this level of financing won't even pay for a return to the Moon anytime soon, which is what prompted the White House to cancel the Bush administration's lunar mission. While private companies would ferry humans and cargo into orbit, NASA would be redirected into basic research and development of technologies for trips far beyond Earth, according to Mr. Obama's plan.

Full text: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- During his trip to the Kennedy Space Center this week, President Obama will be confronted with an awkward political reality: when it comes to space exploration, sometimes even Republicans can be passionate advocates for the public option.
They've joined with Democratic colleagues in Congress to oppose Mr. Obama's plan to reduce NASA's missions and to encourage private companies' rockets to haul cargo and astronauts into space. Mr. Obama's critics accuse him of abandoning NASA's glorious trailblazing tradition -- and maybe, if your constituents have jobs at NASA, it's possible to see something pioneering about an agency whose flagship goes a few hundred miles into space.
But four decades after the moon landing, why isn't NASA venturing somewhere more exotic? The glory days of the Apollo moon missions were possible only because of the race against the Soviet Union, and Mr. Obama could revive that spirit by starting a new space race. But not if he gives in to demands to keep NASA wobbling along in current fashion.
The main problem with NASA is not lack of money. Its current budget is about the same size, when adjusted for inflation, as the average during the 1960s and early 1970s. But space exploration has become so costly that this level of financing won't even pay for a return to the Moon anytime soon, which is what prompted the White House to cancel the Bush administration's lunar mission.
Normally, once a pioneer makes the first trip somewhere, the cost goes down as others follow and technology improves. That's why so many colonists could follow Columbus to the New World, and why the masses today can afford to fly in Lindbergh's path back to Europe. The real costs of shipping freight by rail and air have declined by an order of magnitude since locomotives and airplanes were invented.
In space transportation, though, many costs have actually risen since the days of Apollo. NASA estimates that each seven-person space shuttle mission now costs about $65 million per astronaut, and outside experts say the true cost, once you add in all shuttle-related expenses, is double or triple that figure. Even a cramped trip to the space station on the Russian government's Soyuz will cost the United States more than $50 million per astronaut.
Elon Musk has promised to do the job for just $20 million by building his own rocket, which is being readied for a test launch next month. His company, SpaceX, is saving money through innovations like assembling the rocket horizontally inside a prefab hangar here at Cape Canaveral, thereby avoiding the costs of the customized towers and scaffolding used by NASA to assemble its rockets vertically.
The most important innovation for the space program, Mr. Musk said, would be to get away from the old "cost plus" model in which NASA contractors are guaranteed a profit on top of whatever costs they incur.
"The cost-plus approach encourages aerospace companies to find the most expensive way to do something and drag it out as long as possible," said
Mr. Musk, the entrepreneur who co-founded PayPal. "Future contracts should be given to meet milestones based on objective design reviews and actual hardware completion. If a company meets the milestone, they get paid. If not, they don't."
Under Mr. Obama's new plan, there would be further encouragement for SpaceX and other private companies. The traditional aerospace companies remain leery of the plans, as my colleague Ken Chang reported Monday, but there are other upstarts besides SpaceX working on projects to get humans into space, and they would be potential competitors.
While private companies would ferry humans and cargo into orbit, NASA would be redirected into basic research and development of technologies for trips far beyond Earth, according to Mr. Obama's plan. This R&D, as White House officials are quick to note in preparation for their Florida trip, would provide jobs in some of the Congressional districts affected by the closing of the shuttle and lunar programs.
In theory, it could make sense for NASA to be doing the high-risk advanced research that could yield breakthroughs for a trip to Mars. But how much progress would NASA actually make?
One way to encourage innovation would be to convert some of NASA's divisions into versions of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which has successfully sent robotic probes across the solar system. The laboratory is financed by NASA but operated by CalTech, and therefore freer to innovate outside of political and Civil Service constraints. A presidential commission in 2004 recommendedthat NASA convert some of its research centers to this academic model, but the agency's bureaucracy showed little interest in surrendering control.
Another way to prod NASA would be to set specific goals. Robert Zubrin, the president of the Mars Society, argues that NASA has been effective only when given a definite destination and hard timetable -- the Apollo Mode, as he calls it, which is still used successfully on robotic missions.
But since the moon landings, he said, the human spaceflight program has been stuck in the Shuttle Mode, in which the agency develops technologies to please bureaucratic and political constituencies. Instead of looking for the best ship to reach a goal, it looked for a goal (like the space station) to justify the ship. To Dr. Zubrin, the new Obama plan looks like more of the Shuttle Mode.
"The plan proposes to spend $100 billion on human spaceflight over the next 10 years in order to accomplish nothing," he said. "If we are going to have a NASA human spaceflight program, it must be given a goal."
Dr. Zubrin would like to see NASA committed to a goal like building a ship to reach an asteroid by 2016 (a year that would just happen to fall within a second Obama term) as preparation for a journey to Mars. That's not a bad goal, although I can't see how the agency could afford to make the trip itself.
What it could do is oversee a competition among companies like SpaceX or whatever nonprofit groups wanted to participate. It could offer a series of prizes, like the cash bonus that Lindbergh collected for crossing the Atlantic. Or there could be contracts given to the competitors that would be based strictly on their performance, not on their costs. (To debate these ideas, go to nytimes.com/tierneylab.)
What if Mr. Obama, in Kennedyesque fashion, started a race to Mars in which NASA set milestones along the way and rewarded competitors only when they passed each one?
"It'd be cool to set a Mars goal," Mr. Musk said. "Personally, I think it could be done in 10 years." Maybe he's being overoptimistic, but what's the harm in letting him -- and everyone else -- go for it?

Full text: PARIS -- France and Germany traditionally have been the "motor" of the European Union, but relations between the two countries are badly strained over the Greek debt crisis, which is just the latest example of a new German willingness to resist the demands of Europe and assert its self-interest under Chancellor Angela Merkel.
"There has been a tectonic shift in the way Germany acts in Europe," said Ulrike Guerot, a senior research fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. Germans, she says, are "talking of behaving 'normally' now, like the others, and that means nationally."
The European Union is facing a serious crisis over financing and its currency, the euro. But France and Germany also have important disagreements on policy toward Russia, China and Iran, making a coherent European foreign policy increasingly difficult to discern on an array of critical issues.
The French and the Germans, with different domestic constituencies and different attitudes toward economic policy, have a different view of how Europe and the euro zone, the 16 nations that have adopted the euro as their currency, should be managed. Germany, long the financier of the European Union, has made it clear that it will no longer pay for the mistakes and frauds of others.
France has put a much stronger emphasis on European unity and pride, trying to avoid involving multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund in the future of the euro, a prominent symbol of Europe's challenge to the supremacy of the United States.
"Germany is no longer, as a matter of course or of principle, the motor, heart and savior of Europe," said Constanze Stelzenmuller, a senior fellow of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. "This isn't the Europe we signed up for. It's much larger, much poorer, and we have to take care of our own."
Germany always acted in its interests, Ms. Guerot said, but those were perceived as sublimated within the European Union and NATO, the two postwar multilateral institutions that both protected the new democratic Germany and kept its ambitions in check. Now Germany is turning more obviously to Russia for energy and commercial interests, she said, making its European and American partners uneasy.
"We sublimated hegemony," said Ms. Guerot, a German who is working on a paper called "Germany Unbound." "But we're dropping the sublimation now." She laughed, then said: "Of course, this doesn't sound nice to others."
Before a European Union summit meeting in Brussels last month on the Greek crisis, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was reportedly in a rage, unable to push Mrs. Merkel toward a more explicit promise of help for Greece.
Mr. Sarkozy yelled at the European Union president, Herman Van Rompuy, whom he summoned to Paris, European Union officials said. He threatened to boycott the summit meeting, while muttering that the Germans "haven't changed," according to French officials.
Mrs. Merkel, for her part, remained calm as Mr. Sarkozy cooled down, but she stood by her position -- that German taxpayers should not suffer for Greek mismanagement and laxity or set a precedent for future rescues of other weaker Mediterranean countries like Portugal, Spain and even Italy. Her stand, which included a role for the International Monetary Fund, created resentment in the rest of the euro zone, accustomed to German sacrifice for larger European political and economic goals.
With a neo-liberal coalition partner, the Free Democrats, and with important elections coming next month in North Rhine-Westphalia, which could cost her ruling coalition control of the upper house in Berlin, Mrs. Merkel stood up for German interests and was hailed afterward at home.
She also cited constitutional restraints against Germany bailing out other countries, concerns that France took as something of a pretext.
Criticism of German economic policy "expresses a French malaise toward the growing gap between the two economies, and more generally toward this new Germany without which nothing is possible anymore in Europe, and which seems less and less likely to compromise if not in its national interests," Jacques-Pierre Gougeon, a Germany specialist at the French Institute for International and Strategic Relations, wrote in the newspaper Le Monde.
At the heart of the dispute is the euro. The French see it as the currency of a new, united Europe; the Germans see it as the direct descendant of the mark, and the European Central Bank as retaining the DNA of the Bundesbank, whose main task was to keep inflation down. The French favor a kind of European economic government, with easier rules on deficits; the Germans have no intention of giving up economic sovereignty to anyone, let alone to the French.
In the Greek crisis, for example, Germany has insisted that any aid to Greece come as a last resort, and in the loan package arranged on Sunday it insisted that Greece pay a significant penalty in interest rates. This was well within Mrs. Merkel's guidelines and does not represent a subsidy to Greece, said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
"The German taxpayer is much more likely to make money from this deal than to lose it, and the agreement is within the framework of what she agreed upon in successive Brussels summits," he added.
Germany also reacted angrily and defensively to a modest French suggestion by Finance Minister Christine Lagarde that the German export model had to change in the interests of other, less competitive euro zone countries, and that Germans should spend more buying the goods of their less fortunate neighbors.
Germans, who have already undergone a wrenching structural reform and paid a huge bill to integrate the former eastern Germany, say they feel that "they're paying a significant personal price," Mr. Klau said. "Poverty has increased considerably in Germany and is now a social reality. And it makes Germany more inward-looking than the old West Germany, and a more defensive country."
Part of the change is generational, with Mrs. Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, representing those born after World War II, with only anecdotal knowledge of Nazi Germany. The members of Parliament are even younger, many of them teenagers or younger when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
So the German leadership paradigm from Konrad Adenauer through Helmut Kohl -- roughly 1949 to 1989, when Germany was a crucial junior partner both for NATO and European integration -- is gone. "When Germany steps out of the film, it changes," Ms. Guerot said.
Despite symbolic efforts to bring Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel together -- unveiling joint projects at the Arc de Triomphe last February or a recent stunt of having Ms. Lagarde sit in on a German cabinet meeting -- "With the French we have more that divides us than unites us," Ms. Guerot said.
Germans feel they have paid both their reparations and their dues, "and many times over," said Ms. Stelzenmuller, especially in an uncertain time of globalization and financial crisis. "People want to be normal, in the sense that other people don't come to us first and say, 'You have to pay.' And it doesn't have much to do with political orientation. All of us are huddling with our backs against the storm."

Abstract: Mortgage rates and car loans are linked to the yield on long-term bonds. Besides the inflation fears set off by the strengthening economy, Mr. Gross said he was also wary of Treasury bonds because he feared the burgeoning supply of new debt issued to finance the government's huge budget deficits would overwhelm demand, driving interest rates higher.

Full text: Even as prospects for the American economy brighten, consumers are about to face a new financial burden: a sustained period of rising interest rates.
That, economists say, is the inevitable outcome of the nation's ballooning debt and the renewed prospect of inflation as the economy recovers from the depths of the recent recession.
The shift is sure to come as a shock to consumers whose spending habits were shaped by a historic 30-year decline in the cost of borrowing.
"Americans have assumed the roller coaster goes one way," said Bill Gross, whose investment firm, Pimco, has taken part in a broad sell-off of government debt, which has pushed up interest rates. "It's been a great thrill as rates descended, but now we face an extended climb."
The impact of higher rates is likely to be felt first in the housing market, which has only recently begun to rebound from a deep slump. The rate for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has risen half a point since December, hitting 5.31 last week, the highest level since last summer.
Along with the sell-off in bonds, the Federal Reserve has halted its emergency $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage debt, placing even more upward pressure on rates.
"Mortgage rates are unlikely to go lower than they are now, and if they go higher, we're likely to see a reversal of the gains in the housing market," said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School. "It's a really big risk."
Each increase of 1 percentage point in rates adds as much as 19 percent to the total cost of a home, according to Mr. Mayer.
The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the rise to continue, with the 30-year mortgage rate going to 5.5 percent by late summer and as high as 6 percent by the end of the year.
Another area in which higher rates are likely to affect consumers is credit card use. And last week, the Federal Reserve reported that the average interest rate on credit cards reached 14.26 percent in February, the highest since 2001. That is up from 12.03 percent when rates bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2008 -- a jump that amounts to about $200 a year in additional interest payments for the typical American household.
With losses from credit card defaults rising and with capital to back credit cards harder to come by, issuers are likely to increase rates to 16 or 17 percent by the fall, according to Dennis Moroney, a research director at the TowerGroup, a financial research company.
"The banks don't have a lot of pricing options," Mr. Moroney said. "They're targeting people who carry a balance from month to month."
Similarly, many car loans have already become significantly more expensive, with rates at auto finance companies rising to 4.72 percent in February from 3.26 percent in December, according to the Federal Reserve.
Washington, too, is expecting to have to pay more to borrow the money it needs for programs. The Office of Management and Budget expects the rate on the benchmark 10-year United States Treasury note to remain close to 3.9 percent for the rest of the year, but then rise to 4.5 percent in 2011 and 5 percent in 2012.
The run-up in rates is quickening as investors steer more of their money away from bonds and as Washington unplugs the economic life support programs that kept rates low through the financial crisis. Mortgage rates and car loans are linked to the yield on long-term bonds.
Besides the inflation fears set off by the strengthening economy, Mr. Gross said he was also wary of Treasury bonds because he feared the burgeoning supply of new debt issued to finance the government's huge budget deficits would overwhelm demand, driving interest rates higher.
Nine months ago, United States government debt accounted for half of the assets in Mr. Gross's flagship fund, Pimco Total Return. That has shrunk to 30 percent now -- the lowest ever in the fund's 23-year history -- as Mr. Gross has sold American bonds in favor of debt from Europe, particularly Germany, as well as from developing countries like Brazil.
Last week, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly crossed the psychologically important threshold of 4 percent, as the Treasury auctioned off $82 billion in new debt. That is nearly twice as much as the government paid in the fall of 2008, when investors sought out ultrasafe assets like Treasury securities after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of the credit crisis.
Though still very low by historical standards, the rise of bond yields since then is reversing a decline that began in 1981, when 10-year note yields reached nearly 16 percent.
From that peak, steadily dropping interest rates have fed a three-decade lending boom, during which American consumers borrowed more and more but managed to hold down the portion of their income devoted to paying off loans.
Indeed, total household debt is now nine times what it was in 1981 -- rising twice as fast as disposable income over the same period -- yet the portion of disposable income that goes toward covering that debt has budged only slightly, increasing to 12.6 percent from 10.7 percent.
Household debt has been dropping for the last two years as recession-battered consumers cut back on borrowing, but at $13.5 trillion, it still exceeds disposable income by $2.5 trillion.
The long decline in rates also helped prop up the stock market; lower rates for investments like bonds make stocks more attractive.
That tailwind, which prevented even worse economic pain during the recession, has ceased, according to interviews with economists, analysts and money managers.
"We've had almost a 30-year rally," said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard & Poor's. "That's come to an end."
Just as significant as the bottom-line impact will be the psychological fallout from not being able to buy more while paying less -- an unusual state of affairs that made consumer spending the most important measure of economic health.
"We've gotten spoiled by the idea that interest rates will stay in the low single-digits forever," said Jim Caron, an interest rate strategist with Morgan Stanley. "We've also had a generation of consumers and investors get used to low rates."
For young home buyers today considering 30-year mortgages with a rate of just over 5 percent, it might be hard to conceive of a time like October 1981, when mortgage rates peaked at 18.2 percent. That meant monthly payments of $1,523 then compared with $556 now for a $100,000 loan.
No one expects rates to return to anything resembling 1981 levels. Still, for much of Wall Street, the question is not whether rates will go up, but rather by how much.
Some firms, like Morgan Stanley, are predicting that rates could rise by a percentage point and a half by the end of the year. Others, like JPMorgan Chase are forecasting a more modest half-point jump.
But the consensus is clear, according to Terrence M. Belton, global head of fixed-income strategy for J. P. Morgan Securities. "Everyone knows that rates will eventually go higher," he said.

Full text: DESPITE the headlines about financial distress for the Greek and other European governments, many American investors have been broadening their horizons and stepping up purchases of global bond funds.
Since the first quarter of 2009, when there was an outflow of cash, funds that invest in foreign government and corporate debt have attracted a surge of new money. The enthusiasm reflects various forces, including skittishness about the dollar, a scavenging for yield at a time of ultralow domestic money market rates and a revived willingness to assume risk as the economy crawls out of recession.
"It's no longer just a tactical allocation," said Michael Hasenstab, portfolio manager of the $29 billion Templeton Global Bond fund. That fund invests at least 80 percent in bonds of governments and government agencies. "It's a strategic allocation."
His fund is the largest in the category and, with no corporate holdings, one of the purest plays on foreign government debt, interest rates and currencies.
For some, it's a matter of discovery. Traditionally, said Scott Mather, head of the global bond desk at Pimco, the bond giant, investors who worried about inflation would gravitate to commodities or foreign stocks. "They forgot about foreign bonds," he said, but they now seem to be embracing this market, which he estimated at $30 trillion.
Some $128.5 billion of new money has flowed into funds that hold foreign government and corporate bonds since the first quarter of 2009, according to EPFR Global, a research firm. In fact, a $2.98 billion surge in the week ended March 31 of this year set a one-week record.
Portfolio managers, for their part, are generally responding to the crosswinds of government finance by reducing or eliminating exposure to the most prominent of highly indebted countries -- Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland, in addition to Greece.
Some, however, are shopping amid the fallen. "We've been looking to add or bargain-hunt," said Andrew Keirle, a London portfolio manager who specializes in European debt for T. Rowe Price. He says he sees opportunity in Greek debt whose rates for 10-year bonds jumped last week to over 7 percent, about four percentage points above those of comparable German debt, a benchmark. "We think the yield is enough in the medium term to justify a small position" of overweighting the index in Greek bonds, Mr. Keirle said. He similarly favors Italian bonds.
OTHERS are shuffling their portfolios to improve quality, shorten maturities, add corporate debt or seek protection with short sales, or even the credit default swaps that have attracted so much official and public opprobrium.
The Vanguard fund family has been somewhat less venturesome. It has huge international bond holdings, half of them in index funds, but no funds specifically dedicated to a particular type or geographic area.
"We think volatility, particularly in Europe, will continue for a while, so we're being cautious," said Jonathan Lemco, Vanguard's sovereign-risk analyst.
He is favorably disposed to countries like Canada, Germany, Mexico and Brazil. But he is leery about prospects for Spain, Portugal and Britain. He says he believes that British bonds could lose their triple-A rating within a year, especially if the winning party does not have a decisive victory in the May 6 election.
Indeed, most specialists seem to agree with Robert Robis, a portfolio manager of the $12.9 billion Oppenheimer International Bond fund, that many of what he called onetime fiscal "basket cases" are performing better than developed countries as a group these days.
"They're doing the right things, running the right policies," Mr. Robis said of emerging-market countries, noting much-improved ratios of debt to gross domestic product. His fund has raised its exposure to these countries to about 50 percent, from 40 percent in the last few years.
Mr. Hasenstab at Templeton observed: "The tables have turned. Now the highly indebted are the developed markets."
The ratio of debt to G.D.P. for emerging economies is just 40 percent, according to a January report by Deutsche Bank, compared with 106 percent for the developed world. And one of the most vigorous advocates of foreign bonds is Pimco, which contends that their merits have become increasingly compelling.
In a market letter, Pimco said that investing globally provides diversification and far more choice of securities, and helps overcome a bias among investors toward their home markets.
An investor in the United States who avoids foreign bonds ignores 65 percent of the world's bond supply, Pimco said. And because the American currency is likely to suffer from weak economic growth, easy fiscal and monetary policy, and global pressures, Pimco contended, "Investors will likely be rewarded for diversifying their currency exposures away from the U.S. dollar."
Oppenheimer's fund embraces currency risk, saying that it "makes no sense" not to do so. "We run an unhedged fund," Mr. Robis said. Not only does currency exposure add to diversification and reduce risks of home-currency inflation, he added, but "the costs of hedging eliminate so much of the yield advantage."
His fund's biggest overweighting is in Italy, which he said was less dependent than others on foreign financing. He said its high debt level was not as important as its less-frightening trade and current accounts.
Mr. Hasenstab of Templeton views things differently. "We've learned the importance of having a flexible hedging strategy," he said, using hedges on a country-by-country basis.
These days, he favors Swedish and South Korean investments. But he is negative on the euro, to which Templeton has almost no exposure, and the Japanese yen, which was attractive to him as recently as 2008 but no longer.
How should individual investors operate in the current climate? "It's a good idea to put 15 to 20 percent of total holdings in international stocks or bonds -- or both," advised Mr. Lemco at Vanguard. He said mutual funds were generally agreed to be the most efficient vehicle.
And advisers suggest looking beyond credit ratings when evaluating portfolios. Don't reach for the highest yields, they recommend, but examine trends in national debt management, analyze fund performance in different market cycles and minimize interest rate risk by aligning investments so that long-maturity bonds are limited to the strongest credits. You should also be aware of the difference between global and international bond funds: global ones hold domestic securities as well as foreign.
With all the potential for continued or increased financial turmoil, specialists say, it seems likely that broad diversification in bond markets will gain popularity.
"Everybody's concerned about these rising debt levels," said Brad Durham, managing director of EPFR Global, "but it looks like investors continue to pile in and increase their exposure."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve artfully avoided a second Depression by being open to generating and testing new ideas, the central bank's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Thursday evening.
In an address here at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, Mr. Bernanke drew comparisons between the financial crisis of 2008 and the financial collapse of the 1930s with greater precision than he had in the past.
Mr. Bernanke, who made his name as an academic economist by studying the Depression, has been cautious about being seen as claiming credit for saving the economy from total collapse when the credit markets froze a year and a half ago. In the critical period before he won Senate confirmation in January for a second four-year term, he left it to the Obama administration and others to defend his record.
But on Thursday, Mr. Bernanke expressed confidence that the Fed's measures -- a series of emergency lending programs, as well as huge purchases of mortgage-backed securities and government debt -- helped to avoid a panic, stabilize the economy and restore the flow of credit.
He compared the 2009 "stress tests" that the Fed oversaw to assess the financial health of the nation's largest banks with the national bank holiday that President Roosevelt declared in 1933 to evaluate banks' soundness and restore customer confidence.
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had learned several lessons from the Great Depression.
First, he said that economic prosperity depended on financial stability. That was a connection misunderstood during the Depression, when the central bank stood by as banks failed. In addition, the Treasury secretary at the time, Andrew W. Mellon, urged President Hoover to "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate" as a means to "purge the rottenness out of the system."
Mr. Bernanke said that his own scholarship had demonstrated that countries with severe banking problems, like the United States, did worse than those with more stable systems, like Britain.
Second, Mr. Bernanke said the Depression showed that "policy makers must respond forcefully, creatively and decisively" to financial crises. It was not until the 1933 bank holiday, he said, that officials began to "challenge the orthodoxies of their day," like the post-World War I gold standard.
Mr. Bernanke said the Troubled Asset Relief Program to bail out financial institutions "was far from perfect," but "essential for preventing an imminent financial collapse." He said the Fed had acted "sharply and proactively" by slashing interest rates to near-zero between the fall of 2007 and the end of 2008.
Mr. Bernanke said the Depression also taught the importance of international cooperation. He called the joint decision of six central banks -- the Fed, the European Central Bank, and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland, Canada and Sweden -- to cut short-term interest rates in October 2008 "an unprecedented display of coordination."
Mr. Bernanke did not argue that the Fed's response was ideal. He said that "history is never a perfect guide," and cited a quotation from Mark Twain, "History does not repeat itself, but it can rhyme."
The complex securitization of investment banks and other parts of the "shadow banking system" during the recent crisis could have led to a panic like that of the 1930s, he said.
"When the housing slump shook investors' faith in the values of the loans underlying the securities, short-term funding dried up quickly, threatening the banks and other financial institutions that explicitly or implicitly stood behind the off-balance-sheet vehicles," Mr. Bernanke said. "This was a new type of run, analogous in many ways to the bank runs of the 1930s, but in a form which was not well anticipated by financial institutions or regulators."
The huge outflow from money market funds in September 2008 after the Reserve Primary Fund suffered losses related to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy was "an additional variation on the theme of the bank run," Mr. Bernanke said.
Mr. Bernanke was introduced by Paul A. Volcker, who led the Fed from 1979 to 1987 and is now an influential outside adviser to the Obama administration.
Earlier on Thursday, in a speech in San Francisco, the Fed's vice chairman, Donald L. Kohn, said that he expected unemployment "to come down only slowly from its currently elevated level" and warned that "part of the increase in unemployment over the past two years may be structural, and this part would tend to reverse only slowly."
Mr. Kohn, who has announced that he would retire in June, said the Fed would eventually have to start raising interest rates to stave off inflation.

Abstract: Because of the euro. [...] recently, being a member of the euro zone seemed like a good thing for Greece, bringing with it cheap loans and large inflows of capital.

Full text: The debt crisis in Greece is approaching the point of no return. As prospects for a rescue plan seem to be fading, largely thanks to German obduracy, nervous investors have driven interest rates on Greek government bonds sky-high, sharply raising the country's borrowing costs. This will push Greece even deeper into debt, further undermining confidence. At this point it's hard to see how the nation can escape from this death spiral into default.
It's a terrible story, and clearly an object lesson for the rest of us. But an object lesson in what, exactly?
Yes, Greece is paying the price for past fiscal irresponsibility. Yet that's by no means the whole story. The Greek tragedy also illustrates the extreme danger posed by a deflationary monetary policy. And that's a lesson one hopes American policy makers will take to heart.
The key thing to understand about Greece's predicament is that it's not just a matter of excessive debt. Greece's public debt, at 113 percent of G.D.P., is indeed high, but other countries have dealt with similar levels of debt without crisis. For example, in 1946, the United States, having just emerged from World War II, had federal debt equal to 122 percent of G.D.P. Yet investors were relaxed, and rightly so: Over the next decade the ratio of U.S. debt to G.D.P. was cut nearly in half, easing any concerns people might have had about our ability to pay what we owed. And debt as a percentage of G.D.P. continued to fall in the decades that followed, hitting a low of 33 percent in 1981.
So how did the U.S. government manage to pay off its wartime debt? Actually, it didn't. At the end of 1946, the federal government owed $271 billion; by the end of 1956 that figure had risen slightly, to $274 billion. The ratio of debt to G.D.P. fell not because debt went down, but because G.D.P. went up, roughly doubling in dollar terms over the course of a decade. The rise in G.D.P. in dollar terms was almost equally the result of economic growth and inflation, with both real G.D.P. and the overall level of prices rising about 40 percent from 1946 to 1956.
Unfortunately, Greece can't expect a similar performance. Why? Because of the euro.
Until recently, being a member of the euro zone seemed like a good thing for Greece, bringing with it cheap loans and large inflows of capital. But those capital inflows also led to inflation -- and when the music stopped, Greece found itself with costs and prices way out of line with Europe's big economies. Over time, Greek prices will have to come back down. And that means that unlike postwar America, which inflated away part of its debt, Greece will see its debt burden worsened by deflation.
That's not all. Deflation is a painful process, which invariably takes a toll on growth and employment. So Greece won't grow its way out of debt. On the contrary, it will have to deal with its debt in the face of an economy that's stagnant at best.
So the only way Greece could tame its debt problem would be with savage spending cuts and tax increases, measures that would themselves worsen the unemployment rate. No wonder, then, that bond markets are losing confidence, and pushing the situation to the brink.
What can be done? The hope was that other European countries would strike a deal, guaranteeing Greek debt in return for a commitment to harsh fiscal austerity. That might have worked. But without German support, such a deal won't happen.
Greece could alleviate some of its problems by leaving the euro, and devaluing. But it's hard to see how Greece could do that without triggering a catastrophic run on its banking system. Indeed, worried depositors have already begun pulling cash out of Greek banks. There are no good answers here -- actually, no nonterrible answers.
But what are the lessons for America? Of course, we should be fiscally responsible. What that means, however, is taking on the big long-term issues, above all health costs -- not grandstanding and penny-pinching over short-term spending to help a distressed economy.
Equally important, however, we need to steer clear of deflation, or even excessively low inflation. Unlike Greece, we're not stuck with someone else's currency. But as Japan has demonstrated, even countries with their own currencies can get stuck in a deflationary trap.
What worries me most about the U.S. situation right now is the rising clamor from inflation hawks, who want the Fed to raise rates (and the federal government to pull back from stimulus) even though employment has barely started to recover. If they get their way, they'll perpetuate mass unemployment. But that's not all. America's public debt will be manageable if we eventually return to vigorous growth and moderate inflation. But if the tight-money people prevail, that won't happen -- and all bets will be off.

South Korean Sailors Say Blast That Sank Their Ship Came From Outside the Vessel

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- It could take weeks for engineers to salvage the South Korean warship that sank in waters disputed by North Korea after a mysterious explosion and provide a definitive explanation of what caused the disaster. But some signs are pointing to North Korea, raising uncomfortable questions for the South's government.
On Thursday, surviving crew members went public with their account, saying they were convinced that the explosion came from outside the ship. That follows remarks last week by Defense Minister Kim Tae-young before the National Assembly that the military had not ruled out the possibility that the ship was hit by a mine or torpedo. Mr. Kim added, "A more likely possibility is a torpedo attack."
If North Korea is ultimately found culpable, it will amount to one of the most serious military provocations since the Korean War ended in a truce, leaving the peninsula technically in a state of war. But what options South Korea may have to retaliate is a difficult issue for the South.
The delicacy of the matter was on full display during Mr. Kim's testimony. No sooner had he raised the possibility of a torpedo attack than he was handed a hurriedly dictated note from the office of President Lee Myung-bak. It warned him not to "lean too much toward the torpedo attack" and to stick to the official stance: keeping all possibilities open until the ship was salvaged and examined for the cause of its sinking.
The stakes are obviously enormous, both for Mr. Lee and for the future of six-nation talks the United States hopes to reconvene to discuss eliminating the North's nuclear weapons program.
If the ship, the Cheonan, was sunk by a North Korean attack, then the action almost certainly was approved in advance by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, said Won Se-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, South Korea's top spy agency, in a conversation with lawmakers on Tuesday.
But if that was the case, what was the motivation for the attack? Some experts have speculated that it was a desperate attempt at score-settling by the North Korean military, which was overpowered by its South Korean counterpart during three recent naval skirmishes.
Others have tied it to the fallout from a succession struggle thought to be under way in North Korea, with the military trying to demonstrate its mettle to Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il's youngest son, who is being prepared to take over from his ailing father.
Then again, North Korea has a long history of provoking trouble when the South is preparing for major international events. In 1987, North Korean agents blew up a Korean passenger jet over the sea near Myanmar, killing all 115 on board and shaking South Korea only months before the 1988 Olympic Games. In 2002, North Korea set off a naval clash while South Korea was a co-host of World Cup soccer matches.
In November, South Korea is set to host the Group of 20 summit meeting.
Experts also note the North's traditional tactic of lashing out with unexpected provocations -- like missile and nuclear tests -- when it most needs outside attention and aid. This might be one of those times, analysts say.
Kim Jong-il is believed to have suffered a stroke in 2008. He has vowed to build a "strong and prosperous nation" by 2012, when his son is widely expected to be announced as his political heir. But the country's economic woes and food shortages worsened sharply after its botched attempt to arrest inflation with a disastrous currency revaluation late last year.
Ha Tae-keung, who runs Open Radio for North Korea, a Web site based in Seoul that collects news from informants inside North Korea, said that many North Korean elites believed that their military sank the ship, although they have not produced any proof.
The North Korean military has been increasing its submarine capabilities to compensate for its decrepit naval fleet, especially after its defeat in a brief naval clash last November, Mr. Ha said.
"It must demonstrate that it remains a threat to the South," he said. "It gets aid not by openness but by blackmailing."
Mr. Lee won the presidency in 2008 primarily on a promise to stop coddling the North, reversing the "sunshine policy" of his more liberal predecessors.
He has vowed to make the inquiry as international as possible, inviting American and United Nations investigators.
"We need a thorough and scientific investigation whose outcome the rest of the world can accept," President Lee told his cabinet on Tuesday. "Based on such a conclusion, the government can take a stern position."
Despite all that, there are strong reasons to doubt he will come down hard on the North. South Korea's reactions to past provocations have hardly been ferocious, ranging from plotting revenge attacks (but never carrying them out) to coaxing the North back to the negotiating table with more aid.
Beyond that, experts say, anything it does may only make things worse.
"In the current situation, Seoul has no way to retaliate," said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. "So, it is better to wait until things calm down, so the government will not be under pressure 'to do something' in a situation when all possible actions are counterproductive or dangerous."
Mr. Lee's political opponents are already claiming that he is exaggerating the possibility of North Korean involvement to rally conservative votes ahead of crucial mayoral and gubernatorial elections in June.
It is possible that the mystery of what caused the explosion will remain unsolved, some experts on Korean affairs said. "An underlying problem here is whether clear knowledge of the causes of the Cheonan sinking will be attainable, even after salvaging the ship," said John Delury, a North Korea expert and the associate director of the Asia Society's Center on U.S.-China Relations, in New York.

China Seems Set To Loosen Hold On Its Currency

Abstract: [...] with the Chinese economy booming, a small move in the renminbi may still leave the central bank struggling with trade surpluses and a tide of speculative investment into China.

Full text: HONG KONG -- The Chinese government is preparing to announce in the coming days that it will allow its currency to strengthen slightly and vary more from day to day, people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday. The move would help ease tension with the Obama administration about the United States' huge trade deficit with China.
China's exports have been bolstered by its policy of keeping its currency, known as the renminbi or yuan, pegged at a nearly fixed rate to the dollar. Many members of Congress and economists say that by spending several hundred billion dollars each year to hold down the value of the renminbi, China has made its exports extremely competitive in foreign markets and taken away sales from manufacturers in the United States and other countries.
But if China allows only a small move in the renminbi, the effects on the American trade deficit may also be small. Chinese companies are formidably competitive and, while labor costs are rising in China, transportation and communication costs are plunging because of heavy investment in new expressways and rail lines.
A marginally stronger renminbi would make Chinese goods only marginally more expensive in the United States and make American goods slightly cheaper in China, which is now exporting more than four times as much to the United States as it imports.
The move is being made for domestic policy reasons in China, primarily as an inflation-fighting tool, people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing said on Thursday. While any announcement could still be delayed, China's central bank appears to have prevailed with its arguments within the Chinese leadership for a stronger but more flexible currency, these people said.
Insisting on anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue in Beijing, they predicted that China's policy shift could easily occur before President Hu Jintao arrives in Washington next week for discussions with President Obama and other world leaders on improving nuclear security.
Administration officials, especially Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, have publicly kept quiet to avoid giving the impression that a currency policy shift by China was a result of American pressure, instead of a decision based on what was best for the Chinese economy. Mr. Geithner maintained that silence on Thursday, holding meetings with senior officials in Hong Kong before flying in midafternoon to Beijing for a brief stopover and a meeting with Vice Premier Wang Qishan.
A terse Treasury statement after the meeting with Mr. Wang noted only that the two men "exchanged views on U.S.-China economic relations, the global economic situation and issues relating to the upcoming economic track dialogue of the second U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, to be held in Beijing in late May."
Chinese officials have been publicly wrangling over what to do about the currency for a month. The central bank favors a prompt move, while the Commerce Ministry, aligned with exporters, has opposed currency appreciation. The Obama administration has stayed scrupulously silent, fearing that public comments could backfire by stirring a nationalist reaction in Beijing against international pressure.
Holding down the value of the renminbi through huge currency market intervention has become an enormous expense for China. The central bank spent 9.2 percent of the country's economic output last year on the purchase of foreign reserves, mainly Treasuries that are now paying low interest.
A stronger renminbi could prove to be a mixed blessing for the United States. If China cuts back sharply on purchases of Treasuries, then the Obama administration could find it harder to finance American budget deficits.
But with the Chinese economy booming, a small move in the renminbi may still leave the central bank struggling with trade surpluses and a tide of speculative investment into China. That could force it to continue buying Treasuries with the extra dollars.
Allowing wider variation in the currency would also make it easier for China's central bank to fight inflation, which Wen Jiabao, the premier, identified last month as a top concern for the leadership. Consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher in February than a year earlier, after prices were falling as recently as last October. Inflation is accelerating in China faster than most Western economists expected.
A stronger currency helps hold down prices by making imports cheaper. It also gives China's central bank more room to raise interest rates and brake economic growth while lessening the risk of drawing more speculative investments into the country.
A slightly stronger renminbi that fluctuates each day against the dollar would mainly hurt low-margin, labor-intensive industries in China like shoes and textiles. Many Beijing officials have been worried about job losses in these industries if the currency appreciates.
Much of this production is already starting to move out of China, notably to Vietnam and Bangladesh, where labor costs have stayed low. And Chinese factories producing these goods have been struggling to find enough workers over the last two months as the economy grew powerfully this winter, stimulated by heavy bank lending, strong demand for workers in the retail sector and rising government spending on high-speed rail lines and other infrastructure investments.
In 2005, China allowed the renminbi to jump 2 percent overnight against the dollar and then trade in a wider daily range, with a trend toward further strengthening against the dollar. For its coming policy shift, China may follow a similar pattern, but officials may emphasize much more in public remarks that the value of the renminbi can fall as well as rise on any given day. That would help discourage a flood of speculative money into China from investors betting on rapid further appreciation in the currency, said people with knowledge of the emerging consensus in Beijing.
Xia Bin, a member of the monetary policy committee of the Chinese central bank, hinted at the new policy for the currency while attending a forum in Shanghai on Thursday.
"Whether to let the yuan slowly appreciate or let it rise to a tolerable range after careful calculation, I think it is better to have that quick, prompt appreciation," he said, according to news service reports.
Mr. Xia later added that, "At a certain point, when necessary, it is better to have a quick, prompt appreciation in a bid to fend off speculative capital."
But Mr. Xia, who spoke after others had already described an emerging consensus in Beijing in favor of a small move in the currency, cautioned that no one should expect a "large, one-time" appreciation of the renminbi of the sort that many members of Congress have sought.
The central bank declined to comment on its currency plans.

Full text: Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned Wednesday that an aging American population posed fiscal challenges for the United States.
In a rare foray into the realm of fiscal policy, Mr. Bernanke said the United States "must begin now to prepare for this coming demographic transition."
Mr. Bernanke, speaking before the Dallas Regional Chamber, said that the economy was still fragile, and he made it clear that he did not expect the federal government to raise taxes or cut spending anytime soon. But he spoke about the budget pressures posed by Social Security and Medicare with greater urgency than he has in the past.
"The arithmetic is, unfortunately, quite clear," Mr. Bernanke said. "To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above. These choices are difficult, and it always seems easier to put them off -- until the day they cannot be put off any more."
He said a "sharp near-term reduction in our fiscal deficit is probably neither practical nor advisable," but that a long-term plan for fiscal sustainability could help to lower interest rates and borrowing costs, and even stimulate economic growth.
Mr. Bernanke's comments on the nation's budget problems could lead to political confrontations. Raising taxes is anathema to Republicans while slashing entitlement programs is strongly opposed by Democrats. Still, Mr. Bernanke's comments could add urgency to the work of the bipartisan fiscal commission named by President Obama.
Mr. Bernanke also used his speech to review the Fed's conduct during the economic crisis. He voiced support for regulatory changes being debated in Congress that would seek to prevent any company from being seen as too big to fail.
"To end 'too big to fail,' the new regime should permit regulators to close a failing firm and impose losses on shareholders and creditors," he said.
"Indeed, I would argue that no financial instrument counted as regulatory capital should be allowed to receive any protection from losses."
Mr. Bernanke has hinted that long-term unemployment has become one of his major worries as the economic recovery slowly moves forward.
Noting that more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or longer, nearly double the share of a year ago, he said: "I am particularly concerned about that statistic, because long spells of unemployment erode skills and lower the longer-term income and employment prospects of these workers."
In a separate speech earlier in the day, a member of the Federal Reserve's policy-making board challenged the notion that financial markets were self-correcting, saying that asset bubbles existed and that central banks could do more to prevent them.
William C. Dudley, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called on policy makers to more aggressively speak out against prevailing wisdom when asset prices fluctuated wildly.
"The costs of waiting to respond to an asset bubble until after it has burst can be very high," Mr. Dudley said in prepared remarks to the Economic Club of New York. "A proactive approach is appropriate."
In recent months, the Fed has faced intense criticism for failing to prevent the recent bubble in home prices that brought the economy to its knees.
Though Mr. Dudley acknowledged the difficulty in identifying bubbles, he said "uncertainty is not grounds for inaction." He called for combining the power of the bully pulpit with other tools, like limiting loan-to-value ratios and debt loads.
Mr. Dudley's remarks contrasted sharply with those of Alan Greenspan, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Testifying before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Mr. Greenspan defended the Fed against complaints that it had not done enough to prevent the subprime mortgage crisis.
Mr. Greenspan seemed to reject the idea that central banks could use the power of their words to ward off bubbles. Instead, he said central banks should rely on tools like requiring banks to hold more capital and demanding traders hold more collateral.
A third Fed official, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, raised the specter of higher interest rates on Wednesday. Mr. Hoenig has repeatedly expressed concern that extraordinarily low interest rates may spur inflation.
Mr. Hoenig said in a speech in Santa Fe, N.M., that the Fed should consider lifting the benchmark federal funds rate to 1 percent, from near zero, which he called a "highly accommodative policy."
"I am confident that holding rates down at artificially low levels over extended periods encourages bubbles, because it encourages debt over equity and consumption over savings," Mr. Hoenig said.

Optimism on Low Interest Rates Offsets Worry Over Greece

Full text: Wall Street traders were cautious on Tuesday amid worries that the European Union's plan to help Greece might unwind. But signs that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low helped give stocks some support.
The major indexes ended mixed, hampered by new doubts about Greece's ability to pay its debts. Reports on Tuesday indicated that the financially struggling country was seeking to sidestep aid from the International Monetary Fund because of concerns the fund would impose severe austerity measures.
The yield on 10-year Greek bonds pushed above 7 percent for the first time in more than two months, raising the prospect that Greece could default. The cost of insuring Greek debt rose to the highest level since late February, when talk of a possible default was widespread.
"It's almost cliche to say markets don't like uncertainty, but this is something of a classic case," said Douglas M. Peta, an independent analyst. "Investors would like to get chapter and verse of how an aid package would work. Europe just keeps kicking the can down the road."
Some of that uncertainty was offset by indications that the Fed would keep its benchmark federal funds rate near zero for the near future.
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee released on Tuesday showed that policy makers largely believed that inflation in the United States remained subdued. That buoyed hopes on Wall Street that the Fed might prolong a period of low rates through the end of the year and perhaps beyond.
Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist for Capital Economics in Toronto, wrote in a research note that rates "could be on hold at near zero for a lot longer than the markets are currently expecting." He predicts they will not rise until 2012.
"Fed officials are becoming increasingly worried about falling inflation," Mr. Ashworth wrote.
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.56 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,969.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock average rose 2 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,189.43, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 7.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,436.81.
Financial companies provided a bright spot. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 77 cents, or 2.44 percent, to $32.28, and Bank of America gained 36 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $18.49.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32, to 97 11/32. The yield fell to 3.95 percent from 3.98 percent late Monday.
Oil at one point climbed to an 18-month high, and ended the day with a slight gain at $86.84 a barrel.
The uncertainty about the prospects for a rescue package for Greece helped weaken the euro; its value slipped below $1.34 on Tuesday.
Most European markets closed higher, with the concern about Greece tempered by an upbeat jobs report on Friday from the United States.
The FTSE 100 in London was up 0.62 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris climbed 0.49 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt was 0.27 percent higher. The markets were closed Friday and Monday for Easter.
In Asia, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 0.5 percent. Australia's benchmark exchange rose 0.9 percent after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, to 4.25 percent.
American markets closed at their highest levels in 18 months on Monday. The Dow has been inching closer to the 11,000 mark, a psychologically important level that would bring the market back to its pre-financial crisis levels.

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan's Parliament opened debate on Tuesday on a set of amendments intended to refurbish the Constitution after decades of distortions inflicted by a series of military autocrats.
The changes were widely heralded here as important step toward improving the long-term health of the country's beleaguered democracy. But they also threatened to open a new chapter of instability for the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, as they strip away his powers and leave him more vulnerable to challenges from the opposition.
The changes, which are expected to pass this month, represent a rare moment of consensus in Pakistan's fractious politics. Representatives from 14 political parties, led by a member of Mr. Zardari's party, spent 10 months preparing 102 amendments.
On paper, the changes restore the country's democracy to its original form -- a parliamentary system run by a prime minister -- and undo the accumulated powers that the country's military autocrats had vested in the presidency.
But this is Pakistan -- a chaotic, 62-year-old country, where no elected government has ever lasted a full term and the rule of law is often up for grabs -- and it is far from certain that in practice the new laws will be respected.
For the United States, the changes mean two conflicting things. Over the long run, they could lift Pakistan's prospects to have stronger, more effective civilian governments, something the Obama administration has said it wants.
But short-term security interests have trumped even the best of intentions throughout the history of American-Pakistani relations, and the urge to default to dealing with the military, an effective, if bossy, institution, is likely to remain strong.
Many argue that this is already happening. Military leaders have had their way in defining Pakistan's relationships with the United States and India, and they dismissed Mr. Zardari's attempts to place the powerful military spy agency under civilian control. Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, took center stage in a high-level meeting in Washington last month and led a meeting of federal officials before leaving for the United States, a first in Pakistan's history.
"Power has moved from Islamabad to Rawalpindi," said Farrukh Saleem, a columnist for The News, an English-language daily, referring to the country's capital and the city its army calls home. "The civilians may be in power, but they don't really control much."
In theory, the changes would set into motion a reorganization of power that could start to alter that situation. The president will lose the controversial ability to dissolve Parliament, a 1980s-era weapon that has long been used by warring political parties, egged on by the military, to destroy rival governments. The president would move closer to figurehead status, and the prime minister would get new powers.
While that is healthy over the long run, in the short term it raises questions about the viability of the government under Mr. Zardari, whose party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, or P.P.P., currently has the largest number of seats in Parliament.
The changes could provide an opening to Mr. Zardari's most serious opponent, Nawaz Sharif, a metals industry magnate, by allowing him to become prime minister once again.
"The road is now clear for Nawaz Sharif to generate instability by demanding midterm elections," said Najam Sethi, editor in chief of The Friday Times, a weekly.
A telling sign, he said, was Mr. Sharif's snubbing of a national ceremony held in Parliament for the package of changes on Monday. "This indicates his intention to start picking holes in the amendment and government quickly," Mr. Sethi said.
Mr. Zardari's supporters argue that by divesting his powers, Mr. Zardari is fulfilling a promise he made two years ago when he became president and that the step will deprive his enemies in politics, the military and the media of ammunition against him.
For the time being at least, although many of his powers will be shifted to the prime minister, the man who holds that post, Yousaf Raza Gilani, is part of the political party Mr. Zardari controls and is unlikely to challenge him. In Pakistan, party leaders wield immense power, as they control who gets to run on the party ticket, a huge advantage for provincial politicians.
"He is a very unpopular figure, but he is the source of power in the P.P.P., and institutionally, the prime minister will have to answer to him," said Rasul B. Rais, a professor of political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
One of the most serious long-term implications of the changes, analysts said, would be a shift in power in favor of the provinces. After decades of being run from Islamabad, provinces will eventually have the right to legislate, to control their own education programs and significantly more of their finances, among other things, a difficult retooling that could lead to even more instability if it is not handled delicately.
Still, Hasan-Askari Rizvi, an analyst in Lahore, said he believed that the changes improved the prospects for Pakistan's shaky democracy, if for no other reason than after years of narrow, partisan squabbling, politicians actually came together over something important.
"Pakistani politicians have actually agreed on something," Mr. Rizvi said. "They are not in the habit of agreeing on anything."
But few see the changes as likely to improve Mr. Zardari's unpopular standing among Pakistanis, who are too mired in the economic woes of joblessness and inflation to care much about constitutional tinkering.
"It will have implications within the media and the political class," said Cyril Almeida, a columnist for Dawn, a daily newspaper. "But is it a vote getter? I don't think so."

Throw Out Skybox Tax Subsidies

Full text: UNTIL the 1970s, Major League Baseball was a populist sport. Bleacher seats cost as little as a dollar, meaning middle- or even working-class fans could afford to take their families to a game a few times each season.
But in the years since, tickets to baseball games -- along with other professional sports events -- have skyrocketed in cost. Over the last two decades, the average ticket price for a Chicago Cubs game has increased 265 percent, more than four times the inflation rate. Add in parking, concessions and souvenirs, and a family trip to one of this week's opening day games could easily cost a few hundred dollars.
There are many reasons for the price explosion, but a critical factor has been the ability of businesses to write off tickets as entertainment expenses -- essentially a huge, and wholly unnecessary, government subsidy.
These deductions have led to higher ticket prices in two ways. On the demand side, they have fueled competition for scarce seats, with business taxpayers bidding in part with dollars they save through the deductions.
On the supply side, the large number of businesses bidding for expensive seats has driven the expansion of luxury skyboxes and a reduction in overall seats in new ballparks.
While baseball parks built in the 1960s and before held as many as 56,000 seats, the modern trend is toward smaller-capacity parks, with a higher percentage of total space dedicated to skyboxes. The new Yankee Stadium, the only major-league park built since 2000 with more than 44,000 seats, has 3,000 fewer seats than its 1923 predecessor but almost three times as many skybox suites.
Congress has occasionally expressed concern about deductions for business entertainment, including tickets to sporting events. In 1962, it placed limits on the deductibility of business entertainment generally. In 1986 it restricted the deductibility of luxury skybox tickets to the face value of non-luxury premium tickets, like center-court seats at a basketball game or behind-the-plate seats at a baseball game. For example, if a ticket to a skybox suite cost $500 and a seat behind the plate cost $100, a business could deduct only $100, subject to other limitations on deductibility.
That made sense when there was still a substantial price disparity between skybox seats and tickets for even the choicest non-luxury seats. But the price for non-luxury premium tickets has grown significantly in recent years -- thanks in part to endless demand from businesses and the use of more sophisticated, Web-based pricing tools by the teams -- rendering the skybox rule meaningless.
Ideally, Congress would get rid of business-entertainment deductions altogether -- after all, they are little more than an excuse for corporate executives to consume luxury items at a discount, distorting markets and cheating the public out of substantial tax revenue.
Given corporate America's passionate attachment to sports-related perks, a blanket elimination may be unrealistic, though. A more feasible but still effective approach would be to limit deductions for luxury skybox tickets to a low, fixed amount -- say, $50 per seat, per game.
Such a limit would be fair, unambiguous and easy to enforce. But above all, it would help baseball return to its roots, when average folks -- not corporate entertainers -- were the ones filling the seats.

Full text: LOS TEQUES, Venezuela -- When Judge Maria Lourdes Afiuni issued a ruling in December that irked President Hugo Chavez, he did little to contain his outrage. The president, contending on national television that she would have been put before a firing squad in earlier times, sent his secret intelligence police to arrest her.
Then the agents took her to the overcrowded women's prison in this city of slums near Caracas. They put her in a cell near more than 20 inmates whom Judge Afiuni had sentenced on charges like murder and drug smuggling.
"I've received threats from inmates telling me they will burn me alive because they see me as a symbol of the system that put them in prison," said Judge Afiuni, 46, in her prison cell. "I'm in this hell because I had the temerity to do my job as a judge in a way that didn't please Chavez."
Since Judge Afiuni's imprisonment, a dizzying sequence of other high-profile arrests has taken place, pointing to Mr. Chavez's recent use of his security and intelligence apparatus to quash challenges to his grip on the country's political institutions. The arrests come at a time of spreading public ire over an economy hobbled by electricity shortages and soaring inflation.
Senior officials in Mr. Chavez's government here, including Attorney General Luisa Ortega, say the most recent arrests were necessary to suppress conspiracies or to prosecute people whose comments were deemed offensive to Mr. Chavez. In Judge Afiuni's case, Attorney General Ortega said the judge had illegally freed another high-profile prisoner, the businessman Eligio Cedeno.
In March, intelligence agents arrested Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, a former presidential candidate, charging him with conspiracy after he said in televised remarks that Venezuela had become a haven for drug trafficking; he also supported a Spanish indictment asserting that officials here had helped Basque separatists train on Venezuelan soil.
Only days later, agents arrested Guillermo Zuloaga, the owner of the opposition television network Globovision, after he criticized the government's efforts to shut down media outlets that challenged the president. After an outcry by rights groups, Mr. Zuloaga was released on the condition that he could not travel outside the country.
Next, agents arrested Wilmer Azuaje, an opposition lawmaker, on charges of insulting and striking a police official during a heated discussion. Mr. Azuaje had in the past revealed corruption claims against Mr. Chavez's siblings. Like Mr. Zuloaga, Mr. Azuaje was released, but the Supreme Court forbade him to discuss his arrest with the media.
The arrests have taken aim at some of Mr. Chavez's most prominent critics ahead of legislative elections in September that put control of the National Assembly in play, and they illustrate Mr. Chavez's attempts to tighten control over institutions like the judiciary.
Judge Afiuni, previously an obscure jurist, quickly rose to prominence when she freed Mr. Cedeno, a businessman jailed on charges of circumventing currency controls. The imprisonment of Mr. Cedeno, who had previously financed opposition politicians, was explicitly criticized last year by a panel of United Nations legal experts after his pretrial detention exceeded the limits set by Venezuelan law.
Judge Afiuni contended that she was following United Nations guidance when she released Mr. Cedeno, who subsequently fled to the United States. But Mr. Chavez immediately claimed that she had been bribed to release Mr. Cedeno, demanding that she be jailed for 30 years, even if new laws were needed to keep her in prison that long.
"The corruption charges are false, and prosecutors know that by looking at all of my banking records," Judge Afiuni said. "But the damage to me has been done."
Prosecutors overseeing Judge Afiuni's case did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Criticism of her imprisonment from fellow judges in Venezuela has also been relatively muted, a reaction that is not entirely surprising because Mr. Chavez and his loyalists in the National Assembly stripped the Supreme Court of its autonomy in 2004.
Outside Venezuela, criticism of her arrest has been more vocal. United Nations legal experts called for her immediate release. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights said her arrest came within a political system already under stress because of a lack of judicial independence. Independent human rights group have assailed Mr. Chavez's government over the arrest.
"It is not the sort of thing that happens in a functioning democracy, in which judicial institutions offer safeguards for rule of law," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch.
Still, there appear to be relatively few political prisoners in Venezuelan jails, legal experts here say. Twenty to 30 Venezuelans, including Judge Afiuni, are now imprisoned here because of their political activity or for reasons connected to publicly contradicting Mr. Chavez's wishes, said Rocio San Miguel, a legal scholar here who leads a nongovernmental group that monitors Venezuelan security.
The high-profile prisoners also include Raul Isaias Baduel, a former defense minister, and Franklin Brito, a biologist arrested at around the same time as Judge Afiuni and put under guard in a military hospital after refusing to end a hunger strike over the government's handling of the seizure of his farmland by squatters.
While Judge Afiuni's case has raised concern over the erosion of judicial independence, the most recent arrests are stoking fears about freedom of expression.
"The government is fraudulently inventing conspiracies, assassination plots and national emergencies," said Mr. Alvarez Paz, the former presidential candidate, who was charged with conspiracy after his televised remarks. He is now being detained in a holding cell at the headquarters of the intelligence police. He responded to written questions submitted through his lawyer. "It is doing so out of nervousness over the precarious decline in the president's credibility at home and abroad," he said.
Judge Afiuni said she followed news of the other arrests from a small television in her cell that received a state network signal. She also gets updates from her 17-year-old daughter, who visits twice a week. Otherwise, she remains in her cell and reads, most recently a biography of the Dalai Lama, fearful of venturing into other areas of the prison.
One respite from her life in jail, she said, came when the rehearsal sounds from a prison orchestra of inmates traveled past the bars of her cell. She said its rendition of Vivaldi could move her close to tears. "Just when I cannot stand it any longer here," she said, "the music lets me escape from reality a little and remember that this nightmare will end someday."

Abstract: "Markets will be removed in the future, by reducing their numbers step by step, while continuously expanding the planned supply through state-run commercial networks," Ri Ki-song, a professor at the North's state-run Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, that was broadcast on APTN on Thursday.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- The ailing North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, may soon visit China, the North's last remaining patron, to seek help as his government faces its greatest crisis since the catastrophic famine in the mid-1990s, according to South Korean officials and news reports.
Reports of Mr. Kim's "imminent trip" to China, in what would be his fifth visit to Beijing since he took power in 1994, have been circulating here for months. In an unusual prediction, the office of President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said this week that there was "a high level of possibility" that Mr. Kim would visit China.
The likelihood of Mr. Kim's trip increased after a recent exchange of high-level delegations between the North and China, during which Mr. Kim was formally invited to Beijing. The predictions also stem from the fact that analysts say Mr. Kim is facing both external and internal pressures that are forcing him to reach out to the one remaining, if reluctant, source of aid: China.
"His biggest goal on a trip to China will be securing help to overcome the North's economic crisis," said Choi Myeong-hae, a visiting professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul.
As payback for such aid, North Korea might be expected to return to the six-nation talks, a forum that China presides over and that is aimed at persuading the North to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic and diplomatic rewards.
Experts on North Korea say that Mr. Kim, a reclusive yet shrewd survivalist, might try to obtain Chinese investment or aid, which could weaken the impact of United Nations sanctions, while continuing to hold on to his nuclear program, which is his last bargaining chip and a source of national pride he can hold up before his people, who are said to be facing growing food shortages.
Mr. Kim, 68, is also thought to be in declining health, after a stroke in 2008. He is now undergoing dialysis every two weeks, according to Nam Sung-wook, director of the Institute for National Security and Strategy, a research organization affiliated with South Korea's main spy agency.
Mr. Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, in 1994, is hurrying to groom his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, 27, as his heir, officials in south Korea say. To justify another dynastic succession, he is proposing to build a "strong and prosperous nation" by 2012.
But recent seizures of cargo out of North Korea demonstrate that the United Nations embargo, tightened after the North's nuclear test in May 2009, is squeezing the North's ability to export weapons, a major source of hard currency. Food aid from South Korea has dried up under President Lee, a conservative who wants to see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program.
The government's disastrous currency revaluation in November, meant to fight inflation and curb free markets, has also deepened food shortages.
Mr. Kim, who has kept his people in isolation and fearful of prison gulags, has outlived previous predictions of the collapse of his government, even after an estimated two million North Koreans died of famine in the mid-1990s. But the North Korea of today is not the North Korea of the 1990s. South Korean DVDs and outside news are smuggled in from China. The currency revaluation elicited highly unusual outbursts of public anger.
North Korea "is facing several domestic problems that in isolation would each be manageable but together could threaten regime survival," Daniel Pinkston, an International Crisis Group researcher, said in a recent report.
But he also cautioned that for now, the state security apparatus and the barriers to collective action made a "revolution from below" impossible.
Meanwhile, the government seems to be gambling that it can tighten political control by cracking down on private markets, a conduit of capitalist influence, while trying to improve food supplies and the economy with Chinese help.
"Markets will be removed in the future, by reducing their numbers step by step, while continuously expanding the planned supply through state-run commercial networks," Ri Ki-song, a professor at the North's state-run Academy of Social Sciences, said in an interview in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, that was broadcast on APTN on Thursday.
B. R. Myers, a North Korea expert at Dongseo University in South Korea, said at a forum in Seoul this week that the North's currency reform and crackdown on the markets might not be as unpopular as reported. It is likely that they did not affect most North Koreans, he said, except those relatively few who had amassed a private fortune through black markets.
Mr. Kim's plea for aid will be strengthened by the implicit threat of his country's economic collapse, which would be a nightmare for China's leaders, who can easily envision millions of starving refugees flooding over the border. "Buttressing up the Kim Jong-il regime for stability in the North is as important as denuclearizing it," said Mr. Choi, the analyst.
Chinese state media reported on Thursday that China and North Korea planned to start building two hydroelectric dams this year on the Yalu River, which serves as their border. The dams will cost about $161 million and generate 308 million kilowatt hours of electricity for North Korea and the northeastern Chinese province of Jilin.
China is also considering investments to build bridges and renovate roads and railways in North Korea to tap its rich natural resources and use its ports, according to South Korean news reports and analysts.
For its part, South Korea wants China and the United States to focus more on dismantling the North's nuclear weapons. A nuclear North Korea increases investors' risks in South Korea, leaves the South more dependent on the benevolence of the United States' nuclear umbrella and makes a unified Korea a more distant dream, officials here say.
At the same time, if the North does not get any help from China or South Korea, "it might launch a desperate provocation against the South," Kim Young-soo, a North Korea expert at Sogang University in Seoul, said at a recent seminar.
Fears of such a situation increased last week, when a South Korean Navy ship sank in a mysterious explosion in waters disputed by North Korea, possibly after being hit by a North Korean torpedo or mine, the defense minister, Kim Tae-young, told South Korea's National Assembly on Friday.

Abstract: After winning, creditors can secure a court order to seize part of the debtor's paycheck or the funds in a bank account, a procedure called garnishment. According to a court order secured by Beneficial's lawyers last spring, he still owed the company $3,965, a sum nearly equal to the original loan amount.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article on Friday about the rise in pay garnishments misstated the portion of a person's wages that is exempt from being garnished by court order to repay debts. The maximum that is exempt under federal law is 75 percent of a person's take-home pay or 30 times the minimum wage per week, whichever is more -- not whichever is less. The law thus exempts a minimum of $217.50 per week from seizure, not a maximum of that amount.
PHOENIX -- When the bank sued Leann Weaver for not paying her credit card balance, her reaction was typical for someone in that situation. Personal and financial setbacks weighed her down, and she knew she owed the $2,470. So she never went to court to defend herself.
She was startled by what happened next. When she swiped her debit card at the grocery store, it was declined. It turned out Capital One Bank had taken $224.25 from her paycheck, a quarter of her wages for two weeks of work at a retail chain, and her bank account was overdrawn.
"They're kicking somebody who's already in the dirt," she said.
One of the worst economic downturns of modern history has produced a big increase in the number of delinquent borrowers, and creditors are suing them by the millions. Concern is mounting in government and among consumer advocates that the debtors are not always getting a fair shake in these cases.
Most consumers never offer a defense, and creditors win their lawsuits without having to offer proof of the debts, much less justify to a judge the huge interest charges and penalties they often tack on.
After winning, creditors can secure a court order to seize part of the debtor's paycheck or the funds in a bank account, a procedure called garnishment. No national statistics are kept, but the pay seizures are rising fast in some areas -- up 121 percent in the Phoenix area since 2005, and 55 percent in the Atlanta area since 2004. In Cleveland, garnishments jumped 30 percent between 2008 and 2009 alone.
Debt collectors say they are being forced into the action by combative debtors who dodge attempts to settle. "I think there's a lack of accountability among debtors, and a lack of interest in reaching out to their creditors to resolve things amicably," said Fred N. Blitt, president of the National Association of Retail Collection Attorneys.
Bankruptcy can clear away most debts. Yet sweeping changes to federal law in 2005 -- pushed by the banking lobby -- complicated that process and more than doubled the average cost of filing, to more than $2,000. Many low-income debtors must save for months before they can afford to go broke.
In some states, courts allow creditors to charge high interest rates for years after a lawsuit is decided in their favor. In others, creditors can win lawsuits by default and seize wages and bank accounts without a case ever appearing before a judge.
Lack of participation is the most fundamental problem. Some consumers do not even know they are being sued; the people who are supposed to serve them with formal notice have sometimes been caught skipping that step and doctoring the paperwork.
In far more cases, consumers are served but still do not offer a defense. Few can afford lawyers; others are intimidated or confused. In their absence, judges can offer little relief.
In the rare event that a consumer battles back, creditors frequently lack the documentation to prove their claim, and cases are dropped. That is because many past-due debts are owned not by the banks that issued them, but by debt collectors who bought, for cents on the dollar, a list of names and amounts due.
"If the consumers were armed with more education about how to defend against these debts, they'd be successful," said Jeffrey Lipman, a civil magistrate in Des Moines.
The case of Sidney Jones shows how punishing the system can be. In January 2001, Mr. Jones, 45, a maintenance worker from California Crossroads, Va., took out a $4,097 personal loan from Beneficial Virginia, a subprime lender now owned by HSBC, the big bank.
He fell behind, and Beneficial sued. Mr. Jones did not appear in court. "I just thought they were going to take what I owed," he said.
By default, Beneficial won a judgment of $4,750, plus $900 in lawyers' fees, with the debt accruing interest at 27.55 percent until paid in full. The bank started garnishing his wages in March 2003.
Over the next six years, the bank deducted more than $10,000 from Mr. Jones's paychecks, but he made little headway on his debt. According to a court order secured by Beneficial's lawyers last spring, he still owed the company $3,965, a sum nearly equal to the original loan amount.
Mr. Jones, who did not graduate from high school, was baffled. "Where did all this money go that I paid them?" he said.
Dale Pittman, a consumer law lawyer in Petersburg, Va. , took Mr. Jones's case without charge, and found that all but $134 of his payments had gone toward interest, fees and court costs. "It's a perfectly legal result under Virginia law," Mr. Pittman said.
HSBC said it ceased collection shortly after Mr. Pittman took the case, but declined further comment. "We are confident we are treating our customers fairly and with integrity," Kate Durham, a spokeswoman for HSBC North America, said in an e-mail message.
The rare debtors who press their claims, and catch a sympathetic judge, have a shot at a result more to their liking.
Ruth M. Owens, a disabled Cleveland woman, was sued by Discover Bank in 2004 for an unpaid credit card. Ms. Owens offered a defense, sending a handwritten note to the court.
"After paying my monthly utilities, there is no money left except a little food money and sometimes it isn't enough," she wrote.
Robert Triozzi, a judge at the time, heard the case. He found that over a period of several years, Ms. Owens had paid nearly $3,500 on an original balance of $1,900. But Discover was suing her for $5,564, mostly for late fees, compound interest, penalties and other charges. He called Discover's actions "unconscionable" and threw the case out.
Discover defended its actions. "This account was placed with an attorney only after all other efforts to reach the card member were exhausted," Matthew Towson, a bank spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
Going to court is no guarantee of victory, of course. Consumers who do go are sometimes intercepted by collection lawyers, who press them to sign papers settling without a trial. These settlements may be against the interests of debtors, but they sign anyway.
"We're signing off on a lot of settlement agreements where we shake our heads and ask, 'Why is this person settling to this?' " Judge Lipman said.
For the working poor, losing a lawsuit can mean disaster. A 1968 federal law exempts 75 percent of a worker's wages, or 30 times the minimum wage per week, from being taken in garnishment -- whichever is less. But increases in the minimum wage have failed to keep up with inflation. As federal law stands now, just $217.50 a week is exempt from seizure. (A few states set higher cutoffs.)
The working poor "have difficulties maintaining payments on life's necessities with their full paycheck," said Angela Riccetti, a lawyer with Atlanta Legal Aid who represents indigent clients whose wages are being garnished. "You lose 25 percent of it and everything folds."
For Leann Weaver, the woman at the grocery store, Capital One's lawsuit made a bad situation worse. After being evicted from her apartment, she moved in with her grandparents. Without them, she might have ended up on the street or in a shelter, she said.
Capital One declined to comment on Ms. Weaver's case. "We encourage anyone facing difficulties meeting their financial obligations to contact us right away," Tatiana Stead, a bank spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message.
Ms. Weaver said she repeatedly asked Capital One for more time to pay her $2,470 debt, but last year the bank filed suit. She failed to show up in court, and a judgment was entered against her, swollen by $1,800 in interest and lawyers' fees. Then the garnishment began, almost $500 a month, or a quarter of her pay.
"I can't even look at my paychecks any more," she said.

Visit Seen As Signal From China On Currency

Abstract: Researchers from the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics have created a model based on equilibrium exchange rates. Because China sells so many goods in the United States, it runs a giant current-account surplus.\n

Full text: It is the number that lurks behind much of modern economic life, a figure that helps shape the fortunes of nations and the price of nearly everything.
The number hovers around 6.827. It is the nearly fixed rate of exchange between China's currency, the renminbi, and the United States dollar. And members of Congress say it is proof that Beijing manipulates its currency to keep its exports cheap -- at the expense of American exports and jobs.
They want the government to label China a "currency manipulator," which would allow Washington to retaliate against China economically. But the announcement by Chinese authorities on Thursday that President Hu Jintaowill be visiting Washington in two weeks is being seen as the beginning of a possible easing of the friction over the renminbi.
China experts said it was unlikely that China would have agreed to the visit unless there was at least an informal assurance by the Treasury Department that it would not be named a currency manipulator either on or around April 15 -- the deadline for the Obama administration to submit one of its twice-a-year reports on foreign exchange to Congress.
At the same time, economists say the visit, and other Chinese moves, suggest China is finally willing to let the renminbi increase in value. Analysts at HSBC, the Hong Kong-based global bank, declared that "the latest development should make it more likely for Beijing to start moving away from the renminbi's current de facto peg within the next few months, if not weeks."
Before the disclosure of Mr. Hu's trip, Goldman Sachs said that China seemed increasingly likely to allow the renminbi to begin a modest appreciation in the next three months. Helen Qiao, the China economist for Goldman Sachs, and others who have spoken with officials in Beijing said that the currency issue appeared to be under active discussion there.
But what should be the value of the renminbi? Most Western economists agree that the currency is undervalued, meaning that it would be stronger if it were allowed to float freely in relation to other currencies. But that is about all the economists agree on. Some argue that the currency is undervalued by an astonishing 50 percent or more. Others contend it is about where it should be, economically speaking, saying the currency is undervalued by about 10 percent. Still others say the renminbi may actually be overvalued, because Beijing does not allow its people to trade it freely for other currencies.
If that policy were changed, Chinese savers might move money from low-interest-rate domestic accounts into foreign markets, helping drive down the value of the renminbi.
"Every estimate of the appropriate level of the currency is fraught with uncertainty," said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and the former head of the China desk at the International Monetary Fund. "And it's almost always the case that two methods are going to give you different answers."
Much is at stake, both for China and the United States. If Beijing bowed to American demands and let its currency appreciate by, say, 10 percent, the resulting squeeze on exports would shave about 0.86 percentage point off China's annual growth rate, according to a paper by Dani Rodrik, a professor of international political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. A 25 percent increase in the value of the renminbi would trim Chinese growth by 2.15 percentage points.
Before the onset of the global economic crisis, Beijing had been allowing the renminbi to appreciate. From 2005 to 2008, the government let the currency rise by about a fifth against the dollar.
It is around the dollar-renminbi rate that the economic might of the United States and a rising China converge and, at times, collide. Many economists say it helps explain the gaping trade deficit of the United States with China. The value of the renminbi in relation to the dollar and other currencies influences, to a greater or lesser degree, the price of things as diverse as a pair of Gap jeans and an Apple iPod.
Studies of the renminbi usually reflect one of three schools of economic thought about exchange rates. The first is based on trade and financial transfers, known as current-account deficits, of a country or a group of countries. The second is based on worker productivity. And the third is based on the theory of purchasing power parity, which equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies for a given basket of goods.
Researchers from the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics have created a model based on equilibrium exchange rates.
Because China sells so many goods in the United States, it runs a giant current-account surplus. It buys dollars to hold down the value of its currency, and has amassed $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.
China is running a current-account surplus equal to about 10.5 percent of its annual economic output. But the Peterson Institute scholars estimate that gap should ideally be 4.2 percent. Based on that assumption, they estimate that the renminbi is about 20 percent undervalued against all currencies, and 40 percent against the dollar.
"It's a level of intervention in foreign exchange markets we have never seen from any country in history," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.
Other economists have come to similar conclusions using a different approach -- productivity. From 1998 to 2008, the total cost of labor that goes into producing one unit of output fell 40 percent in China as workers became better at making goods. Had Beijing not intervened in foreign exchange markets, that higher level of output should have led to higher real wages in dollar terms for the Chinese workers as they approached American levels of productivity. But the currency appreciated just 15 percent in those 10 years.
"The Chinese government is taxing their own workers," said Moritz Schularick, a professor at Freie Universitat Berlin. His co-author is Niall Ferguson, a professor of economic history at Harvard.
Another group of scholars believes that the concerns about the renminbi have been overplayed. They cite purchasing power parity, a concept often used to compare prices between developed and developing countries. Such models are often used to adjust for the fact that haircuts, meals at McDonald's and other items cost less in poor countries than in rich nations.
One variation of that model, used by Helmut Reisen, suggested that the renminbi was undervalued by only 12 percent in 2008. He acknowledges that it's probably more undervalued now, but not much more. Mr. Reisen heads research for the development center of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris; his comments do not represent the official view of the O.E.C.D.
While he says he is not convinced that China needs a major currency revaluation, Mr. Reisen agrees with many on the other side of the debate that Beijing needs to overhaul many of its economic policies.
The country, he said, needs to replace its emphasis on exports and investment with a focus on increasing spending by Chinese consumers.
"As long as there is high growth, they can allow the currency to appreciate," he said. "But I would certainly not urge a 20 percent appreciation."
Mr. Prasad of Cornell said that one of the most compelling reasons for China to change its currency policy was that it limited Beijing's ability to manage its economy. To maintain the renminbi rate, for instance, the country keeps interest rates very low, which hampers its ability to fight inflation.
"Whatkind of constraint is the currency policy putting on its ability to balance its growth? That's ultimately what everybody cares about," he said. "That's what the Chinese care about, and that's what the U.S. should care about."

Abstract: In Washington, where Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign continues to point a finger at the school lunch line, a Senate committee on March 24 cut by more than half a proposal by President Obama to spend a record $10 billion more on child nutrition programs over 10 years, including school food. The bill headed to the Senate floor would increase by about 6 cents the $2.68 that schools can get for each lunch -- far less than the $1-a-lunch increase that a coalition of groups seeking to change school food programs have been campaigning for.

Full text: CORRECTION: An article last Wednesday about school nutrition legislation now in the Senate omitted one type of milk the bill would allow in cafeterias. Besides skim, 1 percent milk could be sold.
IT'S been an unusually tough month for the people who make school lunches.
Friday night, more than seven million viewers watched the premiere of "Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution," an ABC reality series in which the British chef storms the kitchens of Huntington, W.Va., to improve the town's collective diet.
That only the N.C.A.A. Division I men's basketball tournament pulled in more viewers signals that the nation has an appetite for the kind of wholesale food reform Mr. Oliver is pushing.
To the chagrin of cafeteria workers everywhere, his star villains are the town's lunch ladies -- or the "lovely girls" as he calls them. They ended up looking so bad that the national School Nutrition Association followed up with a press release in their defense.
That wasn't the only recent public thrashing for the people who make school food. Students in Chicago showed up at a Board of Education meeting to protest the quality of their midday meals. And members of the national news media discovered the "Fed Up with Lunch" blog, written by an anonymous school employee in the Midwest who is spending a year eating and publishing photos of awful-looking food at her school cafeteria.
In Washington, where Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign continues to point a finger at the school lunch line, a Senate committee on March 24 cut by more than half a proposal by President Obama to spend a record $10 billion more on child nutrition programs over 10 years, including school food.
Although school food directors and the growing ranks of those seeking to improve what is served in the lunchroom are disappointed with the numbers coming out of Washington, people who have been working with the Agriculture Department and Congress to improve school food say the bill's $4.5-billion increase is an historic improvement.
"We'd all like to do more and we're going to try, but we've got to get started," said Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, the chairwoman of the Senate committee on agriculture and the architect of the bill. The legislation proposes the first real increase over inflation that the school food program has had in several decades. And, she said, in the current economic climate, any money is a victory.
The Child Nutrition Act comes up for financing every five years. It pays for school food and other nutrition programs for lower-income children. It's also the mechanism legislators can use to change the rules that govern those programs. The bill headed to the Senate floor would increase by about 6 cents the $2.68 that schools can get for each lunch -- far less than the $1-a-lunch increase that a coalition of groups seeking to change school food programs have been campaigning for.
Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, said the bill was still worth supporting.
"This is the strongest child nutrition reauthorization bill I have ever seen," said Ms. Wootan, who has worked to improve school nutrition standards for 17 years. "We can't go from candy bars to apples in one fell swoop."
In addition to the increase in financing, Agriculture Department staff members said a number of less obvious changes in nutritional rules and financing for special programs will improve what is served in schools as soon as next year.
For example, milk is the biggest single source of saturated fat on the lunch line. The bill would allow only skim milk to be offered, banning whole and 2 percent milk. And schools will be required to ensure that children have water with their meals.
At least $40 million would be spent on farm-to-school programs and school gardens. Another $10 million would go toward adding organic food. And millions more have been included to train cafeteria workers.
One of the biggest changes involves food sold in places other than the cafeteria, like vending machines, sporting events and hallway fund-raisers. The law would give the Agriculture Department power to set limits on nutrients like sodium and fat in all food sold on campus, and it would set limits on the number of bake sales and other food-based fund-raisers.
"We want to make sure there's consistency," Senator Lincoln said. "This is not only about providing nutritional food for our children but teaching them good life skills and what the right choices are."
The Agriculture Department is also overhauling all school nutritional guidelines in an effort that is separate from the Child Nutrition Act, but which is intended to work in concert with the changes it will bring about.
The meal standards, which haven't been changed for 15 years, are now being updated by the Agriculture Department. Based on a report from the Institutes of Medicine, the new standards will require more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and, for the first time, limit the amount of calories in each meal.
"Look at the regulations now," said Renee Hanks, food service director for the South Colonie School District in Albany. "The U.S.D.A. requires so many carbohydrates that we're throwing whole-wheat bread at them. We're throwing extra crackers at them. If they aren't out and active, they can't handle all those calories."
But, she warned, adding new requirements for more expensive foods like fresh fruit must come with more money.
Changes to the bureaucratic process might free up some money in school budgets, analysts said. For example, the amount of paperwork needed to assure that some lower-income children qualify for a free lunch will be reduced, and the cost of a meal for children who pay full price will likely increase. Extra training money should also help school kitchens operate more efficiently.
Whether more money will be added before the final bill is approved later this year is in question. Even if more money for the bill does appear, it will likely go toward the parts of the act that pay for hunger programs, not school lunch, Agriculture Department officials and overhaul advocates agree.
That doesn't mean the conversation is necessarily over, said Rochelle Davis, the founding executive director of the Healthy Schools Campaign, a national nonprofit organization. The new nutritional requirements mean nothing if school districts cannot pay for them. Accepting the small increase in school food financing and calling it a victory lets Congress off the hook, she said.
"Look at the agony our country is going through over health care and the struggle to handle a sick nation," she said. "We just have to connect the dots and get people eating right and get people moving. Healthy school food is a logical part of that."

Abstract: When Congress and President George W. Bush enacted a prescription drug plan for seniors in 2003, the legislation encouraged companies to continue providing prescription coverage to retirees, instead of shifting retirees to Medicare Part D, by having the government give those companies large subsidies for each retiree -- and also allowing them to deduct those subsidies from their income taxes.

Full text: An association representing 300 large corporations urged President Obama and Congress on Monday to repeal a provision of the health care overhaul that prompted AT&T, Caterpillar and other companies to announce substantial charges for the current quarter.
The association, the American Benefits Council, said the provision -- which reduces the tax deductions for companies with drug coverage for their retired employees -- would deal a significant blow to corporate profits and would discourage companies from hiring more workers.
AT&T announced last week that it was taking a $1 billion charge because of the provision. Deere & Company announced a $150 million charge, Caterpillar a $100 million charge, and 3M a $90 million charge.
Many companies said they were taking these charges now, before the current quarter ended, to comply with accounting rules. But some corporate critics asserted that the companies' rapid response to the health legislation was aimed at pressing the administration to repeal the provision.
James A. Klein, the president of the American Benefits Council, called the provision "a serious mistake that is having negative and unintended consequences."
White House officials defended the provision, saying it was a deliberate effort to eliminate what they said was an unusually generous tax loophole.
They said the overall health care overhaul would save businesses more than $150 billion over the next decade by reducing health care inflation.
"We're confident that the benefits are going to accrue and strengthen business's bottom line," said Linda Douglass, the communications director for the White House Health Reform Office.
When Congress and President George W. Bush enacted a prescription drug plan for seniors in 2003, the legislation encouraged companies to continue providing prescription coverage to retirees, instead of shifting retirees to Medicare Part D, by having the government give those companies large subsidies for each retiree -- and also allowing them to deduct those subsidies from their income taxes.
Under the health care overhaul, the federal government will continue providing those subsidies -- amounting to 28 percent of a drug plan's costs -- but companies will lose the tax break.
In a telephone news conference on Monday, Mr. Klein cited a study by Towers Watson, a consulting firm, saying the loss of the deduction would cost companies $14 billion in future years.
"Particularly in this economic environment, it makes no sense to impose this type of a hit on companies' financial statements," Mr. Klein said. The provision takes effect in 2013, but accounting rules require companies to take immediate charges equal to the current value of any known hit to future profits.
Defending the provision, White House officials said it was rare for companies to obtain a tax-free federal subsidy and be able to deduct it as well.
These officials added that the health care legislation contained a $5 billion subsidy for companies that maintain health plans to early retirees.
"Let's put these changes into perspective," Ms. Douglass said. "While accounting rules required companies to book this cost upfront, there are a whole set of benefits that will accrue to companies over time that they're not booking upfront."
Federal officials estimate that the provision will raise $4.5 billion to $5 billion in revenue over 10 years, but Mr. Klein maintained that it would cost the government more than it raised.
About 6.3 million retirees -- an estimated two-thirds of them from the private sector -- are covered by employer drug plans. Mr. Klein cited a study by the Moran Company, a health care consulting group, estimating that as a result of the legislation, drug coverage would be altered for 1.5 million to 2 million retirees.
Many companies, he said, will stop providing drug coverage to retirees and will instead push them into Medicare Part D, causing the government to pay for their coverage.
AT&T said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, "As a result of this legislation, including the additional tax burden, AT&T will be evaluating prospective changes to the active and retiree health care benefits offered by the company."
Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized the charges by the companies, asserting that the health reform would save companies more money than it cost them.
Mr. Waxman sent AT&T, Caterpillar and Deere a sharp letter, questioning the charges and saying he wanted top officials from those companies to testify at an April 21 hearing he has scheduled on the issue.
Mr. Waxman and Bart Stupak, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigations, wrote to AT&T's chairman, Randall L. Stephenson, "The new law is designed to expand coverage and bring down costs, so your assertions are a matter of concern."
Their letter said AT&T's moves "appear to conflict with independent analyses," including a finding by the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives, that health care reform would reduce insurance cost trends for businesses by more than $3,000 for each employee over the next 10 years.
Responding to such criticism, Mr. Klein said: "These announcements are required under accounting rules, and we should all expect more of such announcements in coming days and weeks. We're very troubled that these announcements have been challenged by officials in Obama administration and Congress."
Many employer plans for retiree drug coverage are part of union contracts. In December, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s legislative director, Bill Samuel, joined Mr. Klein in writing to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, urging the Senate not to enact this provision.
Gerry Shea, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s chief strategist on health care, stopped short of calling for a repeal of the provision. "We're very concerned about the disruption that could be caused because of this, with people being pushed out of employer plans," he said. "With all the changes we're looking at because of the new health legislation, we feel you don't need this."
Mr. Klein argued that the provision would undercut Mr. Obama's job creation plans. "If companies are going to take a hit like this on their financial statements that will certainly hurt their ability to borrow in the marketplace and make the type of investments that will retain and create jobs," he said.
But White House officials said the provision would not affect job creation because it does not take effect for three years and any charge for a given year would not be large.

Full text: Uncle Sam is ready to get out of Citi. The Treasury is set to sell its 27 percent stake in Citigroup about two years after rescuing it.
The exit should deliver a healthy profit for taxpayers. That's a relief for doubters of the bailout, and represents another financial success story for the authorities managing the crisis. But the banking behemoth has hardly been turned around since the government stepped in.
The sale will happen comparatively quickly considering its size. Treasury has hired Morgan Stanley to trickle its 7.7 billion Citi shares into the market over the next nine months. The outline of the process will be preset to avoid the appearance of any inside knowledge or conflict for the government, the bank's largest shareholder. At Monday's price of about $4.20 a share, the government would reap a profit of about $7 billion on its $25 billion investment. That's a nice paper gain, especially when put against Britain's hefty bank investments which remain in the red.
American taxpayers have already booked some returns on their three-part bailout of Citi, and stand to make even more. The bank has paid about $3 billion in dividends to the government. And it is scheduled to pay an additional $400 million a year in dividends on $5.1 billion of trust preferred shares issued to the government in exchange for insurance on impaired assets -- insurance that has since been canceled. Uncle Sam has warrants over an additional $6.5 billion of Citi stock, too. These are way out of the money now, but would turn a profit if Citi stock hit first $10.61 and then $17.85 within eight years.
The government's rescue of Citi can't, however, be considered anything close to a full success. Its investment will probably turn out profitable. And the intervention forced Citi to make some major changes, including identifying $850 billion of unwanted assets and operations to be unwound or sold. But some of these are proving difficult to unload.
Even though Citi is performing better, the bank remains unwieldy and still looks a long way from earning enough to offset its cost of capital. There's plenty more work needed to make absolutely certain that Uncle Sam does not have to move back in.
Greece Gets to Work
Greece has successfully sold 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) of new debt. That will settle nerves, but it's only the beginning. The political winds may be blowing its way, but the country still needs an economic overhaul.
Greece has political leverage in the European Union. Even Angela Merkel, the German chancellor who has been taking a hard line on helping Athens, does not want a default by a euro zone government. The International Monetary Fund is also ready to assist.
Ultimately, though, Greece still has to make good on its existing 270 billion euros of government debt. The constraints are daunting. On one side is the mountain of debt, set to rise to 125 percent of Greece's gross domestic product this year. On the other is the danger that the economy could shrink -- a probable result of the government's austerity plan. The most direct ways to cut debt relative to G.D.P. -- namely defaulting or encouraging inflation -- are currently closed to Greece. And the easiest way of stoking growth, a currency devaluation, isn't an option either.
For a country to stabilize its debt-to-G.D.P. ratio, broadly speaking two things are needed. First, it has to stop running a so-called primary deficit, or the deficit before interest payments. Second, the average interest rate it pays on debt needs to be less than nominal growth in G.D.P. Both will be a challenge for Greece.
Its primary deficit, which was 7.7 percent of its G.D.P. last year, is forecast to be not much under 5 percent despite the government's belt-tightening. Meanwhile, the average interest rate Greece pays on its debt (currently 4.4 percent) will rise in the immediate future as the country issues more bonds with 6 percent coupons, which was the yield on the latest issue. So the country needs sustained annual economic growth of 5 percent just to keep up.
From 2000 to 2008 Greece managed to do that, with nominal G.D.P. growing at a 7.3 percent compound rate. But the risk premium in Greek yields -- the country's new debt is will cost about 3.5 percentage points more than Germany pays -- reflects justified skepticism over its ability to get back on the growth track.

Full text: A brighter outlook for the American consumer and signs that foreign debt troubles were easing helped propel Wall Street higher on Monday.
Adding to the momentum, shares of energy companies rose after the price of oil surged nearly 3 percent. Two attacks on the subway system in Russia, a major oil producer, raised concerns about supplies.
But much of the focus on Monday was on the health of the economic recovery, as investors recalibrated their portfolios ahead of a data-heavy week. The Commerce Department said that consumer spending rose 0.3 percent in February, even though household income remained flat.
"Spending has been growing even when employment has been weak," said Thomas J. Lee, chief United States equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase. "And it's not like people are borrowing to spend -- they are getting their finances in order and then spending."
Many analysts interpreted the data as further evidence that a rebound was intact, even though unemployment remained high and the housing market was stuck in a rut.
"The consensus is coming around that this is the real deal, that the economic recovery is here," said E. William Stone, chief investment strategist for PNC Wealth Management.
A gauge of inflation in Monday's report remained tame, tempering worries that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates sooner than expected to ward off price increases.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill fell 5/32, to 98 1/32, and the yield rose to 3.86 percent from 3.85 percent late Friday.
Stocks were also helped after Greece, facing imminent deadlines to pay back its debt, successfully sold $6.7 billion in seven-year bonds. It was the country's first offering since the announcement of a rescue plan backed by the European Union.
"It kicks the can down the road for a slight amount of time," Mr. Stone said. "They need to deal with their fiscal house, but time is our friend if we are really in a global recovery."
At the end of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 45.50 points, or 0.42 percent, higher at 10,895.86, still more than 100 points shy of the 11,000 mark. The Dow was helped by gains in Boeing, Caterpillar and Bank of America.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.63 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,173.22, and the Nasdaq was up 9.23 points, or 0.39 percent, at 2,404.36.
Energy stocks drove Monday's rally. Oil rose $2.17 to $82.17 a barrel after suicide bombers set off explosions in two Moscow subway stations, killing more than three dozen people.
In response, shares of Schlumberger, the oil field services company, rose 2.3 percent, to $63.07 a share, Exxon Mobil climbed 1.1 percent, to $67.30, and Chevron gained 1.1 percent, to $75.23.
Citigroup fell more than 3 percent, to $4.18 a share, after the Treasury Department said it planned to sell $7.7 billion in common shares as part of its effort to gradually reduce its 27 percent stake in the bank.
Commodities posted strong gains. The price of gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,109.72 an ounce, and copper was up 3.9 percent. As investors acquired stocks, the dollar weakened 0.3 percent against world currencies, including the euro.
Investors will get several critical snapshots of the strength of the economy this week. On Tuesday, home prices will be released, and analysts are predicting a slight dip. The housing market remains a chief hurdle to a sustained recovery, with foreclosures rising and sales reaching record lows.
But the most significant item on the economic calendar comes on Friday, when the Labor Department releases its monthly barometer of the labor market. Analysts say they believe the economy added 200,000 jobs in March, helped in large part by census hiring, and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 9.7 percent. If the report disappoints, it could raise new questions about the durability of the recovery.

Full text: Household incomes remained flat in February as a weak jobs market crimped paychecks, the Commerce Department indicated on Monday.
But even as wages held steady, consumers were more willing to part with the little cash they had on hand -- a trend economists expect to continue. Spending rose 0.3 percent, or $34.7 billion, compared with January, the fifth month of increases.
Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, called the report an "unambiguous sign that consumers are growing more confident."
"There is an enormous amount of pent-up demand, and now it is being unleashed," Mr. Baumohl said.
As the recovery strengthens, analysts expect spending to rise modestly this year. But it will probably be constrained by weak consumer confidence, which is far below historical averages, and high unemployment, with the jobless rate at 9.7 percent.
In addition, high debt burdens and nervousness about the economy will probably lead Americans to keep a larger-than-usual proportion of their income in savings. The saving rate fell to 3.1 percent last month, its lowest level since October 2008, but it is expected to rise. In early 2008, before the financial crisis sent jitters through the economy, the rate was 1.2 percent.
"Households are gradually altering their behavior in the face of large capital losses in investment and real estate portfolios, a weak labor market, and tight credit," Joshua Shapiro, chief economist for MFR, wrote in a research note.
The labor market continues to shed jobs on a monthly basis, though the pace of losses has decreased and economists believe that the economy might have created jobs in March.
Still, even if jobs start reappearing, paychecks are expected to remain suppressed since many employers do not face pressure to raise wages.
Wages and salaries, which make up more than half of personal income, were largely flat in February, increasing by $2.7 billion or 0.1 percent. Unusually stormy weather in February, which forced many employers along the East Coast to cut hours, may have held back growth.
Spending on durable goods, like cars and air-conditioners, fell 0.4 percent in February, while spending on non-durable goods like food and clothing increased 0.7 percent.
A gauge of prices in the report registered no change, suggesting inflation in the United States was largely tame.
The Commerce Department said spending levels in January were less robust than previously thought, rising 0.4 percent rather than the original forecast of 0.5 percent. Income was higher than originally reported, rising 0.3 percent rather than the original report of 0.1 percent.

Full text: In the scramble to find something, anything, to generate more revenue, states are considering new taxes on virtually everything: garbage pickup, dating services, bowling night, haircuts, even clowns.
"It's hard enough doing what we do," grumbled John Luke, a plumber in the Philadelphia suburbs. His services would, for the first time, come with an added tax if the governor has his way.
Opponents of imposing taxes on services like funerals, legal advice, helicopter rides and dry cleaning argue that this push comes as businesses are barely clinging to life and can ill afford to see customers further put off by new taxes. This is especially true, they say, in states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, where some of the most sweeping proposals are being considered this spring.
But this is also a period of economic gloom for states. Pension funds are in the red, federal stimulus help will soon vanish, and revenues from traditional sources like income and property taxes are slumping ever lower, with few elected officials willing to risk voter wrath by raising them.
"This is born out of necessity," said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat. His proposed budget, being debated in Harrisburg, would tax services including accounting, advertising and data processing.
Mr. Rendell argues that the state's current sales tax system makes no sense. (Why, he asks, is the popcorn in his state's movie theaters taxed, but the candy is not?)
"Look, I'm not a crazy tax guy," Mr. Rendell said, reflecting on recent trims to the budget. "I know what we've cut the last two years, and I know how deep and painful the cuts have been. So I know that in the future there's going to have to be a revenue increase, and this is the best of the alternatives, obviously none of which we're happy about."
Michigan's revenues, adjusted for inflation, have sunk to a level last seen in the 1960s. And that may be exactly what at long last pushes through wide acceptance for taxes on more services, according to supporters of the idea, who say it makes sense in an economy that has long been service-based. In the past, such taxes have never quite been able to survive the political tussle.
A handful of states, including Delaware, Hawaii, New Mexico, South Dakota and Washington, already tax all sorts of services. Most states tax at least some services, particularly items like utilities.
Nevertheless, few states have gone where political leaders in Michigan and Pennsylvania are now suggesting: adding scores of services to their states' sales tax requirement and lowering the tax rate under a widened tax base.
But from coast to coast, desperate governments are looking to tap into new revenue streams.
In Nebraska, a lawmaker has introduced a bill to tax armored car services, farm equipment repairs, shoe shines, taxidermy, reflexology and scooter repairs. In Kentucky, Jim Wayne, a state representative, and some fellow Democrats are proposing taxing high-end services: golf greens fees, limousine and hot-air-balloon rides, and private landscaping.
In June, voters in Maine will decide whether to accept a state overhaul of its tax system that would newly tax services like tailor alterations, blimp rides, and entertainment provided by clowns, comedians and jugglers.
Though some say the proposed service taxes face opposition too fierce to succeed in many places, particularly in an election year, even some of the most ardent opponents predict that some of the taxes will scrape through. The current budget misery will probably "push the idea over the edge" in at least some states, said Robert D. Fowler, president and chief executive of the Small Business Association of Michigan.
"And they won't be any better off for it, either," said Mr. Fowler, who added that his members detested the notion. "It's the wrong time, in the heat of just trying anything to find money, to have this discussion.
"Yes, we need more money, but is this a step toward turning the economy around?" Mr. Fowler asked. "Taking more money out of peoples' pockets? Putting more burdens on small business? It doesn't seem like a recipe for a state turnaround."
In the 1930s, with property tax revenues shrinking because of the Great Depression, states began taxing the sales of items. It was simple, and at the time, the tax matched an economy largely based on goods.
But as the nation's economy shifted to one focused more on services, the tax system mostly did not budge. And so, in 2009, states raised $230 billion in sales taxes; had they taxed all services, too, according to Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan research group, they might have raised twice that.
Advocates say taxing services is simply a matter of fairness and good sense, and of spreading out the tax burden as widely as imaginable. If you pay tax for a ring, why should you be exempt from paying it for a manicure? But even those who agree in principle wrestle with the details. Should a bakery be taxed for the accounting work or lawn care it gets, only to pass along that cost to its customers in the price of cookies? Some in the world of taxes would describe that as pyramiding. And what to do about all the industries that would, naturally, line up for exemptions?
"In truth, a lot of people like this concept of being taxed on what they use," said Bill Farmer, a Republican state representative in Kentucky, who has suggested a tax on services if it was wed to the demise of the state's income tax. "Then they say, 'But please don't tax me because I'm a lawyer.' Or 'But please don't tax me because I'm a grass cutter, an accountant, anything.' " (Mr. Farmer, for the record, is a tax accountant.)
In years past, large plans to tax services have become law, only to face sudden, sometimes embarrassing repeals in places like Florida and Maryland. In Michigan, lawmakers agreed in 2007 to a tax on services (in an episode Mr. Fowler recalls as "a last minute, midnight deal"), only to repeal it amid widespread public opposition the very day it went into effect.
Supporters say the new plan in Michigan, put forth by Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, would solve some of the earlier complaints. In addition to adding more than 100 types of services to the 26 the state already taxes, she says she wants to lower the sales tax rate to 5.5 percent from the current 6 percent, phase out a surcharge on a business tax and direct savings to education.
Ultimately, says Robert J. Kleine, the Michigan treasurer, the tax on services would mean $1.8 billion a year in new revenue.
"The basic thing is that we need to update our tax structure," Mr. Kleine said. "We've got a 20th-century tax structure based on a different sort of economy. The tax base doesn't grow as the economy grows."
Ms. Granholm, like Mr. Rendell, cannot seek re-election this year because of term limits (something opponents of taxing services say provides a hint at how unpopular the whole idea must be with the voting public).
Michael D. Bishop, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, said this was one more case of Michigan's problems being dumped onto consumers who "cannot afford anything else" and businesses who "are being run out on a rail."
People like Pete Tomassoni, whose third-generation bowling alley in Iron Mountain, Mich., has 20 percent less business so far this year than early last year, deemed taxation of his $3 games "a terrible idea."
Still, some believe the notion is certain to grow more palatable as states grasp the depths of their woes. State Senator Cap Dierks of Nebraska, who has pushed for a services tax in part because of his worries about the mounting burdens of property taxes on farmers and ranchers, said he thought such taxes were inevitable.
"I got a lot of negative vibes when I introduced it, but eventually, we'll have to look at it," he said. "What else are you going to do?"

Abstract: According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry-financed research group, 25,428 passenger vehicle occupants were killed in car and light-truck crashes in 2008, a 17 percent reduction from 1975.

Full text: WHEN a straight-A student starts bringing home report cards riddled with Cs, it's cause for concern.
In much the same way, lower grades on the safety report cards of new vehicles -- an expected result of changes in the crash-test regimen used to rate vehicles under the government's New Car Assessment Program -- could incite serious hand-wringing by new-car buyers.
The scoring system, which takes effect with 2011 models, is likely to sow confusion in dealership showrooms, where shoppers have grown accustomed to advertisements trumpeting high marks -- five-star safety rating! -- in the various tests.
Another aspect of the changes promises to confound shoppers: there is a good chance that some 2011 vehicles they are considering will have earned fewer stars -- despite improvements in crash protection -- than similar models from previous years. It's a situation familiar to parents who have wondered why their teenager's A+ in history class last fall became a B- this semester.
In truth, the exams have become much tougher with the addition of a second type of side-impact crash. Also among the changes for 2011 are new test dummies and revised injury criteria for existing front- and side-impact tests, which are otherwise unchanged.
Because it will be years before all vehicles can be evaluated under the new system, consumers can look forward to labored explanations of crash-performance ratings by sales personnel for some time to come. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says it will conduct an extensive public education campaign through its Web site, Safercar.gov, and other outlets, but it is unclear how many consumers that effort will reach.
Regulators are revising the star system partly to deal with a situation that one Transportation Department official called "grade inflation." With so many vehicles receiving five stars, especially in frontal crash testing, the program offers little guidance to help safety-conscious shoppers choose the new vehicle that will make them feel best protected. It is as if the cars are all from Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor's made-up community where "all the children are above average."
In at least one way, the government is trying to make the test results easier to grasp. Vehicles will now receive a single overall star rating that summarizes the different grades for front, side and rollover crashes.
At the same time, earning a five-star rating will get tougher. In the new side-impact test, the vehicle collides with a 10-inch-diameter vertical pole at 20 miles per hour. The impact is at a 75-degree angle, with the contact point on the driver's door behind the front windshield pillar. Crashes of this type -- typically into a tree -- are not the most common in the real world, but they are the most dangerous single-vehicle accident, said Stephen T. Kozak, global safety chief engineer at Ford.
In addition to conducting this test with a dummy of 50th percentile male size, the crashes will also be done with a 5th percentile dummy, representing a 97-pound female driver who would be more susceptible to injury.
Today's side-impact test is conducted by running a 3,015-pound trolley with a wide, deformable surface into the driver's side of the tested vehicle at 38 m.p.h. The pole test is far more demanding because the contact area is so much smaller; the new test is expected to result in side-curtain air bags being installed in virtually all vehicles.
"The newly overhauled five-star rating system significantly raises the bar on safety," Ron Medford, acting deputy director of N.H.T.S.A., said.
In the first year under the new system, only 20 percent of a manufacturer's vehicles will need to comply with the stricter rules, but the requirement ramps up to 100 percent compliance in 2014.
Cars are already much safer than they once were. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an industry-financed research group, 25,428 passenger vehicle occupants were killed in car and light-truck crashes in 2008, a 17 percent reduction from 1975. A majority of those fatal accidents, 52 percent, resulted from front crashes, but 28 percent -- about 7,000 deaths -- were from side impacts.
More rigorous testing standards could further reduce fatalities -- and help consumers sort out which cars are the safest.
"N.H.T.S.A.'s current crash test is fairly meaningless," said David Champion, senior director of Consumer Reports' auto test division. "Every car gets a four- or five-star rating in frontal crashes, so there isn't much differentiation. To the consumer, every car looks pretty safe."
Mr. Champion said a more stringent rating system would result in very few vehicles getting five stars and would also spur development of new safety technology.
David Zuby, senior vice president for vehicle research at the insurance institute, agrees that there is some potential for confusion with the new rules. "But you have to balance that against the potential to provide safer cars to the public," he said.
The pole-impact test will result in increased head protection in collisions, Mr. Zuby said. "Right now, there's no requirement for air bags that protect the head, and the pole test is basically a way to require that cars provide that level of protection."
For the 2009 model year, Mr. Zuby said, 64.5 percent of vehicles had side-curtain air bags with head and torso protection as standard equipment, with another 5.3 percent of new vehicles offering them as an option.
For automakers, the new grading system increases the pressure. Mr. Kozak, the Ford safety engineer, said he saw the new tests as a major change from previous standards and a useful incentive for Ford, which has more five-star ratings than any other carmaker, to increase marketing efforts aimed at distinguishing its products from those of other carmakers.
"They've added some severe new modes and new test dummies," Mr. Kozak said. Explaining it all to the public, he said, will be a further challenge for regulators and automakers.
Ford has already moved to comply with the 2011 standards. The 2010 Taurus has a roof-pillar made of ultra-high-strength boron steel, and the 2011 Fiesta and 2012 Focus small cars will as well. Mr. Kozak said the F-150 pickup had a new side air bag that helps the truck comply with the pole test by better distributing impact loads between the pelvis and thorax.
"The critical question on the table is whether the new tests will mimic what happens in real-world crashes and whether N.H.T.S.A.'s stars-for-cars ratings will reflect improvements made for real-world situations," said Thomas C. Baloga, an engineering vice president at BMW.
Mr. Baloga said BMW was among the carmakers concerned that consumers would not understand the new system.
"That's why we're taking part in a big educational push," he said. BMW is working with N.H.T.S.A., dealers and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents 11 carmakers. While the auto industry is concerned about the potential for buyer bewilderment as the new system is phased in, there is cautious optimism and a commitment to dispelling the confusion.
Wade Newton, a spokesman for the Alliance, said the current system could be compared with "easy grading in high school, where everyone gets an A."
Because the government can test only 30 to 40 new cars a year, Mr. Newton said, many 2011 models will say "not tested" in the safety corner of the window sticker. "It's a concern," he said.
N.H.T.S.A. says it tries to minimize this problem by crashing the high-volume cars and trucks first. "The agency puts a priority on testing the most popular models," Mr. Medford said.

Full text: Economic growth in the last quarter of 2009 was slightly less robust than previously thought, the government said on Friday. But corporate profit in the quarter rose significantly, providing hope that businesses might begin hiring again.
Gross domestic product, the total value of goods and services in the economy, expanded at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. Growth was previously forecast at 5.9 percent from October through December.
Even with the revision, it was the fastest quarterly growth rate in more than six years. But economists expect the pace will slow again, given chronic unemployment and struggling real estate markets.
"This doesn't take much away from the strong pace in the fourth quarter," said Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas.
"Looking at the underlying numbers, it tells us the recovery is on track, but it's going to be slow."
After-tax corporate profit, considered a harbinger of business spending, rose 6.5 percent in the quarter, according to the government report, signaling that businesses might soon begin hiring in greater numbers.
Spending by businesses in the quarter was lower than expected, rising 5.3 percent rather than the 6.5 percent originally forecast. Much of the difference was attributed to the worsening commercial real estate sector, with spending falling 18 percent rather than the original 13.9 percent estimate. The sector is grappling with high vacancy rates, excess supply and little interest by investors in financing large projects.
After cutting costs significantly in the last year, businesses have begun to tentatively expand. The report issued Friday recorded higher-than-expected spending on equipment and software, which rose 19 percent in the quarter.
Consumer spending was weaker than originally estimated. Americans, facing mounds of debt and dreary job prospects, have been reluctant to spend freely. Spending rose 1.6 percent in the quarter, compared with the 1.7 percent originally forecast.
A barometer of consumer sentiment released Friday by the University of Michigan held steady in March; analysts had expected it to decline. Views on the current health of the economy brightened, but consumers were slightly more pessimistic about the outlook.
The roaring growth rate in the fourth quarter was largely the result of a slowdown in how quickly businesses slashed stockpiles. Inventories remained well stocked in the fourth quarter, contributing more than 3 percent to gross domestic product.
Economists do not expect the restocking of inventories to contribute as much to future growth. Forecasts call for the economy to grow at an annual rate of 2 to 3 percent in the first quarter of 2010 -- far short of the levels needed to significantly reduce the jobless rate, which stands at 9.7 percent.
The government's first estimate of first-quarter growth will be released at the end of April.

Full text: ON Thursday night, Congress sent to President Obama the reconciliation package to remove some of the embarrassing provisions in his signature legislative achievement, health care reform. But a serious fix for what ails health care in America will entail far more than merely tweaking the new law of the land; we will need to repeal the entire faulty architecture of the government behemoth and replace it with real reform.
To be clear: it is not sufficient for those of us in the opposition to await a reversal of political fortune months or years from now before we advance action on health care reform. Costs will continue their ascent as the debt burden squeezes life out of our economy. We are unapologetic advocates for the repeal of this costly misstep. But Republicans must also make the case for a reform agenda to take its place, and get to work on that effort now.
So what can we do?
Health care experts across the political spectrum acknowledge that a fundamental driver of health inflation is the regressive tax preference for employer-based health insurance. This discriminatory tax treatment lavishes the greatest benefit on the most expensive plans while providing no support for the unemployed, the self-employed or those who don't get coverage from their employer.
Reform-minded leaders like Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, pushed legislative proposals that would directly address this issue. I helped write a plan that would replace the bias in the tax code with universal tax credits so that all Americans have the resources to purchase portable, affordable coverage that best suits their needs, with additional support provided for those with lower incomes. All these ideas, though, were dismissed early on, as they didn't fit with the government-driven plan favored by the majority. But going forward it's important that we reconsider this regressive tax issue.
Then, when helping Americans with pre-existing conditions obtain coverage, we should focus on innovative state-based solutions, including robust high-risk pools, reinsurance markets and risk-adjustment mechanisms. I intend to continue advancing true patient-centered reforms like attaching tax benefits to the individual rather than the job, breaking down barriers to interstate competition, and promoting transparency and consumer-friendly coverage options.
We should ensure that health care decisions are made by patients and their doctors, not by bureaucrats, whether at an insurance company or a government agency. By inviting market forces into health care, we can encourage a system where doctors, insurers and hospitals compete against one another for the business of informed consumers.
We must also immediately begin dealing with our crushing debt burdens, which this legislation will worsen. The Democrats' fiscal arguments never did add up: they claim that their program will reduce the deficit even though the federal government will pick up the tab for more than 30 million uninsured Americans and subsidize millions more. Even after accounting for the $569 billion in tax increases and $523 billion in Medicare cuts, the true costs of this legislation -- concealed by timing gimmicks, hidden spending and double-counting -- will make the deficit explode, plunging us deeper into debt.
Washington already has no idea on how to pay for its current entitlement programs, as we find ourselves $76 trillion in the hole. Our country cannot afford to avoid a serious conversation on entitlement reform. By taking action now, we can make certain that our entitlement programs are kept whole for those in and near retirement, while devising sustainable health and retirement security for future generations.
The case for attempting health care reform was not difficult to make. Skyrocketing health care costs are driving more and more families and businesses to the brink of bankruptcy, leaving affordable coverage out of reach for millions of Americans and accelerating our path to fiscal ruin. The challenge was how to deal with the seemingly inexorable increase in health care costs.
Yet the Congressional majority went at this goal backward: with the force of the federal government, cover all Americans -- then figure out which screws to twist to contain costs. Democrats opted for this approach because their concern was never about costs. It was about expanding coverage through an expansion of government.
As the dust settles from this historic and fiscally calamitous week, we have to try to steer this country back in the right direction. The opposition must always speak with vigor and candor on the need for wholesale repeal and for real reform to fix what's broken in health care.

Chinese Leaders Divided on Whether to Let Currency Rise

Full text: BEIJING -- Signs are emerging of conflicting views among China's leaders over whether to allow the country's currency to rise against the dollar.
The conflict, which has broken into rare public view, seems to be mainly between China's central bank and its Commerce Ministry. But how it is eventually resolved could decide the course of trade tensions between China and the United States.
Many experts contend China deliberately undervalues its currency, the renminbi, making Chinese exports more competitive on global markets and creating jobs in China at the expense of employment elsewhere.
The current drama began on March 6 when the governor of China's central bank stunned analysts by saying that the bank's policy of keeping the renminbi at a constant exchange rate against the dollar was a "special" response to the global financial crisis.
The new description suggested to many economists that the current value of the renminbi was temporary and that the central banker, Zhou Xiaochuan, was preparing the Chinese public for a stronger renminbi.
But other Chinese officials, particularly at the Commerce Ministry, have fought back in the last two weeks, stoking nationalism and anti-American sentiment by loudly declaring that China would not be told what to do by the United States.
"It seems like they are talking from different perspectives," said Li Wei, the director of the American studies department at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, speaking of the Chinese officials. He added that he supported the Chinese government's overall stance of resisting American pressure.
The debate is far from academic. In the coming weeks, the Obama administration faces a series of politically charged deadlines set by Congress to decide whether to continue negotiating with China over currency and trade issues or to take a more confrontational stance and name China a currency manipulator.
If the administration labels China a currency manipulator, it would face further Congressional pressure to impose punitive tariffs on many Chinese goods.
So far, the media-wise Commerce Ministry is trouncing the normally secretive central bank.
Every few days, senior Commerce Ministry officials have spoken out, warning that pressure to let the renminbi rise is "irrational." The ministry is close to exporters, who are still upset that shipments fell early last year for the first time since China began opening trade in the late 1970s. China's overall trade surplus was $198.1 billion last year, down from $297.4 billion the year before as global trade shrank during the financial crisis.
The ministry has even taken its campaign to Washington, with Zhong Shan, the deputy minister, giving a speech at the United States Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday morning and telling reporters at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday afternoon that American pressure for a stronger renminbi "is unacceptable to China."
These comments have raised a surge of anti-American sentiment in Internet chat rooms and prompted daily headlines on the front pages of Chinese newspapers that China must not "back down."
Borrowing a page from the playbook of some of the most sophisticated Western crisis management consultants, the ministry even sent to reporters last week the private cellphone numbers of eight Chinese academic experts on Sino-American trade relations. But unlike the Western consultants, the ministry did not ask or warn the academics before giving out their phone numbers.
Some Chinese economists gingerly suggested in the past year that China could find better uses for the hundreds of billions of dollars it spends buying United States Treasuries and other foreign securities to keep the renminbi from rising against the dollar.
That investment in overseas bonds was equal to nearly a tenth of China's entire economic output last year, even though Treasuries have a return of only 0.13 to 4.76 percent currently. If the renminbi does appreciate eventually, the value of China's vast foreign reserves will plunge in renminbi terms -- a loss for which the central bank would likely be blamed.
Maintaining the current level of the renminbi also means the central bank cannot easily push up interest rates -- a move countries normally use to battle inflation.
That may be necessary in China. The economy here is doing so well and China international competitiveness is so strong that inflation is starting to appear. Exporters have more orders than they can fill -- although imports have been rising even faster as Chinese companies have stockpiled commodities as a hedge against inflation.
Export-oriented provinces in coastal China raised their minimum wages by 20 percent last week in a desperate bid to attract more workers from China's increasingly prosperous interior to run factory assembly lines.
These problems have made the central bank unenthusiastic about selling renminbi and buying foreign bonds so as to hold down the value of the currency, people close to the central bank said. But the bank has been reluctant to make its case in public, consistently rebuffing requests for interviews, and now may have missed its chance as the increasingly free Chinese business press has embraced the weak renminbi as a nationalistic symbol of Chinese sovereignty.
In many policy discussions between the United States and China over the past two decades, the Chinese government has seemed to maintain a laserlike focus. American officials in a succession of administrations and Congresses have been more like flashlights pointing in different directions at night.
But in the current debate, American officials have been tightly disciplined -- the Treasury, Commerce Department and Office of the United States Trade Representative have said little. Chinese officials, on the other hand, have been vocal and less consistent.
In the United States, the Treasury -- and often only the Treasury secretary himself -- comments on the dollar. That has helped limit sudden fluctuations in the dollar's value in currency markets.
But China has no such policy limiting which agencies or individuals can publicly address currency issues. For decades, currency policy has been the purview of the central bank, but the central bank is a politically weak institution. The People's Bank of China is simply one of many economic policy ministries and even lacks independent authority over monetary policy, unlike the Federal Reserve.
Commerce Ministry officials say that they are following a broader trend in the Chinese government of greater responsiveness to the public. "Our ministry is doing a good job to be more open and more transparent -- there is even an office in our ministry responsible for publicizing our policies," said Chen Rongkai, the ministry's division director for press.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted on Thursday that the central bank might be open to selling part of its huge portfolio of mortgage-backed securities when the time came to start tightening credit.
In testimony Thursday before the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Bernanke did not depart from the Fed's stance that it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero for "an extended period," given that unemployment remained high and inflation was expected to remain low.
But he offered a glimpse into his thinking about the timing and pace of the Fed's eventual withdrawal from its monetary policies of the last two years.
The Fed's balance sheet has grown to about $2.3 trillion, about 2.5 times its size before the crisis. The central bank bought up mortgage-backed securities, Treasury securities and debts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates as the economy went into a tailspin in 2008.
In addition, the Fed created several emergency lending programs to pump credit into the economy.
While the lending programs have mostly ended, the giant balance sheet, which includes a large volume of bank reserves that the Fed created as it bought the assets, poses a difficult challenge for Mr. Bernanke.
Mr. Bernanke was originally to testify before the Financial Services Committee about the Fed's exit strategy on Feb. 10, but the hearing was postponed because of a snowstorm.
"I currently do not anticipate that the Federal Reserve will sell any of its security holdings in the near term, at least until after policy tightening has gotten under way and the economy is clearly in a sustainable recovery," Mr. Bernanke wrote in that testimony, which was released after the hearing was postponed.
On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke omitted reference to "the near term." He said, "Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies."
The Fed plans to experiment with two tools, reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits, to drain the large store of bank reserves and replace them with other liabilities. Those tools would not change the overall size of the balance sheet.
"If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities," Mr. Bernanke said.
He was careful to avoid specifying a time frame, but he told Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, "We would like to get back to an all-Treasury portfolio within a reasonable amount of time." Traditionally, the Fed bought and sold Treasury securities to lower and raise the key interest rate it controls, the federal funds rate.
Later, in response to a question from Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Bernanke said, "My expectation is that sales would be slow, gradual, announced in advance and would not create undue market impacts."
Even if the Fed were to do nothing, the balance sheet would slowly shrink as the securities mature or as Fannie or Freddie redeem their debts. But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had no intention of holding onto the securities -- some of them backed by 30-year fixed-rate mortgages -- indefinitely. "We certainly don't want to hold this stuff for 30 years," he told Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey.
The Fed's exit strategy is untested, and several economists who testified after Mr. Bernanke warned of potential risks.
Marvin Goodfriend, of the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, warned that reverse repurchase agreements, in which the Fed would sell securities with an agreement to buy them back later a slightly higher price, could expose the Fed to private sector risks. He said that term deposits, analogous to certificates of deposit, would also compete with Treasury bills and "potentially cause friction with the Treasury."
John B. Taylor, an influential Stanford economist, said the Fed might want to follow an "exit rule," reducing reserve balances by $100 billion for each 0.25 percent increase in the federal funds rate.
Other economists were more optimistic about the choices the Fed faced. Laurence M. Ball, of Johns Hopkins University, said the Fed should not raise rates "until we see major progress in reducing unemployment," even if inflation starts to rise. A moderate rise in inflation, he said, could even be good for the economy.
Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster and former Fed governor, testified that the risk of high inflation was remote unless the central bank came under political pressure.
"The Fed is operating in uncharted waters," he warned. "It has never had such a challenging exit. Don't expect the Fed to be perfect. Nobody is perfect."

Abstract: The vote was 56 to 43 in the Senate and 220 to 207 in the House, with Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers. Since the bank-based loan program began in 1965, commercial banks like Sallie Mae and Nelnet have received guaranteed federal subsidies to lend money to students, with the government assuming nearly all the risk.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Ending one of the fiercest lobbying fights in Washington, Congress voted Thursday to force commercial banks out of the federal student loan market, cutting off billions of dollars in profits in a sweeping restructuring of financial-aid programs and redirecting most of the money to new education initiatives.
The revamping of student-loan programs was included in -- if overshadowed by -- the final health care package. The vote was 56 to 43 in the Senate and 220 to 207 in the House, with Republicans unanimously opposed in both chambers.
Since the bank-based loan program began in 1965, commercial banks like Sallie Mae and Nelnet have received guaranteed federal subsidies to lend money to students, with the government assuming nearly all the risk. Democrats have long denounced the program, saying it fattened the bottom line for banks at the expense of students and taxpayers.
"Why are we paying people to lend the government's money and then the government guarantees the loan and the government takes back the loan?" said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee.
Democrats celebrated the legislation, a centerpiece of President Obama's education agenda, as a far-reaching overhaul of federal financial aid, providing a huge infusion of money to the Pell grant program and offering new help to lower-income graduates in getting out from under crushing student debt. Still, the final bill is less ambitious than the original proposal.
Congressional allies of the student-loan industry attacked the overhaul as an overreaching government takeover. The legislation substitutes an expanded direct-lending program by the government for the bank-based program, directing $36 billion over 10 years to Pell grants, for students from low-income families.
"The Democratic majority decided, well look, while we're at it, let's have another Washington takeover," said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former federal education secretary. "Let's take over the federal student loan program."
Even as the Democrats' decision to attach the student-loan overhaul to the health care package virtually ensured its passage, banks fought fiercely up to the last minute, prompting some lawmakers, like Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, where Nelnet has its headquarters, to cast their vote against the overall bill.
Although private banks will no longer be allowed to make student loans with federal money, many will continue to earn income by servicing those loans.
The Congressional Budget Office said the direct-lending approach would save taxpayers about $61 billion over 10 years. Roughly $40 billion of the savings will be redirected to higher education. Education programs will get an additional $10 billion from the health care package.
The bill includes some landmark changes, like automatic increases, tied to inflation, in the maximum Pell grant award. But for individual students, the increase in the maximum Pell grant -- to $5,900 in 2019-20 from $5,550 for the 2010-11 school year -- is minuscule, compared with the steep, inexorable rise in tuition for public and private colleges alike.
And because college costs are rising so quickly, the maximum Pell grant now covers only about a third of the average cost of attending a public university, compared with three-quarters in the 1970s, when the program began. So each year, more students graduate with debt of more than $20,000.
The legislation will make it easier to pay back student loans, by reducing the share of income that a graduate must devote to loan payments and by accelerating loan forgiveness -- but not right away. Those who take out new loans after July 1, 2014, will have to devote 10 percent of their income to payments, down from the current 15 percent, and those who keep up their payments will have their loans forgiven after 20 years, reduced from the current 25.
"Income-based repayment is a fantastic addition to the Senate bill that will allow over a million students to avoid being crushed by unmanageable levels of debt," said Rich Williams, a higher-education advocate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
With the new legislation, students will have to take out their loans through their college's financial aid office, instead of using a private bank.
The original proposal stood to save $87 billion over 10 years by ending the bank-based program, known formally as the Federal Family Education Loan program. But as the Senate delayed in taking up the legislation, colleges and universities began shifting to the direct-lending program, realizing the savings to the Treasury up front and cutting the amount of money available for future spending.
At the same time, an increase in the number of Americans enrolling in college and seeking financial aid, as a result of the recession, raised the projected costs of the enhanced Pell grant program.
In addition, to comply with the complex budget reconciliation rules, some of the savings from the education changes had to be redirected to pay for parts of the health care legislation.
In the scaled-back, final version, the administration scrapped $8 billion in proposed spending on early-childhood education. It also mostly erased a $12 billion "American Graduation Initiative," which was announced with fanfare in the fall as an effort to bolster the work force by producing millions more community college graduates over the next decade, and building up high-quality free online courses.
Community colleges, the main provider of higher education for most low-income Americans, were slated to receive $10 billion under the administration's original plan, but will instead get just $2 billion for job training.
"I'm disappointed," said Eduardo J. Padron, the president of Miami Dade College, one of the nation's largest community colleges. "For the first time, we had a president who understood the importance of community colleges, and we were validated and recognized for our role in opening the doors of higher education."
Untouched was the $2.55 billion to historically black and minority-serving colleges, a priority of the Congressional Black Caucus. If the new legislation had not passed, Obama administration officials say, Pell grants would have had to be cut to about $2,150, and some 500,000 students dropped from the program.
In lobbying fiercely against the overhaul, the private banks argued that it would eliminate jobs, even though the government will hire many of the same banks on a contract basis to service the loans and perform other back-office administration. Furthermore, the banks said that with the government as the only lender, students would not get the same level of service.

Full text: Before I ask for a drumroll and reveal "the secrets" of fighting poverty, a bit of background:
For a quarter-century after World War II, the United States made great progress against poverty. Then in the 1970s, we fumbled. Over the last 35 years, our economy has almost tripled in size, but, according to the United States Census Bureau, the number of Americans living below the poverty line has been stuck at roughly 1 in 8.
One reason is that wages for blue-collar and other ordinary workers peaked in the early 1970s, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A second is the breakdown in the family and the explosion in single-parent households. A third is the quintupling of incarceration rates beginning in 1970, making it harder for impoverished young men to play a role in families or get decent jobs.
When those factors converge -- a young woman with a 10th-grade education trying to raise a couple of kids as a single parent -- poverty proves almost inescapable. Often the cycle is transmitted from generation to generation.
Still, there's a reason for hope: We're getting a much better handle on what policies can overcome poverty. We're now seeing more experiments, modeled after randomized drug trials, that measure carefully whether an approach works and how cost-effective it is. Partly this reflects the rise of economists (at the expense of political scientists and do-gooders) and the rigor they pack in their briefcases.
"To make a difference, we have to do things that actually work," said Gordon Berlin, the president of MDRC, a research organization that pioneered the use of randomized trials to evaluate poverty-fighting strategies. "In the last 15 to 20 years, we've begun to build a compelling body of evidence that policy makers and program operators can act on."
Here's a peek at some of the interventions that seem to make a difference (and there are many more):
High-quality early childhood programs, before kids get behind. Much-studied examples include the Perry Preschool program in Michigan in the 1960s and the Abecedarian Project in North Carolina in the 1970s. Both worked with impoverished children who had much better outcomes than control groups. For example, those who had been through the Perry program were -- as adults, decades later -- only half as likely to go on welfare and much less likely to be arrested.
Intensive efforts in the ninth grade (which is well known as education's Bermuda triangle, swallowing up poor students). A program called Talent Development in Philadelphia gave ninth graders a double dose of math and English and reduced absenteeism and significantly improved performance for at least the next couple of years. Tentative results suggest it is also improving high school graduation rates.
Career academies. These keep students engaged in high school by teaching around career themes and partnering with local employers to give kids work experience. Eight years of follow-up research suggests that graduates are more likely to hold jobs and earn more money.
Jobs programs. One of the most successful is the "jobs-plus" demonstration, which trains people living in public housing to get jobs and gives them extra incentives to keep them. Participants thrive -- and the gains continue even years later, after the program ends.
The two most important interventions seem to be education and jobs. Schooling programs pay off from early childhood all the way through community college. And jobs programs lift entire families: even though one might worry about children getting less supervision with parents working, studies suggest that children then do better at school.
All this underscores a long-term cost of this recession: there are cuts in both education and schooling, harming the two most effective stairways out of poverty. That's tragic, and I hope we consider schooling and jobs every bit as important as our multibillion-dollar surge in Afghanistan.
In effect, what's needed to overcome poverty in part seems to be a change of culture, to break self-destructive behaviors -- resignation to unemployment, self-doubt, alcohol and drug abuse, disintegrating families, lack of engagement in children's education -- that create self-replicating cycles of poverty. The Harlem Children's Zone Promise Academy, a charter school where third graders from a disadvantaged neighborhood outperform their peers around New York City and New York State, offers a shining example of what is possible.
This wave of research suggests that there's no magic bullet, that helping people is hard, and that even when pilot programs succeed they can be difficult to scale up. But evidence also suggests that we increasingly have the tools to chip away at poverty. We know what to do if we just can summon the political will.

Abstract: The bill achieves that by requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, providing subsidies to help the middle classes buy policies on new competitive exchanges, and expanding Medicaid coverage of the poor to include childless adults and others not currently eligible.

Full text: The process was wrenching, and tainted to the 11th hour by narrow political obstructionism, but the year-long struggle over health care reform came to an end on Sunday night with a triumph for countless Americans who have been victimized or neglected by their dysfunctional health care system. Barack Obama put his presidency on the line for an accomplishment of historic proportions.
The bill, which was approved by the Senate in December and by the House on Sunday, represents a national commitment to reform the worst elements of the current system. It will provide coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans, prevent the worst insurance company abuses, and begin to wrestle with relentlessly rising costs -- while slightly reducing future deficits.
Amendments approved by the House and awaiting approval in the Senate would provide additional coverage and make somewhat deeper reductions in the deficit.
All of this was managed despite the fact that not a single Republican in the House or Senate was willing to vote for the bill. Efforts by the White House and Congressional Democrats to draft bipartisan legislation were met by demagoguery. That is not likely to end now.
Republican leaders, who see opportunities to gain seats in the elections, have made clear that they will continue to peddle fictions about a government takeover of the health care system and about costs too high to bear. Mr. Obama took too long to get into the fight, but came on strong in the end and will have to keep pushing back so all Americans understand the benefits of reform.
Most Americans -- those who already have employer-based insurance -- will not see much change for a while and certainly not in the seven months before the elections. They will get one important benefit quickly: for an additional fee, parents will be able to keep adult dependent children on their policy through age 26. That is good news when so many young people are struggling to find jobs during the recession.
The biggest difference for Americans who have employer-based insurance is the security of knowing that, starting in 2014, if they lose their job and have to buy their own policy, they cannot be denied coverage or charged high rates because of pre-existing conditions. Before then, the chronically ill could gain temporary coverage from enhanced high-risk pools and chronically ill children are guaranteed coverage.
The focus of the reform is on improving the dysfunctional and hugely expensive insurance markets for individuals and small businesses, and on expanding Medicaid coverage for the poor. The big expansion of coverage will start in 2014, but some reforms start quickly, like tax credits to help small businesses provide coverage.
Over time the reforms could bring about sweeping changes in the way medical care is delivered and paid for. They could ultimately rival Social Security and Medicare in historic importance.
NEAR-UNIVERSAL COVERAGE The United States is the only advanced industrial nation that does not provide or guarantee health care coverage for virtually all of its citizens. It is a moral obligation to end this indefensible neglect of hard-working Americans. The bill does not quite reach full universality, but by 2019, fully 94 to 95 percent of American citizens and legal residents below Medicare age will have coverage. The bill achieves that by requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance, providing subsidies to help the middle classes buy policies on new competitive exchanges, and expanding Medicaid coverage of the poor to include childless adults and others not currently eligible.
INSURANCE REFORMS The legislation would rein in many of the insurance industry's worst practices. Insurers would no longer be able to reject applicants with "pre-existing conditions" or charge them exorbitant rates. They could not rescind policies on specious grounds after people become sick (that becomes effective immediately) or cap the amount they are willing to pay toward a beneficiary's illnesses in any given year or over a lifetime.
The most important reform -- forcing insurers to accept all applicants regardless of their health status -- cannot be achieved unless nearly all Americans are required to have coverage, so the costs can be spread among the healthy and the sick.
A START AT COST CONTROL The legislation won't quickly bend the cost curve for medical care or insurance premiums -- no one has yet found a surefire way to do that -- but the reform will make an important start. Some experts believe it will lay the structural framework to mount the most serious effort ever made to control medical inflation. It will create competitive insurance exchanges that should help lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by offering an array of private policies and rates comparable to large group coverage.
The legislation will impose an excise tax in 2018 designed to drive employers and their workers away from the highest-cost insurance policies, which typically provide generous benefits at little out-of-pocket cost to the workers. Health economists consider the excise tax a very strong cost-control measure, because if workers have to pay more of the cost themselves, they and their doctors are apt to think more carefully about whether a test or procedure is really needed. The impact of the excise tax gets increasingly strong as the years pass.
The legislation creates an array of pilot programs within Medicare, to test other innovative cost-reduction strategies. They include encouraging new medical groups to better coordinate care of the chronically ill, and paying doctors and medical institutions based on the quality, not quantity, of services they deliver. The reform measure will establish an independent board to push approaches that work into widespread use in Medicare and ultimately, by force of example, the private sector.
With so many mechanisms available to hold down medical costs, it's hard to believe that they won't bear fruit, if not in the next several years then in the decade thereafter.

Just as Social Security grew from a modest start in 1935 to become a bedrock of the nation's retirement system, this is a start on health care reform, not the end. A lot will depend on whether future presidents and Congresses stick to the savings and deficit targets set in this legislation; on how aggressively states administer the new exchanges; on how health care professionals and institutions respond to the challenge of changing their ways; and on how the public responds to the mandate that everyone obtain insurance or pay a penalty.
Our hope and belief is that this reform will in the end accomplish its great objectives. Right now, the good news for all Americans is that despite all the politics and the obstructionism, the process has finally begun.

Abstract: A decision by the central bank of India to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly two years brought jitters to the world's equity markets.

Full text: The Dow Jones industrial average was stopped in its tracks on Friday as it tried for a ninth consecutive session of gains, a feat last achieved in 1996.
A sharp drop in the price of oil weighed on shares of energy companies, and by day's end, stocks were firmly in negative territory.
The market was hurt as the price of oil retreated nearly 2 percent, briefly dipping below $80 a barrel. That bolstered the appeal of the dollar, which strengthened against the euro and the British pound amid concerns about unwieldy deficits in Europe.
Despite the losses, the Dow ended the week 1.1 percent higher. On Friday, it fell 37.19 points, or 0.35 percent, to 10,741.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.93 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,159.90. It was 0.85 percent higher for the week.
The Nasdaq fell 16.87 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,374.41, posting a 0.28 percent gain for the week. It was held back by the smartphone maker Palm, which fell more than 29 percent after offering a disappointing revenue forecast.
A decision by the central bank of India to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly two years brought jitters to the world's equity markets. Analysts worry that the announcement could encourage other high-growth countries to follow suit as concerns about inflation grow. But investors bristled at the prospect of higher rates, which make lending more expensive and can hurt profit.
Currency markets were in flux on Friday amid lingering uncertainty about Greece, which is grappling with a wide budget deficit as deadlines for debt payments loom. No clear resolution has emerged for the nation, with Germany recently backing off its support of a European-led rescue package. Europe's wealthier countries are now looking to the International Monetary Fund for help.
Germany's words exposed new fissures in the effort to ward off a crisis for the Continent and its monetary union.
"It does not look like Europe has a united face to deal with the Greece situation," said Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
The pound also weakened, falling more than 1 percent against the dollar, as an official at the Bank of England raised the possibility that the British economy could fall into another downturn. Andrew Sentance, a member of the monetary policy committee, told CNBC, "There is some risk of a double-dip recession but it is not the central forecast."
Investors also remain concerned that looming elections could result in a fractured Parliament that would be unable to tackle Britain's deficit problems.
The dollar benefited from those concerns, strengthening against most world currencies. Mr. Chandler said a consensus was emerging that the Federal Reserve would soon move to raise the rate it charged banks on short-term loans, known as the discount rate.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 4/32, to 99 14/32, and the yield rose to 3.69 percent, from 3.68 percent late Thursday.
The stock market's movements were clouded on Friday because of "quadruple witching," the expiration of futures and options for stocks and stock indexes.
Despite Friday's losses, investors said they thought some optimism had returned to the market. Economic data has been largely positive lately, and traders are expecting first-quarter earnings to show strong revenue growth. Many also say they think a government report on the labor market to be released next month will show that the economy created jobs in March.
"Investors are starting to get their confidence back, starting to get their feet back underneath them," said M. Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management.
But recent gains for the market have been small, and trading has been light on some of the most enthusiastic days, raising doubts about the durability of an upward turn.
"It's a very tenuous, nervous time for Americans," Mr. Dollarhide added.

Full text: With three of seven seats to fill on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, President Obama has an opportunity to put the economy in the hands of experts untainted by the failures that led to the financial crisis. In the process, he can help restore public confidence in the Fed as steward of the economy.
Early word indicates he is on the right track. Possible nominees are still being vetted. But Mr. Obama appears to be seeking board members with broad economic and legal expertise, including a keen sense of how policies affect what the Fed would call "the household sector." This is a welcome shift from decades in which the Fed has focused increasingly on financial markets as a proxy for the economy -- mistaking asset bubbles for growth and debt-driven gains for prosperity.
The Times has reported that the top choice for vice chairwoman of the board is Janet L. Yellen, an economist who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and an expert in the causes and implications of unemployment. For the other vacant seats, Peter A. Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an authority on taxes and retirement, is under consideration, as is Sarah Bloom Raskin, a lawyer who is the Maryland commissioner of financial regulation. Other candidates include economists, lawyers and executives with expertise in labor and housing issues.
Those kinds of perspectives would help ensure that the Fed weighs the impact that its decisions have, not only on markets, but on jobs, consumer protection, long-term wealth accumulation and other neglected fundamentals of economic well-being. They also could mean a shift away from pro-market, anti-regulatory theories, notably the belief that markets are always efficient and institutional investors reliably sophisticated.
Though discredited by the crisis, those beliefs are embedded in American economic thought and need to be replaced at the highest levels of economic decision-making. Wall Streeters would scream at that, because they have benefited from the discredited status quo and would like to see it restored. Mr. Obama must be prepared to let them scream.
The new members will join the Fed board at a critical juncture. The economy is showing signs of recovery but is vulnerable to renewed recession or prolonged stagnation. If the Fed moves too soon to end the lax policies and low interest rates that are propping up the economy, it risks derailing the recovery -- and worsening already high unemployment. If it moves too late, it risks inflation. Achieving the right balance in the economy will require achieving the right balance on the board.

Full text: Signs of strength in manufacturing helped lead the Dow Jones industrial average to an eighth day of gains on Thursday, despite worries about tighter monetary policy in the United States and lingering debt woes in Europe.
After hopping between positive and negative territory for much of the day, Wall Street indexes ended mixed. Hopes were high amid signs that inflation remained tame and the jobs market was improving.
The Dow fell about 40 points at midday as rumors swirled that the Federal Reserve was poised to raise the rate it charges banks on short-term loans. In addition, the debt crisis facing Greece continued to weigh on the market. The German government indicated on Thursday that financial support for Greece should be provided by the International Monetary Fund, rather than European countries. That added more uncertainty to the prospects for a rescue plan for the struggling country as debt payments loom.
Those worries raised questions about the sturdiness of the global recovery. "There is a high level of sensitivity," said Philip J. Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. "You've got a lot of weak hands that are prepared to go the other way if it looks like this nascent recovery is stalling out."
By the end of the day, however, the Dow rose 0.41 percent, or 45.50 points, to 10,779.17, a 17-month high. The index was helped by a 2.15 percent increase in shares of Boeing. Industrial stocks gained after a Fed report on manufacturing in the Philadelphia region showed gains, particularly for hiring.
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index struggled to break into positive territory, ending the day at 1,165.83, down 0.03 percent, or 0.38 points. It was held back by losses for the energy sector, which weakened as the price of oil fell nearly 1 percent, hovering at $82 a barrel. The Nasdaq gained 0.09 percent, or 2.19 points, to close at 2,391.28.
Stocks in the financial sector also fell as traders tried to predict the effects of a bill to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory system. Some investors remain concerned about measures to focus the Federal Reserve's authority on Wall Street's largest financial institutions and strip it of its oversight over small- and midsize banks.
Shares of Bank of America fell 1.1 percent, JPMorgan Chase declined 0.34 percent and Citigroup dropped 0.74 percent.
But positive signs for the economy counteracted some of the uncertainty on Wall Street. A report from the Labor Department showed that inflation was largely in check, with consumer prices unchanged in February.
The results fueled hopes that central bankers would continue to hold down the Fed's benchmark interest rate, known as the federal funds rate, as they try to revive the economy.
The market had pulled back significantly at midday amid speculation that the Fed would move to raise the so-called discount rate. But as the day went on, investors grew skeptical of that possibility.
The central bank, which declined to comment, raised the discount rate a quarter percentage point last month and has not signaled any additional increases.
A separate report offered hope for the labor market, which remains one of weakest points of the economy. The number of people filing first-time unemployment claims declined by 5,000 last week to 457,000.
The economy has yet to start creating jobs on a sustained basis, and the unemployment rate remains at 9.7 percent, far above historical averages.
Some analysts say they believe stocks are poised for more growth before stimulus efforts begin to fade and political gridlock sets in ahead of the November election.
"It doesn't necessarily mean that stocks are going down, but it does mean you get more headwinds," said Jeffrey D. Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James, an investment firm.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 11/32, to 99 18/32. The yield rose to 3.68 percent, from 3.64 percent late Wednesday.

Prices of Consumer Goods Hold Steady, Indicating That Inflation Is at Bay

Full text: The price of consumer goods held steady in February, the government reported Thursday, the latest sign that near-zero interest rates and billions of dollars in stimulus money had yet to set off inflation.
Prices showed no movement over all last month, the Labor Department said, but when volatile food and fuel costs were excluded, costs as measured by the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent.
The index also indicated that the price of cars rose last month, with used vehicles rising 0.7 percent and new vehicles climbing by 0.4 percent. Medical care costs increased 0.5 percent, and food prices rose 0.1 percent. But the increases were offset by a 0.5 percent drop in energy costs, tied to a drop in gasoline prices.
As the United States tries to emerge from a deep downturn, the stability in prices offered reassurance that the government's efforts to stimulate the economy had not yet spurred inflation. The Federal Reserve has set a target inflation rate near 2 percent, and since February 2009, prices have increased 1.3 percent, excluding food and fuel.
"There is absolutely no rationale for any premature tightening by the Fed in this environment," said Brian A. Bethune, chief financial economist for IHS Global Insight. "This report is a checkered flag for low interest rates."
A snapshot of wholesale costs on Wednesday offered a similar message: the Producer Price Indexdropped 0.6 percent in February and was virtually unchanged when food and fuel costs were excluded.
Subdued prices have stirred talk about the risk of deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Though helpful for consumer pocketbooks, deflation can quickly derail a recovery. But many economists say they believe that as the recovery gains steam, demand will be strong enough to overcome that threat.
"Lean inventories and improving demand will eventually lead to a pickup in inflation," said Michelle Meyer, an economist for Barclays Capital.
Economists expect the nation's high unemployment rate -- currently at 9.7 percent -- to help keep prices down.
With jobs scarce, bargaining power effectively rests in the hands of company managers. Employers can set wages without worrying that their workers will decamp for more lucrative positions. As a result, paychecks generally decline, forcing businesses to lower prices to compete for struggling customers. That cycle keeps prices -- and inflation -- tame.
On Thursday, the labor market showed small signs of improvement, with the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims falling by 5,000 to 457,000 last week.
Some sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, are beginning to increase hiring. A Fed survey on manufacturing in the Philadelphia region released Thursday showed that activity continued to accelerate, despite a series of storms. Hiring improved, registering its best reading in nearly three years.
Despite scattered growth, the economy continues to shed jobs each month. At many factories, machines sit idle, with the capacity utilization rate far below historical averages.
Those pressures have kept costs down for now, but policy makers continued to monitor shifts in prices as they worked to revive the economy.
As it seeks to normalize monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has begun scaling back some of its broad interventions, like a program to buy troubled mortgage-backed securities.
But on Tuesday, facing an economy that was still grappling with pervasive unemployment and a sputtering housing market, the Fed pledged to keep its benchmark federal funds rate near zero for an "extended period."
Economists interpret the Fed's language to mean six months or more, although if producer and consumer prices hold steady, it could be longer. Some analysts said they believed the economy might not be strong enough to return to higher rates for one to two years.

Full text: Wholesale prices fell 0.6 percent in February, the government said Wednesday, signaling that inflation remained tame even in a time of extraordinarily low interest rates.
A day after the Federal Reservereiterated its pledge to keep rates down to spur growth, data from the Labor Department reinforced the view that price pressures remain subdued.
That will most likely give the Fed leeway to keep interest rates low for an extended period, though the central bank is expected to begin taking more substantial steps to normalize monetary policy toward the end of the year.
"There's nothing here that would shake the view that inspired the Fed's decision," said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase.
Wholesales prices have been increasing since October and climbed 1.4 percent in January. February broke that trend, largely because of a 7.4 percent drop in the price of gasoline.
Prices at the pump have increased in the last month because of rising demand and limited supply. Over all, energy prices fell 2.9 percent last month, which was offset somewhat by a 0.4 percent increase in food prices, including eggs, meat and fresh vegetables.
A more closely watched measure that excludes volatile food and energy costs showed wholesale prices increased 0.1 percent.
Compared with a year earlier, wholesale prices are up 4.4 percent, which economists consider elevated but not sufficient to sound an alarm about widespread inflation.
Changes in producer prices often trickle down to the consumer level, though businesses have been reluctant to raise prices in the current economic environment as they compete for customers.
"In subdued economic conditions, there just isn't the demand to support higher prices," said Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics in Toronto. "Companies have to cut prices to survive."
The Labor Department will release its barometer of consumer prices on Thursday. On Tuesday, the Fed held its regular meeting to set interest rates. In a statement, the central bank's policy-setting committee suggested it was not concerned about inflation, though one member, Thomas M. Hoenig, dissented. He has expressed concern that the Fed was moving too slowly to restore higher interest rates and may set the stage for inflation.
In its statement, the committee said, "With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time."
Economists expect the Fed to keep rates low until the labor market and the broader economy show clear signs of improvement.
Some argue that an extended period of low interest rates could usher in deflation, which occurs when weak demand causes prices to fall. Japan, for instance, is grappling with deflation concerns as it tries to emerge from a recession.
But in the United States, concerns about deflation have subsided as the recovery has gained strength and demand has shown signs of rebounding. Still, Mr. Feroli warned, "I think we may be jumping the gun -- we collectively, meaning economists and policy makers -- in declaring deflation risks over."
Other economists believe that a healthy recovery will come only when inflation is more pronounced in the United States, and that central banks have set their target inflation rates too low.

Full text: Wall Street indexes reached their highest levels on Wednesday since the start of the financial crisis in 2008, pushed ahead by signs that inflation remained subdued and that interest rates would remain low.
Investors were reassured by pledges from the central banks of the United States and Japan that they would keep in place policies aimed at speeding the global economic recovery.
The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that its benchmark federal funds rate would remain near zero for the immediate future. And in an attempt to add liquidity to the world's second-largest economy, the Bank of Japan on Wednesday doubled the size of a loan program for banks.
That helped send the major stock indexes to their highest levels in 17 months. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.45 percent, or 47.69 points, to 10,733.67, breaking above its recent January highs and extending a winning streak to seven days.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reached another 17-month high, climbing 0.58 percent, or 6.75 points, to 1,166.21. The Nasdaq rose 0.47 percent, or 11.08 points, to 2,389.09.
"There really isn't a reason to sell here," said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. "You're not seeing robust outright buying, but you are seeing some nibbling. There is a growing sense that it's time to commit a little more to the market."
Building on the momentum, a report showed inflation in the United States remained tame in February despite an extended period of extremely low interest rates. Policy makers have kept rates at record lows in an effort to jump-start lending, but some economists remain concerned about upward pressure on prices.
Trading was lighter than usual, stirring doubts about the sustainability of the momentum. But several analysts said they were reassured by the advance in the absence of conclusive economic data.
Health care stocks posted only a slight gain as Congress moved closer to some type of action on legislation to overhaul the country's health care system.
A rise in commodities helped build the appetite for risk. The price of oil continued to increase, climbing 1.2 percent, to $82.93 a barrel, as producers decided to keep production levels unchanged for now. Copper gained nearly 2 percent.
Ford's stock surged more than 4.5 percent after the company's debt was upgraded by Moody's. The company became the No. 1 automaker in the United States in February, with sales rising 43 percent.
Analysts said the market might need conclusive signs that the recovery was under way to sustain a move upward. With the S.& P. 500 now more than 70 percent above its levels a year ago, and the Dow approaching 11,000 points, some investors say they believe that the market's exuberance may not reflect the reality of a halting recovery.
"The equity market is three parts perception and one part reality," said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff, an investment firm. "It's extremely hard to believe that zero percent interest rates can engineer positive sentiment on an ongoing basis. It's really going to come down to how the economy and how earnings end up performing."
Investors will get a better sense of whether the tide has turned in the American labor market when the government releases its monthly employment snapshot. The jobless rate remains at 9.7 percent, and the economy continues to shed jobs each month.
Interest rates were steady on Wednesday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note increased 4/32, to 99 29/32, and the yield fell to 3.64 percent, from 3.65 percent late Tuesday.

Abstract: Drastic budget cuts, if carried out as promised, could set off deflation, send already high unemployment rates surging, bring governments down and even create popular opposition to the euro, critics say. The Germans are preaching harsh budget cuts, tax increases, pension reforms, a later retirement age and a quick return to government deficits closer to the European requirement of 3 percent of gross domestic product, a far cry from Greece's 12.7 percent for 2009.

Full text: PARIS -- Across Europe, from profligate Greece to newly strait-laced Ireland, countries are promising deep, painful cuts in public spending even as they face the likelihood of a new recession.
To protect the value of the euro, satisfy investors and appease Europe's economic taskmaster, Germany, the region's most heavily indebted nations consider that they have no choice but to slim down. Reviving economic growth and reducing unemployment must wait until countries put their fiscal houses in better order, the thinking goes.
But some argue that Berlin is pressing too hard, and that the region's new fixation on debt has created a "cult of austerity" that could make it harder to recover from the slump. Drastic budget cuts, if carried out as promised, could set off deflation, send already high unemployment rates surging, bring governments down and even create popular opposition to the euro, critics say.
The pressure "will impose terrible strains on the government and society" for years to come, said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, professor of economics at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. "It's self-defeating, because if you have austerity and deflation in Greece, Portugal and Spain, then the European economy will not recover; firms will fail and jeopardize the banks."
Opposition to austerity is spoken softly in official circles, as political leaders fret that markets will punish countries that show weak resolve to reduce debt. But Germany, which has insisted on steep cuts in public spending in the most indebted nations, is facing criticism for harping about the dangers of debt without doing more to support growth, mainly by buying more from its neighbors.
The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, warned Berlin that it must raise its domestic demand to help partners in trouble. Could Germany, with its high savings and big trade surplus, "do a little something?" she asked in an interview with The Financial Times. "It takes two to tango. It can't just be about enforcing deficit principles."
The debate is partly about economics -- what steps European countries need to take to tackle their demons of high debt and slow growth. But it is also about leadership, as the European Union struggles to define its mission during the deepest economic crisis in its history.
The Germans insist that the problem is debt. Addressing it means radical cuts in public spending immediately, using the pressure from markets to impose changes that are politically difficult but crucial to long-term health.
"The euro is facing the strongest challenge it has ever had to cope with," Chancellor Angela Merkel told the lower house of the German Parliament on Wednesday. "A quick act of solidarity is definitely not the right answer. Rather, the right answer is to seize the problem at the roots; therefore there is no alternative to the Greek savings program."
France has a different, softer approach, akin to the American perspective: public spending must expand in times of economic crisis to increase employment and growth, which will gradually cut the deficit through increased tax receipts. Many European countries need to streamline their public sectors, France argues, but not as shock therapy.
German rigor has worked well for Germany, which has kept wages down, reformed its social-welfare system and remained one of the world's top exporting countries. Psychologically, Germans remain obsessed with inflation and saving. But Germany consequently has a big balance-of-trade surplus with its euro-zone partners. And that imbalance makes it harder for less competitive countries to grow their way out of their problems.
The Germans note that Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy did not play by the rules of monetary union, drafted largely by Germany. "Wages rose very fast, productivity stayed low and governments went on a spending spree, and that makes Germans angry, because they did the opposite," said Thomas Klau of the European Council on Foreign Relations.
The Germans are preaching harsh budget cuts, tax increases, pension reforms, a later retirement age and a quick return to government deficits closer to the European requirement of 3 percent of gross domestic product, a far cry from Greece's 12.7 percent for 2009.
On the other side are worries that this sounds similar to the austerity mantra that helped set off the Great Depression. Mr. Fitoussi says it risks throwing the Mediterranean countries into deflation, which will create huge political and social pressures and short-circuit Europe's economic recovery. Forecasts already predict recession for most of the southern rim for at least another year or two.
While Greece clearly must reform its public sector -- and stop manipulating its economic statistics -- market credibility does not require murdering the economy, argues Mr. Fitoussi, who is close to Joseph Stiglitz, the American economist who has advised Greece. Mr. Stiglitz warns of "deficit fetishism," arguing that further recession could increase the deficit beyond the government's ability to cut spending.
Even the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Fitoussi said, having learned lessons from the Asian crisis of the 1990s, would not try to impose as much austerity all at once, but would rather try to alleviate the immediate debt squeeze and help revive growth before insisting on the biggest cuts.
The United States, too, has taken a different tack, accumulating new debt to stimulate growth and worrying later about reducing deficits. The United States budget deficit this year will be 11.2 percent of G.D.P. But Washington can better afford it. Not only does it control the dollar, which remains the world's reserve currency, but also gross American debt is only half that of Greece when measured against G.D.P.
France, hit less hard by the crisis, is trying to find a happy medium -- with moderate stimulus, no tax increases, support for small and medium enterprises and a deficit growing to 8.2 percent, even as unemployment climbs back over 10 percent.
To an extent, smaller economies like that of Greece have to bow to the demands of the market. Iceland with its bank disasters and Ireland with its property and bank bubbles have also buckled down to cut budgets considerably in the face of plunging tax receipts, but their politicians are expected to suffer.
Moreover, accumulated debt in southern Europe has become an urgent issue, with Greece only the most egregious example. The Greek ratio is forecast for 125 percent of G.D.P. and climbing; Italy's is nearly 118 percent and the euro zone's is 84 percent.
But inevitably the policies to deal with the debt have to balance political and economic realities. Elected governments may promise drastic cuts, but it is not clear that they can stay in office to carry them out.
Greek unions are striking regularly, determined to keep their benefits, and consumer organizations are denouncing a new poverty. Babis Delidaskakis, an economist with INKA, the Greek consumers' federation, called the sudden cuts "a nefarious dead end for the economy."
"Can the Greek government survive this?" asked Julian Callow of Barclays Capital. "Spain looks better, but the government hasn't even begun to get tough on the fiscal side. This is going to have to be a six- to eight-year project to stabilize these debt-to-G.D.P. ratios -- and it gets progressively harder to keep at it."

Full text: HONG KONG -- The World Bank recommended higher interest rates and a stronger currency for China on Wednesday, as it raised growth forecasts for the country. China's rapid economic growth has led to expectations of rising inflation and concerns that a bubble is building in the property industry.
In its quarterly assessment of China, which is poised to overtake Japan this year as the world's second-largest economy after the United States, the World Bank raised its forecast to 9.5 percent growth for 2010 from the 8.7 percent it projected in November. It also estimated that growth would slow somewhat next year, to 8.7 percent.
Separately, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, also said the renminbi's exchange rate was too low. "Some currencies in Asia are undervalued, especially the renminbi," Mr. Strauss-Kahn told a committee of the European Parliament in Brussels.
A huge stimulus package and ample lending by China's government-controlled banks helped its economy avoid a recession last year. China grew 8.7 percent in 2009, less than in previous years but still a huge gain, especially when compared with the drop in gross domestic product that hit most other leading economies.
Exports, a main driver of growth, also recovered briskly from their sharp fall in early 2009, allowing China to gain global market share last year.
But several problems have emerged: the World Bank on Wednesday singled out the looming property bubble and strained local government finances as "macroeconomic risks" in China.
"Inflation expectations can be contained by a tighter monetary stance and a stronger exchange rate," the organization wrote in its report. "The case for a larger role for interest rates in monetary policy is strong. If policy makers remain concerned about interest-rate-sensitive capital flows, more exchange rate flexibility would help."
The call for flexibility comes as China faces increasing pressure from the United States to let the renminbi appreciate against the dollar. Many American politicians argue that the current level, at 6.8 renminbi to the dollar, gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage by making their goods cheap for overseas buyers.
In addition, the World Bank said that with output in China again "close to potential," the country needs "a different macro stance than most other countries."
This echoes assessments from many other economists, many of whom expect the Chinese authorities to step up measures to contain bank lending, including nudging up interest rates again later this year.
"The monetary policy stance needs to be tighter than last year, and the case for exchange rate flexibility and more monetary independence from the U.S. is strengthening," the organization said in its update.
"It would also be helpful to increase the tolerance for modest inflation, to ensure room for desirable relative price changes," the report said. "Over time, more exchange rate flexibility can enable China to have a monetary policy independent from U.S. cyclical conditions."

Abstract: Mr. Bernanke, who noted that small institutions were involved in crises from the bank failures of the 1930s through the savings-and-loan collapse in the 1980s, added, "We need to have insights into what's happening in the entire banking system to understand how regulation affects banks, to understand the status of the assets and the credit problems of banks at all levels, at all sizes." The president of the Boston Fed, Eric S. Rosengren, has published research asserting that information collected by bank supervisors can improve the forecasts of inflation and unemployment that Fed policy makers consider when setting interest rates.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Officials at the Federal Reserve are trying to alter a Senate proposal that would focus the Fed's regulatory attention on the nation's biggest banks and strip away its powers over small and medium-size banks.
The proposal, which was introduced on Monday by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, would make the Fed even more centered on New York and Washington and disrupt an institutional balance in place since the central bank opened its doors in 1914, officials said.
"It's not the central bank of Wall Street," Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in an interview. "It's the central bank of the United States. Let's not forget that."
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made the same point in testimony to the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.
"We are quite concerned by proposals to make the Fed a regulator only of the biggest banks," he told Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina. "It makes us essentially the 'too big to fail' regulator. We don't want that responsibility. We want to have a connection to Main Street as well as to Wall Street."
Mr. Bernanke, who noted that small institutions were involved in crises from the bank failures of the 1930s through the savings-and-loan collapse in the 1980s, added, "We need to have insights into what's happening in the entire banking system to understand how regulation affects banks, to understand the status of the assets and the credit problems of banks at all levels, at all sizes."
As part of an overhaul of financial regulation, the chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, had proposed in November that the Fed be stripped of all bank supervision powers and focus almost exclusively on monetary policy.
In a revised bill released on Monday, he reversed course, proposing to grant the Fed oversight of all systemically important financial institutions, not just banks.
While the new proposal would leave the Fed with responsibility for about 35 bank holding companies, each with $50 billion or more in assets, about 4,900 smaller bank holding companies and 850 state-chartered banks that are members of the Fed system would become the responsibility of other regulators.
Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman who has advised the Obama administration, said the $50 billion threshold -- Mr. Dodd had originally proposed $100 billion -- seemed to be "rather arbitrary."
He said the Fed's 12 district banks "provide a window into both banking developments and economic tendencies in all regions of the country."
The regional banks would have the most to lose under Mr. Dodd's proposal, which would enhance the New York Fed's traditional status as the first among equals.
The New York Fed is the largest and most powerful of the 12 banks, and it also conducts the open-market operations by which the Fed expands or contracts the supply of credit in the economy.
As the vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, the New York Fed president always has a vote on setting the short-term interest rate. Voting powers rotate among the presidents of the 11 other district banks.
Mr. Dodd's proposal would have the president of the United States appoint the New York Fed's president.
J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., a retired president of the Richmond Fed, said of the Dodd proposal, "It will tend to sway the balance of power and influence within the Fed to some degree away from the non-New York banks toward the Fed power centers in Washington and New York."
Anne M. Khademian, a political scientist at Virginia Tech who has written about the Fed, said the Senate proposal was partly a response to a longstanding criticism that the Fed cared more about monetary policy than bank supervision.
"Despite the criticism of supervision by the Fed, there is some pretty sophisticated expertise in the regional banks that would be lost," she said of the proposal. "To get a broad picture of systemic risk, you need to look at the smaller banks."
Mr. Hoenig, of the Kansas City Fed, is the longest-serving of the 12 current presidents. His district covers all or part of seven states, and he said it had served as an early-warning system for pressures in various sectors of the economy, from commercial real estate to agriculture. The link between monetary policy and bank regulation "has served us well for nearly 100 years," he said.
The president of the Boston Fed, Eric S. Rosengren, has published research asserting that information collected by bank supervisors can improve the forecasts of inflation and unemployment that Fed policy makers consider when setting interest rates.
Jeffrey L. Gerhart, president of the Bank of Newman Grove in Nebraska, testified on Wednesday on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America. "It is not logical to strip the Federal Reserve of its authority over community banks and their holding companies when the record shows it has been a very effective regulator of community banks," he said.
Several lawmakers, however, seem unmoved by those arguments, suggesting that the bank presidents have been self-serving.
"They like their marble buildings and they like their stature and they like their relevance," Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who has been a Republican negotiator with Mr. Dodd on the regulatory overhaul, said last week.
And at the Wednesday hearing, Representative Spencer T. Bachus of Alabama, the top Republican on the committee, said, "It seems that when the Fed is responsible for monetary policy and bank supervision, its performance in both suffers."

Full text: Home building slowed in February as snowstorms stopped construction in some of the country's largest markets, a Commerce Department report indicated Tuesday.
But the data suggested that builders might also be curtailing construction in response to disappointing demand, despite the government's efforts to lure buyers with a tax credit of up to $8,000.
Construction fell 5.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 575,000 homes, with much of the weakness in the Northeast and South, where the severe weather was concentrated. Building of single-family homes fell 0.6 percent.
"The outlook remains bleak," Paul Dales, an economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. "Home building activity remains very low by historical standards and is set to remain that way for some time."
The drop in February followed an increase in January that was much better than initially reported. The government said Tuesday that construction increased 6.6 percent in January, nearly triple the original estimate, with much of the momentum coming from single-family homes.
Analysts had expected home construction to decrease by less in February, but those forecasts did not account for the surge in building in January.
The slowdown revived a debate about the potency of the tax credit for home buyers. While economists said most of the decline in February could be tied to weather, builders might also be responding to tepid demand.
Sales of new homes fell to a record low in January, resurrecting worries that consumers would delay home buying until the jobs market turned around. The government's tax credit helped lift sales in the fall. But analysts have yet to see the second wave of buying they predicted as the April 30 deadline for the credit approaches.
Indeed, building permits, which indicate future activity and were not affected by weather, fell 1.6 percent in February after robust gains in recent months.
A large supply of excess homes on the market is keeping builders on the sidelines. Economists estimate there are 3.8 million homes for sale in the United States, and the market may be flooded with an additional five million to six million in foreclosed properties over the next several years.
"It's still a real struggle for builders," said Nigel Gault, an economist for IHS Global Insight. "They're competing with a lot of distressed properties on the market at bargain prices."
The influx of foreclosed homes is also making it harder for Americans to sell their homes, contributing to the weak demand for new homes. Over the last year, the housing market has moved mostly sideways: the rate of construction was 0.2 percent higher in February compared with a year earlier.
Adding to the troubles is the foundering commercial real estate market, where vacancy rates are high and financiers are scarce. That has curbed apartment construction. In February, construction of apartments with five units or more fell 43.1 percent to an annual rate of 58,000 units, though economists cautioned that the trends could be exaggerated at such low levels.
The housing market's recovery may depend largely on how quickly unemployment eases. It may take several years before the jobless rate, now 9.7 percent, retreats to normal levels.
In part because of the weak jobs market, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it would keep interest rates near zero for an extended period.
Despite the low rates, economists say inflation appears to be in check in the United States. A Labor Department report released Tuesday reinforced that view, with import prices, a gauge of inflation, falling 0.3 percent in February, mostly because of a decline in fuel prices.

Abstract: To cover the costs of future spending -- the retirement of the baby boomers and everything else -- federal taxes would have to rise by almost 50 percent, immediately and permanently, according to a recent analysis by the economists Alan Auerbach and William Gale. Despite the Bush tax cuts, average annual growth over the last decade -- even before the Great Recession began -- was slower than in any decade since World War II.

Full text: As a society gets richer, its tax rates tend to rise.
This idea is known as Wagner's Law, named for the 19th-century economist who came up with it. Citizens of richer societies generally prefer more government services, Adolf Wagner explained. With their basic needs met, they want a military to protect them, good schools for their children, comfortable retirement for the elderly, medical care even when it isn't profitable and a strong social safety net.
Sure enough, the United States followed this path for most of the last century. In 1900, federal taxes amounted to just 2 percent of gross domestic product. By 2000, the share had risen to 21 percent.
Over the last couple of decades, though, we have repealed Wagner's Law -- or, more to the point, only partly repealed it. Taxes are no longer rising. They fell to 18 percent of G.D.P. in 2008 and, because of the recession, to a 60-year low of 15.1 percent last year.
Yet our desire for government services just keeps growing. We added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Farm subsidies are sacrosanct. Social Security is the third rail of politics.
This disconnect is, far and away, the main reason for our huge budget problems. Yes, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the recession and the stimulus have all added to the deficit. But they are minor issues in the long run. By 2020, government spending is projected to equal 26 percent (and rising) of G.D.P., mostly because of Medicare and Social Security. Taxes are on pace to equal just 19 percent.
On Friday, Congressional Republicans named six members of a deficit commission that President Obama created last month. In all, the commission will have 10 Democratic members and eight Republicans. It is scheduled to issue its recommendations late this year.
"By any reasonable projection, we're on an utterly unsustainable path," Peter Orszag, the White House budget director, told me last week. "And the fiscal commission, while not guaranteed to succeed, offers the best hope of getting ahead of this problem before it becomes a true crisis."
The commission can succeed, of course, only if it comes up with solutions that Congress and the White House accept. For now, political leaders in both parties are still in denial about what the solution will entail. To be fair, so is much of the public.
What needs to happen? Spending will need to be cut, and taxes will need to rise. They won't need to rise just on households making more than $250,000, as Mr. Obama has suggested. They will probably need to rise on your household, however much you make.
A solution that relied only on spending cuts would dismantle some bedrock parts of modern American society. Paul Ryan, the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, recently released such a plan, and it got rid of Medicare for everyone now under 55.
A solution that relied only on taxes would muzzle economic growth. To cover the costs of future spending -- the retirement of the baby boomers and everything else -- federal taxes would have to rise by almost 50 percent, immediately and permanently, according to a recent analysis by the economists Alan Auerbach and William Gale.
A solution that combined spending cuts and tax increases would not need to be ruinous -- or start in the next couple of years, when unemployment is likely to remain high. But the federal government does have a decent amount of fat in it. And, just as Wagner pointed out, tax increases are not inherently bad. Done right, they do not even have to reduce economic growth by much.
In recent years, economic research has suggested that moderate changes in the tax law don't actually have a huge impact on growth. You don't need econometrics to grasp this, either. Just look at the last 20 years. Economic growth after Bill Clinton's tax increases was far more rapid than economic growth after George W. Bush's tax cuts. Despite the Bush tax cuts, average annual growth over the last decade -- even before the Great Recession began -- was slower than in any decade since World War II.
The biggest hurdle to solving the deficit problem will be politics, not economics. Even if the tax increases and spending cuts don't need to be ruinous, they will not be popular. None of us like the idea of losing benefits or paying more taxes. That's why Mr. Obama and Congress have outsourced the first stage of the process to a commission.

On the spending side, health care is easily the biggest item. Not only will many people in their 50s and 60s live into their 80s, but technological advances will make medical care for any individual person much more expensive in the future.
A crucial aspect of the final health reform bills is that they take early steps toward trying to distinguish between care that makes people healthier and care that does not. These steps, along with some Medicare cuts, are the reason that many economists think the bills will reduce the deficit. The bills will also make it easier for Medicare to make further changes in the future.
Beyond heath care, Social Security benefits could be reduced for high-income households, and the annual inflation adjustment could be trimmed (making it more accurate, some economists believe). Many corporate subsidies -- for agribusinesses and banks, among others -- serve no useful economic function. Some military contractors could also stand to be squeezed.
Don't expect that any one program can close the deficit, though. Military spending, for example, already takes up a much smaller share of the budget than a few decades ago, as Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, said last week. Without the end of the cold war, the deficit might have already soared.
On taxes, the affluent can certainly stand to pay higher rates than they have. Over the last three decades, they have received both the biggest pretax pay increases and the biggest tax cuts. But there is not enough money at the top to eliminate the long-term fiscal gap. Households making more than $250,000 pay federal taxes equal to only about 5 percent of G.D.P.
The ideal way to raise taxes for everyone else is not through the income tax code -- which can affect people's incentive to work -- but through another means. As Victoria Perry of the International Monetary Fund points out, every industrialized country in the world except Saudi Arabia and the United States has some kind of consumption tax. A modest consumption tax would give households more incentive to save and could raise significant revenue. Another option is to reduce some big deductions, like the one for mortgage interest.
I'll confess that I have a hard time seeing how any of this will happen in the next few years, no matter what the deficit commission recommends. Congressional Republicans have shown little willingness to consider any tax increases, and Mr. Obama has shown no indication of breaking his $250,000-and-under pledge. We voters, meanwhile, tend to oppose government spending in general while supporting the government programs that the spending pays for.
But a lot can happen in a few years. For one thing, interest rates on government bonds are likely to rise, making the need to reduce the deficit more pressing. "It doesn't seem like policy makers are currently afraid of the bond market," Mr. Orszag says, "and I wish that weren't the case." Someday soon, they may have to be.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Tuesday affirmed its plan to stop buying mortgage-backed securities, expressing a degree of confidence that it could eliminate that pillar of support without undermining the nation's economic recovery.
The move came as the Fed voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, at nearly zero percent, citing evidence of economic weakness and little sign of inflation.
The Fed's purchases of mortgage-backed securities, which will total $1.25 trillion and end March 31, have helped hold mortgage rates to near-record lows, and the Fed left open the possibility that the purchases might have to be resumed, particularly if the housing recovery stalls.
The Fed said it would "continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability."
Marvin Goodfriend, a former research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said the Fed was essentially conducting an experiment by trying to end its purchases of mortgage securities. "It would like private money to come back into the mortgage market, but if the interest-rate spread on mortgages over government securities that is needed to bring private money back is too high, it could impede the recovery of the housing market," he said.
Ideally, the Fed would like to see only a slight rise in mortgage rates, he said.
In announcing that it would hold its benchmark fed funds rate near zero, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's chief policy-setting arm, said that "the labor market is stabilizing."
That was a slight improvement over the assessment given after the Fed committee's last meeting, in January, when it said "the deterioration in the labor market is abating."
The committee added: "Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly.
"However, investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have been flat at a depressed level, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls."
The committee maintained its position that "inflation is likely to be subdued for some time," and left the target range for the fed funds rate, the rate that banks make overnight loans to each other, at zero to 0.25 percent, where it has been since December 2008.
And as it has said since last March, the committee projected that the rate would probably remain "exceptionally low" for "an extended period." Many economists have taken that language to mean that the Fed would not begin tightening monetary policy until the second half of this year.
As of last week, the Fed has bought just over $1 trillion in mortgage-related assets, through a program that started in November 2008. It also had bought, as of Wednesday, $169 billion out of a target of $175 billion in debt guaranteed by federal mortgage-financing agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Stephen H. Axilrod, a retired Fed official and the author of "Inside the Fed," a book about monetary policy, said of the committee members: "They're gathering the nerve to end this response to the crisis and revert to normal, which is not to buy large amounts of long-term securities to lower interest rates."
Traditionally, the Fed's balance sheet has mostly comprised safe Treasury-securities.
But Ian Shepherdson, the chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting company, said the end of the asset purchases would "expose M2," a measure of the money supply, "to the full force of the credit contraction, and it won't be pretty."
He wrote in a research note: "The Fed reserves the right to buy assets again if needed; we think it will have to."
Mr. Goodfriend, now a professor of economics at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University, said: "The Fed can't fund the mortgage market forever. There has to be an exit where the Fed pulls out, lets the spread move around a little, and assures investors that they can get a return commensurate with the current risk in housing."
So far, the gradual tapering off of the purchases has not had a major effect on mortgage interest rates, which many Fed officials view as an encouraging sign.
The committee approved its public statement by a vote of 9 to 1. Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who is known for his wariness about inflation, dissented, as he did in January.
Mr. Hoenig "believed that continuing to express the expectation of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period was no longer warranted because it could lead to the buildup of financial imbalances and increase risks to longer-run macroeconomic and financial stability," the Fed said in its statement.
With interest rates unable to go any lower, the Fed has had to use other instruments of monetary policy to help stimulate growth. Chief among those tools has been the asset purchases.
"The Fed, if it wanted to, and it may yet need to, could continue buying assets and expanding its balance sheet," Mr. Goodfriend said.
"That's an option the Fed has, even though interest rate policy is immobilized at zero. The reason we have a central bank is that it retains flexibility to move in either direction, depending on what the economy requires. It needs to make the most of that flexibility, because it's very hard to see the future."
The Fed also injected liquidity into the markets by making huge amounts of loans at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008.
Less than a month ago, the Fed took steps to normalize lending by raising the interest rate it charges on short-term loans to banks to 0.75 percent, from 0.50 percent.
While the Fed emphasized that the change in the discount rate did not represent a shift in monetary policy, it was interpreted by some as a clear sign that an extraordinary era of easy money was going to end gradually.

Full text: CORRECTION: An Op-Ed essay on Wednesday, about the Federal Reserve and consumer protection, misidentified the state represented in the House of Representatives by William Delahunt. It is Massachusetts, not Delaware.
ON Monday, Senator Christopher Dodd unveiled his proposal to reform the nation's financial regulatory system, including a new agency to protect consumers from predatory practices like teaser mortgages and misleading credit card contracts.
It's a great idea, save for a fatal flaw. As a sop to Republicans, Senator Dodd's plan lodges the agency in the very organization that dropped the ball in America's consumer finance crisis: the Federal Reserve.
The Fed has a long and largely undistinguished history of consumer protection. During the 1970s, officials at the Fed opposed the Community Reinvestment Act, which attacked home lending discrimination, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which compelled banks to reveal their lending patterns.
When these became law, the Fed limply enforced them; it gave the same treatment to the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, passed in 1994.
The Fed also sat on the sidelines during the housing bubble. Many Fed officials supported the explosion in subprime lending, and they seemed to look the other way as foreclosures soared in the latter half of 2006.
Even at the height of the crisis, Fed governors rarely mentioned consumer protection. Indeed, it wasn't until two Democratic representatives, William Delahunt of Delaware and Brad Miller of North Carolina, proposed an independent consumer agency on March 10, 2009, that the Fed began to talk the talk of consumer protection; it's probably no coincidence that the first public mention of consumer protection regulation by Fed officials in the entire aftermath of the financial crisis came on March 19, 2009, when a Fed governor, Daniel Tarullo, spoke about it at a hearing.
At this point, the Fed, and in particular its chairman, Ben Bernanke, seemed to find religion. Last July, it proposed rule revisions that would simplify the fine print on mortgages and highlight risky features of a loan. Two months later, it said that credit cards should be subject to similar regulatory reform, and Mr. Bernanke followed in October with a proposal for a council of risk regulators that would also oversee consumer issues.
It wasn't all talk: according to its own data, the Fed's enforcement actions against banks and lenders also began increasing over the past year, particularly after Congress took up the idea of an independent regulator. From a post-crisis average of eight announced enforcement actions per month, the Fed doubled its announcements to 16 actions per month once an independent agency was proposed.
But this new seriousness doesn't mean the Fed is the right place for a consumer protection agency. For one, the Fed is above all concerned with inflation and other systemic risks to the economy; given a conflict between avoiding threats to the economy and consumer protection, is it reasonable or fair to expect it to choose the latter?
And, conflicts of interest aside, the Fed has yet to show it can truly protect consumers. Regulation is often a cat-and-mouse game in which officials must constantly anticipate how banks and lenders will respond to the government's rules and activities and adapt regulation in turn. Reactive "regulation for show," as we've seen from the Fed since March 2009, is not enough.
Senator Dodd's proposal attempts to seal off the agency within the Fed, giving it rulemaking authority subject to the veto of a council of regulators. But independence will be impossible to enforce in practice, since nothing in the bill would prevent the Fed from lobbying the council or other regulators reviewing the bureau's rules -- and Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues would surely carry a lot of weight.
Embedding consumer protection in the Fed could be worse than imperfect. By giving the imprimatur of a consumer protection office to an agency that has long resisted consumer protection, Congress risks creating a false sense of security among policymakers and the public. The Fed's politically reactive posture is the exact opposite of the sustained care that consumer financial protection demands.

Full text: TALCAHUANO, Chile -- Just a few weeks ago, some 2,000 fishermen who ply the waters of this port city for sardines and mackerel were busy mending their nets and testing their rigs in preparation for the start of the four-month fishing season.
But the tsunami that barreled through here after last month's 8.8-magnitude earthquake washed away the fishing industry before the fishermen could cast their first net.
The waves tossed around fishing boats and truck-size shipping containers as if they were wood blocks in a toddler's sandbox. Boats landed several blocks inland, resting battered and broken on city streets. The waves deposited multicolored containers one-third of a mile up the beach.
The effect on the economy of this city of 250,000 residents, for whom fishing is the main industry, will be far-reaching, with city officials estimating that it could take up to a decade to rebuild homes and port facilities. And this year's fishing season, which was to begin last Monday, is lost, fishermen said.
"The disturbance in the sea caused the fish to emigrate, to disappear from here," said Alfonso Alvear, 69, a fisherman and president of a neighborhood association here. "It's as if we have to discover this fishing region all over again."
How severely the Feb. 27 earthquake will rattle Chile's overall economy, which has been the envy of Latin America for the past decade, remains to be seen. Most economists are betting that Chile's prudent economic management leading up to the disastrous quake, and the intense rebuilding effort now needed in some parts of the country, will help it weather the economic shocks better than most countries could.
But for a few months at least, a major slowdown is expected in several Chilean industries, including fishing, pulp and paper, wine and agriculture. Seaside areas like Talcahuano that were ravaged by the tsunami could take much longer to pick themselves back up.
"The harder part will be in small villages and towns along the coast, many of which lost their local economy like the fishermen did, and the lady that owned a mini market, and the guy who owned a campground," said Rodrigo Jordan, chairman of the Foundation for Overcoming Poverty, a research institute in Santiago, the capital. "They can rebuild their homes and find clothes, but how can they sustain their families without a local economy?"
The quake devastated nearly a third of the fishing industry in the south-central part of the country, where the tremor struck hardest. It destroyed more than 12 percent of the stock of Chile's wine industry. And it knocked out an important pulp and paper mill in Constitucion that could take six months to repair.
Then there were the more subtle effects. The seemingly endless aftershocks -- more than 300 by Friday -- have kept many on edge, and even stressed out cows, which are producing less milk since the quake, said Marta Lagos, a Santiago economist and pollster.
The two regions affected most by the quake -- Maule and Bio Bio -- account for 13 percent of Chile's gross domestic product and nearly 20 percent of its industrial output. Concepcion, Chile's second largest city and an industrial hub, was close to the quake's epicenter and was extensively damaged.
Chile's most important industry, copper, was relatively unscathed, as the quake did little to most mines, especially those in the far north of the country. Several ports will need to be repaired, which could slow exports in a variety of goods, although copper is not expected to be affected. The south-central zone damaged by the quake handles more than 20 percent of the cargo in and out of Chile, said Claudio Ortiz, frigate captain of the maritime government of Talcahuano.
"The movement of goods to ships is going to slow down," said Sebastian Edwards, an economics professor at U.C.L.A. who specializes in Latin America. "Chile is a country that relies heavily on exports, so this is going to be a factor."
But Dr. Edwards and other economists also contend that Chile could emerge with a stronger economy a year or so after the earthquake than it had before last month. The nation owes much of that rosy prognosis to the fiscal management of the past two moderate leftist governments, which have given the new president, Sebastian Pinera, palatable options for financing reconstruction, which is expected to exceed $30 billion.
Former President Michelle Bachelet's government hewed to a program of automatic savings during the boom years for global commodities, including copper. The program, along with prudent investment of the savings abroad, allowed two sovereign funds to amass more than $14 billion, money that can now be tapped for reconstruction.
"You save for a rainy day, and this is a rainy day," Andres Velasco, then Chile's finance minister, said last Monday in an interview.
Chile also has a barely negative inflation and an enviable public debt of 6 percent of gross domestic product, among the lowest in the world, that would allow the country to borrow in foreign markets at very low interest rates.
"There are investors throughout the world that would be willing to add Chilean debt to their portfolios," Dr. Edwards said.
Most economists see Chile's economy losing about a half a percentage point to growth projections of about 5 percent this year. But by next year, projects to rebuild bridges and highways, and homes damaged and destroyed by the quake, could end up accelerating growth to even higher levels, said Eduardo Engel, an economist at Yale University.
Mr. Velasco said the government's main focus, for now, needed to be on building temporary housing to replace tens of thousands of dwellings that were badly damaged or destroyed by the quake and tsunami. In Talcahuano alone, city officials said that 106,000 people were left homeless.
Rebuilding local economies will require more creativity, said Mr. Jordan of the Foundation for Overcoming Poverty. "There needs to be a master plan for reinvesting subsidies into the local economy, to bring back tourism, to rebuild the economic cycle," he said.
Talcahuano, which means "thundering sky" in the indigenous Mapuche language, has been home to hardy sailors and fishermen for more than 200 years. But residents said Talcahuano had never experienced a wave like the seven-footer that swept over the city in early on Feb. 27.
Three people drowned along the coast, with two more still missing, Captain Ortiz said. A total of eight people died in the area, the government says.
In a seaside section of the city, residents worked earlier this month to clean up the mess. Luis Alberto Ayala, who works in a fish cannery, toured warehouses filled with thousands of tons of canned mackerel bound for export, including to the United States. Workers walked through piles of bent and rusted cans, seeing which ones could be saved.
Nearby, Marcelo Alvear, a fisherman and the nephew of Alfonso Alvear, pondered the future.
"Many of us need to work during the season to earn money to pay for school supplies for our children," said Mr. Alvear, 39. "But we can't generate anything this year. If we don't work, how are we going to take care of our children?"
His uncle shook his head.
"Right now we don't have a plan for how we are going to make a living," said the elder Mr. Alvear. "All we have is uncertainty."

Abstract: With China's exports soaring, even as other major economies struggle to recover from the recession, evidence is mounting that Beijing is skillfully using inconsistencies in international trade rules to spur its own economy at the expense of others, including the United States. To maximize its advantage, Beijing is exploiting a fundamental difference between two major international bodies: the World Trade Organization, which wields strict, enforceable penalties for countries that impede trade, and the International Monetary Fund, which acts as a kind of watchdog for global economic policy but has no power over countries like China that do not borrow money from it.

Full text: HONG KONG -- With China's exports soaring, even as other major economies struggle to recover from the recession, evidence is mounting that Beijing is skillfully using inconsistencies in international trade rules to spur its own economy at the expense of others, including the United States.
Seeking to maintain its export dominance, China is engaged in a two-pronged effort: fighting protectionism among its trade partners and holding down the value of its currency.
China vigorously defends its economic policies. On Sunday, Premier Wen Jiabao criticized international pressure on China to let the currency appreciate, calling it "finger pointing." He said that the renminbi, China's currency, would be kept "basically stable."
To maximize its advantage, Beijing is exploiting a fundamental difference between two major international bodies: the World Trade Organization, which wields strict, enforceable penalties for countries that impede trade, and the International Monetary Fund, which acts as a kind of watchdog for global economic policy but has no power over countries like China that do not borrow money from it.
China had a $198 billion trade surplus with the rest of the world last year, with its exports to the United States outpacing imports by more than four to one. Despite that, in the last 12 months, Beijing has filed more cases with the W.T.O.'s powerful trade tribunals in Geneva than any other country complaining about another's trade practices.
In addition, Beijing has worked to suppress a series of I.M.F. reports since 2007 documenting how the country has substantially undervalued its currency, the renminbi, said three people with detailed knowledge of China's actions.
China buys dollars and other foreign currencies -- worth several hundred billion dollars a year -- by selling more of its own currency, which then depresses its value. That intervention helped Chinese exports to surge 46 percent in February compared with a year earlier.
Many prominent academic economists see a basic contradiction in the global system of oversight on trade and currency.
"Many of us would like to see the W.T.O.-style commitments -- with people's feet being held to the fire -- at other international agencies, like the I.M.F.," said Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia University economist.
Western countries hoped last year to bring international pressure to bear on China, after years of complaining that Beijing keeps the renminbi artificially low.
An undervalued currency keeps a country's exports inexpensive in foreign markets while making imports expensive. That makes a trade surplus more likely, reducing unemployment for that country while increasing unemployment in its trading partners.
Last September, President Obama, President Hu Jintao of China and other leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing countries agreed in Pittsburgh that all the G-20 countries would begin sharing their economic plans by November. The goal was to coordinate their exits from stimulus programs and prevent the world from lurching from recession straight into inflation.
The G-20 leaders agreed that the I.M.F. would act as intermediary.
But two people familiar with China's response said that the Chinese government missed the November deadline and then submitted a vague document containing mostly historical data. These people said that China feared giving ammunition to critics of its currency policies at the monetary fund and beyond. Both people asked for anonymity because of China's attitudes about its economic policies.
If China is found to be manipulating its currency, it could be a political and economic challenge for the Obama administration. President Obama called on Thursday for China to introduce "a more market-oriented exchange rate." China's defiant response keeps the administration in a difficult position.
China is the biggest buyer of Treasury bonds at a time when the United States has record budget deficits and needs China to keep buying those bonds to finance American debt. But the Treasury also faces an April 15 deadline for whether or not to list China as a country that manipulates the value of its currency.
If China is listed, that could embolden members of Congress who are already discussing whether to seek restrictions on Chinese exports to the United States. China would certainly criticize such retaliation as protectionism, leading to a broader deterioration in already strained bilateral relations.
China is starting to describe its currency interventions as stimulus. But unlike extra government spending in the United States and other countries, currency intervention does not expand global demand, but shifts it from other countries to China.
Two closely related scourges played a central role in the collapse of world trade in the 1930s: protectionism and beggar-thy-neighbor currency devaluations. World leaders set up two institutions after World War II, now known as the W.T.O. and the I.M.F., to reduce the risk of another Great Depression.
Unlike its predecessor, which had weak arbitration panels whose rulings could be easily blocked by the losing country, the trade organization has had powerful tribunals since 1995. These tribunals can clear the way for the imposition of sanctions running into the billions of dollars.
Filing a case against another country is the heaviest artillery available to countries in trade disputes. But it also is expensive. Preparing a case and pushing it through a tribunal can easily require millions of dollars in legal expenses, and low-income countries seldom file them.
China joined the W.T.O. in 2001 and in its first seven years filed only three cases. But it has stepped up its pace recently, and has filed four of the 15 cases in the last year: two against the United States, on poultry and tires, and two against the European Union, on steel fasteners and poultry.
The monetary fund has not acquired similar powers to the trade organization.
I.M.F. policies call for it to disclose documents and information on a timely basis, with the deletion only of market-moving information. But under the rules a member country may decide to withhold a report, an organization official said.
China allowed the release of its reports until the monetary fund's executive board decided in June 2007 that reports should pay more attention to currency policies. China has quietly blocked release of reports on its policies ever since, without providing its specific reasons to the I.M.F.
A person who has seen copies of the most recent report last summer said that the monetary fund staff concluded the renminbi was "substantially undervalued."
The monetary fund regards a currency as substantially undervalued if it is more than 20 percent below its fair market value.
More than four-fifths of the I.M.F.'s members allow publication of the agency's annual staff reports on their economies. Countries blocking release are mostly tightly controlled places like Myanmar, Sudan, Turkmenistan and Saudi Arabia, although Brazil has also not released its reports.
China's central bank did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment.
The main indicator of a country's intervention in currency markets is its level of foreign reserves. China halted the gradual appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar in July 2008; from June 30, 2008, through Dec. 31 of last year, China's foreign exchange reserves rose by $590 billion. A small part of the increase reflected interest on bonds, the appreciation of stocks and currency fluctuations.

Full text: BEIJING -- Prime Minister Wen Jiabao sharply defended China's currency and trade policies on Sunday against what he called foreign "finger pointing," charging instead that developed countries seek to force unfair changes in those policies "just for the purposes of increasing their own exports."
Mr. Wen's remarks, which echoed a rebuke on Thursday by one of China's central bankers, were perhaps the sharpest yet in a brewing disagreement between the Chinese and American governments over their economic positions.
In a news conference that lasted more than two hours at the close of China's annual legislative session, Mr. Wen repeated that China would keep its currency, the renminbi, "basically stable" despite calls by the United States and other developed nations to let its value increase.
He also repeated the concerns he voiced a year ago, at China's past legislative session, that the United States was failing to rebuild its own economy and maintain the value of the dollar, which has fluctuated since the global economic crisis began in late 2008. Protecting the dollar is a matter of "national credibility," Mr. Wen said.
"Any fluctuation in the value of the U.S. currency is a big concern for us," he said. "I hope the United States will take concrete steps to reassure investors. It is not only in the interests of the investors but also the United States itself."
Chinese leaders fear that the vast budget deficits in the United States will lead to inflation that effectively devalues the dollar, and thus the value of China's vast foreign-currency reserves. Those reserves exceeded $2.4 trillion at the end of 2009, nearly $900 billion of that in dollar-denominated Treasury securities.
Mr. Wen's most pointed remarks, however, were aimed at critics of China's economic policies, led by the United States. Those critics accuse China of keeping the value of its currency artificially low, so that its exports will remain cheap compared with other nations' products. That bolsters China's economy, but at the expense of other trading partners, they say.
China has pegged the renminbi to the dollar. Were it to let the market judge the renminbi's value, critics say, the currency -- and the cost of Chinese products -- would rise.
In Sunday's news conference, Mr. Wen bluntly rejected that view. Instead, in remarks that seemed aimed at the United States, he accused unnamed competitors of trying to bail out their own slumping economies by hamstringing China.
"I understand some economies want to increase their exports," he said, "but what I don't understand is the practice of depreciating one's own currency and attempting to force other countries to appreciate their own currencies, just for the purpose of increasing their own exports."
That amounts to trade protectionism, he said, and "all countries should be fully alarmed by such developments."
Some economic analysts were struck by the comments.
"I think it's my first time hearing government officials saying that," Shen Minggao, the chief China economist for Citibank in Hong Kong, said in a telephone interview. "Basically, Premier Wen said it's a kind of protectionism to ask other countries to appreciate their currency and depreciate their own currency. In that sense, it's a new understanding of currency policies."
Mr. Wen argued that the renminbi is not unfairly valued.
One leading Chinese economist, Bai Chong-en of Tsinghua University in Beijing, said in an interview on Sunday that for a broad range of technical reasons, he did not believe that the renminbi was seriously undervalued. But he also suggested that Western exhortations to revalue the currency were having the opposite effect.
"The greater the outside pressure, the more difficult it is for the Chinese government to raise the exchange rate, and the more difficult it is for the Chinese people to accept a revaluation of the Chinese currency," he said. "People don't like to be forced to change things."
In a wide-ranging news conference that drew on both Chinese and foreign questioners, Mr. Wen repeated some basic government positions -- China is an underdeveloped nation that will need a century or more to reach advanced status, he said -- and a few new ones.
Addressing a chorus of complaints by foreign investors, he said China would "put in place institutional arrangements to level the playing ground" for foreign companies in China, and he promised to meet personally with foreign business leaders during his final years in office. Some of China's economic stimulus measures, like subsidizing purchases of new automobiles and home appliances, applied to products by foreign manufacturers as well as domestic ones, he said.
He also said that he had been excluded from a crucial meeting of world leaders at last year's Copenhagen conference on climate change and had not deliberately skipped the meeting, as some at the conference charged. Mr. Wen's absence from that session, which was attended by President Obama and other leaders, has been mentioned by critics as a symbol of China's intransigence on the climate.

Abstract: Conceived in its broadest form, managed care can be run by the government, as in Britain, or left in the hands of a regulated private sector. Because the United States already has substantial private-sector capacity, and because many Americans are suspicious of government controls, the private route is the most likely option.

Full text: WE may soon know whether Congress will approve some version of President Obama's health care plan. No matter what the outcome, there will be an unacknowledged monster lurking in the room: managed care.
The concept embodies many modes of delivering medicine, ranging from the nightmarish bureaucratic encounter to the highly professional clinic. Some forms of managed care -- health maintenance organizations like Kaiser Permanente, for example -- have been accepted by broad segments of the population.
But the obvious downside of managed care is that a provider may be stingy with service and access, precisely because "fee for service" treatment is limited. In the 1990s, many patients rebelled, objecting to bureaucratic decision-making and long delays for "optional" services. To this day, managed care is criticized in many circles.
It is still with us, however, and its role is certain to grow. The fundamental appeal is financial. All managed care plans have a built-in incentive to limit costs, because more treatments do not automatically mean more revenue for health providers. Today, many cost-control methods, such as integrated and electronic medical records, are already common in H.M.O.'s. During managed care's heyday in the early 1990s, inflation in health care costs was much lower than it is now.
We may not like it, but third parties -- the government and insurance companies -- won't be able to pay for all the care that people desire. Yet the aging of the population will ensure that medical costs will spiral. Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, has said that the administration's cost-control proposals do not "reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount."
We need to think carefully about how to say no without breaking the better side of our health care institutions. For all the complaints, managed care does not seem to hurt actual health care outcomes, whether pertaining to life expectancy or recovery from disease, according to a series of papers by David Cutler, an economics professor at Harvard, and co-authors.
It's time to consider which forms of managed care -- relabeled, if necessary -- are likely to maintain the flow of innovation while keeping costs under control.
For all of managed care's problems, national bankruptcy would be considerably worse, and that's where we're heading if we don't rein in health costs. We are already experiencing some preliminary symptoms. In addition to the financial burden of Medicare and Medicaid, rising insurance premiums in employer-provided plans are absorbing a large share of what might otherwise be wage increases. That makes us poorer and keeps us from buying safer cars, eating healthier food and investing as productively as we can. Health gains that accompany prosperity are largely invisible, so we tend to neglect them.
Conceived in its broadest form, managed care can be run by the government, as in Britain, or left in the hands of a regulated private sector. Because the United States already has substantial private-sector capacity, and because many Americans are suspicious of government controls, the private route is the most likely option. Individuals would choose among competing providers -- and those providers would try to offer the most appealing bundles of services, relative to cost.
The current tax exemption for health insurance benefits could be modified to encourage more cost-effective delivery systems, including forms of managed care that meet quality standards. For the elderly, the current Medicare fee-for-service method could be transformed into voucher programs for managed care treatment. Of course, people could go outside their network for additional services, if they were willing to pay.
It's not well advertised, but the Obama plan would move in this direction. Many people receiving new health insurance coverage would be enrolled in Medicaid, which already relies on managed care for about half of its patients.
On a national scale, effective managed care will require the right mix of reputation and regulation to enforce provider commitments, and will need some reframing and renaming to make it palatable. It could accurately be called "competitive, choice-based single-payer coverage." Perhaps there will be a jazzier, less foreboding name.
The notion of using the market to experiment with cost-control methods isn't likely to be wildly popular. Still, it is better than relying on the federal government. It's far from obvious that Congress, inflexible and besieged by lobbyists, will make better decisions. Congress also tends to promise cost control up front but to postpone significant action indefinitely. Nor is it clear that electing politicians to choose a plan for people collectively is better than letting each person choose a plan directly.
ON the other hand, for reasons of perceived fairness, some people may be more willing to accept a "no" answer on health care from a government agency than from a private company. If so, we run the risk of limiting our care choices just because we're more squeamish about one kind of "no" than another.
The real challenge is to change our fundamental attitude toward health care. We live in a world where we can spend virtually everything we have on more and better treatment. The question is not managed care versus the status quo, but which opportunities -- and the restrictions that go with them -- we are prepared to accept.
When will we acknowledge that our government -- or, for that matter, our insurance companies -- can't pay every bill? We're in denial, and the longer we wait, the more painful the solution will be.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration has settled on Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, to serve as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, a senior administration official said on Thursday night.
Ms. Yellen, 63, who was chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and a member of the Fed's Board of Governors in the Clinton administration, was widely considered to be the front-runner for the position. She would succeed Donald L. Kohn, who intends to retire when his four-year term expires in June.
Ms. Yellen is viewed by some economists as relatively more inclined to keep interest rates low to stimulate economic growth and reduce the high rate of joblessness. The Fed now faces a tricky balancing act of trying to nudge rates up from historic lows while not choking off a recovery.
Top officials, including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, were still in conversations with Ms. Yellen about the position, according to the administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the search was to be conducted in confidence.
Reached at home on Thursday night, Ms. Yellen declined to comment.
If Ms. Yellen was offered the position and accepted, her salary would be less than half that of her compensation at the San Francisco Fed.
But she would be returning to the Fed headquarters at a crucial time for the institution, which faces the task of stimulating economic recovery without igniting inflation after having lowered interest rates to historic lows and injected billions of dollars into the economy in recent years in response to the financial crisis and the recession.
Mr. Obama renominated the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to a second four-year term last year, and Mr. Bernanke was confirmed by the Senate in January, but only after a divisive debate that included criticism of the Fed for failing to adequately oversee banks and anticipate the crisis.
Ms. Yellen, a Brooklyn native who received her Ph.D. in economics at Yale, has taught in the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, since 1980. She has published widely on a variety of macroeconomic topics and is an authority on unemployment.
Among her publications is a 2001 book, "The Fabulous Decade: Macroeconomic Lessons from the 1990s," written with Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed.
Ms. Yellen's husband, George A. Akerlof, is a Nobel Prize-winning economist who also teaches at Berkeley.
Mr. Obama has named one other Fed governor, Daniel K. Tarullo, who took office in January 2009. Two other seats on the Fed's seven-member board also need to be filled.

Abstract: House Democrats predicted that packaging the two proposals in an expedited budget reconciliation bill would help them secure the needed votes on health care because the financial aid bill is popular. Officials said they could reduce the spending in the education bill by tying annual increases in Pell grants to the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, rather than to the consumer price index plus 1 percent, as set forth in the House bill.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Democratic Congressional leaders struck a tentative agreement on Thursday that breathes new life into President Obama's proposed overhaul of federal student loan programs.
The deal would bundle the bill into an expedited budget package along with the Democratic health care legislation, which would allow for both measures to be passed by the Senate on a simple majority vote. Without the deal, the student loan bill would have been unlikely to pass because it lacked the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.
The bill would end government payments to private, commercial student lenders, leaving the government to lend directly to students. It would also redirect billions of dollars to expand the Pell grant program for low-income students, and to pay for other education initiatives.
The maximum Pell grant is set to rise to $5,550 for the 2010-11 school year and, under the deal struck Thursday, would increase automatically each year in line with inflation. As many as eight million of the nation's lowest-income students receive Pell grants to help pay for college each year. Under current law, Congress must determine any increases.
"Families and students who rely on federal student aid need to know that Congress sides with them and not with the big banks," Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Education Committee, said at a news conference on Thursday. "The federal government has been subsidizing these banks and wasting taxpayer money for far too long. It's time to end it."
Private banks had lobbied fiercely against the bill, which would cut off a longtime stream of revenue. Even on Thursday, lobbyists for the private lenders made a last-ditch effort to stop Democrats from adding it to the budget package.
House Democrats predicted that packaging the two proposals in an expedited budget reconciliation bill would help them secure the needed votes on health care because the financial aid bill is popular. In September, the House adopted that bill, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, by a vote of 253 to 171.
Senate Democrats said that they could lose some votes as a result of the packaging, but that they did not believe it would swing the outcome. Senate Democrats nominally control 59 votes, and need only 50 to approve the reconciliation measure, because Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would break a tie.
Some Democrats in the Senate, where the private student loan industry has strong allies, had resisted tying the two bills together. But federal education officials warned on Thursday that if Congress failed to act, millions of students might see their Pell grants cut by 60 percent.
Democrats said that in a caucus meeting Thursday, Mr. Harkin made a compelling case for moving more quickly on the education measure and that other senators had voiced agreement, outweighing doubts raised in particular by Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee.
Aides to Mr. Conrad said he was open to packaging the two bills, provided that House Democrats agreed to meet budget reconciliation rules by adjusting the education measure to account for a revised cost analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.
The House-passed bill had anticipated savings of $87 billion by eliminating payments to private lenders, and would have redirected that money to Pell grants and other education programs.
But in recent months, more colleges have joined the government's direct lending program, in anticipation of the change, generating the savings up front and reducing the amount of revenue that would be available for new spending to about $67 billion.
"The Treasury is winning every day that somebody takes out a direct loan," said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California and chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. "The concept is already driving savings to the government."
At the same time, a rise in the number of people attending college and seeking aid in the weak economy has raised the projected cost of new Pell grants to $54 billion from $40 billion.
Officials said they could reduce the spending in the education bill by tying annual increases in Pell grants to the consumer price index, a measure of inflation, rather than to the consumer price index plus 1 percent, as set forth in the House bill.
Mr. Harkin and Mr. Miller said on Thursday that if the financial aid measure was not tied to health care, it might collapse.
Six Democrat senators had written a letter to the majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, expressing doubts about the education proposal. And given Republican opposition, the bill was unlikely to win the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.
The decision by Democrats to package the two bills creates tough choices for some lawmakers. Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, for instance, has reason to vote for the health care bill in part to undo a special provision that Senate leaders included giving Nebraska extra federal Medicaid money.
That provision, derided by Republicans as the "Cornhusker kickback," has become a political liability for Mr. Nelson. But Nebraska is also home to some major private student lenders, and he will be hard-pressed to vote in favor of a package that ends their lucrative business originating federal student loans.

S.& P. 500 Tiptoes Past Its Peak In January to Set 17-Month High

Full text: A rally in financial stocks Thursday helped the market extend its gains for a third day.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index cleared an important hurdle watched by traders when it closed just above its January peak to set a 17-month high. That could bring some hesitant buyers into the market.
Financial shares rose after Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, said the bank was on a path toward "sustained profitability" as it sold off risky assets. The bank has been the hardest hit by the financial crisis, so the upbeat assessment helped raise expectations about the economy. The stock rose 5.6 percent.
The climb in financial stocks helped offset concern about a spike in inflation in China. The country said its inflation rate rose to 2.7 percent in February, from 1.5 percent in January. A steep rise in prices could force China to raise interest rates. That, in turn, could slow one of the world's fastest-growing economies and put a damper on a global recovery.
Jim Dunigan, managing executive of investments at PNC Wealth Management, said he expected that China would be able to contain prices for now.
"We'll see hints of inflation here and there, but I don't think we'll see that problem for a while," he said.
In the United States, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing for jobless benefits fell by 6,000 last week, to 462,000. Economists were predicting a slightly bigger decline, according to Thomson Reuters.
The report showed some improvement in the labor market but failed to indicate the increase in hiring that investors wanted to see. Stocks have traded in a narrow range since the Labor Department report on Friday. The market is looking for more signs of progress.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 44.51 points, or 0.42 percent, to 10,611.84. It is down 1.1 percent from its recent high on Jan. 19.
The S.& P. 500 index advanced 4.63 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,150.24, above its Jan. 19 close of 1,150.23. The index now stands at its highest level since Oct. 1, 2008.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.51 points, also 0.40 percent, to 2,368.46 for its sixth consecutive advance.
Bond prices were little changed. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 99 5/32, and the yield was unchanged at 3.73 percent.
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.
Crude oil rose 2 cents to settle at $82.11 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
David Joy, chief market strategist at RiverSource Investments, said he was impressed that traders shrugged off the increase in China's inflation in a week with few economic reports.
"The concept of an economic recovery is garnering a little more credibility," he said. "We've arrived at a place where stocks are fairly valued."
The close above the January high by the S.& P. 500 index could give some of the investors sitting out of the market new incentive to pump money into stocks. The market slipped Monday and inched higher Tuesday and Wednesday. Volume has been light, a sign that traders have limited faith in the market's recent gains.
Corporate deal-making continued. The oil company BP agreed to pay $7 billion to buy exploration rights from Devon Energy. BP will acquire rights to explore in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caspian Sea.
Increased mergers and acquisitions in recent weeks have been a welcome sign that corporate leaders believe the economy is getting stronger.
Citigroup rose 22 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $4.18 a share. It was a year ago this week, on March 10, 2009, that the Dow and the S.& P. 500 index began to pull off of 1-year lows after Citigroup said it had been making money.
Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX index slipped 0.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.4 percent.

Time to Celebrate? Not in a Big Way

Full text: Anniversaries are a good time to reminisce. The global stock market rally is now a year old -- the lows were hit on March 9, 2009 -- and that certainly brings back memories. It's easy to see why the MSCI World Index has surged 71 percent in that period.
Then, there was a steep recession; now there is economic growth. Then, it was realistic to worry about such horrors as rapid deflation, serial banking crises and a competitive protectionism. Now, all of those menaces have now receded. And stock market investors are heartened to see companies in enough control of their short-term destiny that most of them are meeting or beating analysts' expectations of reported profits.
But this celebration is no better than bittersweet. The stock market rally has sputtered somewhat. Although the commodity-heavy FTSE 100 index in Britain is hitting new highs, most other major indexes in the world have made almost no progress for five months. That stalling reflects both an unexpectedly tepid economic recovery and serious worries about whether there will be much to celebrate in the future.
Too many of the wounds of the financial crisis remain unhealed. Central banks are still extraordinarily generous, and unemployment rates are unacceptably high. The world is too leveraged for its own good. And while the financial system is no longer in crisis, its newfound ebullience is itself a cause for worry.
The new talk of inflation is a sign of how far from health markets are. Stock markets are ultimately good hedges against rising prices, but investors feel queasy when economists at serious institutions like the International Monetary Fund, Morgan Stanley and Societe Generale see high inflation as either the most likely or the least bad way to erode excessive leverage.
Historically, a great 12 months in the stock market has usually been followed by a mediocre period -- an average 3 percent decline since 1940 in the United States, according to Deutsche Bank. Stock markets are still well below their peak levels, but there may not be much to celebrate this time next year.
Good Idea for Europe
The proposed creation of a European Monetary Fund faces tough political obstacles. But if the relevant treaties can be amended or skirted, such an organization could effectively address the euro zone's central problem: a lack of fiscal policy coordination.
When the euro was introduced, commentators pointed out that the criteria for fiscal policy set up by the Maastricht Treaty were too weak to ensure proper coordination, leaving profligate countries free to endanger the system. Skeptics predicted either doom or an unacceptable surrender of sovereignty to a central fiscal authority.
A decade on, the fears look partly justified. The common monetary policy exerts the least discipline on free-spending governments that need discipline most, while language and other barriers keep workers from migrating and earning wages in countries where they have risen excessively.
A properly constructed European Monetary Fund can't make Germans move to Greece, but it could help resolve the fiscal problems. Like the International Monetary Fund, it would provide a healthy discipline on euro zone countries that get themselves into trouble. Most important would be conditions placed on loans: money goes only to countries that deliver draconian public sector cuts, pension and health care restrictions and overall wage cuts.
Politicians in countries receiving loans know bitter cures are required, but they face tremendous resistance from voters. So politicians are tempted to lobby peers for softer treatment. But a fund run by stern central bankers could afford to be hated. Potential client countries would do everything possible to avoid it, which would be good for everyone.
While Britain is unlikely to be a founding member, a fund should take a British model -- the Bank of England under the leadership of Montagu Norman. In 1931, he forced the formation of the fiscally responsible National Government before leaving the gold standard.
Mr. Norman was reviled, but Britain avoided the worst of the Great Depression and enjoyed rapid economic growth thereafter.
The closest present day equivalent to Mr. Norman might be Otmar Issing. He's the former chief economist of the European Central Bank currently advising Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany against a weak-willed bailout of Greece.

Abstract: For the first time, the central bank will have two tools -- its huge balance sheet and short-term interest rate -- when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, and it will have to use untested tools to drain the large sum of bank reserves being held at the Fed.

Full text: ARLINGTON, Va. -- The Federal Reserve has terminated nearly all of the extraordinary lending programs it created in 2007 and 2008 to combat the credit crisis. But it now faces critical decisions in coming months about when and how to tighten monetary policy, according to two Fed officials.
The officials -- Brian P. Sack, the executive vice president who oversees the trading desk at Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Charles L. Evans, president of the Chicago Fed -- spoke this week at an economic policy conference here sponsored by the National Association for Business Economics.
Neither challenged the position that the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other members of the Fed's policy-setting panel have stated for months: that the central bank would keep short-term interest rates "exceptionally low" for "an extended period."
The policy-setting panel, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet next Tuesday, and is widely expected to reiterate that language. Mr. Evans told reporters on Tuesday that he interpreted an "extended period" to mean at least six months.
Mr. Evans said the Fed funds rate, which has been held near zero since December 2008, should stay there "for some time," because the Fed did not have the usual tension between its two mandates of maintaining price stability while promoting maximum sustainable employment.
"When I became Chicago Fed president in 2007, I never would have guessed that my first two and a half years would have me voting continually for lower interest rates and more policy accommodation," Mr. Evans said. "But with the unemployment rate at 9.7 percent and inflation significantly under my benchmark for price stability, there is no conflict between our policy goals, and so the directions for policy have been clear."
Mr. Evans, drawing on research by economists at the Chicago Fed, said the labor market was distinctive in two ways. When compared with past recessions, a greater share of adults is outside the labor force in the current downturn and the average spell of unemployment is longer, he said.
Economists inside the Fed have been debating the significance of those two trends. Some believe they may reflect "broader, structural changes in the economy," like a long-term mismatch between the skills of the unemployed and those demanded by employers, Mr. Evans said.
Under that view, there is less slack, or unused productive capacity, than existing models would predict. That would have implications on when and how the Fed moves to tighten the supply of credit in the economy.
Mr. Evans suggested that the debate, while significant, did not have immediate implications for policy. "The debate really boils down to whether the amount of slack in the economy is large or is extremely large," he said.
On Monday, meanwhile, the Fed held its final auction through the Term Auction Facility, which was created in December 2007 to offer banks short-term loans against a wide range of collateral. A total of 53 bidders submitted propositions for $3.41 billion in credit, and all the offers were accepted, the New York Fed announced on Tuesday.
Mr. Sack said the auction brought to an end the short-term liquidity programs the Fed established during the financial crisis. (He said that he was not counting one remaining program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, created in November 2008, because it provides money for up to five years. The Fed will stop making loans under that program in June.)
At their peak, the special lending programs provided more than $1.5 trillion in credit to the economy; today the remaining balance is $20 billion.
Mr. Sack said the Fed faced a tremendous challenge. For the first time, the central bank will have two tools -- its huge balance sheet and short-term interest rate -- when it comes time to tighten monetary policy, and it will have to use untested tools to drain the large sum of bank reserves being held at the Fed.
The Fed has already bought $300 billion in Treasury securities as well as $169 billion in debts (out of an authorized total of $175 billion) guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. It is $30 billion away from hitting its goal of buying $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, a process ending this month.
The asset purchases helped hold down long-term interest rates, and Mr. Sack said that the Fed would be looking to shrink its balance sheet "in a gradual and passive manner."
Similarly, the Fed will use the interest rate it pays on excess reserves, along with two other new tools, to begin draining the reserves it created to buy those assets. Echoing a strategy outlined by Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Sack said the Fed might drain reserves on a trial run before increasing the interest rate on excess reserves.
Only later, with the tightening under way and with an economic recovery firmly established, would the Fed start to sell the assets, he said.

Full text: Many Americans rely on six-days-a-week mail delivery and expect to have a post office just around the corner. But if the United States Postal Service is going to survive the transition to the Internet age -- without requiring billions of dollars of federal subsidies -- Congress must allow it to cut some services, close some offices and make other sensible changes.
Since 1970, the Postal Service has been required to pay its own costs. Still, Congress has insisted on the right to make many policy decisions. The Postal Service made a profit until 2006. Since then, declining mail volumes -- as more Americans use e-mail and pay their bills online -- and the demands of its retiree health benefit system have dragged it deeper and deeper into the red. Last year, it delivered 17 percent fewer pieces of mail than in 2006 and reported losses of $1.4 billion, this year it expects to lose $7 billion. Postmaster General John Potter warns that unless the service takes major steps to bring its costs into line, it will lose $238 billion over the next 10 years. To avoid insolvency -- or falling back into the taxpayers' lap -- he is asking Congress for the flexibility to implement an ambitious plan to reconfigure services and cut costs.
Not every idea is sound, and Congress should retain oversight to ensure that all Americans still have reliable mail delivery. But Congress should grant the service most of the authority it requests.
Mr. Potter estimates that ending mail delivery on Saturday -- when the volume is 17 percent lower than on weekdays -- would save $40 billion over the next decade. He wants to close some yet-to-be-announced number of post offices and replace them with cheaper alternatives, such as automated kiosks and postal windows at supermarkets and other retailers. He is also asking for more flexibility to raise the rates of some services to meet changes in demand and costs.
These seem reasonable compromises considering the magnitude of the challenge. They have to be done the right way. Post offices should not be closed in rural areas and other hard-to-reach places that do not have alternatives. The Postal Service also must work with other government agencies to ensure that people who receive crucial mail -- such as Social Security checks -- on Saturday, receive it on Friday rather than on Monday.
The service says these proposed changes, dramatic as they are, would still fill only part of the gap. Mr. Potter believes it can find other savings and new profits by expanding product offerings -- like new direct-mail products for small businesses -- and cutting labor costs, including by hiring more part-time workers and reducing full-time employees through attrition. Some 300,000 postal workers are expected to retire over the next decade -- about half the Postal Service's entire staff.
Some of the proposed changes are flawed. Mr. Potter is hoping to save another $50 billion over the next decade by stopping contributions to a fund to pay for future retiree health benefits, covering them instead on a pay-as-you-go basis. As many workers have discovered, unfinanced promises of future benefits have a troubling tendency to become worthless in times of economic stress.
Still, the service might be allowed to reduce its annual contribution. Right now, by law, it has to make contributions consistent with a 7 percent annual rate of inflation for health care costs, while Medicare uses a rate of 5 percent to 6 percent to project future benefits.
Even with the Internet, Americans will need mail services for packages, legal documents and, yes, letters for years to come. In some areas of the country, the Postal Service is the only service available. And all Americans should not have to rely solely on private businesses for anything as fundamental as mail delivery.
That means that Congress has a straightforward choice: It can give the Postal Service some more flexibility to run like a business. Or it can start subsidizing it to the tune of $10 billion-plus a year. We vote for flexibility.

Full text: States and companies have started investing very differently when it comes to the billions of dollars they are safeguarding for workers' retirement.
Companies are quietly and gradually moving their pension funds out of stocks. They want to reduce their investment risk and are buying more long-term bonds.
But states and other bodies of government are seeking higher returns for their pension funds, to make up for ground lost in the last couple of years and to pay all the benefits promised to present and future retirees. Higher returns come with more risk.
"In effect, they're going to Las Vegas," said Frederick E. Rowe, a Dallas investor and the former chairman of the Texas Pension Review Board, which oversees public plans in that state. "Double up to catch up."
Though they generally say that their strategies are aimed at diversification and are not riskier, public pension funds are trying a wide range of investments: commodity futures, junk bonds, foreign stocks, deeply discounted mortgage-backed securities and margin investing. And some states that previously shunned hedge funds are trying them now.
The Texas teachers' pension fund recently paid Chicago to receive a stream of payments from the money going into the city's parking meters in the coming years. The deal gave Chicago an upfront payment that it could use to help balance its budget. Alas, Chicago did not have enough money to contribute to its own pension fund, which has been stung by real estate deals that fizzled when the city lost out in the bidding for the 2016 Olympics.
A spokeswoman for the Texas teachers' fund said plan administrators believed that such alternative investments were the likeliest way to earn 8 percent average annual returns over time.
Pension funds rarely trumpet their intentions, partly to keep other big investors from trading against them. But some big corporations are unloading the stocks that have dominated pension portfolios for decades. General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, J. C. Penney, Boeing, Federal Express and Ashland are among those that have been shifting significant amounts of pension money out of stocks.
Other companies say they plan to follow suit, though more slowly. A poll of pension funds conducted by Pyramis Global Advisors last November found that more than half of corporate funds were reducing the portion they invested in United States equities.
Laggards tend to be companies with big shortfalls in their pension funds. Those moving the fastest are often mature companies with large pension funds, and who fear a big bear market could decimate the funds and the companies' own finances.
"The larger the pension plan, the lower-risk strategy you would like to employ," said Andrew T. Ward, the chief investment officer of Boeing, which shifted a big block of pension money out of stocks in 2007. That helped cushion Boeing's pension fund against the big losses of 2008.
Shedding stocks gave Boeing "material protection right when we needed it most," Mr. Ward said. By the time the markets had bottomed out last March, Boeing's pension fund had lost 14 percent of its value, while those of its equity-laden peers had lost 25 to 30 percent, he said.
"We estimated that the strategy saved our company in the short term right around $4 or $5 billion of funded status," he said.
Boeing and other companies seeking to reduce their investment risk are moving into fixed-income instruments, like bonds -- but not just any bonds. They are buying and holding bonds scheduled to pay many years in the future, when their retirees expect their money.
The value of the bonds may fall in the meantime, just like the value of stocks. But declining bond prices are not such a worry, because the companies plan to hold the bonds for the accompanying interest payments that will in turn go to retirees, not sell them in the interim.
Towers Watson, a big benefits consulting firm, surveyed senior financial executives last year and found that two-thirds planned to decrease the stock portion of their companies' pension funds by the end of 2010. They typically said their stock allocations would shrink by 10 percentage points.
"That's 10 times the shift we might see in any given year," said Carl Hess, head of Towers Watson's investment consulting business. Economists have speculated that a truly seismic shift in pension investing away from stocks could be a drag on the market, but they say it would not be long-lasting.
Corporate America's change of heart is notable all on its own, after decades of resistance to anything other than returns like those of the stock markets. But it's even more startling when compared with governments' continued loyalty to stocks. When governments scale back on the domestic stocks in their pension portfolios these days, it is often just to make way for more foreign stocks or private equities, which are not publicly traded.
Government pension plans cannot beef up their bonds that mature many, many years from now without dashing their business models. They use long-range estimates that presume high investment returns will cover most of the cost of the benefits they must pay. And that, they say, allows them to make smaller contributions along the way.
Most have been assuming their investments will pay 8 percent a year on average, over the long term. This is based on an assumption that stocks will pay 9.5 percent on average, and bonds will pay about 5.75 percent, in roughly a 60-40 mix.
(Corporate plans do their calculations differently, and for them, investment returns are a less important factor.)
The problem now is that bond rates have been low for years, and stocks have been prone to such wild swings that a 60-40 mixture of stocks and bonds is not paying 8 percent. Many public pension funds have been averaging a little more than 3 percent a year for the last decade, so they have fallen behind where their planning models say they should be.
A growing number of experts say that governments need to lower the assumptions they make about rates of return, to reflect today's market conditions.
But plan officials say they cannot.
"Nobody wants to adjust the rate, because liabilities would explode," said Trent May, chief investment officer of Wyoming's state pension fund.
The $30 billion Colorado state pension fund is one of a tiny number of government plans to disclose how much difference even a slight change in its projected rate of return could make. Colorado has been assuming its investments will earn 8.5 percent annually, on average, and on that basis it reported a $17.9 billion shortfall in its most recent annual report.
But the state also disclosed what would happen if it lowered its investment assumption just half a percentage point, to 8 percent. Though it might be more likely to achieve that return, Colorado would earn less over time on its investments. So at 8 percent, the plan's shortfall would actually jump to $21.4 billion. Contributions would need to increase to keep pace.
Colorado cannot afford the contributions it owes, even at the current estimated rate of return. It has fallen behind by several billion dollars on its yearly contributions, and after a bruising battle the legislature recently passed a bill reducing retirees' cost-of-living adjustment, to 2 percent, from 3.5 percent. Public employees' unions are threatening to sue to have the law repealed.
If Colorado could somehow get 9 percent annual returns from its investments, though, its pension shortfall would shrink to a less daunting $15 billion, according to its annual report.
That explains why plan officials are looking everywhere for high-yielding investments.
Mr. May, in Wyoming, said many governments were "moving away from the perceived safety and liquidity of the investment-grade market" and investing money offshore, but he said he was aware of the risks. "There's a history of emerging markets kind of hitting the wall," he said.
Last year, the North Carolina Legislature enacted a measure to let the state pension fund invest 5 percent of its assets in "credit opportunities," like junk bonds and asset-backed securities from the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, an emergency program created to thaw the frozen markets for such securities.
The law also lets North Carolina put 5 percent of its pension portfolio into commodities, real estate and other assets that the state sees as hedges against inflation. A summary of the bill issued by the state's treasurer and sole pension trustee, Janet Cowell, said it would provide "flexibility and the tools to increase portfolio return and better manage risk."
But some think they see new risks.
"It doesn't pass the smell test," said Edward Macheski, a retired money manager living in North Carolina. "North Carolina's assumption is 7.25 percent, and they haven't matched it in 10 years." He went to a recent meeting of the state treasurer's advisory board, armed with a list of questions about the investment policy. But the board voted not to permit any public discussion.
Wisconsin, meanwhile, has become one of the first states to adopt an investment strategy called "risk parity," which involves borrowing extra money for the pension portfolio and investing it in a type of Treasury bond that will pay higher interest if inflation rises.
Officials of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board declined to be interviewed but provided written descriptions of risk parity. The records show that Wisconsin wanted to reduce its exposure to the stock market, and shifting money into the inflation-proof Treasury bonds would do that. But Wisconsin also wanted to keep its assumed rate of return at 7.8 percent, and the Treasury bonds would not pay that much.
Wisconsin decided it could lower its equities but preserve its assumption if it also added a significant amount of leverage to its pension fund, by using a variety of derivative instruments, like swaps, futures or repurchase agreements.
It decided to start with a small amount of leverage and gradually increase it over time, but word of even a baby step into derivatives elicited howls of protest from around the state.
The big California pension fund, known as Calpers, was already under fire for losing billions of dollars on private equities and real estate in the last few years. So far it has stayed with those asset classes, while negotiating lower fees and writing off some of the most troubled real estate investments.
It announced in February that it had started looking into whether it should lower its expected rate of investment return, now 7.75 percent a year. It has embarked on a study, but a spokesman said that process would not be done until December, safely after the coming election.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- To fill three seats on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, the Obama administration is balancing seemingly contrary needs.
It could use the expertise of an outsider with Main Street credentials, but savvy in bank regulation; a veteran of complex financial deals, but not associated with the bailed-out banks of Wall Street; and an esteemed economist, but one whose vision extends beyond fighting inflation.
The formerly obscure Fed board has, if not quite the visibility of the Supreme Court, the burden of being under greater scrutiny than at any time in nearly 30 years.
As they vet potential candidates, Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council, and Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, are balancing their own desires with political pressures from within and outside the White House.
Among the potential unconventional nominees whose names have been floated in recent days are Martin D. Eakes, a North Carolina lawyer who helped found Self-Help, a community development fund for low-income borrowers; Peter A. Diamond, an M.I.T. economist and an authority on Social Security and pensions; Alan B. Krueger, a Treasury economist on leave from Princeton, who has studied labor, inequality and terrorism; and Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a longtime advocate of liberal economic views.
According to several people who have been briefed on the search process, Mr. Summers, a former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, and Mr. Geithner, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, both favor economists with impeccable academic credentials, but they also recognize the need for candidates with regulatory experience and community ties.
Janet L. Yellen, who was a Fed governor and chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration, has been mentioned as a front-runner to succeed Donald L. Kohn, the departing vice chairman.
But the people briefed on the process said it was not clear that Ms. Yellen, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, would want to return to Washington. The White House might have to do some arm-twisting to get her; as vice chairwoman she would make $179,700, less than half her current pay.
Another potential candidate for vice chairman would be Benjamin M. Friedman, a Harvard political economist.
When Mr. Geithner held a meeting last month with leaders of labor, civil rights and consumer groups to discuss overhauling financial regulation, he found the conversation steering to the Fed, according to several participants.
Advocates called on Mr. Geithner to appoint governors who could make the Fed more representative and accountable. Diversity is likely to be another consideration. Of the 87 governors since 1914, there have been seven women and three African-Americans.
"It would really be helpful if they had knowledge of the real economy," said William W. Sherrill, a former Fed governor who teaches entrepreneurship in the Bauer College of Business at the University of Houston. "All the attention lately has been on rescuing the financial sector from ruin, but the inability to move the stimulus over to the real economy -- and most directly, small businesses -- has been the problem."
Several banking executives, who have been supporters of Mr. Obama, have been cited as possible nominees: Paul Calello of Credit Suisse, Robert Wolf of UBS and Steven G. Thieke, a veteran of the New York Fed who retired a decade ago from JPMorgan Chase. All have the advantage of not having worked recently at the financial institutions that were at the center of the credit crisis and were bailed out by the Treasury and the Fed, though their ties to the banks could still be problematic.
But speculation that the White House might turn to nominees not too closely tied to Wall Street or Washington was enhanced after Christina D. Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told several news organizations on Friday that she did not intend or expect to be considered.
Ms. Romer is an authority on the Great Depression, like the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and has closely studied the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm. Her main scholarly collaborator has been her husband, David H. Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has himself been mentioned as a possible nominee.
"There's obviously a process under way, as there are with any positions," Ms. Romer told Politico. "But I certainly won't be one of them."
The people briefed on the talks spoke of several economists with ties to Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner: Edwin M. Truman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a veteran of the Fed and the Treasury; the Harvard professors Jeffrey A. Frankel, Jeremy C. Stein and David S. Scharfstein; and David A. Lipton, a former Treasury official who is now at the National Security Council.
Other names that have been mentioned include Laurence M. Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins; Austan Goolsbee, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Jason Furman, a deputy to Mr. Summers.
All of the potential nominees mentioned in this article either declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the process, or did not respond to requests for comment.
For their part, consumer advocates said they were closely watching the selection process.
"I hope they will give serious consideration to adding people who understand and care about the financial needs of consumers, and who know how to balance access and protection," said Jennifer Tescher, director of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, and a member of the Fed's Consumer Advisory Council.
