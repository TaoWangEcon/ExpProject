Full text: Let's face it: Bonds are boring. Usually, stock markets are the source of hyperventilation and headlines.
But right now, all the action is in the bond market. It is sending powerful signals that there's trouble ahead for the United States economy. They're powerful enough, in fact, that they're even rattling the parts of Wall Street that people do talk about.
Does it mean a recession is imminent? Certainly not. Part of what makes the bond market so ominous is that it's not terribly specific. But there is good information buried in the weeds.
Here's what to make of it.
Yields Are Falling Everywhere
When investors get nervous, they buy government bonds. Why? Governments (usually) pay back their debts, so those bonds are a safe bet.
Those purchases push prices higher. And when bond prices rise, the yields -- or the fixed interest rates investors collect on their bond investments -- fall.
So, falling yields are to the economy what barometric pressure is to the weather: When they drop it's often a sign that some kind of storm is coming.
And lately, they've been falling fast. Everywhere. In Japan, Britain, Australia, Germany and the United States. Long-term yields on government bonds around the world are hitting some of their lowest levels in recent years.
The Yield Curve Has Inverted
This tumble in long-term bond yields is especially unnerving because it has pushed long-term yields even lower than short-term yields.
In an economically rational world, investors would demand higher interest rates on long-term bonds than they do for short-term ones. The reason: Locking up their money for a longer period is usually riskier, and investors are paid more for that risk.
Today, in the United States, a government bond that's due in three months will pay a higher rate than a government bond that is due in 10 years.
These occurrences, called inversions, are rare, and they have grabbed Wall Street's attention for one simple reason: They have preceded every recession over the last 60 years (although some of those downturns took up to two years to materialize).
Inflation Expectations Are Dropping
One of the biggest boogeymen for investors in long-term bonds is inflation. Rising prices would gradually eat away at the buying power of a fixed investment in those bonds.
But nobody in the bond market seems to be thinking about inflation. In fact, bond investors' expectations for inflation over the next five years have fallen this month, and that should worry anyone who is looking to predict the state of the global economy.
It suggests that a litany of headwinds -- the trade war, Brexit, slowdowns in Europe and China -- is having an effect on growth.
The bond market's reading on inflation is most obviously evident in the yields on what are called Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS.
TIPS are essentially a kind of Treasury bond that is periodically adjusted to account for inflation. The difference between yields on these adjusted bonds and standard Treasury bonds is often used as a ballpark estimate for inflation expectations among bond market investors.
Lately, the difference between those yields has been shrinking fast, falling to about 1.60 percentage points in recent days, a clear sign that the bond market sees no inflation ahead.
Traders Are Betting on a Rate Cut
Foremost among those who worry about the economy and inflation are the people at the United States Federal Reserve. In recent weeks, officials from the central bank have spotlighted the persistent weakness of inflation and the trade war as reasons for concern.
Since the Fed did an abrupt about-face on raising interest rates, investors have been slowly increasing the odds they put on the Fed's actually starting to cut rates.
And according to the bond market, those cuts are almost a done deal.
You can see this in the shape of the yield curve, a shorthand way of referring to a string of different yields on the range of bonds offered by the Treasury, from short-term bills to the longest-maturity security the United States government sells, the 30-year bond.
As we said before, in a typical bond market universe, investors insist on higher interest rates on longer-term bonds. And until relatively recently, that's how things looked.
About a year ago, this is what the yield curve looked like:
Since then, the yield curve has been warped by growing expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates sometime over the next couple years.
Here is what it looks like now. That dip is how we know investors expect a rate cut.
The Fed Is Watching
The central bank doesn't answer to markets, but it does watch them closely -- particularly because turmoil can result in tighter financial conditions, slowing lending and, by extension, the economy.
One feature of the bond market that the Fed will focus on is credit spreads, which are a measure of how much more companies have to pay to borrow, over the yield on government debt. While they remain pretty low, credit spreads have ticked higher in May, as investors have grown worried about the impact of trade tensions on corporate profits.
Outside the bond market, the Fed will also look at consumer and business confidence as it mulls whether or not to cut rates.
For now, the Fed has little to gain by suggesting that a rate cut is imminent, but a turn for the worse could prod officials into action.
If it does, at least it won't be a surprise to bond investors.
Stock Investors Are Taking Heed
Rate cuts can be manna from heaven for the stock market. If the bond market is so sure they are on the way, shouldn't the stock market be soaring?
Well, if the Fed cuts interest rates, it would probably be doing so for a good reason. And that reason could only be that the risk of recession is real.
Investors typically don't rush to embrace risky stocks if they think a recessionary wave is threatening to overtake the economy, even if interest rates are coming down. This week, stock investors have been focused on that risk, with the drop in bond yields spurring the decline in the broad equity benchmarks.
Hold on. Sure, maybe the global economy is having some trouble. But the United States seems fine.
After all, growth in the first quarter was at a strong 3.1 percent annual rate in the United States. At 3.6 percent, American unemployment has hit its lowest point since 1969. Corporate profits are high. Wages are rising.
All true. But around the world, and in the United States, investors in the bond market are behaving as if something strange is afoot.
Given their track record on calling turning points in the economy, it would be unwise to ignore them.

Abstract: The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, has been betting on that very scenario as he has rejected calls for higher interest rates to suffocate inflation. The recent drop in commodity prices, combined with "a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time, should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year," Mr. Bernanke said Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

Full text: Economic trouble has spread far beyond the United States to major countries in Europe and Asia, threatening American businesses with the loss of foreign sales and investment that have become increasingly vital to their sustenance.
Only a few months ago, some economists still offered hope that robust expansion could continue in much of the world even as the United States slowed. Foreign investment was expected to keep replenishing American banks still bleeding from their disastrous bets on real estate and to provide money for companies looking to expand. Overseas demand for American goods and services was supposed to continue compensating for waning demand in the States.
Now, high energy prices, financial systems crippled by fear, and the decline of trading partners have combined to choke growth in many major economies. The International Monetary Fund expects global growth to slow significantly through the end of this year, dipping to 4.1 percent from 5 percent in 2007.
"The global economy is in a tough spot, caught between sharply slowing demand in many advanced economies and rising inflation everywhere," the I.M.F. declared last month in its official World Economic Outlook.
All this means that economic troubles in the United States could intensify into the presidential election season and beyond. It could also make it harder for financial companies like Lehman Brothers -- which has been seeking fresh investment in South Korea -- and the government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to attract much-needed capital from abroad.
As the United States and many other large economies slip in unison, the reality of integrated markets is being underscored: just as globalization spreads prosperity -- linking cotton farmers in Texas to textile mills in China -- the same forces spread hurt when times go bad.
"The slowdown has reached such a wide range of countries that they're now feeding on one another," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.
The impact of the downturn is reflected by the experience of the Vermeer Corporation in Pella, Iowa. The company, which manufactures farming and construction equipment, has become accustomed to looking abroad for growth as the real estate bust in the United States has crimped purchases of its gear by American home builders. Its overseas sales have doubled in the last five years as a percentage of its total business and now make up nearly a third of its revenue, the company's senior director of international sales, Steve Heap, said.
But in recent months, even as growth has continued over all, some parts of the world have sunk into malaise.
"The U.K. has been really soft for the last six months," Mr. Heap said. "Western Europe overall has been flat. We've not seen the growth we've seen in the last few years."
Many other major economies are either stagnant or shrinking as well. Japan, whose fortunes are tethered to exports, saw its economy contract at a 2.4 percent annual rate from April through June after accounting for inflation. Germany, another export power, slid at a 2 percent clip. France and Italy slipped slightly.
Spain and the United Kingdom -- both grappling with hangovers from their own real estate binges -- were both flat amid talk that they have already slipped into recession. The festivity of easy money has given way to recriminations over bad loans, unemployment and inflation.
"The year 2009 in Europe is going to look significantly worse than 2008," said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at the Italian bank UniCredit.
Even China and India, whose swift growth has occasioned talk of a new global order, have been cooling in recent months, though still expanding at rates that would bring envy in nearly any other land.
"We had buoyant world growth for a few years," said William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. "It was too hot not to cool down, as the song goes."
There is a potentially significant upside to the downturn under way: it could knock down rising prices for food and energy, which have been driven higher by swelling demand in a swiftly expanding world economy.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, has been betting on that very scenario as he has rejected calls for higher interest rates to suffocate inflation.
The recent drop in commodity prices, combined with "a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time, should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year," Mr. Bernanke said Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo.
Still, concern centers on the possibility that slowing global growth could hurt sales of American goods and services overseas. Exports have been a conspicuous bright spot in an economy colored by falling home prices and declining consumer spending.
The dollar has been strengthening against many currencies in recent weeks -- not because of a newfound belief in American prospects, economists say, but because investors are edging out of markets that are weakening, like Britain and other parts of Europe, sending down the pound and the euro.
"It's the rest of the world going down, not the United States going up," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a professor at Harvard.
A stronger dollar makes American goods more expensive on world markets. If the dollar keeps strengthening, it could pinch sales.
"Exports have been sort of holding us out of the graveyard," said Martin N. Baily, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration, and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "That may begin to peter out a little bit if the dollar continues to climb."
Some economists argue that the dollar's recent strengthening is a correction after six years of declines that have sapped it of one-fourth of its value against the currencies of major trading partners. Others maintain that the dollar has further to fall, noting that the United States remains on the short of end of a lopsided balance of trade, with imports outstripping exports by nearly $800 billion at the end of last year.
Regardless of the dollar's value, sales of American goods may be eroded by a more decisive force: a global loss of appetite for goods. "If the rest of the world economy slows, the demand just isn't going to be there," Mr. Ruskin said.
That could be painful for American companies that rely on overseas markets. In 2001, large American companies that disclosed foreign revenues logged about a third of their sales abroad, according to an analysis by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. By last year, the foreign take had climbed to 46 percent. Europe made up 29 percent of the total.
Some American businesses say it is too early to worry about a global downturn.
"When I see the headlines, I worry, but when I look at my order book, I stop worrying," said James W. Griffith, president and chief executive of the Timken Company, a Canton, Ohio, manufacturer of industrial bearings and power transmission equipment with operations in 27 countries.
Roughly half of Timken's bearing business is overseas, cushioning the company against the loss of sales in the American auto industry -- a trend Mr. Griffith says he is confident will continue.
"When China decides they want to build a car, somebody runs a steel mill with coal and iron oreout of Australia, and they mine it with Caterpillar dump trucks which are full of Timken bearings," Mr. Griffith said. "What is driving our success is the globalization of markets."
Still, the transformation of foreign shores from a refuge for American business into a source of anxiety is a testament to how swiftly trouble can proliferate in the global economy.
India's customer service call centers -- heavily dependent on American demand -- are now girding for cuts.
In China, the pace of growth has dipped from an annual rate exceeding 12 percent as recently as last year to something closer to 9 or 10 percent, according to most economists.
China's leaders have become concerned about flagging exports, recently altering priorities from seeking to squelch inflation to instead sustaining economic growth. The government is easing restrictions on bank lending, which were imposed to put the brakes on the economy.
When China makes fewer computers, it needs fewer computer chips forged in Taiwan and designed in the United States. It needs less steel, and so less iron ore from Brazil and Australia. Which means those countries need less construction equipment made in Germany, Japan or Ohio.
"The global slowdown is going to create some headwind for the United States," said Stephen Jen, an economist at Morgan Stanley in London.

Abstract: ''The bandits of Exxon Mobil will never rob us again,'' Mr. [Hugo Chavez] said in comments broadcast Sunday on his weekly television program. He accused Exxon, one of the largest publicly traded oil companies, and the United States of mounting a conspiracy to destabilize Venezuela. ''I speak to the American empire, because that's the master,'' Mr. Chavez said. ''Continue, and you will see that we won't send one drop of oil to the empire of the United States.'' Referring to Exxon, he said, ''They are imperialist bandits, white-collar criminals, corruptors of governments, overthrowers of governments.'' The tension with Exxon was just one of Mr. Chavez's subjects on Sunday. He also accused the United States and neighboring Colombia of bringing paramilitary squads to Venezuela to traffic in weapons and cocaine. And he said his political opponents were plotting to ''reconvert Venezuela into a North American colony.''

Full text: President Hugo Chavez threatened Sunday to halt oil exports to the United States if the oil giant Exxon Mobil succeeds in freezing billions of dollars of foreign petroleum assets controlled by Venezuela.
The warning ratchets up a fierce legal dispute between Venezuela and Exxon after Mr. Chavez's move to exert greater state control over the nation's oil industry last year. Rather than submitting to Venezuela's terms, Exxon withdrew from a major production venture, intensifying the feud.


''The bandits of Exxon Mobil will never rob us again,'' Mr. Chavez said in comments broadcast Sunday on his weekly television program. He accused Exxon, one of the largest publicly traded oil companies, and the United States of mounting a conspiracy to destabilize Venezuela.
''I speak to the American empire, because that's the master,'' Mr. Chavez said. ''Continue, and you will see that we won't send one drop of oil to the empire of the United States.'' Referring to Exxon, he said, ''They are imperialist bandits, white-collar criminals, corruptors of governments, overthrowers of governments.''
Venezuela's government has been seething since Exxon recently won orders in British, Dutch and American courts freezing as much as $12 billion in Venezuelan oil assets abroad -- refineries and other oil-related infrastructure that Venezuela owns. Venezuela vowed to overturn the decisions before arbitration over Exxon's attempts to win compensation for its nationalized oil project.
''We have no comment,'' said Margaret Ross, a spokeswoman for Exxon, based in Irving, Tex., after Mr. Chavez spoke.
Mr. Chavez has repeatedly threatened to cut off oil supplies to the United States, but has never done so.
In fact, despite a deterioration in political relations, the United States remains Venezuela's top trading partner. Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States, sending 1.2 million barrels a day to American refineries, according to the Energy Information Administration in Washington.
The dispute with Exxon is focusing attention on Petroleos de Venezuela, the national oil company, which Mr. Chavez has purged of his political opponents and reconfigured to finance social welfare projects. The company faces steeper borrowing costs after the price of its bonds plunged by 3 percent on Friday, to 66.75 cents on the dollar.
Declining oil production at Petroleos de Venezuela has allowed other countries in the OPEC oil cartel, notably Saudi Arabia, to gain a greater share of the market in meeting the expanding global demand for oil. The problems at Petroleos de Venezuela, a major revenue source for Mr. Chavez, are occurring amid growing discontent over food shortages and galloping inflation.
The tension with Exxon was just one of Mr. Chavez's subjects on Sunday. He also accused the United States and neighboring Colombia of bringing paramilitary squads to Venezuela to traffic in weapons and cocaine. And he said his political opponents were plotting to ''reconvert Venezuela into a North American colony.''

The Dollar Is Falling, And That's Good News

Abstract: A falling dollar does mean price inflation in the United States. Just as it costs more for an American to buy a fancy meal in Paris, so do French wines and German cars have a higher markup when they are sold in New York. But imports are only 16 percent of the American economy, and most foreign suppliers have been reluctant to risk their position in the American market by raising prices a great deal. Furthermore many price increases from Europe come on luxury goods and thus they fall on wealthy American buyers, who can afford it most easily. Wal-Mart serves a more working-class clientele and it is stocked with goods from Asia, where currency values have remained weaker against the dollar. Another worry is that a falling dollar puts the United States at the mercy of China. Dr. Brad Setser, a currency analyst at RGE Monitor, estimates that the Chinese hold about $1.2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets. China is likely to slowly diversify into other currencies, but Chinese leaders have no interest in encouraging a run on the dollar or a fire sale of dollar-denominated assets. China is in a more vulnerable position than the United States, if only because China is a poorer country and has underdeveloped capital markets.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.
ANXIETY about the dollar continues to spread. The falling greenback is often seen as a sign of an impending recession or the fall of the United States from global leadership. A low dollar simply looks bad. We are, after all, used to judging ourselves against others -- comparing our salaries with the earnings of our peers, and our homes with those of our neighbors. We're used to thinking it is a big advantage to stand at the top of a numerical list.
But when it comes to currencies, a higher value neither brings national success nor predicts future prosperity. The measure of a nation's wealth is the goods and services it produces, not the relative standing of its currency. Take a look at 1985-88, when the dollar lost more ground than in the last few years. Those were good times, and the next decade was largely prosperous as well.


Today's lower value for the dollar reflects the success of other regions. Europe has shown it can make the European Union and its unified currency work, and thus the euro has become stronger. The Canadian union appears increasingly stable, and that means a higher value for the Canadian dollar. Over all, these geopolitical developments are good for America even if the dollar becomes weaker in relative terms.
Many observers have an exaggerated sensitivity to the dollar's fall because they spend more time in relatively expensive countries. A shopping trip to London will give an American tourist the feeling that all prices have doubled or even worse. A weekend vacation or conference in nearby Toronto or Montreal may no longer feel like a bargain.
But from a broader perspective, the value of the dollar hasn't fallen quite as much as it might seem. Since President Bush started his second term in January 2001, to Nov. 20 of this year, the dollar has dropped 19.8 percent -- if we weight the dollar by how much America trades with individual countries. That is a noticeable decline, but it is hardly a radical economic event. There are still many bargains, travel and otherwise, in Asia and Latin America for people paying in dollars.
A falling dollar does mean price inflation in the United States. Just as it costs more for an American to buy a fancy meal in Paris, so do French wines and German cars have a higher markup when they are sold in New York. But imports are only 16 percent of the American economy, and most foreign suppliers have been reluctant to risk their position in the American market by raising prices a great deal. Furthermore many price increases from Europe come on luxury goods and thus they fall on wealthy American buyers, who can afford it most easily. Wal-Mart serves a more working-class clientele and it is stocked with goods from Asia, where currency values have remained weaker against the dollar.
Of course the lower value of the dollar also makes American exports more competitive. Much of Middle America is booming because of its ability to sell tractors, food stuffs and other products abroad at favorable prices. Even after a serious real estate decline, the American economy is continuing to expand, and this is largely because of the strength of our export sector, as encouraged by a low value for the dollar.
Another worry is that a falling dollar puts the United States at the mercy of China. Dr. Brad Setser, a currency analyst at RGE Monitor, estimates that the Chinese hold about $1.2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets. China is likely to slowly diversify into other currencies, but Chinese leaders have no interest in encouraging a run on the dollar or a fire sale of dollar-denominated assets. China is in a more vulnerable position than the United States, if only because China is a poorer country and has underdeveloped capital markets.
Still, it would be naive to argue that a weak or falling dollar can never hurt the United States. Extreme volatility can increase general anxiety and discourage economic commitments. If the dollar went into a true free fall, it would damage the reputation of the United States as a desirable place for foreigners to invest. That would hurt; but on the other hand a low dollar would mean bargains for foreigners, thereby attracting investment and limiting the potential negative fallout from a dollar collapse.
SO far the Federal Reserve and the Bush administration have shown little concern over the falling dollar. This isn't because of neglect or lack of interest; trillions of dollars worth of currency are traded every day, so policy makers have only a limited ability to push around long-term exchange rates, even if they wanted to do so.
When it comes to market prices, people can always find reason to be unhappy. In the eurozone, for example, it is a common complaint that the euro is too strong and therefore it is too difficult for Europeans to export goods and services.
In the case of the dollar, we need to stop thinking of its value as a marker of economic success. The American economy has its problems, but so far the low value of the dollar has proved more a benefit than a cost.

Abstract: After a year in which the bank carefully telegraphed its plans well in advance, including the increase on Thursday, Mr. [Jean-Claude Trichet] refused to specify precisely when the bank might move next. But with a stern warning that it will act ''in a firm and timely manner,'' he left little doubt that the bank thought that higher rates would be needed to squelch inflation. Still, Mr. Trichet's mix of signals tilted decisively toward worries that inflation could rise if previous oil price increases make energy-related products more expensive, or if companies pass on wage increases to consumers. Currency markets have driven down the value of the dollar against the euro in recent weeks as it became apparent that the central bank was likely to push up rates next year. Rising rates increase the appeal of assets denominated in euros. The dollar has also weakened in the face of evidence that a housing slowdown in the United States could spill over into the rest of the economy and force the Federal Reserve to ease its own monetary policy. But Mr. Trichet endorsed the view of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who expects a cooling but still-expanding economy in the United States next year.

Full text: The European Central Bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point on Thursday, its sixth such move in a year, and signaled more increases were likely next year as it sought to head off higher inflation.
The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, acknowledged that the economy of the 12-country euro zone could be hurt again by higher energy prices. But he struck a sanguine note about growth, saying it would be steady into 2007 thanks to strong global expansion, renewed business investment and a pickup in household spending.
After a year in which the bank carefully telegraphed its plans well in advance, including the increase on Thursday, Mr. Trichet refused to specify precisely when the bank might move next. But with a stern warning that it will act ''in a firm and timely manner,'' he left little doubt that the bank thought that higher rates would be needed to squelch inflation.
''We are there to ensure price stability,'' he said. ''It is as simple as that. There is no ambiguity.''
The bank's move put its key rate at 3.5 percent. The Bank of England, also meeting on Thursday, left its benchmark rate unchanged at 5 percent.
Mr. Trichet hinted that higher rates were likely next year once Europe weathered the shock of a sharply higher value-added tax in Germany.
When the German tax increases to 19 percent from 16 percent on Jan. 1, its largest one-time increase ever, Mr. Trichet said the central bank would take time to digest economic data early in the year to assess its effect on growth.
''What is unclear is exactly the impact that it will have,'' he said.
Still, Mr. Trichet's mix of signals tilted decisively toward worries that inflation could rise if previous oil price increases make energy-related products more expensive, or if companies pass on wage increases to consumers.
Soon after Mr. Trichet spoke, Axel A. Weber, the president of the Bundesbank, chimed in with an even more explicit call for higher rates next year.
''Financing conditions are favorable, more favorable than they need to be in my opinion in the long term, to be compatible with inflation-neutral growth,'' said Mr. Weber, who is a member of the central bank's 18-member rate-setting body.
Currency markets have driven down the value of the dollar against the euro in recent weeks as it became apparent that the central bank was likely to push up rates next year. Rising rates increase the appeal of assets denominated in euros. The dollar has also weakened in the face of evidence that a housing slowdown in the United States could spill over into the rest of the economy and force the Federal Reserve to ease its own monetary policy. But Mr. Trichet endorsed the view of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who expects a cooling but still-expanding economy in the United States next year.
''A smooth slowing down is what we are observing and very likely what we will continue to observe,'' Mr. Trichet said.
He also served notice that the central bank might not offer as much guidance on future intentions as it did this year.
The bank vowed in its statement to ''monitor very closely'' all risks of inflation, a formulation that has previously suggested a rate increase two months later. But Mr. Trichet explicitly rejected the notion that the bank had February in mind, saying it could ''act at any time.''
The change may also reflect the fact that after a year of rate increases, the central bank is nearing the neutral rate of interest -- one that neither promotes nor hampers growth -- and it needs to preserve its flexibility to slow or even halt its tightening cycle as the outlook for inflation changes.

Abstract: One benefit of the slowing economy has been lower inflation. The revised G.D.P. report showed that the pressure from inflation also eased more than the government first estimated. A broad index of consumer prices rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate, compared with an initial estimate of 2.5 percent. And a gauge of inflation, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, that strips out volatile food and energy prices posted an annualized ''core'' rate of 2.2 percent, compared with 2.3 percent reported last month. While the Fed has held rates steady since August, its members have repeatedly cautioned that any resurgence of inflationary pressure could prompt it to start raising them again. On Tuesday, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned in a speech in New York that inflation remained ''uncomfortably high,'' signaling that future rate increases have not been ruled out. He identified pressure from rising wages and income as a potential threat because employers could pass their rising labor costs onto customers. Indeed, the beige book showed that wages were rising quickly in some parts of the country. It cited ''more rapid'' wage gains in the San Francisco district, especially for skilled workers in health care, finance and construction. And it noted that employers were ''increasingly reliant'' on hiring bonuses to recruit skilled workers. Similar patterns were reported in the New York district.

Full text: The rough patch that the American economy hit in the third quarter was not quite as rough as the government first estimated.
New figures released yesterday by the Commerce Department showed that gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate from July through September, notably more than the 1.6 percent reported last month.
But new signs surfaced yesterday suggesting the economy may be headed for a steeper decline during the rest of the year, with corporate inventories bulging and home sales deteriorating further.
Economists said that the slide in growth had still not bottomed out on its way down from the lofty 5.6 percent expansion in the first quarter.
''Things kind of tailed off in the third quarter, so you entered the fourth quarter without much momentum,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, an economic research firm. ''We're not off to a great start.''
A separate report from the Commerce Department yesterday said that sales of new homes dropped in October for the fifth time in 10 months, falling 3.2 percent from September. Compared with a year earlier, new home sales plunged 25.4 percent. It was the ninth consecutive month of year-over-year declines of more than 10 percent -- the longest such string since 1991.
The housing sector, by far the biggest drag on growth in the third quarter, wilted at a slightly faster rate in the third quarter than the government initially reported. In all, the contraction in the housing market subtracted 1.16 percentage points from the annualized growth rate, compared with the 1.12 percentage points reported last month.
Two main factors led to the upward revision in the third-quarter figure: Americans purchased fewer goods from overseas than initially thought, and businesses added to their inventories more quickly.
On Wall Street yesterday, investors bid stocks upward on news of the stronger growth figures. The dollar, which has declined in recent days because of fears about the United States economy starting to slide, retraced some of its losses.
While increasing purchases by businesses bode well for the economy in the short term, they could drag down growth in the future if inventories pile up, economists said.
''A classic sign of an economy that's going to have trouble is an inventory accumulation,'' said David Kelly, an economist with Putnam Investments. ''If companies don't sell as much stuff as they bought in one quarter, then they don't produce as much in the next quarter.''
One benefit of the slowing economy has been lower inflation. The revised G.D.P. report showed that the pressure from inflation also eased more than the government first estimated. A broad index of consumer prices rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate, compared with an initial estimate of 2.5 percent. And a gauge of inflation, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, that strips out volatile food and energy prices posted an annualized ''core'' rate of 2.2 percent, compared with 2.3 percent reported last month.
The figures were consistent with other recent economic reports that have showed price increases starting to slow recently. Yesterday the Federal Reserve released its beige book report, which said that most regions of the country saw prices moderate from the beginning of October through Nov. 20.
While the Fed has held rates steady since August, its members have repeatedly cautioned that any resurgence of inflationary pressure could prompt it to start raising them again. On Tuesday, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned in a speech in New York that inflation remained ''uncomfortably high,'' signaling that future rate increases have not been ruled out. He identified pressure from rising wages and income as a potential threat because employers could pass their rising labor costs onto customers.
Indeed, the beige book showed that wages were rising quickly in some parts of the country. It cited ''more rapid'' wage gains in the San Francisco district, especially for skilled workers in health care, finance and construction. And it noted that employers were ''increasingly reliant'' on hiring bonuses to recruit skilled workers. Similar patterns were reported in the New York district.
The beige book largely depicted an economy that was moderating as the slowdown in housing weakened overall economic growth. ''Most districts cited declining sales and rising home inventories,'' the report said.
The situation seemed particularly bleak in the San Francisco district, where banks were beginning to report that some builders had been delinquent in repaying loans.
The unsold inventory of new homes continued to mount, according to the Commerce Department's report. There is now a seven-month supply on the market, compared with 6.7 months' worth in September.
Even so, median prices for new homes ticked up in October to $248,500, 1.9 percent higher than a year earlier. Economists attributed the price jump to regional variations, and said it was not an indication that prices had bottomed out.
''Mix and location of home sales is clearly impacting the overall median price,'' Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial, said in a research report.
Sales in the West, where houses are more expensive on average than elsewhere in the country, actually rose last month. It was the only region of the country where sales increased.

After Years of Growth, What About Workers' Share?

Abstract: In the United States, where labor unions have lost much of their bargaining power and few workplace regulations limit employers' decisions, companies have had an easier time reducing real wages. In the last year, wages have risen only enough to keep pace with inflation. In real terms, the wages of nonmanagement employees in the United States are now 10 percent below their level in the early 1970's, according to Labor Department statistics. In Western Europe, collective bargaining has been more successful in keeping wages up. These differences affect the distribution of the workers' share. America's low-wage labor market is virtually nonexistent in the European Union. There is no Western European equivalent of the American earning $5.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage, on the overnight shift as a convenience store cashier. A $7-an-hour baby-sitter is nearly impossible to find in London. Over all, the wage distribution in Europe is much less polarized than it is in the United States. Mr. [Olivier Blanchard] suggested that the decline in the labor share in Europe might have been prompted in the 1970's by strong unions pushing up employee wages -- which led companies to shed workers, eliminating many occupations entirely -- the late-night cashier, for example -- and replacing others with machines.

Full text: JOB growth is starting to slow, and wages are barely keeping up with inflation. Five years into a relatively robust economic expansion, it's understandable that many American workers feel that they are not getting their fair share of the pie.
In fact, the share of the economy devoted to workers' wages and benefits has eroded in the United States over the last five years. But if it's any consolation, the trend for workers in other rich industrial nations isn't much better.
The portion of the economy going to the workers in wages and benefits is perhaps the broadest measure of the workers' share of economic growth. The numbers are based on how many workers are employed and how much they are paid for their toil.
In the United States, this economic slice, including wages, health insurance and pension benefits, declined 2.5 percentage points from 2000 to 2005, to 56.5 percent of gross domestic product, according to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Workers in some countries have lost even more. According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the forum of industrialized countries, the workers' share of gross domestic product in Germany fell 3.1 percentage points over the last half-decade. In Japan, the decline was 3 points.
Over all, the workers' share of the economy fell in 4 of the Group of 7 industrialized nations.
The recent declines are hardly atypical. While there have been some periods when the workers' share has risen, the overall trend since the 1970's has been downward in most industrialized countries.
Economists have identified some important forces causing this erosion, but they are mostly perplexed by the long decline. ''It's a bit of a mystery why the labor share is falling so much,'' said Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton.
Olivier Blanchard, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, added, ''The complete, integrated story remains to be told.''
For workers, perhaps the most important question is, how long will the slide continue?
Workers in the United States appeared to get a break for a few years in the second half of the 1990's, when robust growth bolstered employment and increased labor's bargaining power. Workers' share of the economy grew 2.3 percentage points from 1995 to 2000.
But that increase proved fleeting. While the uptick led some economists to expect a similar rebound in this decade, many are losing hope.
''The longer the recovery is delayed,'' Mr. Krueger said, ''the less confident I am.''
To begin with, consider changes in the composition of the American economy. In 1975, manufacturing accounted for 28 percent of output, while finance accounted for 18 percent, according to an analysis by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By 1995, the relative importance of these sectors had flipped -- with finance accounting for 27 percent and manufacturing for 22 percent.
This shift took a chunk out of the workers' share because banks and other financial companies use fewer workers than manufacturers to do what they do, and they don't pay their workers proportionally more.
And well-known forces continue to whittle away at the workers' share. Cheap imports from China and cheap call centers in India have increased the competition for jobs. New technologies have also replaced many middle-income workers. And immigration is on the rise in much of the industrial world.
Though economists do not fully understand how these forces are affecting labor markets, most seem to agree that, one way or another, they are eating into the workers' share of the pie.
In the United States, where labor unions have lost much of their bargaining power and few workplace regulations limit employers' decisions, companies have had an easier time reducing real wages. In the last year, wages have risen only enough to keep pace with inflation. In real terms, the wages of nonmanagement employees in the United States are now 10 percent below their level in the early 1970's, according to Labor Department statistics.
In Western Europe, collective bargaining has been more successful in keeping wages up. These differences affect the distribution of the workers' share. America's low-wage labor market is virtually nonexistent in the European Union. There is no Western European equivalent of the American earning $5.15 an hour, the federal minimum wage, on the overnight shift as a convenience store cashier. A $7-an-hour baby-sitter is nearly impossible to find in London. Over all, the wage distribution in Europe is much less polarized than it is in the United States.
BUT the institutional differences have done little to halt the slide in the share of the economy that is devoted to workers' compensation.
Mr. Blanchard suggested that the decline in the labor share in Europe might have been prompted in the 1970's by strong unions pushing up employee wages -- which led companies to shed workers, eliminating many occupations entirely -- the late-night cashier, for example -- and replacing others with machines.
''The decline in the wage share is bound to level off,'' said David Grubb, a labor economist at the O.E.C.D. But the question is, when will it stop falling, and how?
If historical experience in the United States serves as any guide, workers' compensation could still fall a long way. It was a different world then, but it is worth noting that in 1929, workers had less than half of the economic pie.

Abstract: The classic example of embedded inflation is the wage-price spiral -- better described as wage-price leapfrogging -- of the 1970's. Back then, whenever wage contracts came up for renewal, workers demanded big raises, both to catch up with past inflation and to offset expected future inflation. And whenever companies changed their prices, they raised them by a lot, both to catch up with past wage increases and to offset expected future increases. The result of this leapfrogging process was that inflation became a self-sustaining process, feeding on itself. And ending that self-sustaining process proved very difficult. The Fed eventually brought the inflation of the 1970's under control, but only by raising interest rates so high that in the early 1980's the U.S. economy suffered its worst slump since the Great Depression. It's true that some widely used inflation measures, like so-called core inflation, strip out the direct ''first-round'' effects of rising energy prices. But there are still indirect effects, which usually take some time to show up in the data. Much of the recent rise in core inflation probably represents the delayed effect of the big run-up in fuel prices a few months ago. And unless something else happens to drive up oil prices -- like, to give a wild example, a military strike on Iran -- inflation will probably subside in the months ahead.

Full text: Over the last few weeks monetary officials have sounded increasingly worried about rising prices. On Wednesday, Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, declared that inflation ''is running at a rate that is just too corrosive to be accepted by a virtuous central banker.''
I'm worried too -- but not about recent price increases. What worries me, instead, is the Fed's overreaction to those increases. When it comes to inflation, the main thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Discussions of inflation can be numbingly arcane -- are you a core C.P.I. type or a trimmed-mean P.C.E. person? But the real issue is whether there's a serious risk that inflation will become embedded in the economy.
The classic example of embedded inflation is the wage-price spiral -- better described as wage-price leapfrogging -- of the 1970's. Back then, whenever wage contracts came up for renewal, workers demanded big raises, both to catch up with past inflation and to offset expected future inflation. And whenever companies changed their prices, they raised them by a lot, both to catch up with past wage increases and to offset expected future increases.
The result of this leapfrogging process was that inflation became a self-sustaining process, feeding on itself. And ending that self-sustaining process proved very difficult. The Fed eventually brought the inflation of the 1970's under control, but only by raising interest rates so high that in the early 1980's the U.S. economy suffered its worst slump since the Great Depression.
Fed officials now seem worried that we may be seeing the start of another round of self-sustaining inflation. But is that a realistic fear? Only if you think we can have a wage-price spiral without, you know, the wages part.
The point is that wage increases can be a major driver of inflation only if workers consistently receive raises that substantially exceed productivity growth. And that just hasn't been happening.
In fact, the distinctive feature of the current economic expansion -- the reason most Americans are unhappy with the state of the economy, in spite of good numbers for the gross domestic product and explosive growth in corporate profits -- is the disconnect between rising worker productivity and stagnant wages. Over the past five years productivity, as measured by real G.D.P. per hour worked, has risen by about 14 percent, but the real wages of nonmanagerial workers have risen less than 2 percent.
Nor is there much sign that things are changing on that front. The official unemployment rate is low by historical standards, but workers still don't seem to have much bargaining power. (Does this mean that the official unemployment rate makes the job situation look better than it really is? Yes.) The Federal Reserve's Beige Book, an informal survey of economic conditions across the country, reports that over the last couple of months ''wage pressures remained moderate over all, with the exception being workers with hotly demanded skills.''
But if wage pressures are so moderate, where's the inflation coming from? The answer is soaring oil and commodity prices.
It's true that some widely used inflation measures, like so-called core inflation, strip out the direct ''first-round'' effects of rising energy prices. But there are still indirect effects, which usually take some time to show up in the data. Much of the recent rise in core inflation probably represents the delayed effect of the big run-up in fuel prices a few months ago. And unless something else happens to drive up oil prices -- like, to give a wild example, a military strike on Iran -- inflation will probably subside in the months ahead.
And bear in mind that many economists, including Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, have said that a little bit of inflation -- say, 2 percent a year on average -- is actually good for the economy.
It would be an exaggeration to say that there's no inflation threat at all. I can think of ways in which inflation could become a problem. But it's much easier to think of ways in which the Federal Reserve, wrongly focused on the phantom menace of a new wage-price spiral, could be slow to respond to bigger threats, like a rapidly deflating housing bubble.
So I don't fear inflation nearly as much as I fear the fear of inflation. And I wish the Fed would lighten up on the subject.

Abstract: BAA, the former British Airports Authority before it was privatized in the 1980's, owns Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton airports in England; Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports in Scotland; and interests in airports in Naples, Italy, and Budapest. In the United States, it runs the Indianapolis airport and manages the retail shops at airports in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Boston. Ferrovial owns a controlling stake in Bristol International Airport in England and a minority stake in Belfast City Airport in Northern Ireland. It also manages airports in Australia and Chile, and runs toll roads in Spain, Canada, Chile, the United States, Portugal, Italy and elsewhere. Bawag acquired a 10 percent stake in Refco in 1999. Refco, which was based in New York, sold shares to the public last year but collapsed a few months later amid evidence of fraud in its accounts.

Full text: SIGNS of slower economic growth, paradoxically, would normally have been welcome news this week, bolstering the idea that the Federal Reserve would stop tightening the money supply and raising interest rates. But when signs of slow growth were accompanied by evidence of accelerating inflation, it was hard to see a bright side.
With the stock market falling, the deal-making machinery on Wall Street fell silent. There were a couple of takeovers involving foreign companies, both with significant interests in the United States.
FIRST THINGS FIRST -- Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and almost every other Fed member were meticulously on message: Make no mistake this time, rates are going up.
After sending mixed messages in the past about when the steady march of interest rate increases might end, Fed members stepped up to uniformly express concern that prices were rising too fast: at a 3 percent annual rate over the last six months and 2.3 percent over the last 12 months.
Speaking at a conference in Washington on international monetary issues, Mr. Bernanke described those rates as ''unwelcome developments.'' In the past, he has said that core inflation should hover between 1 and 2 percent a year.
The Fed, he added, ''will be vigilant to ensure that the recent pattern of elevated monthly core inflation readings is not sustained.''
The inflation rate for May is scheduled to be released Wednesday. Analysts expect an increase of 0.3 percent for the month.
SIGNS OF A SLUMP -- Inflation concerns were stoked earlier in the week when the Labor Department said that the number of workers making their first unemployment insurance claims fell sharply last month, suggesting a tight labor market that could lead to higher wages as companies compete for workers.
But analysts dismissed the number as a statistical fluke, and reaffirmed that they expected that the number of initial jobless claims would start climbing this month as the economy slowed.
Evidence of a slowdown came from the Commerce Department, which said that wholesalers' inventories rose 0.9 percent in April, much faster than expected. The decline was led by automakers, which may be an early sign of how stubbornly high energy prices are starting to affect the broad economy.
Additional evidence of economic growth will come Tuesday, when the Commerce Department releases retail sales figures for May.
BRIGHT SPOT -- Grupo Ferrovial, a Spanish construction and real estate company, offered to buy BAA, the world's biggest airport operator, for $19 billion in a significant vote of confidence in the rebounding air travel industry.
BAA, the former British Airports Authority before it was privatized in the 1980's, owns Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton airports in England; Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports in Scotland; and interests in airports in Naples, Italy, and Budapest. In the United States, it runs the Indianapolis airport and manages the retail shops at airports in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Boston.
Ferrovial owns a controlling stake in Bristol International Airport in England and a minority stake in Belfast City Airport in Northern Ireland. It also manages airports in Australia and Chile, and runs toll roads in Spain, Canada, Chile, the United States, Portugal, Italy and elsewhere.
Some airlines expressed concern that Ferrovial would have to raise landing fees at its airports to cover the cost of the acquisition. Others said they hoped the company's experience would expedite construction of a third runway at Heathrow, near London.
BIG FINE -- An Austrian bank agreed to pay at least $675 million to avoid criminal charges and settle bankruptcy claims stemming from its role in helping the commodities brokerage firm Refco conceal losses before it collapsed into bankruptcy.
Of that total, $8 million will be used to settle a class-action lawsuit, and the rest will be split evenly between the United States Justice Department and victims of the fraud at Refco.
As part of the settlement, the bank, Bawag, acknowledged that it had helped Refco's former chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, conceal crippling losses from investors and creditors by lending him hundreds of millions of dollars and permitting him to shift funds among the company's various accounts.
Bawag acquired a 10 percent stake in Refco in 1999. Refco, which was based in New York, sold shares to the public last year but collapsed a few months later amid evidence of fraud in its accounts.
Mr. Bennett is under house arrest, awaiting trial on eight felony counts of fraud.
COMMERCIAL BOOM -- While sales of new and existing homes continue to fall from month to month, suggesting that the residential real estate rally is fading, there are signs that people are still bullish on commercial property.
Brookfield Properties, a Canadian company that owns 67 office buildings in New York City, Boston, Washington and Canada, agreed to buy Trizec Properties, which owns 61 towers, for $4.8 billion. The deal, which also calls for the assumption of $4.1 billion in debt, will create one of the largest commercial landlords in North America.
In New York, Brookfield already owns the World Financial Center; acquiring Trizec will let it add the Grace Building on 42nd Street and One New York Plaza. Trizec also owns Bank of America Plaza in downtown Los Angeles.
Shares of other commercial property companies, including Equity Office Properties and Boston Properties, have been mentioned as the next possible takeover candidates.

Abstract: Crude oil for July delivery climbed to $58.60 a barrel before settling at $58.47, up $1.89. Some traders said oil might reach $70 a barrel, driven primarily by demand in China and the United States. Fears over what might affect the supply, rather than what is actually affecting it, appeared to inject anxiety into the market. ''In this environment, we cannot afford to have any disruptions,'' said Thomas Bentz, senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures. ''We are still in the uptrend.'' The closing on Friday of the consulates of the United States, Britain and Germany in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, because of reports of threats from Islamic militants put traders on edge. Nigeria supplied the United States with more than 1.1 million barrels of oil a day in April.

Full text: A hint of a terrorist threat in Nigeria, a major supplier of crude oil to the United States, and worries about a lack of refining capacity drove energy markets into a frenzy on Friday, pushing oil over $58 a barrel, a record.
Crude oil for July delivery climbed to $58.60 a barrel before settling at $58.47, up $1.89. Some traders said oil might reach $70 a barrel, driven primarily by demand in China and the United States. Fears over what might affect the supply, rather than what is actually affecting it, appeared to inject anxiety into the market.
''In this environment, we cannot afford to have any disruptions,'' said Thomas Bentz, senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures. ''We are still in the uptrend.'' The closing on Friday of the consulates of the United States, Britain and Germany in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city, because of reports of threats from Islamic militants put traders on edge. Nigeria supplied the United States with more than 1.1 million barrels of oil a day in April.
The possibility of a terrorist attack in Nigeria was enough to tap the oil market's fear that demand-driven pressure on prices might evolve into a full-blown supply-driven crisis.
A sudden restriction of supplies led to the oil shocks of the 1970's, and the lack of spare production capacity, particularly of the types of crude oil easy to refine into gasoline, has made the markets vulnerable to whispers of any potential disruption.
So do the opinions that oil is still relatively cheap. Adjusted for inflation, oil is less expensive than it was in 1981, when Iran choked off oil exports. The average cost of oil used by American refineries at that time was $35.24 a barrel, or $75.44 in current dollars, according to Bloomberg.
One of OPEC's concerns is that oil prices will quickly climb to a level where many car owners decide to switch from sport utility vehicles to compact cars, or possibly, to public transportation or carpooling. Such a change in driving habits, while still considered unlikely, might produce a scary outcome for oil-producing countries: a crash in oil prices.
''When I go to neighborhood parties, people are always asking me when gasoline prices are coming down,'' said David Pursell, a principal with Pickering Energy Partners, an energy investment firm in Houston. ''Well, I always reply, 'When are you going to start riding the bus?' There's lots of angst, but not enough to keep us from $60 oil.''
Not everyone is convinced oil prices will continue to soar. Andy Xie, the greater China economist for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, predicted a sharp decline in prices, citing signs of softer demand in China, the second-largest petroleum consumer after America; Chinese oil imports fell 1.2 percent in the first five months of this year.

Something in the Air: Inflation

Abstract: So far, the conventional wisdom apparently hasn't noticed that inflation, though always with us, is gathering steam. Just look at the yield spread between regular Treasury notes and inflation-adjusted Treasury issues. Lately, 10-year Treasuries have been paying around 2.5 percentage points more than the equivalent Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. That difference is considered to be investors' expectation of the annualized inflation rate over the next decade. The same answer -- an average of 2.5 percent for 10 years -- was given by the professional forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia late last year. Of course, inflation isn't supposed to happen anymore. Ever since Paul A. Volcker's epic conquest of inflation in the early 1980's, we have trusted vigilant central bankers to raise interest rates whenever it seems a threat. But raising rates as sharply as Mr. Volcker did when he was chairman of the Federal Reserve wouldn't be easy politically. A recession would result and, besides, it would be much easier for the government to pay off its mountainous debts in a moderately inflationary environment. How bad will inflation become? I'm not expecting any kind of run on those old Whip Inflation Now buttons from the Ford administration. Besides, a housing bust, an outbreak of peace in the Middle East or an economic crash in China could derail the inflation train for a while. Still, this may be a good time to ignore the wisdom of crowds by picking up some inflation-adjusted Treasuries.

IT'S back.
The data don't necessarily reflect it. The markets don't believe it. Even the experts don't seem to see it coming, although the signs are all around them.
But make no mistake: inflation is something to worry about again. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.3 percent last year, the most since 2000, when it was 3.4 percent. This time, however, the number really is the start of something.
So far, the conventional wisdom apparently hasn't noticed that inflation, though always with us, is gathering steam. Just look at the yield spread between regular Treasury notes and inflation-adjusted Treasury issues. Lately, 10-year Treasuries have been paying around 2.5 percentage points more than the equivalent Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. That difference is considered to be investors' expectation of the annualized inflation rate over the next decade. The same answer -- an average of 2.5 percent for 10 years -- was given by the professional forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia late last year.
The University of Michigan's surveys show that consumers expect annualized inflation of 2.8 percent for the next five years, perhaps because the average consumer is less affluent than most Treasury investors or economic forecasters and pays more attention to the way homes, gasoline, groceries and other things have climbed in price.
Indeed, signs of increasing inflation are everywhere. Gold prices are up sharply since 1999 and will probably rise further this year, more than one analyst has predicted. Home prices have been rising for years, and while there may well be a bubble along the coasts, the climb in residential real estate prices will continue to beat 2.5 percent in the long run, driven by a growing population, restrictions on development, the desire for second homes, a real-estate-friendly tax code and inflation fear -- once it takes hold.
Energy and meat prices will also rise in coming years, if only because global affluence is spreading and is almost always associated with higher fuel and protein consumption. The price climb for medical insurance and prescription drugs will easily beat 2.5 percent as far as the eye can see, driven in part by an aging population. And college tuition will spiral upward as usual.
Commodities will keep rising, too, thanks to booming demand from India and China -- itself a likely candidate for some serious inflation. Consider steel. The price of its main ingredient -- iron ore -- is expected to go up 30 to 50 percent in 2005 alone. And the cost of coking coal, used in steel-making, may double. Can anyone doubt that steel, and products made from it, will cost more this year?
Red ink is also inflationary. The Congressional Budget Office says the fiscal 2005 federal deficit will hit $368 billion, not counting billions in additional military spending sought by the Bush administration -- which also advocates a costly plan for private Social Security accounts. Let's not even discuss Medicare. Does the phrase ''guns and butter'' ring any bells?
Speaking of red ink, the twin budget and trade deficits are driving down the dollar's value to levels that will buy us inflation. Sure, a weak dollar offers the comfort of making American exports more attractive, but it also raises the price of what Americans buy abroad -- and domestic substitutes are unlikely to materialize anytime soon because it still won't pay to invest in producing them here.
Of course, inflation isn't supposed to happen anymore. Ever since Paul A. Volcker's epic conquest of inflation in the early 1980's, we have trusted vigilant central bankers to raise interest rates whenever it seems a threat. But raising rates as sharply as Mr. Volcker did when he was chairman of the Federal Reserve wouldn't be easy politically. A recession would result and, besides, it would be much easier for the government to pay off its mountainous debts in a moderately inflationary environment.
Globalization is supposed to have killed inflation by always moving production to the lowest-cost area. But globalization has also given us a world awash in inflationary dollars, as well as the inflationary affluence of so many people in China and India.
How bad will inflation become? I'm not expecting any kind of run on those old Whip Inflation Now buttons from the Ford administration. Besides, a housing bust, an outbreak of peace in the Middle East or an economic crash in China could derail the inflation train for a while. Still, this may be a good time to ignore the wisdom of crowds by picking up some inflation-adjusted Treasuries.

The Oil Question: To Fret or Not to Fret

Abstract: When inflation and inflation fears were high in the 70's and 80's, Mr. [Ben S. Bernanke] has argued, the Fed felt compelled to react to higher oil prices by raising interest rates and slowing the economy. Fed policy, or fear of Fed policy, was the real reason that recession followed the oil shocks of 1974, 1980, 1990 and 2000. Crude-oil imports have jumped to about 9.6 million barrels a day in 2003, from about 5.8 million barrels a day in 1990. Add imports of other petroleum products, from natural gas to gasoline, and the United States is now importing about 12 million barrels a day, about 60 percent of its consumption. Even though oil consumption has declined as a share of the total economy, Mr. [Jan Hatzius] notes that oil imports are just as big a share as ever of the gross domestic product. Because oil imports have climbed so sharply, higher oil prices mean that more money leaves the United States and less is simply recirculated from oil consumers to oil producers.

Full text: THE United States has managed to thrive despite high budget deficits and a staggering level of international indebtedness. Can it also thrive if oil prices remain above $40 a barrel and gasoline costs more than $2 a gallon at the pump?
The standard answer is yes, and the argument goes like this: First, oil prices are still lower, after adjusting for inflation, than they were in the 1970's. Second, the United States is much less ''energy intensive'' than it was 30 years ago, using about half as much oil to produce each dollar's worth of output. Third, even a big jump in oil prices is typically a one-time hit on consumer prices and not a prelude to sustained inflation.
Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, has argued that the biggest change since 30 years ago is the stunning decline of inflation.
When inflation and inflation fears were high in the 70's and 80's, Mr. Bernanke has argued, the Fed felt compelled to react to higher oil prices by raising interest rates and slowing the economy. Fed policy, or fear of Fed policy, was the real reason that recession followed the oil shocks of 1974, 1980, 1990 and 2000.
Today, Fed officials believe that inflation is so low that they have no need to react in the same way. Indeed, if higher oil prices were to cause a dip in economic growth, the Fed might view them as a reason to keep interest rates low.
All that may well be true, but there are reasons to be concerned. The United States has become habituated to low oil prices. The American love affair with heavy S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks has driven the average fuel economy of new cars to its lowest level in more than 20 years.
And while it is true that the American economy has grown much faster than its consumption of oil, it is also true that American oil imports have skyrocketed while American oil production has declined.
Crude-oil imports have jumped to about 9.6 million barrels a day in 2003, from about 5.8 million barrels a day in 1990. Add imports of other petroleum products, from natural gas to gasoline, and the United States is now importing about 12 million barrels a day, about 60 percent of its consumption.
It is true that energy accounts for a smaller share of the total economy than it did 30 years ago, but the difference is not as profound as it first appears.
The Energy Information Administration, a statistical arm of the Energy Department, estimates that energy expenditures are now about 6.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. By contrast, the energy share soared from 8 percent to 14 percent of gross domestic product immediately after the oil embargo of 1973.
It is soothing to think that the United States' energy intensity has declined because businesses and consumers have become more efficient and more focused on knowledge-based industries like finance, software and technology. But while that is true in part, energy intensity fluctuates with energy prices. Energy prices have been low or declining for two decades, so energy spending has played a smaller role in the total economy. But with oil and natural gas prices both near record levels, the United States is likely to look a lot more energy intensive this year.
Few experts, if any, believe that oil prices are about to tip the United States back into a recession, as happened after four of the five last oil-price shocks. But Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said optimists might be overlooking several worrisome details.
Even though oil consumption has declined as a share of the total economy, Mr. Hatzius notes that oil imports are just as big a share as ever of the gross domestic product. Because oil imports have climbed so sharply, higher oil prices mean that more money leaves the United States and less is simply recirculated from oil consumers to oil producers.
There are other jolts as well. American car companies, for example, have become dependent on the sale of bigger, heavier sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Leave aside last year's frenzy over the Hummer H2 S.U.V., which gets about 11 miles to the gallon but has already seen its popularity plunge.
Consider what happened to Detroit's Big Three car companies in the 1970's, when they found themselves blindsided by demand for small cars. In their panic to change course, they introduced several of the worst new cars of all time: the Chevy Vega, the Ford Pinto and the A.M.C. Gremlin.
''The auto industry has a huge problem,'' said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an independent oil analyst based in Newport Beach, Calif. ''Detroit is once again going to have to retool with hybrid cars of whatever the market demands.''
Not surprisingly, the Bush administration has used high oil prices to argue that Congress should pass energy legislation that would hand out $18 billion in tax breaks to oil and gas companies, renewable-energy producers and others.
But none of that will do much to curb soaring demand for oil anytime soon. At the moment, the only real impulse for energy conservation is the one that comes from higher oil prices.

Abstract: Most people are familiar with the economic misery index, which is calculated by adding the percentage of Americans out of work to the general inflation rate. It was devised by Arthur Okun, an adviser to Jimmy Carter during the 1976 presidential election campaign, and was used to demonstrate how troubled the economy had become under President Gerald Ford. Okun felt that presenting inflation and unemployment figures separately did not give a very broad picture of the economy, because one indicator can rise while the other falls. Jointly rising unemployment and inflation, however, definitely make all people miserable. In a similar fashion, I have compiled a misery index for health care, going back to 1960. As the measure, I took the percentage of Americans without health insurance and added to it the ''excess'' health care inflation rate -- that is, the percentage by which annual increases in medical costs have exceeded general price inflation. As with combined inflation and unemployment, when both of these health care evils simultaneously increase, people are collectively made worse off. Throughout the Reagan boom, however, the health care misery index rose continually. First, the costs of medical care were rising more rapidly than general price inflation. Second, private enrollment in health insurance plans declined relative to population, in part because President Ronald Reagan slashed marginal tax rates, giving employees and employers less incentive to participate in tax-exempt, employer-sponsored insurance. People began to take on themselves the risks of high medical costs. By 1986, the misery index stood at its highest level since 1969.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Rexford E. Santerre is a professor at the Center for Health Care and Insurance Studies at the University of Connecticut School of Business.
Surrounding last week's Congressional debate over Medicare was a blizzard of budget figures, insurance statistics and cost projections -- an illustration of how deeply and confusingly intertwined economics and medicine have become. However, economic measures can clarify the health care picture as well as cloud it. One way for Americans to judge more easily the effectiveness of the new legislation, and of our health care system as a whole, is to adapt a leading tool of political economics: the misery index.
Most people are familiar with the economic misery index, which is calculated by adding the percentage of Americans out of work to the general inflation rate. It was devised by Arthur Okun, an adviser to Jimmy Carter during the 1976 presidential election campaign, and was used to demonstrate how troubled the economy had become under President Gerald Ford. Okun felt that presenting inflation and unemployment figures separately did not give a very broad picture of the economy, because one indicator can rise while the other falls. Jointly rising unemployment and inflation, however, definitely make all people miserable.
In a similar fashion, I have compiled a misery index for health care, going back to 1960. As the measure, I took the percentage of Americans without health insurance and added to it the ''excess'' health care inflation rate -- that is, the percentage by which annual increases in medical costs have exceeded general price inflation. As with combined inflation and unemployment, when both of these health care evils simultaneously increase, people are collectively made worse off.
In compiling the index, I got the insurance figures using past enrollment lists from the Health Insurance Association of America, figures from Medicare and Medicaid, and the Census Bureau's published data on the ranks of the uninsured (making careful adjustments to eliminate possible double-counting). Annual numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics supplied the figures on medical price inflation.
The resulting chart shows the fluctuations in health care misery over the last 43 years, and helps us put today's figures in historical perspective. Clearly, in the early 1960's the index was excessively high. While costs of medical care were largely contained in those days, the problem was that many poor and elderly Americans lacked health insurance (Medicaid and Medicare had yet to be enacted).
From the mid-60's through the 70's the index consistently declined, and for several reasons. In addition to the new government entitlement programs, the percentage of Americans with private insurance rose. This was largely because, as personal income tax rates increased, tax-exempt, employer-sponsored health insurance became more attractive to workers. Also, many commercial insurers that had shunned health insurance markets entered them. They were enticed by a relatively new innovation called ''experience rating'' -- which allowed them to calculate an individualized per-person rate for a company or a small group rather than basing each person's rates on society as a whole. Experience rating allowed these companies to offer consumers lower premiums than the historically dominant carrier, Blue Cross.
The health care misery index bottomed out in 1979 at 5.6 percent. Stagflation may have cost Jimmy Carter the presidency, but it did have one useful byproduct: declining real prices for medical care at a time when a relatively small number of people lacked insurance.
Throughout the Reagan boom, however, the health care misery index rose continually. First, the costs of medical care were rising more rapidly than general price inflation. Second, private enrollment in health insurance plans declined relative to population, in part because President Ronald Reagan slashed marginal tax rates, giving employees and employers less incentive to participate in tax-exempt, employer-sponsored insurance. People began to take on themselves the risks of high medical costs. By 1986, the misery index stood at its highest level since 1969.
Since 1988 the index has become less volatile, ranging from 15 percent to 19 percent annually. The number of Americans lacking insurance has stayed at 13 percent to 16 percent, and the ''excess'' costs of medical care, while high in most people's estimation, have stayed stable.
What do we learn from looking at the index over time? For one thing, it explodes some myths in the current health-care debate. For example, critics of the system often imply that we were better off 40 years ago because medical spending was the equivalent of only about 5 percent of the gross domestic product, whereas today it is some 14 percent. Yes, health care has gotten more expensive, but the facts are that more people are insured today and those insured have more comprehensive coverage. Thus in 2002 the index stood at 17.9 percent, less than half of the misery observed in 1960.
Still, I think most people would agree that today's misery index is still too high, especially when compared to the late 1970's. How do we make health insurance more accessible without significantly fueling medical price inflation? I think the Bush administration proposal to offer people and families a tax credit for purchasing private health insurance appears to be a step in the right direction, as it would give a fairer shake to those without employer-sponsored insurance.
There will probably never be agreement -- between Republicans and Democrats, consumers and employers, health care providers and insurers -- as to the ''acceptable'' misery level. But at least we'll have a better informed debate if we look at the historical big picture.

Abstract: The $87 billion price tag makes the package the most expensive postwar military and civilian effort since the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, after adjusting for inflation. Combined with the earlier $79 billion approved by Congress to conduct the war and pay initial postwar expenses, it would bring the cost to the United States of deposing Saddam Hussein and stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan this year and next to $166 billion. That is more than 25 times the $6.4 billion bill to American taxpayers, in today's dollars, for the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to expel Iraq from Kuwait. The administration's proposal includes $51 billion for military operations in Iraq and $11 billion for military operations in Afghanistan. The military money for Iraq would include $800 million to help cover the costs incurred by other nations that agree to send troops to a multinational division, as well as $300 million to buy more body armor and armored vehicles for American troops, who have been subject to regular bombing and sniper attacks. The White House's overall estimate of $50 billion to $75 billion in civilian reconstruction costs for Iraq, much of which the United States expects to come from other countries, makes clear that the job in Iraq is one of huge scale. At that level, it would be on a par in today's dollars with the reconstruction costs shouldered by the United States for Britain, France and Germany under the Marshall Plan.

Full text: President Bush's $87 billion request for postwar costs is heavily weighted to maintaining military operations, with $65.5 billion directed to the armed forces, $15 billion toward rebuilding Iraq and $5 billion toward building its security forces, and $800 million to new spending for civilian programs in Afghanistan, administration officials said today.
The $87 billion price tag makes the package the most expensive postwar military and civilian effort since the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II, after adjusting for inflation. Combined with the earlier $79 billion approved by Congress to conduct the war and pay initial postwar expenses, it would bring the cost to the United States of deposing Saddam Hussein and stabilizing Iraq and Afghanistan this year and next to $166 billion. That is more than 25 times the $6.4 billion bill to American taxpayers, in today's dollars, for the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to expel Iraq from Kuwait.
Most of the cost of the 1991 conflict -- $60 billion at the time or about $84 billion in today's dollars -- was picked up by allies, including Saudi Arabia and Japan.
This time around, administration officials said, their main financial goal is to squeeze donations from other countries toward the difference between the $15 billion the United States plans to put toward physical reconstruction of Iraq and the total cost, which the White House put at $50 billion to $75 billion.
White House officials said Mr. Bush's request, higher than the $60 billion to $70 billion that Congress had expected, should cover all costs for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. But some analysts said the figure might still prove to be low, especially if the United States cannot quell the growing terrorist threat within Iraq.
''This is the beginning of the administration presenting realistically eye-popping numbers to the American people,'' said Rachel Bronson, director of Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''The number is probably on the low side of what's needed, but we're finally in the realm of realism.''
In his speech on Sunday night, Mr. Bush himself compared his plans to rebuild Iraq with the effort after World War II, saying, ''America today accepts the challenge of helping Iraq in the same spirit.''
His request, though, amounted to an abandonment of a more optimistic plan sketched by administration officials earlier in the year. The administration told Congress in the spring that Iraq's oil revenues would be sufficient to pay the bulk of the postwar costs, which they estimated then would be low.
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz told a House subcommittee in March that Iraq could generate $50 billion to $100 billion of oil revenue over the next two to three years. ''We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said at the time.
Last spring, when it sought the initial $79 billion for the war, the White House asked for $2.5 billion for reconstruction.
''It is fair to say that the level of decay and underinvestment in the Iraqi infrastructure was worse than almost anyone on the outside anticipated,'' a senior administration official said today.
Administration officials said they now expect Iraqi oil revenues to increase from zero this year to $12.1 billion next year and $20 billion a year in 2005 and 2006.
The administration's proposal includes $51 billion for military operations in Iraq and $11 billion for military operations in Afghanistan. The military money for Iraq would include $800 million to help cover the costs incurred by other nations that agree to send troops to a multinational division, as well as $300 million to buy more body armor and armored vehicles for American troops, who have been subject to regular bombing and sniper attacks.
In addition to seeking $15 billion for reconstruction in Iraq, the proposal calls for $5 billion to be put toward building up Iraqi security forces, including an Iraqi Army, a police force and a border and customs agency.
In many ways, the $87 billion figure was the most compelling evidence yet of how Mr. Bush, who campaigned in 2000 against taking on such jobs, has reversed course to take on a more ambitious role in remaking parts of the world than any president since Harry S. Truman.
From 1948 until 1952, the United States spent just under $13 billion on the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, an amount equivalent to about $100 billion today. The parallels to the spending request for Iraq are not exact, because the United States was also spending considerable amounts after World War II to maintain a large military presence in Europe and square off against the Soviet Union in the cold war.
But the White House's overall estimate of $50 billion to $75 billion in civilian reconstruction costs for Iraq, much of which the United States expects to come from other countries, makes clear that the job in Iraq is one of huge scale. At that level, it would be on a par in today's dollars with the reconstruction costs shouldered by the United States for Britain, France and Germany under the Marshall Plan.
To put the request into a different kind of perspective, the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, said $87 billion is roughly equivalent to two years of unemployment benefits, 87 times what the federal government spends on after-school programs and more than 10 times the budget for the Environmental Protection Agency.

Abstract: It's true that the administration is aggressively promoting trade liberalization by pushing for new commercial deals with Latin America, as it has recently done with Chile and is now doing in Central America. It is also pressing for more tariff and quota reductions around the world in an omnibus negotiation that it hopes to conclude within two years under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. These efforts are an excellent start. But there are at least four broader challenges the United States must now confront, and with an urgency that the [Bush] administration has yet to demonstrate. America's economy is the world's most powerful by far, accounting for almost a third of global demand these days, but even if we grow at a healthy rate this year, the United States by itself cannot create a sustainable international economic recovery. Our own revival depends on the health of our companies, and that in turn depends in part on expanding foreign markets. Overseas sales of our goods and services made up at least 25 percent of our economic growth in the 1990's. Moreover, because many of our top companies -- Intel, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, for example -- rely on Europe, Japan and developing countries for more than 30 percent of their revenues, stronger foreign economies are important to the health of our stock markets, the principal financing vehicle for corporate America's expansion. Washington must bring together its economic partners -- the Group of 7 nations made up of Canada and Japan and those in the European Union -- to get the global economy moving again. The United States, which is already running huge budget deficits and has lowered interest rates to levels not seen in generations, has little room to maneuver. But it can encourage the European Central Bank, Europe's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, to lower its relatively high interest rates, since inflation on the continent is not nearly the threat that stagflation is. The European Union must also let up on its growth-constricting demands that Germany, Italy and France restrict spending and, in some instances, raise taxes. The United States and Europe can push Japan to restructure its growth-strangling bank debts.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Jeffrey E. Garten is dean of the Yale School of Management and author of ''The Politics of Fortune: A New Agenda for Business Leaders.'' He held economic and foreign policy positions in the Nixon, Ford, Carter and Clinton administrations.
The Bush administration is leaving no doubt that it intends to use the United States' enormous military power to make the world a safer place. But to succeed, Washington must develop a more robust global economic policy as well. Unless our military confrontations lead to something much better for the millions of people who will be hurt, we will have won the wars and lost the peace.
It's true that the administration is aggressively promoting trade liberalization by pushing for new commercial deals with Latin America, as it has recently done with Chile and is now doing in Central America. It is also pressing for more tariff and quota reductions around the world in an omnibus negotiation that it hopes to conclude within two years under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. These efforts are an excellent start. But there are at least four broader challenges the United States must now confront, and with an urgency that the Bush administration has yet to demonstrate.
The first is reinvigorating global economic growth. The world economy is in trouble: corporate investment and trade are slowing, factories are producing more than they can sell, and deflation is threatening many regions. The two potential economic engines besides the United States -- Germany and Japan -- are stagnating. Big emerging markets, from Indonesia to Brazil, are in deep trouble.
America's economy is the world's most powerful by far, accounting for almost a third of global demand these days, but even if we grow at a healthy rate this year, the United States by itself cannot create a sustainable international economic recovery. Our own revival depends on the health of our companies, and that in turn depends in part on expanding foreign markets. Overseas sales of our goods and services made up at least 25 percent of our economic growth in the 1990's. Moreover, because many of our top companies -- Intel, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, for example -- rely on Europe, Japan and developing countries for more than 30 percent of their revenues, stronger foreign economies are important to the health of our stock markets, the principal financing vehicle for corporate America's expansion.
Washington must bring together its economic partners -- the Group of 7 nations made up of Canada and Japan and those in the European Union -- to get the global economy moving again. The United States, which is already running huge budget deficits and has lowered interest rates to levels not seen in generations, has little room to maneuver. But it can encourage the European Central Bank, Europe's equivalent of the Federal Reserve, to lower its relatively high interest rates, since inflation on the continent is not nearly the threat that stagflation is. The European Union must also let up on its growth-constricting demands that Germany, Italy and France restrict spending and, in some instances, raise taxes. The United States and Europe can push Japan to restructure its growth-strangling bank debts.
Second, there will soon be an acute need to rebuild countries that are either defeated or disintegrating. The estimates for reconstructing Iraq, for example, range from $120 billion over 10 years, in the case of a very short war, to $1.2 trillion after a prolonged conflict, according to extensive work by the economist William Nordhaus. This amount does not include the costs of the administration's vision of spreading democratic and free market institutions in the gulf region.
The job of economic relief and reconstruction will most likely need to be handled by the United Nations, but substantial American financial support will be essential. Given budget deficits at home, this will be no easy task. Will this money come from domestic programs or from foreign aid already promised to others? At the least, the administration needs to work with Congress to incorporate the requirements in planning -- something which Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, has been reluctant to do.
One problem is that there is no single agency in Washington capable of overseeing the extensive United Nations efforts that must be mounted. One needs to be created, just as the Economic Cooperation Administration was established in 1948 to oversee the Marshall Plan. Like it or not, we are entering a decade of political and military tension, and nation-building is going to be a major part of America's response.
Third, we need to prepare for all-too-possible international economic crises. A major run-up in oil prices in reaction to turmoil in Venezuela and Iraq has already begun and could send the global economy into a deep recession. The United States should be working with the European Union and Japan to release emergency oil reserves if oil prices spiral out of control. It should be encouraging Russia to expand production, too, by promising we will buy Moscow's supplies well into the future.
Another crisis could involve the dollar, which was down 15 percent against the euro in 2002. If our trade deficit continues to soar and foreigners get nervous, they could dump their dollars. It would help if Washington could persuade the European Central Bank to lower its interest rates -- which it should do anyway to stimulate economic growth on the continent -- and make the euro less attractive as an alternative to the dollar. Beyond that, Washington, Brussels and Tokyo will have to be prepared to coordinate purchases of the dollar if it goes into free fall.
Latin America could also provide the spark for a global financial debacle. After all, Argentina and Venezuela are in deep trouble, and Brazil's economy is fragile at best. In 1997, a currency collapse in Thailand set off a global financial meltdown. The lesson is that Washington and its economic partners had better focus more on what's happening south of the Rio Grande.
Finally, the United States will have to give much more attention to helping developing countries, the very nations in which so much of today's turmoil exists, get a fairer deal from globalization, which has so far disproportionally benefited rich countries. This means not only negotiating trade agreements but also improving the World Trade Organization's ability to settle trade disputes and to give technical assistance to struggling countries overwhelmed by the blizzard of new trade laws in the last decade. It also means helping the World Bank and its regional counterparts deal with poverty more effectively, rather than just criticizing their performance, which is what Washington so often does.
Admittedly, the Bush administration has never shown much interest in multilateral diplomacy except when other countries press it to the wall, as they have with Iraq. But in the economic realm, there is no choice but to seek partners.
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the United States pushed for the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and coordinated the Marshall Plan with European nations. Washington realized then that economic stability and prosperity were essential to a country's security. It's true today, too.

Abstract: The Bush administration has warned European nations that the American role in NATO will change if the European Union refuses the United States' request for agreements to keep Americans out of the reach of the new International Criminal Court. ''Unfortunately, some voices in the E.U. in recent weeks have suggested that E.U. governments should avoid making Article 98 bilateral arrangements with the United States, pending further consultations toward a common E.U. position,'' Secretary [Colin L. Powell] wrote in the letter. While several European nations viewed these remarks as a veiled threat, Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said ''there is no connection'' between a decision by the United States in favor of a country's membership in NATO and the country's decision on granting an exemption. He said Mr. Prosper's remarks about NATO reflected the administration's deep concerns about the court.

Full text: The Bush administration has warned European nations that the American role in NATO will change if the European Union refuses the United States' request for agreements to keep Americans out of the reach of the new International Criminal Court.
The foreign ministers of the European Union are scheduled to meet at the end of the week in Copenhagen, where they will begin deliberations on whether to grant the United States such an exemption.
The European nations are strong supporters of the court, which opened last month in The Hague and is the first permanent forum for trying people charged with genocide and other crimes against humanity.
The Bush administration is strongly opposed to the court, citing concerns that Americans would be unfairly singled out for politically motivated prosecutions abroad.
The debate complicates the administration's search for support among its closest allies for possible action against Iraq.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell wrote letters to individual European governments dated Aug. 16, asking them to ignore the European Union's request to wait and make a united stand on the issue. He urged them instead to sign separate agreements with the United States ''as soon as possible'' under Article 98 of the treaty that created the court, which the United States says allows nations to negotiate for immunity for their forces on a bilateral basis.
''Unfortunately, some voices in the E.U. in recent weeks have suggested that E.U. governments should avoid making Article 98 bilateral arrangements with the United States, pending further consultations toward a common E.U. position,'' Secretary Powell wrote in the letter.
In a confidential document written by the European Commission, the European Union's executive body, the commission's initial legal assessment is against the United States' request, according to European diplomats who have read the document.
The conclusion states that ''the bilateral agreements proposed by the U.S. are not covered by Article 98. A contracting party to the Statute concluding such an agreement with the U.S. acts against the object and purpose of the Statute.''
A spokesman for the European Commission refused to comment, saying it is European Union policy to neither confirm nor deny the contents of confidential documents.
''This is too delicate a matter,'' said a European Union spokesman in Washington. ''We should wait in about a week when the ministers have discussed the issues and come to a decision.''
Pierre-Richard Prosper, the American ambassador for war crimes issues, said in an interview with the Danish news media last week that if the answer is no, the status quo between the United States and NATO ''will obviously not exist, and we will have to see how we can work through this.''
He also said that if countries that are candidates to become members of NATO did not sign such an agreement, ''it will be an issue that we will have to discuss in the NATO context,'' according to a State Department transcript of the interview.
While several European nations viewed these remarks as a veiled threat, Philip Reeker, a State Department spokesman, said ''there is no connection'' between a decision by the United States in favor of a country's membership in NATO and the country's decision on granting an exemption. He said Mr. Prosper's remarks about NATO reflected the administration's deep concerns about the court.
''The Europeans know our concerns about peacekeeping and NATO,'' Mr. Reeker said. ''We are not prepared to speculate on what alternative strategies we might pursue if our current policy falls short of our goal.''
Last month, after debate over protection for American peacekeepers from the court's jurisdiction, the United Nations Security Council agreed to exempt United Nations peacekeepers from prosecution for a year.
The Bush administration then started a campaign to persuade most countries to sign agreements not to extradite Americans for trial before the court. It warned foreign diplomats that under a new American law, their nations could lose American military assistance if they became members of the court without pledging to protect Americans serving in their countries from its reach.
Romania and Israel have signed such agreements. Switzerland has said it will refuse to do so.
Human rights groups here worry that the administration's position will eventually undermine the court.
''The level of threats has increased dramatically,'' said Richard Dicker, director of the international justice program for Human Rights Watch in New York. ''And threat inflation is a sign of a policy gone amok.''

Dollar Hits A 2-Year Low Against Euro

Abstract: The dollar fell to a two-year low against the euro today and also edged down against the Japanese yen, continuing a months-long slide. The decline came after new data showed that the United States trade deficit had widened to what some economists said was a worrisome level. The monthly trade deficit in goods and services rose in April to $35.9 billion, a record, as rising exports were swamped by an even bigger increase in imports. A broader measure of the country's international financial standing -- the current account balance, which measures investment flows as well as trade in goods and services -- also posted a record deficit of $112.5 billion for the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported. History suggests that no country can go on financing an expanding trade deficit forever. And though there is a spirited debate among economists about when the United States might reach that point, the dollar's current slide suggests that foreign investors are already scaling back the flow of capital into the United States and putting more of their money into stocks, bonds and business ventures elsewhere.

Full text: The dollar, after rising sharply in value for years in a reflection of American economic might, is weakening markedly, mirroring concern about the fragility of the economic recovery and the nation's financial condition.
The dollar fell to a two-year low against the euro today and also edged down against the Japanese yen, continuing a months-long slide. The decline came after new data showed that the United States trade deficit had widened to what some economists said was a worrisome level.
The monthly trade deficit in goods and services rose in April to $35.9 billion, a record, as rising exports were swamped by an even bigger increase in imports. A broader measure of the country's international financial standing -- the current account balance, which measures investment flows as well as trade in goods and services -- also posted a record deficit of $112.5 billion for the first quarter, the Commerce Department reported.
In late trading today, the euro was worth 96.52 cents, up from 95.67 cents a day earlier. The dollar was worth 123.37 yen, down from 123.82 yen.
Since January, the dollar has lost 7.8 percent of its value against other major currencies, according to an index compiled by the Federal Reserve, after rising 33 percent since the mid-1990's. While the dollar is still strong or even overvalued by some measures, its downturn has become pronounced enough that many economists judge it to be at the start of a correction that could continue for some time.
A declining currency would have both positive and negative effects. It would help American manufacturers by making their products less expensive in foreign markets, thereby increasing exports, and could allow domestic manufacturers to recapture sales in the United States by making competing imports more expensive.
But a steady fall in the dollar could put upward pressure on inflation by pushing up import prices, and would make foreign travel more expensive. If the fall in the dollar led investors from abroad to stop putting their money into stocks and bonds in the United States -- and there is already evidence of such a pullback -- interest rates could rise and stock prices could fall further.
Analysts said the dollar's decline appears to have been driven in large part by concern among investors that the United States is not bouncing back as strongly as first hoped from last year's recession.
But they said it was accelerated by other factors, including fear of terrorist attacks and concern after the Enron scandal that more companies will turn out to have overstated their earnings and hidden their liabilities. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates at very low levels has also held down returns on dollar-denominated investments.
While sticking to its official position that it supports a strong dollar, the Bush administration has shown no inclination to intervene in currency markets to support the dollar's value. As a result, investors have concluded that the administration is content to allow the currency to slide, at least for a while.
The crucial question for the economy is whether the erosion in the dollar, should it continue, will be gradual and orderly, as it has been so far, or whether it will turn into a rout that could destabilize the financial markets and endanger the recovery.
''We're probably going to see a substantial decline in the dollar over the next 12 months,'' said Robert D. Hormats of Goldman Sachs International, the investment firm.
''A gradual decline in the dollar shouldn't be surprising and shouldn't be disruptive,'' he said. ''It would be helpful in improving the outlook for the U.S. economy by boosting U.S. exports. But a very sharp decline would induce foreign investors, and indeed U.S. investors, to get out of U.S. financial assets.''
When countries run large trade and current account deficits -- in effect consuming more than they produce -- they must make up the gap by borrowing and attracting investment from abroad.
History suggests that no country can go on financing an expanding trade deficit forever. And though there is a spirited debate among economists about when the United States might reach that point, the dollar's current slide suggests that foreign investors are already scaling back the flow of capital into the United States and putting more of their money into stocks, bonds and business ventures elsewhere.
One outcome, economists said, is a cycle in which a growing current account deficit spurs an exodus by nervous foreign investors, pushing up inflation and interest rates and putting the already weak economy into a stall.
But even a more benign result, in which the dollar remains under pressure but does not collapse in value, could still leave Wall Street on edge.
''Let's be clear: the ballooning trade deficit is reason to sell the greenback,'' said Kenneth T. Mayland of Clear View Economics, a consulting firm in Pepper Pike, Ohio. ''We risk seeing a flood of dollar selling as everybody tries to get through the door at the same time.''
Jay H. Bryson, an economist at Wachovia Securities, said there were signs in today's report on the current account deficit that the pace of foreign investment in the United States was slowing substantially. He said that private foreign purchases of American securities ran at an annual pace of about $260 billion in the first quarter, compared with $400 billion last year, a 35 percent decline.
Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research organization, said it was impossible to know for sure how lengthy and pronounced a slide was in store for the dollar.
''But we've known for a long time that the dollar has been at the way upper range of its value,'' Mr. Prestowitz said. ''We've known for a long time that the trend of the current account deficit is unsustainable, and we've known that the longer it goes on the greater the chance that the adjustment could be disorderly. Now we're at the beginning of an adjustment and we have to hope it's an orderly one.''
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor, said the currency's strength was likely to be influenced mostly by whether the American economy rebounded convincingly this year.
''It's not that there's a better place to invest right now,'' he said. ''It's just that people are concerned about the vulnerabilities of the U.S. economy.''

Two Latin Americas, Two Diverging Outlooks

Abstract: At a time when Europe and North America are each melding into one large market, facilitating investment, Latin America is instead fragmenting economically. Some nations, like Brazil, Chile and Mexico, are pressing ahead with reforms and integration into the global economy, while others, like Venezuela and Argentina, are beset by political problems that create obstacles to growth. The widening economic gaps and differing interests between the two groups, meanwhile, are frustrating attempts at regional trade pacts, like Mercosur, the bloc centered around Brazil, which aspires to be the continent's powerhouse. Until regional trade groups emerge -- or a continentwide trade agreement is reached -- companies face stiff challenges. Mr. [Mataga], the Japanese investor in Venezuela, for example, is hoping to increase exports of the cars produced at his plant after starting to sell some models in neighboring Colombia last year. Much of these hopes are hinged on Venezuela eventually negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Brazil, Mr. Mataga said. Such fundamental steps to opening the economy remain elusive in Venezuela, however, which last week was ranked second to last in a competitiveness list of 49 countries compiled by the International Institute for Management Development of Lausanne, Switzerland. Argentina ranked last. The study was front page news in Venezuela's leading newspapers, testament to the gulf of sentiment between Venezuela's business establishment and blue-sky optimists like Mr. Mataga, the Japanese investor.

Full text: SHUJI MATAGA could not believe his luck.
Mr. Mataga, the president of MMC Automotriz, a Japanese-Venezuelan venture, had arrived in Seoul, South Korea, on April 10 to sign an agreement with Hyundai Motor to enlarge his auto assembly plant in northern Venezuela. But antigovernment protests here had turned into an uprising, and dissident military officials were about to remove Hugo Chavez as Venezuela's president in a short-lived ouster.
Somehow, Mr. Mataga persuaded his Korean partners, who were growing increasingly concerned, to go ahead with the deal.
''Volatility here is a way of life,'' Mr. Mataga, who has lived in Venezuela for three years, said after flying back to Caracas. ''I try to look at the basics -- the population, the cheap gasoline, geographic location. Otherwise the situation is truly worrisome.''
Under a plan to produce 6,000 small Hyundai cars called Elantras by next year, Mr. Mataga's company, which is controlled by the Nissho Iwai Corporation, a large Japanese trading company, will create about 1,000 jobs in the state of Anzoategui. The cost of the expansion is only about $5 million, but that is the kind of investment Latin American nations have been desperate to get, although with little success outside of Brazil and Mexico.
Latin America is expected to grow half a percent or less this year, even less than last year's measly 0.6 percent economic growth. As worldwide growth slowed, or stopped, last year, foreign direct investment in the region fell by 6 percent, to about $71 billion, compared with the previous year, according to the World Bank.
Such anemic growth perpetuates the continent's skewed distribution of income, with the wealthiest 10 percent of Latin Americans controlling 40 percent of the region's income and the poorest 30 percent accounting for less than 10 percent of it. About 211 million Latin Americans, some 40 percent, still live in poverty, and of that number 89 million do not earn enough to cover basic food needs, according to the United Nations.
But at a time when Europe and North America are each melding into one large market, facilitating investment, Latin America is instead fragmenting economically. Some nations, like Brazil, Chile and Mexico, are pressing ahead with reforms and integration into the global economy, while others, like Venezuela and Argentina, are beset by political problems that create obstacles to growth. The widening economic gaps and differing interests between the two groups, meanwhile, are frustrating attempts at regional trade pacts, like Mercosur, the bloc centered around Brazil, which aspires to be the continent's powerhouse.
Although the number of Latin American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange has climbed from exactly one in 1990 to more than 100 today, few of those businesses have made expansion throughout the region a priority -- or a reality. Brazil has multinationals that manufacture jets and process poultry, for example, but they sell more of their products to nations in Asia or the Middle East than to neighboring countries.
''Latin America is at a crossroads after pushing through with a first stage of relatively easy reforms like privatizing aluminum smelters or airlines,'' said Moises Naim, a former minister of trade and industry in Venezuela who edits Foreign Policy magazine in Washington. ''The really difficult work lies ahead, like reforming tax systems or building hospitals that work. Without attention to these granular issues, the region will continue to suffer from violence and pressure on governments to spend freely, the byproducts of inequality.''
How each country proceeds is now more important than ever.
The region is expected to recover in 2003, to perhaps 3.8 percent growth, but only if three things happen: if a global economic recovery led by the United States proceeds, if Brazil elects a president who does not frighten foreign investors and if recessions abate in Venezuela and Argentina, where the government was forced to close the banking system for several days last month to prevent a huge outflow of deposits.
THE economic slowdowns sparked by political crises in those two countries, Latin America's third- and fourth-largest economies, are the exception. Strip out Argentina, whose economy is expected to contract by 10 percent this year, and Venezuela, and Latin America should grow 3 percent this year, said Ricardo Hausmann, a former chief economist at the Inter-American Development Bank who is now a Harvard professor.
Growth varies, of course. The giants, Brazil and Mexico, which together account for nearly two-thirds of Latin America's economy, are expected to grow in the low single digits. The Dominican Republic, with projected growth this year of 4 percent, and Peru, with 3 percent growth, are expected to be the region's best performers.
But all told, the region is not growing fast enough. This year, if Brazil is excluded from the statistics, the regional economy is actually expected to shrink by 1 percent. Yet Latin America needs to grow at least 4 percent to 5 percent a year just to prevent poverty rates from worsening as its population increases.
The economic segmentation of Latin America has a positive side; it may prevent the spread of economic problems in the continent's most troubled parts to other countries. Argentina's dilemma is unique, with politicians unable to cobble together the consensus needed to limit spending by the government. Without such action, Argentina's return to international borrowing markets remains a distant possibility, leaving the government dependent on the unlikely possibility of more investment from rich industrialized countries to finance its day-to-day operations.
Venezuela's problems, meanwhile, are related to policy struggles between Mr. Chavez, a populist president, and the nation's elite. It is seen most sharply at the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, where the two sides disagree on the direction and control of oil policy. For a nation that depends on oil for 80 percent of its export revenue, the tenuous truce between the president and executives at the company is exacerbating uncertainty over the direction of economic policy.
To some, the containment of problems in places like Argentina and Venezuela represents a major step in Latin America's political and economic evolution. As recently as 1994, tension in one part of Latin America could touch off a crisis in another.
When Mexico devaluated the peso that year, the economy of Argentina -- nearly 4,600 miles from capital to capital -- shrank by 3 percent. Even in 1999, Brazil's devaluation of its currency, the real, revealed the vulnerability of currency policy in neighboring Argentina, where a rigid link to the United States dollar exacerbated the already pressing economic stagnation.
According to this school of thought, Uruguay is the only country in the region that may be aversely affected by developments in Argentina.
It may be too easy to assume that foreign investors and Latin Americans themselves have grown more sophisticated in analyzing the region in recent years. Some governments, like the administration in Peru, are worried that losses suffered by large foreign investors in Argentina, particularly utilities and banks from Spain and the United States, may make them wary of acquiring companies elsewhere in the region. Many of Latin America's shared problems, such as dependence on commodities exports whose prices swing widely and on relatively expensive financing from abroad, persist.
BUT the differences among the region's countries have become almost as striking as the region's unequal distribution of wealth.
Mexico, for example, has chosen to uncouple from the rest of Latin America and cast its economic lot increasingly with the United States and Canada. When the United States grows, so does Mexico. As a result, Mexico's reach in international markets has grown, but the country also suffered when the American economy slowed in 2001.
Similarly, Brazil has opened its economy to investment from abroad and has reaped benefits. Its decision to float the real, instead of maintaining a peg to the dollar, not only allowed large Brazilian exporters, like Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica, or Embraer, a maker of small passenger jets, or Sadia, a processed foods producer, to compete better globally, but also put Brazil on stronger financial footing at home.
The Eaton Corporation, a maker of auto parts and aerospace systems based in Cleveland, illustrates the trend. It has increased the value of its plant and equipment in Latin America -- almost entirely in Mexico and Brazil -- to $203 million in 2001 from $193 million in 2000 and $182 million in 1999. Meanwhile, Eaton shrank the total value of its worldwide assets to $2.05 billion last year, from $2.186 billion in 1999.
While Eaton expanded in Brazil, nothing went into Argentina. The one Argentine plant, part of a global division that made truck axles, was transferred to the Dana Corporation in 1997 with the sale of the entire division. Eaton's most recent Latin expansion was a new transmission plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. ''We are just now ramping up production,'' Alexander M. Cutler, the chairman of Eaton, said in a telephone interview.
Earlier, in April 1999, Eaton acquired aerospace equipment plants in Brazil through its purchase of Aeroquip-Vickers. ''Anyone who is a student of the Brazilian economy knows that it tends to have large swings, but you have to look through the swings,'' Mr. Cutler said. ''The growth rate has been attractive.''
Eaton's eight Brazilian plants -- including three in the Sao Paulo area and one in Rio de Janeiro -- mainly make transmissions and clutches for all sizes of trucks, some of which are exported. As for Mexico, Mr. Cutler bragged about a recently announced $250 million contract from Mercedes Benz to supply transmissions for medium-duty trucks to be sold in Europe and Latin America. Eaton has operated in Brazil since 1958.
Regional integration largely depends on Brazil. There, industrialists and officials at Itamaraty, its elite diplomatic corps, are trying to prevent Brazil's influence in South America from eroding if the United States gets its way in negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas, a hemispherewide trade accord, political analysts say.
The United States, for its part, has been reluctant to give too much credence to Brazil's potential leadership role in the region. A recent move to place tariffs on Brazilian steel exports and a perception in Brazil that the United States is unwilling to budge on protecting producers of soybeans, orange juice, beef and sugar -- commodities where Brazil fiercely competes with the United States around the world -- have reinforced the view in Latin America's largest nation that free trade with the United States is more about rhetoric than action.
In the meantime, individual countries like Chile and Mexico have pursued the expansion of bilateral trade pacts while the effort to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas, dominated by the United States, has stalled.
Until regional trade groups emerge -- or a continentwide trade agreement is reached -- companies face stiff challenges. Mr. Mataga, the Japanese investor in Venezuela, for example, is hoping to increase exports of the cars produced at his plant after starting to sell some models in neighboring Colombia last year. Much of these hopes are hinged on Venezuela eventually negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with Brazil, Mr. Mataga said.
In fact, cars from Mr. Mataga's assembly plant could be transported on a highway completed in the late 1990's that connects Venezuela with Manaus, a large city in the Brazilian Amazon. The road was initially expected to bolster trade between the two nations, and although the transport of some goods has increased, stagnation and political instability in Venezuela have prevented closer ties between the countries.
Governments around Latin America are closely following events in Venezuela, where Mr. Chavez's populist policies have led to a lack of confidence in the economy and capital flight estimated at $10 billion a year, said Jose Luis Daza, the emerging markets strategist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
As Mr. Chavez frightened investors with his battle to exert greater control over the national oil company, parts of Venezuela's economy appeared to be spinning out of control. Inflation is expected to triple, to more than 30 percent, and an announcement last week raising the minimum wage will cost the government at least $600 million, money analysts expect to come from oil revenues.
The listless Caracas Stock Exchange reflects the nation's economic angst. Trading volume has dried up since the mid-1990's, with only one issue, Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela, or CANTV, the phone company controlled by Verizon Communications, firmly on the radar screen of foreign investors. Shares in CANTV surged 25 percent the day Mr. Chavez was removed from power, as hedge funds bought it as a bet on Venezuela's economic recovery, said Greg Haywood, a senior analyst at Montgomery Asset Management in San Francisco. (CANTV's stock is now trading at preouster levels.)
Yet if Venezuela's economy underscores the region's risks, the economy in neighboring Peru offers a glimpse of Latin America's fragile opportunities. After several years of stagnation, Peru's economy is expected to grow as much as 3.8 percent this year, assuming the government of Alejandro Toledo remains committed to market-friendly policies in the face of persistent opposition to these measures in Congress.
Mr. Toledo, despite a decline in his popularity, has stuck to a privatization program that could generate about $1 billion of revenue for the government over the next three years. Peru's exports, meanwhile, are climbing and would bring more foreign exchange into the country if not for the decline in prices of some commodities, like zinc, that play a big part in the economy.
In February, as problems in Argentina continued to worry investors, Peru successfully sold $1.4 billion in bonds in international markets, its first such sale in 1928. Still, populist demands in Congress -- tax amnesty proposals for example -- have added to concern over a widening of the budget deficit.
''People in Peru have been against the wall for years,'' Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Peru's finance minister, said in an interview. ''We're happy to see the economy grow more than 3 percent this year but we know Peru needs to grow 7 or 8 percent a year to really make an impact on poverty.''
MUCH growth rates have been rare in the region, but they do exist in some smaller countries. Through much of the 1980's and 1990's, Chile was the star performer after implementing market-oriented policies, but its growth has slowed after a decade of healthy government spending and a decline in prices for commodities like copper. Then, the Dominican Republic displaced Chile as the region's fastest-growing (though still tiny) economy, with average annual growth exceeding 6 percent from 1992 to 2000.
Growth in the Dominican Republic probably slowed somewhat in 2001, as tourism weakened. Still, analysts point to several important measures implemented in the 1990's, like a special tax structure that protects foreign investors' rights, that subsequently encouraged foreign investment in the island nation of 8.6 million. Companies have flocked to Industrial Free Trade Zones, where more than 400 companies employ about 200,000 people.
Such fundamental steps to opening the economy remain elusive in Venezuela, however, which last week was ranked second to last in a competitiveness list of 49 countries compiled by the International Institute for Management Development of Lausanne, Switzerland. Argentina ranked last. The study was front page news in Venezuela's leading newspapers, testament to the gulf of sentiment between Venezuela's business establishment and blue-sky optimists like Mr. Mataga, the Japanese investor.

Abstract: Announcements of job cuts at Motorola and Lucent, and most recently at DaimlerChrysler, seem an ominous sign that the mass layoffs of the early 1990's are about to return. But today, the great American job machine stands more than ready to provide jobs to laid-off corporate workers and dot-com programmers alike. In fact, the rest of the world could only wish it had America's problems. Even though Europe has just seen the first quarter in years in which its economy grew substantially faster than the U.S. economy, unemployment is still more than twice as high in Europe as in the United States, and most European governments are years away from being able to squabble over how they might wish to spend a budget surplus. The United States is leading the world in transforming its economy from manufacturing to services -- the direction of increasing profits in an age of globalization and computerization. This sort of transition will naturally generate a constant stream of layoffs as workers shift from poorly run companies or those trading on old skills to new and more efficient employers. In fact, if there were no layoffs, that would be a sign that the United States was somehow missing needed structural adjustment.

Full text: AuthorAffiliation Norbert Walter is chief economist for Deutsche Bank.
President Bush is concerned about the state of the United States economy, and so is Alan Greenspan. With such prominent voices expressing worry, it may seem heretical to dispute the idea that the economy is in trouble. But before Americans get too gloomy, they should step back and examine the situation carefully. I think they will find that while being alert is fine, panicking is ill-advised.
Announcements of job cuts at Motorola and Lucent, and most recently at DaimlerChrysler, seem an ominous sign that the mass layoffs of the early 1990's are about to return. But today, the great American job machine stands more than ready to provide jobs to laid-off corporate workers and dot-com programmers alike. In fact, the rest of the world could only wish it had America's problems. Even though Europe has just seen the first quarter in years in which its economy grew substantially faster than the U.S. economy, unemployment is still more than twice as high in Europe as in the United States, and most European governments are years away from being able to squabble over how they might wish to spend a budget surplus.
What is wrong, foreigners wonder, with an American economy that is slowing from an unsustainable pace to a more reasonable rate of growth?
The United States is leading the world in transforming its economy from manufacturing to services -- the direction of increasing profits in an age of globalization and computerization. This sort of transition will naturally generate a constant stream of layoffs as workers shift from poorly run companies or those trading on old skills to new and more efficient employers. In fact, if there were no layoffs, that would be a sign that the United States was somehow missing needed structural adjustment.
The layoffs in the early 1990's were an important contributor to the rapid growth of American productivity later in the decade, part of a change to an economy increasingly driven by automated industrial processes and rapid flows of information. The current relative weakness appearing in the industrial sector reflects the same ongoing transformation.
It is very hard for outsiders to believe that the United States -- with housing starts at over 1.5 million units and an unemployment rate at little more than 4 percent -- is in trouble. Nor have retail sales and consumption spending slipped as much as the gloomy headlines and measures of consumer confidence might imply.
There is, of course, an ongoing need for the United States to work hard for higher productivity and to aim at higher household savings and a smaller trade deficit. But why are Americans complaining about a broader economic outcome that -- in principle -- was strongly desired just a year ago? Then, the tight labor market and fast economic growth had analysts calling for higher interest rates to relieve the pressure on labor markets that might otherwise lead to inflation.
And here is a basic question: If things were so good until very recently, how did they become so bad so fast? The answer lies less in what is actually happening than in who is telling the story. The steady drumbeat of worry over the past few months has come almost exclusively from economists who specialize in the stock markets, especially the Nasdaq. There is far less gloom among the American corporate economists I speak to in non-financial companies, people whose main business is to advise top managers on longer-term trends that drive decisions like whether to build new factories or buy equipment. These economists do not often appear on television, but they are close to real-world decisions on employment, order flow and investment. If the layoffs were really such a bad sign, it should be not just Wall Street economists, but, even more so, these others who would sound the alarms.
Viewed from outside the country, there are few signs of serious weakness in the American economy -- just clear evidence that it has come back down to earth from a period of very fast growth before there could be real damage from a permanent rise in inflation. Only six months ago, most American economists still wanted to see the economy cool off. Because the Federal Reserve has done its job well by raising interest rates at the right time, there should be celebration, not trepidation.

Fed Leaves Rates Steady As New Data Pose Few Risks

Abstract: Today's good news about the United States economy was the refreshing absence of bad news: the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates at this morning's monetary policy meeting. Inflation did not rise much in July. And the trade deficit did not widen further in June, as economists had expected. Despite the lowest unemployment rate in a generation, consumer prices edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported. Prices are up just 1.7 percent from a year ago, an extraordinary performance for the seventh year of an economic expansion. And despite the robust dollar and deepening recession in Asia, the United States trade deficit fell by more than $1 billion in June, to $14.2 billion. In dollars, that is still close to a record high, but as a share of the economy -- a more meaningful yardstick -- the trade deficit is still just two-thirds of its 1980's peak. Exports fell, but at a far slower rate than in recent months. Imports fell as well, as businesses bought less equipment from abroad and oil prices dropped another notch. Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve announced that it was leaving its target for the overnight lending rate, known as the Federal funds rate -- a benchmark for all interest rates -- at 5.5 percent, and the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for emergency loans, at 5 percent.

Full text: Today's good news about the United States economy was the refreshing absence of bad news: the Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates at this morning's monetary policy meeting. Inflation did not rise much in July. And the trade deficit did not widen further in June, as economists had expected.
Despite the lowest unemployment rate in a generation, consumer prices edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported. Prices are up just 1.7 percent from a year ago, an extraordinary performance for the seventh year of an economic expansion. And despite the robust dollar and deepening recession in Asia, the United States trade deficit fell by more than $1 billion in June, to $14.2 billion.

Exports fell, but at a far slower rate than in recent months. Imports fell as well, as businesses bought less equipment from abroad and oil prices dropped another notch.
Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve announced that it was leaving its target for the overnight lending rate, known as the Federal funds rate -- a benchmark for all interest rates -- at 5.5 percent, and the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges banks for emergency loans, at 5 percent.
As usual, the central bank offered no explanation of its decision, but hardly any economists were predicting a change in policy. With inflation tame, the economy slowing but not in immediate danger of slipping into recession, and turmoil in Russia and elsewhere, the Fed's best action was inaction.
''The Fed has been very successful, and blessed,'' said Robert Di Clemente, co-head of United States economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. ''Most of us feel that they would have been compelled to tighten if it had not been for the shock from Asia.''
Stocks rose sharply for the second consecutive day. But whatever the market was celebrating, it probably was not economic news, which came as no surprise to Wall Street.
Inflation may well be leveling out after declining for much of this expansion. Right now, however, the strong dollar and the growing share of imports are helping to hold down prices. Consumer prices for goods are up just four-tenths of 1 percent from a year ago. It is not just that imports, like gasoline, clothing and consumer electronics, are cheaper. It is also that inexpensive imports are helping to restrain domestic prices by intensifying competition.
The most encouraging news in today's consumer price report is that inflation in the service sector -- which accounts for two-thirds of spending and more than four-fifths of employment -- is a remarkably tame 3 percent. That is half the rate of inflation in services at the end of the 1980's boom.
''Services inflation is very benign," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber. ''It's higher than goods inflation, but it hasn't accelerated.''
That is true across a wide range of services. From a year ago, for example, housing is up 3.3 percent; car repair, 2.4 percent; haircuts and other personal services, 2.2 percent, and airline and other transportation, 1.2 percent. Even the prices of medical services, a category in which economists expect heftier increases now that the shift to managed care has pretty much been completed, are up just 3.2 percent, faster than a year ago but moderate by past standards.
With labor markets tighter than they have been in decades, employment in services is growing by more than 230,000 workers a month, and wages are rising handily. So the absence of inflation in services is a puzzle.
Like the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Harris said he suspected that the productivity of workers in services might be rising faster than the official measures were capturing. Also, competition in services is fierce, so businesses are having a tough time raising prices.
And finally, cheaper imports are having an indirect effect on wage-setting in the service industry by holding down the cost of living.
The trade deficit will almost certainly keep getting bigger as the troubles in Asia deepen. Exports to Asia have already fallen 21 percent from a year ago, and exports to the rest of the world are growing very slowly. Imports are apt to bounce back; those from Asia are beginning to head higher. Indeed, the trade deficit is likely to remain the biggest drag on economic growth, as it was during the year's first half.
The unexpected improvement in the trade deficit is a temporary respite. June's smaller trade deficit implies that economic growth in the second quarter, which slowed to 1.4 percent from 5.4 percent in the winter, might have been a bit stronger than first estimated. But one detail of today's trade report -- a sharp decline in imports of capital goods -- implies that business spending on new equipment may have been weakening at the end of last quarter. If that is so, the effects would cancel each other out.
So far this year, the widening trade deficit has knocked 2.5 percentage points off economic growth. The negative effect is likely to diminish over time, though economists expect it to persist well into next year.
''That's bad news for American manufacturers, but good news for inflation,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics, a forecasting firm.

Full text: The stock market staged a powerful rally yesterday after the United States and Japan bought yen to bolster the sagging currency, which has threatened to plunge Asia into a deeper economic crisis.
Worries that financial instability in Japan and Southeast Asia would result in a global slowdown this year that would cut even deeper into the already slumping profits of American companies had punished share prices in the United States for the last few weeks.
But investors stampeded back into the market yesterday after the United States Government and the Bank of Japan moved to bolster the value of the Japanese yen, partly in the hope of preventing a deeper economic and currency crisis in Japan and the rest of Asia.
After plunging Monday more than 207 points, or 2.3 percent, on fears of a widening crisis in Asia, enthusiastic buying sent the Dow Jones industrial average soaring 164.17 points, or 1.89 percent, yesterday to close at 8,829.46.
Scores of companies that had been battered recently by a huge wave of selloffs roared back to life in one of the heaviest trading days of the year with more than 744 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. While a wide majority of stocks gained, technology and blue-chip issues led the recovery.
''The market had been going down because of Japan -- Japan was the new wrinkle in Southeast Asia,'' said Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''But now it looks like there's intervention and that Japan's going to deal with its problems, and that is a clear positive for the markets.''
In fact, Wall Street's big rally sparked a comeback in Japan early today. At the midday break, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 4.4 percent, or 647.11 points, to 15,362.49.
The Government's decision to buy Japanese yen with dollars, coupled with promises that Japanese officials would address the deepening banking crisis there, also helped lift the value of the Japanese currency, which had fallen close to an eight-year low on Monday at 146.15 yen to the dollar.
Yesterday, the value of the yen reached 136.37.
United States bond prices, however, plummeted after rising sharply in the last week on the prospect that Asia's economic slowdown would benefit bondholders by dragging down commodity prices and helping stave off inflationary pressure. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.73 yesterday from 5.65 on Tuesday.
For investors yesterday's events were not a clear indication that corporate profits, which are expected to be hurt in the coming year by a strong dollar and falling demand in Asia, were no longer in jeopardy.
''The Asia problem is clearly not going to go away easily,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. ''Investors would like to believe it's going to go away, but it's already clearly had an impact on earnings.''
Indeed, in the last few weeks several large multinational companies have warned that the Asian economic crisis would depress earnings growth this year.
Although the United States economy continues to grow at a robust pace, with few signs of inflation, slowing profit growth in the first quarter of the year and worries that Asia's festering crisis would pinch profits even more led to a sharp selloff beginning in mid-April, after the Dow peaked at 9,211.84.
But yesterday, investors helped ignite the Dow, which soared as much as 230 points before a late wave of selling pushed the index lower. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.52, or 1.79 percent, to 1,107.11, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.33 percent, to 1,776.40.
Oil stocks gained after the price of oil soared on reports that the leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would move to establish more oil production cuts. Tobacco stocks, which rose modestly, may rise higher today because the Senate voted to reject a tobacco bill aimed at curbing smoking.
To prolong the rally, analysts say that Japanese officials are going to have to do much more than commit to banking reform and stimulus packages. ''This is potentially a watershed event for the financial crisis,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. ''However, the real economy in Japan is still going down. But what was crucial for the markets was to see a policy response. And that's what you're seeing now.''
Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley added that a big selloff might yet come later this year if things do not change, at home and in Asia. ''This is a rally on the promise Japan will do something,'' he said. ''So we'll have to see what Japan does, and then assess whether it's enough.''

Abstract: The United States trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in November, though analysts said it was likely to be only a brief respite before the Asian economic crisis leads to larger deficits this year. The trade deficit shrank to $8.037 billion in November from a revised $9.091 billion in October, as both exports and imports declined, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Many economists had expected the deficit to rise. And today, the Japanese Government reported further indications of the trend toward a rising imbalance in trade between the United States and that country. Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose in December by 40.9 percent from a year earlier, and the surplus with the United States rose by 25.4 percent.

Full text: The United States trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in November, though analysts said it was likely to be only a brief respite before the Asian economic crisis leads to larger deficits this year.
The trade deficit shrank to $8.037 billion in November from a revised $9.091 billion in October, as both exports and imports declined, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Many economists had expected the deficit to rise.
The deficits with China, Japan and most Pacific Rim countries also narrowed in November, countering expectations that currency devaluations in Asia would increase United States imports by reducing the cost of foreign-made goods.
Still, despite the declines in the deficits with Japan and China in November, the gaps with those countries over the first 11 months of last year were up 16.7 percent and 24 percent, respectively.
And today, the Japanese Government reported further indications of the trend toward a rising imbalance in trade between the United States and that country. Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose in December by 40.9 percent from a year earlier, and the surplus with the United States rose by 25.4 percent.
For all of 1997, Japan's overall trade surplus expanded by 48.5 percent, the first annual rise in five years, the Ministry of Finance reported.
In a separate report yesterday, the Federal Reserve said that economic ripples from the Asian turmoil were felt in most regions of the United States in recent weeks. ''Manufacturers and agricultural firms report weaker exports to Asia, and there was some evidence of increased competition from Asian products in U.S. markets,'' the Fed said in its regional survey, known as the beige book.
That has helped keep inflation absent from the American economy, the Fed said, noting that ''prices were generally flat'' in the period covered by the survey.
Analysts said the narrowing of the United States trade gap could be accounted for in part by problems with the way the Commerce Department computes the figures.
''We have been arguing for some time that the Government's seasonal adjustment procedure for the fourth quarter produces a narrowing of the deficit,'' said Anne Mills, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. ''Today's numbers are a reflection of the seasonal adjustment, not the underlying data.''
Lee Price, Acting Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, acknowledged that there were problems with the adjustment process, but added that the pattern did not show up consistently in every trade category and that Government economists were reluctant to force a general adjustment on the numbers only to try to correct the trend.
The trade figures could give a lift to the fourth quarter's gross domestic product, which economists had been forecasting to grow at about a 3.5 percent annual rate.
Economists said that the trade numbers for January or February should better reflect the actual trade situation and begin to show the effects of the Asian crisis. ''It's the calm before the storm,'' Ms. Mills said.
The trade deficit for all of 1997 is on target to total $111 billion, matching last year's total, which was the largest since a $115 billion deficit in 1988.
''There isn't any doubt in anyone's mind where the trend is going on trade,'' said James Glassman, chief domestic economist at Chase Securities in New York. ''It would defy logic for it to go the other way.''

Abstract: Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, believes rates are currently caught in a tug-of-war. On one side is the Asian financial turmoil, which some market participants believe will slow the United States economy and keep inflation low, not to mention the flight to quality by investors seeking shelter from those markets that have lowered short-term rates here and supported Treasuries for weeks. Also, the shrinking Federal budget deficit, rising stock market -- despite recent volatility -- strong consumer confidence and strong dollar. On the other side, he said, we have a strong United States economy that has the potential to accelerate inflation, with faster wage gains in a tighter labor market, rising consumer debt including delinquencies, along with personal bankruptcies. And in the middle, there is the Fed.

Full text: Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as stocks gained on upbeat news from Korea over the weekend.
The 30-year bond fell 21/32, to 102 6/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.97 percent, from 5.92 percent on Friday.
Traders said signs of a return to global stock market stability could signal the end of the flight to quality that fueled last week's bond rally.
Bonds also slumped ahead of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting after a larger than expected increase in factory output. The increase of eight-tenths of a percent last month was higher than the four-tenths of 1 percent some economists had expected. It challenged the notion that the economy is slowing, which some thought would be hastened by the Asian market slump.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, believes rates are currently caught in a tug-of-war. On one side is the Asian financial turmoil, which some market participants believe will slow the United States economy and keep inflation low, not to mention the flight to quality by investors seeking shelter from those markets that have lowered short-term rates here and supported Treasuries for weeks. Also, the shrinking Federal budget deficit, rising stock market -- despite recent volatility -- strong consumer confidence and strong dollar. On the other side, he said, we have a strong United States economy that has the potential to accelerate inflation, with faster wage gains in a tighter labor market, rising consumer debt including delinquencies, along with personal bankruptcies. And in the middle, there is the Fed.
''The balance of these pro and con factors favors continued economic growth in 1998, albeit at a noticeably slower pace,'' Mr. Hoffman said.
Yesterday, yields slipped as market participants grew cautious ahead of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting and release of the November Consumer Price Index and housing starts, putting buyers on the side lines. Few in the market expect the Fed will take any action today, but even that did not dissuade the market from pricing the risk premium anyway.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of the fixed-income department at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., thought the market was also concerned about how the Japanese were going to remedy their banking problems. ''That is more important than any of the other stuff,'' he said. ''If no solution is found there is the threat that the Japanese can liquidate some of their Treasury holdings and that could put pressure on prices regardless of what the Fed does. That is the critical issue this week. Even the threat of it happening has put pressure on the market.'' ''Nonetheless, I'm still sticking to a 5.80 yield on the long bond very shortly,'' Mr. Pugliese said.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:

Crisis in Asia No Big Threat, Fed Chief Says

Abstract: Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, teamed up with the Clinton Administration today to offer soothing comments about the turmoil in global markets, saying the problems in Asia and elsewhere should not threaten prosperity in the United States or the soundness of the nation's financial system. While pointing out possible risks from the crisis to the United States and the rest of the world, Mr. Greenspan said the difficulties that had created such volatility in stock markets around the world could even benefit the United States by helping in a small way to suppress inflation. The Federal Reserve has been increasingly concerned that the strong growth in the domestic economy at a time when unemployment has fallen to a 24-year low could lead to rising prices and thwart the long expansion. The Fed voted on Wednesday not to raise interest rates, concerned that tightening monetary policy would further destabilize markets around the world and betting that the American economy might slow sufficiently to avert any inflationary outbreak.

Full text: Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, teamed up with the Clinton Administration today to offer soothing comments about the turmoil in global markets, saying the problems in Asia and elsewhere should not threaten prosperity in the United States or the soundness of the nation's financial system.
While pointing out possible risks from the crisis to the United States and the rest of the world, Mr. Greenspan said the difficulties that had created such volatility in stock markets around the world could even benefit the United States by helping in a small way to suppress inflation.
The Federal Reserve has been increasingly concerned that the strong growth in the domestic economy at a time when unemployment has fallen to a 24-year low could lead to rising prices and thwart the long expansion. The Fed voted on Wednesday not to raise interest rates, concerned that tightening monetary policy would further destabilize markets around the world and betting that the American economy might slow sufficiently to avert any inflationary outbreak.
Mr. Greenspan's comments heartened investors somewhat today. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 86.44 points to close at 7,487.76, partly offsetting Wednesday's 157.41-point decline.
Asked during his appearance before the House Banking Committee today whether the situation in Asia significantly threatened the world economy and international financial system, Mr. Greenspan said no.
''I think we have fallen far short of something where we have serious threats,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''The reason it requires our attention is that we don't wish it to become something which is a far more serious threat to the system.''
Mr. Greenspan's assessment was largely the same offered by Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, who appeared alongside him in fielding questions about the crisis.
Mr. Summers said the ''direct and indirect impact on our economy of a prolonged period of lower growth in Southeast Asia, and the large decline in its currencies, is potentially significant.''
But, Mr. Summers said in his prepared testimony, the Administration does not see ''significant risk to United States financial institutions or to domestic financial stability as a whole as a result of the turbulence to date.''
Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Summers said the fallout from problems in Asia could worsen if steps were not taken by the United States and international financial institutions to restore stability.
They made low-key pleas to the Republican leadership in Congress to restore $3.5 billion in additional financing for the International Monetary Fund requested by the Administration. The financing was deleted from spending bills today in the House and Senate because of a political dispute over American support for family-planning programs abroad.
Mr. Greenspan stayed closely to comments he made about the Asian turmoil before a Congressional committee two weeks ago.
He said the trouble in Asia would reduce American exports to the region and diminish profits of companies that operate there. He said there could be indirect effects on the American economy as the problems of Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea put pressure on the Japanese economy.
''To date, the direct impact of these developments on the American economy has been modest, but it can be expected not to be negligible,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
Questioned about whether a $160 million trading loss by the Chase Manhattan Bank in October signaled broader problems in the American banking system because of events in Asia, Mr. Greenspan said the loss posted by Chase was not particularly big.
''The losses that are involved in those trades in no way threaten in any means whatever the financial status of that institution,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
Before the Asian crisis is over, he added, ''there will be lots of other losses recognized, but they are in nowhere near the orders of magnitude which threaten the financial system of the United States nor any of the major banking institutions in the developed world.''
Mr. Summers used much of his presentation to justify American involvement in international efforts to stabilize the economies and financial markets of Asia and, increasingly, Latin America.
But the Administration's policies came under attack from liberal Democrats for supporting countries like Indonesia. They said the Administration was ignoring human rights abuses, corruption and other problems in Indonesia, and demanded that the Administration make financial aid contingent on improvement in those areas.

Abstract: Torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer. But it highlighted the delicate situation faced by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, as he sought to keep the long economic expansion enjoyed by the United States on track while also taking account of his vast influence over markets and economies in the rest of the world. As if to illustrate just how volatile an environment Mr. Greenspan faces, markets tumbled once again today. Sharp declines in Asian and Latin American markets caused jitters on Wall Street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the United States.

Full text: Torn between fear of incipient inflation at home and concern about unsettling financial markets around the world, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged and ride out the storm for a while longer.
The decision had been widely expected by economists and investors, who saw little chance that the central bank would risk upsetting the global markets by raising rates, even though there is mounting evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the American economy.
But it highlighted the delicate situation faced by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, as he sought to keep the long economic expansion enjoyed by the United States on track while also taking account of his vast influence over markets and economies in the rest of the world.
As if to illustrate just how volatile an environment Mr. Greenspan faces, markets tumbled once again today. Sharp declines in Asian and Latin American markets caused jitters on Wall Street, where investors appeared increasingly convinced that slowdowns in foreign economies would hurt profits of multinational companies and slow growth in the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 157.41 points to close at 7,401.32. It was the steepest drop in the index since the 554-point decline on Oct. 27.
Although the financial turmoil has the potential to do the same thing as a rate increase by the Fed -- slow the economy sufficiently to keep it from overheating -- Fed officials have made clear over the last several weeks that they still view an outbreak of inflation as a real possibility.
Mr. Greenspan said last month that continuing declines in the unemployment rate -- currently at 4.7 percent, a 24-year low -- at a time of strong domestic growth could set off a process in which higher wages would lead to price inflation.
Many analysts believe that if the financial markets were calm the Fed would have seriously considered raising interest rates today, and could still do so in the next three months.
Still, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues have also been keenly aware that the combination of falling stock prices, tumbling currency values and weak banking systems in other countries, particularly in Asia, holds risks for the global economy and for the United States in particular. Raising rates now could make the situation worse by pushing down stock and bond prices and further weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar. Mr. Greenspan is to answer questions about the international markets from the House Banking Committee Thursday morning.
Even as the Fed's policy-making committee was meeting today, the stock market in Brazil, the latest nation to be buffeted by the round-the-world financial turmoil, was falling more than 10 percent.
''Against that kind of backdrop, the Fed doesn't have a lot of choice, and in that sense their decision today was not difficult,'' said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at HSBC Markets in New York. ''In the longer term it gets much more difficult because they will have to take account of the domestic situation.''
Despite some early warning signs of inflation, including a 4.2 percent increase in hourly earnings over the last year, the Fed has left rates unchanged in recent months because actual gauges of prices have remained stable or in some cases have fallen.
Some economists have even been making a case in the last few months that the real danger to the economy is from deflation -- an across-the-board fall in prices -- rather than from inflation. Their argument is built on the premise that the slowdown in the Asian economies, combined with global overcapacity in many industries, could lead to falling prices around the world.
Other economists believe that fears of deflation are vastly overblown, especially since falling prices are likely to be limited to manufactured goods, while prices for services are likely to continue rising. In any case, the deflation argument has so far received only a cursory hearing with the Federal Reserve, where the focus has been squarely on strong economic growth and the pressures that could ignite inflation in the United States.
''All the dangers seem to be on the inflationary side, not the deflationary side,'' Alice M. Rivlin, the Fed's vice chairwoman, said last week.
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Fed will next meet on Dec. 16, and economists said the chances of a rate increase then, so close to Christmas, were almost nil.
But economists are already vigorously debating what situation the Fed will face at its subsequent meeting, in February. One camp believes the global financial upheaval will slow the American economy enough so that no rate increase will be needed and perhaps a rate cut could be justified later in the year.
''There is as logical a case for a rate cut next year as for a rate tightening,'' said James Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities in New York.
The other camp holds that for the last year or two the economy has always seemed to be just months away from slowing to a more sustainable pace, but then continued to grow at a robust pace and to create new inflationary pressures. With unemployment low and possibly heading lower, consumer spending strong and business investment running at high levels, even a downturn in Asia and Latin America might not be enough to eradicate inflationary pressures in the United States.
''The Fed has erred on the side of caution up to this point,'' said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board, a business group in New York. ''As we get into 1998, they may have to take a risk and raise rates to signal that they will take a stand against the inflationary pressures that are present.''
Economists will be looking particularly hard over the next few months for indications of whether productivity -- the output of a worker in one hour -- is rising fast enough to offset the increases in wages. Corporate profits have remained strong enough this year to suggest that productivity continues to outpace wage gains, economists said. But with companies increasingly being forced to pay more to attract the numbers and quality of workers they want, it is unclear how long that situation will continue, they said.

Abstract: With economic troubles in Southeast Asia and Japan and China's exports booming, Administration officials meeting with finance ministers from around the world said today that they feared the United States was headed toward a revival of huge trade deficits with Asia that could provoke a backlash in Congress. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin met with his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, in a session that one Japanese official described as ''quiet but very tense.'' Mr. Rubin urged him to make sure that Japan did not attempt to crawl out of its recession by boosting exports to the United States. Moreover, Mr. Clinton is about to welcome China's President, Jiang Zimen, to the United States for the first state visit of a Chinese leader since before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. With little progress to boast about on the human rights front, Mr. Clinton's aides had hoped to emphasize the foreign policy benefits of an expanding trade relationship with China.

Full text: With economic troubles in Southeast Asia and Japan and China's exports booming, Administration officials meeting with finance ministers from around the world said today that they feared the United States was headed toward a revival of huge trade deficits with Asia that could provoke a backlash in Congress.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin met with his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, in a session that one Japanese official described as ''quiet but very tense.'' Mr. Rubin urged him to make sure that Japan did not attempt to crawl out of its recession by boosting exports to the United States.
Yet Japanese executives concede that is already happening, and they say they have little choice now that their biggest market -- Southeast Asia -- is reeling from a summer-long currency crisis that is spreading to other nations.
''No one wants to admit it out loud,'' said one senior Japanese executive here for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. ''But now there is no place else that still has strong demand for Japanese goods except the U.S.''
According to many estimates circulating here, Japan's surplus with the United States will exceed $65 billion this year, roughly a 20 percent increase from last year.
The sudden revival of trade deficits -- an issue on which President Clinton focused intently for the first three years of his presidency, then scarcely mentioned -- comes at a politically inopportune time for the White House. Mr. Clinton is battling in Congress for a renewal of his power to strike new trade accords around the world.
But he is running into strong opposition on both the Democratic left and the Republican right, much of it rooted in suspicions that American workers have gained far less from from the Administration's embrace of global competition than Mr. Clinton contends.
Moreover, Mr. Clinton is about to welcome China's President, Jiang Zimen, to the United States for the first state visit of a Chinese leader since before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. With little progress to boast about on the human rights front, Mr. Clinton's aides had hoped to emphasize the foreign policy benefits of an expanding trade relationship with China.
That will now be difficult. Most American estimates now suggest that China's trade deficit with the United States will exceed $50 billion for the first time this year, making it nearly the size of Japan's.
Moreover, efforts to speed along negotiations to get China into the World Trade Organization -- which would require it to adopt rules that would further open the Chinese market -- have bogged down. Administration officials are now playing down the potential discussion of that subject at the Washington summit meeting.
''Wherever you look in Asia, America's trade numbers are about to go bonkers,'' said Kenneth Courtis, the global economist at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo. ''And we are just beginning to see the political fallout.''
Large trade deficits themselves are not necessarily bad news for the American economy. A steady stream of competitive imports helps keep inflation in check. America's soaring trade deficit numbers also reflect the fact that the United States has one of the healthiest economies in the world, while its trading partners are not growing fast enough to attract more imports.
But trade politics and trade economics are often two very different things. So today in his meeting with Mr. Mitsuzuka -- a longtime leader of the Liberal Democratic Party and a veteran of many trade disputes -- Mr. Rubin took the unusual step of inviting the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, to join him in arguing that Japan must act now to revive its economy.
Japan's usual response has been to launch major public works programs, but at one American official said recently, ''There are only so many roads and train tracks you can build to nowhere. And they've built them.'
Mr. Rubin said later that he thought that his message had gotten through. ''It is fair to say that they, too, are concerned about domestic demand and sustainable, solid growth,'' he said. But he stopped short of saying that he had urged Japan to cut taxes.
The trade problem has been exacerbated by the currency crisis in Southeast Asia. Those emerging markets have been a major customer for American exports. But Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are now canceling major projects, including dams and airports, to trim their own large deficits.
They also have been forced to devalue their currencies, making their goods more competitive on world markets and American goods, priced in dollars, sharply more expensive. Equally important, Southeast Asia accounts for slightly less than half of Japan's exports, and some of those goods will undoubtedly be redirected to the United States.
In the currency markets, this has led to some speculation that the United States would attempt to weaken the dollar, to make American goods more attractive abroad.
But Mr. Rubin has given no hint of that and today at a meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven top industrial nations, there was a veiled warning to Japan not to try to drive down the yen to boost its own exports.

Abstract: "The Korean public is led to believe that these things are getting out of hand, and it's affecting our welcome here," said the American Ambassador in Seoul, James T. Laney. "It's a cause for great concern." The United States, on the other hand, wants South Korea to pick up more of the tab for stationing troops in South Korea. Americans see little reason why they should pay more Korean taxes when they are already helping defend South Korea -- and paying for the privilege. The United States now pays not only all the dollar costs of maintaining troops in Korea, like soldiers' pay, but also two-thirds of the costs incurred in local currency, like payments to support staff. The Seoul Government is willing to increase its payments, amounting to a one-third share, only by the amount of inflation. But the United States argues that South Korea's extraordinary economic growth means that Seoul can now pay more of its own way.

Full text: It all began when an American soldier put his hand on a Korean woman's rump.
The version that has captured the local imagination is that a group of drunken American soldiers were rampaging through the subway, molesting Korean women, and that the soldiers then attacked good citizens who dared protest the errant hand.
That episode, which is expected to lead to the public trial soon of four Americans, has added to an outcry in South Korea against what many Koreans perceive as a wave of violence by American soldiers, and a system that is tilted to allow them to get away with it.
"We strongly condemn U.S. military personnel who do not repent and who continue to commit outrageous criminal offenses," declared a group that calls itself the "headquarters to bring an end to crimes by U.S. military stationed in Korea."
The American understanding of events starts with a fact that the Koreans tend to leave out: The American soldier and the Korean woman whose behind he patted were in fact a married couple.
The Americans say the problems arose when some angry young Koreans on the subway accused the American of sexually harassing the Korean woman. When the Korean woman explained that she was the American's wife, the Korean men allegedly spat at her and slapped her -- leading the woman's husband to punch the man who slapped her.
In any case, the result that evening in May was a huge brawl in the subway. It has reverberated through the country and underscored the delicacy of the mission of the 37,000 American military personnel in bases in South Korea.
South Korea is an intensely nationalist country. Some Korean and American officials alike worry that public irritation about crimes committed by American troops could undermine the public support for the American bases in South Korea.
"The Korean public is led to believe that these things are getting out of hand, and it's affecting our welcome here," said the American Ambassador in Seoul, James T. Laney. "It's a cause for great concern."
Mr. Laney says the problem is not that American soldiers are committing more crimes, but that an irresponsible Korean press is portraying them in a particularly lurid way to an inflamed public.
Many Koreans say that whether or not crime is getting worse, the problem is that American soldiers get special treatment when they commit crimes.
"The problem is not in the crime itself, but in the criminal process," said Kwon Suk Hun, a 23-year-old student council officer at Yonsei University, traditionally a hotbed of social protest. "This process reflects the imperialist characteristics of the U.S. Government."
The United States and South Korea agreed this summer to review the Status of Forces Agreement, known as SOFA, which governs such issues as the treatment of American soldiers charged with committing crimes in Korea. Korean courts have jurisdiction, although soldiers may also face court-martial and other penalties under American law.
"The Korean public's perception is that the SOFA is not meeting with a sense of justice," said Yim Sung Joon, director general of the American affairs bureau in the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Yim said the most important issue is to revise the agreement so arrested American soldiers may be held in Korean custody while awaiting trial.
Now they are released to the American military, although they are made available to the Korean authorities for questioning.
If convicted of crimes, American soldiers are jailed in a special wing of a Korean prison, where eight are now serving sentences. If they are sentenced to death by a Korean court, the Americans could be executed, although this has not happened and none is on death row now.
A measure of the public sensitivity in South Korea is that one of the best-known Americans in the country is Kenneth Markle 3d, an Army private convicted of murdering a Korean prostitute in 1992. The case led to huge demonstrations and anti-American protests, as well as calls for the death penalty for Private Markle, but in the end he was sentenced to a 15-year term, which he is serving.
While cases like the subway incident are seen by Koreans as evidence of the need for protection from rampaging Americans, to Americans they show that they need protection from a skewed local judicial system. After the subway brawl, no Koreans were indicted, but four Americans were.
These kinds of problems, of course, are neither new nor confined to South Korea. They were a factor in the closing of American military bases in the Philippines in 1992.
But in South Korea, the upshot is that with the atmosphere strained because of protests over crime by American soldiers, each side is now demanding more of the other. Lee Jang Hee, one of the leaders of a group that has gathered more than 40,000 signatures seeking to revise the Status of Forces Agreement, says American tax privileges in Korea should be revoked.
The United States, on the other hand, wants South Korea to pick up more of the tab for stationing troops in South Korea. Americans see little reason why they should pay more Korean taxes when they are already helping defend South Korea -- and paying for the privilege.
The United States now pays not only all the dollar costs of maintaining troops in Korea, like soldiers' pay, but also two-thirds of the costs incurred in local currency, like payments to support staff. The Seoul Government is willing to increase its payments, amounting to a one-third share, only by the amount of inflation. But the United States argues that South Korea's extraordinary economic growth means that Seoul can now pay more of its own way.
Japan, in contrast, pays all the costs incurred in local currency for maintaining United States forces stationed in Japan.
Could accusations about criminal behavior and demands for changes in the Status of Forces Agreement lead the United States to decide that it is not worth the bother and expense of defending South Korea?
The Clinton Administration says that despite occasional difficulties, the troops in South Korea are as essential now as they ever were.
Mr. Yim also said a withdrawal was unlikely.
"Keeping troops on the Korean peninsula is in U.S. interests," he added, a bit nervously. "So I'm sure the U.S. won't bring them home."

Abstract: Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said bond market participants paid close attention to both housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook because they were "statistics that further indicated a slowdown in business activity, although by now this is news only for those recently arriving from Mars." Mr. Fine says inflation as measured by the consumer index is a lagging indicator and is likely to increase further as the year progresses, though in a nonthreatening manner. "But inflationary expectations, which matter most for bond yields, have clearly lessened in response to the slower rate of economic growth," he said. Some analysts, however, are not as optimistic that the threat of inflation has receded. Anthony E. Spare, chief investment officer of Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates, a $2 billion San Francisco money management firm, sees the economy in transition. "We are going to go from the best of all worlds of rapid growth and low inflation to the worst of all worlds, higher inflation and slower growth," he said. "Everyone has built in their own expectations of a soft landing, but the odds are low for such an occurrence."

Full text: Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday after a rally set off by signs of an economic slowdown faded.
A series of reports released yesterday indicated the economy had slowed enough to subdue inflation. These reports, which included a modest pickup in consumer prices in February, suggest that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets on March 28.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 , to 1032/32 , after being up about a point in intraday trading. At that price, the bond was yielding 7.37 percent, up from 7.36 percent on Wednesday. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. Market participants said the yield had been down as low as 7.28 percent, the lowest in nine months.
In early trading, the market turned higher following the release of the Consumer Price Index for February. The index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. Its core rate, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, also rose three-tenths of 1 percent.
In a separate report, housing starts fell 2.6 percent in February, to an annualized rate of 1.323 million from 1.38 million in January.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, in a survey of regional business activity, said its index fell in March to 3.3 from 11.9 in February. Traders had been expecting the index to slip to 10.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said bond market participants paid close attention to both housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed business outlook because they were "statistics that further indicated a slowdown in business activity, although by now this is news only for those recently arriving from Mars."
The increase in the Consumer Price Index was duly noted, he said, but had little market impact because it was fully anticipated.
Mr. Fine says inflation as measured by the consumer index is a lagging indicator and is likely to increase further as the year progresses, though in a nonthreatening manner. "But inflationary expectations, which matter most for bond yields, have clearly lessened in response to the slower rate of economic growth," he said.
Some analysts, however, are not as optimistic that the threat of inflation has receded. Anthony E. Spare, chief investment officer of Spare, Kaplan, Bischel & Associates, a $2 billion San Francisco money management firm, sees the economy in transition. "We are going to go from the best of all worlds of rapid growth and low inflation to the worst of all worlds, higher inflation and slower growth," he said. "Everyone has built in their own expectations of a soft landing, but the odds are low for such an occurrence."
Bond prices were also supported for most of yesterday by a stronger dollar. But there was late profit taking after word of a large bond sale by a large institutional investor. There was talk among traders that an insurance company had sold substantial holdings in five-year notes and other longer maturities, though the identity of the insurer could not be determined.
In the municipal market, where investors have been hungry for new issues, the Virginia Housing Development Authority competitively priced $100 million of its commonwealth mortgage revenue bonds won by Prudential Securities.
Underwriters said the bonds were insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, giving them a triple-A rating from Moody's Investors Services Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The maximum yield was 6.45 percent for a bond due in 2028, with the next-best yields at 6.40 percent for a bond due in 2022 and 6.35 percent in 2018. For shorter maturities, yields on serials bond range from 6.15 percent in 2011 to 6.30 percent in 2014 and 2015.

MEXICO IS FACING NEW RESTRICTIONS TO GET U.S. HELP

Abstract: "This is scary," said Jonathan E. Heath, an economist in Mexico City. "A recession is already unavoidable. The concern for the United States Government is probably that if you start pursuing a very restrictive monetary policy, and things start to get bad, the Mexican Government will want to let up." "We recognize there's not going to be an easy way out," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. "What they're talking about in Washington now is just a difference of degree." When Mr. [Robert E. Rubin] described the bailout plan in Congressional testimony several weeks ago -- after President Clinton abandoned any hope of getting Congress to pass the program and acted on his own to provide Treasury funds for loans and loan guarantees -- he said that "in the unlikely event" that Mexico defaulted on its United States-backed loans, foreign purchasers of Mexican oil would be required to remit their payments to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That money, in turn, would be used to pay American investors.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
After three days of intense negotiations with top Mexican officials, the United States is preparing to announce details of a plan to bail the country out of a continuing currency crisis, including newly toughened restrictions that are likely to send already high Mexican interest rates soaring.
Details of the plan were still being negotiated here tonight between Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin and Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, who has been in Washington since Thursday. A spokesman for Mr. Rubin said that negotiators were making progress, but it was unclear whether any agreement would be concluded on Monday.
The new conditions, described by Americans and Mexicans familiar with the talks, pose enormous political problems for President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.
To get the $20 billion in direct American help that the Clinton Administration announced last month, Mr. Zedillo's Government is agreeing to shrink Mexico's money supply, even if that means interest rates of 50 percent or more on business loans and home mortgages.
Also included in the draft of an agreement here is a toughening of a highly controversial condition that Washington is placing on the Mexicans: The United States would effectively control the flow of the billions of dollars that Mexico earns every year from the export of its oil, starting in the next few months.
Under an earlier plan, the United States would have control of Mexico's oil revenue, its biggest single source of foreign currency, if Mexico defaulted on some of its American-backed obligations.
The newer, even more stringent conditions seem bound to open Mr. Zedillo to charges at home that he has permitted the United States to dictate his country's economic policy, an enormously sensitive matter in Mexican politics.
But Clinton Administration officials, fearful that they will be blamed by both Republicans and Democrats if Mexico requires another bailout later this year, have insisted in recent days that there is no other choice.
Anything short of Draconian fiscal discipline, they insist, will mean that foreign investors continue to pull money out of the country -- and the problem the Administration raced to solve last month could return as a bigger crisis.
If a recession in Mexico follows -- which many Mexican and American economists consider a real risk -- the result could be more social unrest in the country, where a 14-month-long rebellion in a southern state, Chiapas, is already plaguing Mr. Zedillo's weakened three-month-old administration. Last week, his party overwhelmingly lost an election in a big western state, Jalisco, and several more such elections are scheduled later in the year.
At the heart of the negotiations between United States and Mexican officials this weekend was the Clinton Administration's fear that Mr. Zedillo, under growing political pressure, would be tempted to print more money or to lower interest rates before the coming state elections.
The result, in a nation where inflation was running in January at an annual rate of more than 45 percent, could be even steeper inflation. The current level is already a shock to Mexicans, because last year inflation dropped to less than 10 percent for the first time in recent memory.
However, maintaining interest rates at a high level -- they are already more than 40 percent to keep up with the rising inflation -- seems bound to touch off a recession, and with it the possibility of kindling for social unrest.
"This is scary," said Jonathan E. Heath, an economist in Mexico City. "A recession is already unavoidable. The concern for the United States Government is probably that if you start pursuing a very restrictive monetary policy, and things start to get bad, the Mexican Government will want to let up."
That is what Washington says Mexican officials did last year, as the Presidential election neared.
When the Clinton Administration announced its plan last month, Mexican officials knew that it would carry tough conditions that would be difficult to sell at home.
But they were not counting on such a large run-up in inflation in January, making it all the more painful to meet the plan's conditions. Similar conditions apply to about $30 billion in other help promised to Mexico in the last month, including $17.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund.
"Investors are still nervous about Mexico," a White House official said last week, after the value of the peso had again dropped. "And if the markets are nervous, we have to be nervous."
A Mexican finance official familiar with the discussions said tonight that even before Mr. Ortiz left for Washington last week, there was an understanding that with inflation and interest rates above what had been forecast, the Government would have little choice but to tighten the money supply.
"We recognize there's not going to be an easy way out," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. "What they're talking about in Washington now is just a difference of degree."
The official said the Mexican Government recognized the social risks involved in such moves and was preparing several responses, including an emergency jobs plan, using funds from an antipoverty program. The Government will also zero in on areas of high unemployment and political instability with more than 500,000 job-training grants.
The first victims of the tight monetary plan are expected to be Mexico's weaker banks. At least 8 of the 18 major banks are already considered on the brink because many of their clients cannot repay loans carrying variable interest rates that have soared in recent weeks. There are virtually no fixed-rate loans available in Mexico, so everyone from large companies to ordinary homeowners have been hit hard by the fallout from the currency crisis.
Several of those banks seem likely to be merged in the next few weeks, for fear that investors, particularly United States investors, would otherwise remove funds invested in certificates of deposit in the last year or so. The banks are holding about $8 billion in such assets now, and if these are not reinvested, the money is expected to fly to safer havens.
Under previous pressure from the United States, Mexico had agreed to open its banking system to acquisitions by foreign banks.
All this is expected to put great pressure on Mr. Zedillo, an economist by training. In the last few days, he has been on the phone to Mr. Ortiz and to top United States officials, who have tried to lay out the economic and political tradeoffs.
They have told him that while the tight monetary policy would be painful for the next year or so, it was the best hope of stabilizing the economy. At the same time, they are trying to give him some political cover, so that it does not appear he has fully capitulated to American conditions.
One of the provisions carrying the most potential volatility is proposed American control of the revenue from Mexico's oil, a cherished national asset and the source of $7 billion to the Government each year.
When Mr. Rubin described the bailout plan in Congressional testimony several weeks ago -- after President Clinton abandoned any hope of getting Congress to pass the program and acted on his own to provide Treasury funds for loans and loan guarantees -- he said that "in the unlikely event" that Mexico defaulted on its United States-backed loans, foreign purchasers of Mexican oil would be required to remit their payments to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That money, in turn, would be used to pay American investors.
But members of Congress including Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, charged that the plan provided insufficient protection. And Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, told Mr. Rubin it was ludicrous to think that Washington would cut off Mexico's oil earnings, for fear that such a move would cause wide protests.
To mute such Congressional criticism, the new accord would require foreign buyers of Mexican oil to send their payments through the New York Federal Reserve Bank, starting in the next few months, regardless of how well Mexico was paying off its obligations.
It is unclear, however, whether that move alone would satisfy Mr. D'Amato, who, with other members of Congress, introduced a bill last week requiring the Treasury to issue much fuller reports about the details and progress of its bailout effort.

The nation's difficulties should have only modest effects on the overall United States economy, private economists said. Indeed, the peso's drop, making Mexican goods cheaper for Americans to buy, is likely to shave one- or two-tenths of a percentage point off the inflation rate in the United States during the next two years, according to Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The United States is preparing to spend billions of dollars, possibly as soon as next week, to help Mexico in its financial crisis. The money would be used to prop up the peso in foreign-exchange markets and help make payments on Mexico's national debt, an Administration official said today.
The money would be in addition to the $6 billion line of credit that the United States made available to Mexico last week. It would most likely consist of American loans to the Mexican Government and possibly American purchases of pesos in currency markets, the official said.
The Administration official confirmed that discussions were under way on providing assistance to Mexico, but refused to be quoted directly on any details.
The preparations reflect the Clinton Administration's assessment that Mexico is too important to the United States to be left without assistance at a time of severe economic and financial stress. The goal of the package would not be to obtain greater leverage over Mexico on areas of specific dispute like drugs or illegal immigration, but rather to help assure Mexico's long-term economic and political stability.
Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said tonight that "in approaching this situation, we've recognized the central importance of Mexico to the United States because it is our second-largest trading partner, because we share a 2,000-mile border and because our societies are so closely intertwined."
Bankers and analysts gave a cautious welcome to reports that the United States was preparing a multibillion-dollar aid package for Mexico. But they said that any revival of confidence in Mexico's battered currency and economy would be fragile for a long time to come. [ Page D6. ]
The scale of the assistance is unclear, and would not represent the first time the United States has helped Mexico. In 1982 Washington bought extra oil from Mexico and the Federal Reserve urged commercial banks to reschedule Mexico's foreign debt after it defaulted.
Further assistance from other rich industrial nations -- notably Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- remains possible this year, but American officials have had few conversations with them so far.
The Administration official who disclosed the broad rescue plan also confirmed rumors tonight that Mexico had not yet spent any of the $6 billion line of credit to support the peso. This suggests that Mexico may be waiting until the United States is ready to help in a coordinated intervention in the currency markets to drive up the peso.
The country's volatile financial markets started to calm down today with both the stock exchange and the peso improving.
Within the financial markets, attention has focused in recent days on Mexican Government bonds that are falling due in coming weeks. American officials refused to give specifics about the workings of the bailout package.
But it is clear that Washington's efforts to help are not directly aimed at supporting the peso or relieving Mexico of its obligations to pay off the bonds. Instead, the United States is focusing on the overall problem of making sure that Mexico has enough money to meet these short-term needs.
The understanding has been that any American help would have to be repaid.
The peso -- after dropping nearly 40 percent in the last week and a half -- bounced back by more than 14 percent today, partly on a series of rumors of international assistance to Mexico. The main one was that Canada, the United States and the International Monetary Fund would set up a fund of $10 billion to $15 billion to help the Mexican Government make the bond payments.
But an international monetary official who insisted on anonymity said tonight that all stories of an I.M.F. bailout were false. Because Mexico still owes $4 billion to the I.M.F. that it borrowed in 1989 and the early 1990's, the monetary fund's rules require that any new line of credit come after the negotiation of a comprehensive economic plan it has approved, a process that takes many months.
Top Mexican officials were so confident that 1994 would be a year of financial and economic success that they allowed a $5.4 billion line of credit at the International Monetary Fund to expire on May 25, 1993.
The I.M.F. is a 179-nation organization based in Washington that serves as the lender of last resort for countries facing currency crises.
The Mexican bonds, known as tesobonos, pay interest and principal that is calculated in dollars but paid in pesos. If it takes more pesos than before to buy a dollar, as has been the case this week, then Mexico must pay more pesos to redeem these bonds. International bankers said today that $3.6 billion of these bonds would fall due next month.
Mexico's usual practice until now has been to sell new tesobonos, often to foreigners, and use the proceeds to redeem others falling due.
But the collapse of foreign demand for the Mexican bonds has left the Government there with a stark range of choices: It can print more pesos, which risks higher inflation; it can borrow the money at home, which might send interest rates so high that they bring on a recession in Mexico, or the Government can find a foreign country, like the United States, willing either to buy new bonds or to lend Mexico a few billion dollars until other foreigners become interested in these bonds again.
Mexico's situation is made even more difficult because it needs money at the same time to prop up the peso.
Mr. Summers and several assistants have handled the issue in close consultation with Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. They have exchanged so many phone calls with Mexican officials that they now recognize each others' voices instantly over the phone.
Former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, before stepping down on Dec. 22, also spoke frequently with his new Mexican counterpart, Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche.
Frank N. Newman, the acting Treasury Secretary, and Robert E. Rubin, assistant to the President for economic policy, who has been chosen by Mr. Clinton to replace Mr. Bentsen, are both on vacation this week. They have kept in touch by telephone with developments in Mexico. Members of Congress who scattered on Christmas vacations have largely ignored Mexico's troubles.
The nation's difficulties should have only modest effects on the overall United States economy, private economists said. Indeed, the peso's drop, making Mexican goods cheaper for Americans to buy, is likely to shave one- or two-tenths of a percentage point off the inflation rate in the United States during the next two years, according to Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers.
But if Mexico fell into a deep recession because of the peso's troubles, that might affect the United States economy by reducing growth here, also by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point in 1995 and 1996, Mr. Sinai said.
These effects are assumed to be modest because the Mexican economy is not big by the standards of industrial powers. While the Clinton Administration has portrayed sales of American-made goods to Mexico as a source of jobs and prosperity, these sales are quite small when seen in comparison with the broad economy of the United States.
Through September of this year, for example, American exports to Mexico totaled $37.52 billion, amounting to only three-quarters of 1 percent of all goods and services produced in the United States in that period.

Abstract: Officials in Mr. [Talbott]'s party said Mr. [Kengo Wa Dondo] could not succeed in office without a measure of support from Zaire's traditional foreign partners: the United States, Belgium and France. And if he fails, they said, Zaire, one of Africa's largest countries, with one-quarter the land mass of the United States and 41 million inhabitants, is in danger of disintegration. Mr. Talbott said that for now United States cooperation with Zaire, largely suspended after violent riots in 1991, would remain limited to relief supplies. Even diplomats who support the current opening to Zaire acknowledge that in addition to using Mr. Kengo, Mr. [Mobutu Sese Seko] has repeatedly used the tactic of presenting putatively reform-minded Prime Ministers to the West as a means of buying himself time to refill his coffers and undo his adversaries.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
In a sign of support for a new Prime Minister's reform efforts in a country led by one of Africa's most corrupt and repressive governments, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott made a brief visit here today and said Washington was considering sending an ambassador to Zaire.
Mr. Talbott, who is on a tour of several African countries, met with Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo during a stopover between visits to Malawi and Ghana.
In carefully worded comments about the visit, Mr. Talbott said United States backing for the new Prime Minister would be closely coordinated with his reform efforts and did not represent an embrace of Zaire's long-reigning dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko.
Officials in Mr. Talbott's party said Mr. Kengo could not succeed in office without a measure of support from Zaire's traditional foreign partners: the United States, Belgium and France. And if he fails, they said, Zaire, one of Africa's largest countries, with one-quarter the land mass of the United States and 41 million inhabitants, is in danger of disintegration.
"We are considering sending an ambassador, which would be a modest step," Mr. Talbott said. "After all, we have ambassadors in a lot of countries where we disagree with things happening there."
Critics of Mr. Kengo say the Prime Minister, who was appointed in July, has already twice led governments under Mr. Mobutu. In the end, they say, Mr. Kengo will prove as unwilling or unable to change Mr. Mobutu's system of tight political control as in the past.
A 1991 conference that sought unsuccessfully to organize a democratic transition in Zaire cited Mr. Kengo for large-scale embezzlement during his two previous stints as Prime Minister in the early and late 1980's. He has also been accused of playing a role in the massacre of students at Lovanium University in Zaire in 1969, when he was Justice Minister.
Mr. Talbott said that for now United States cooperation with Zaire, largely suspended after violent riots in 1991, would remain limited to relief supplies. Even diplomats who support the current opening to Zaire acknowledge that in addition to using Mr. Kengo, Mr. Mobutu has repeatedly used the tactic of presenting putatively reform-minded Prime Ministers to the West as a means of buying himself time to refill his coffers and undo his adversaries.
Western diplomats, including Mr. Talbott's delegation, credit Mr. Kengo with moves to rein in ruinous inflation and to reimpose state authority over a formal economy that has virtually ceased to exist.
Among Mr. Kengo's early reform measures has been a still-unresolved bid to remove what diplomats describe as Mobutu cronies from the Central Bank, and efforts to bring the lucrative diamond mining industry back under state control.
Mr. Mobutu has begun to emerge from his own diplomatic isolation, undertaking a trip to Japan and China in the last week and planning a visit to France next month to take part in the annual French-African summit meeting. Mr. Mobutu was banned from visiting France for more than two years after the French Ambassador to Zaire was killed in the 1991 riots.
In a brief interview at Kinshasa Airport, where he met with Mr. Talbott, Mr. Kengo pledged that he would work toward national elections sometime in the next year. "We are moving toward a rehabilitation of the economy that is capital," he said. "For this we must restore the authority of the state, restructure the army and guarantee the liberty of our citizens."

The dollar fell slightly against leading currencies yesterday, following the bond and stock markets, which weakened after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, rekindled inflation fears in testimony before Congress.
Though Mr. Greenspan indicated concern about the dollar's weakness and its effect on the economy, the dollar still fell against the Japanese yen and the German mark. Such talk usually drives the dollar higher by putting traders on notice that the central bank may intervene in its defense.
Traders said yesterday that sliding securities prices and profit taking from the dollar's recent rally undermined the positive effects of Mr. Greenspan's testimony. Another Rate Increase?
The dollar started higher in Europe but began to fall with stock and bond prices after the release of Mr. Greenspan's prepared testimony. He told the Senate Banking Committee that this year's four interest rate increases might not be enough to rein in inflation.
"Greenspan may have reopened a can of worms," said Lisa Finstrom, currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc. "It rekindled inflationary expectations. The market had become somewhat more calm and had faith coming into this. The dollar's value reflects overall financial health of the United States and inflation is no good. The expression of concern fed dollar negativity."
The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 98.80 yen, down from 99.30 late Tuesday. The dollar dropped to 1.5650 marks from 1.5682 marks on Tuesday. An Impact on Policy
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the currency's slide was bad for the United States economy and was beginning to have an impact on the Fed's monetary policy because of the inflationary consequences.
A protracted slide could ultimately fuel inflation by pushing up the price of imports, and has already set off investor flight from dollar-denominated assets.
Some market participants shrugged off the comments, which they said shed no new light on the Government's currency policy, and attributed yesterday's dip mainly to profit taking.
"The selloff started before Greenspan opened his mouth. I think it was largely technical," said Hubert Pedroli, manager of currency trading for Credit Suisse in New York.

Currency Turmoil Weighing on U.S. and Japan; Fed Officials Get Confusing Signals on Interest Rates

Author: Bradsher, Keith

Abstract: Top Fed officials watch a broad 10-currency index of the dollar's value that shows the United States currency has fallen very little this year. The Fed's staff presents the index and other statistics to the Federal Reserve Board each Monday morning at a closed-door meeting on monetary policy. "We're close to that, and certainly the parallels will be drawn, and that will make it more difficult for Secretary [Lloyd Bentsen] and President Clinton," said John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington. "We've been over this ground in the living memory of a lot of people in the market." The Federal Reserve chose in 1978 to raise interest rates fairly gradually, a decision that has been heavily criticized as inadequate since then by monetary economists. When inflation jumped to 11 percent in 1979, the central bank was forced to raise short-term interest rates to 20 percent to bring it under control, provoking a deep recession by 1981 and a long, slow reduction in inflation during the 1980's.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
Top Federal Reserve officials found mixed signals in this week's turmoil in the currency markets, which they believe has left their course on interest rates unclear.
When an American-led effort by 16 central banks on Friday failed to prop up the dollar against the German mark and Japanese yen, many analysts wondered if the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates as the only way to stop the slide.
But the Fed sees a far more complicated picture, one that would appear to have it prepared, but not poised, to take action. Little Fear of Inflation
The Fed officials do not see any inherent inflationary pressures stemming from the week's events that would require such an action. They noted that the dollar was stable against many currencies, and actually rose against those of two key United States trading partners, Canada and Mexico.
In addition, they believe that the inflation rate in the United States is falling as economic growth becomes more subdued.
But they worry that the drop against the mark and yen could be a warning sign that international investors have come to expect inflation in the United States and are less willing to hold assets here as a result.
A determination to stamp out such expectations, which tend to become self-fulfilling, was a prime reason for the series of interest-rate increases that the Fed undertook this spring to keep the markets satisfied about the pace of economic recovery. The Effect of Rates
Raising interest rates again might appease the banks, companies and professional traders who have sold billions of dollars in exchange for yen and marks and who on Friday brushed aside an Administration-led effort by the Federal Reserve and 15 other central banks to prop up the dollar.
Higher rates would make American bonds more attractive, providing an incentive for traders to buy the dollars needed to buy those bonds.
But higher rates would also put extra drag on the United States economy, which most economists and many Federal Reserve officials say will grow less quickly in the next six months than it did in the winter and spring.
Another increase in interest rates might also irritate the Clinton Administration, although the dollar's perilous condition could limit that irritation.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in an interview on June 15 -- before the dollar ran into serious trouble -- that given the recent signs of slower consumer spending and economic growth, "I don't see any pressure on the Fed to increase those rates."
To avoid roiling financial markets, senior Fed officials do not like to discuss publicly their plans for changing interest rates and perceptions of currency rates. But they have let their analysis of the market's conflicting signals be known privately. Keeping Tabs
Top Fed officials watch a broad 10-currency index of the dollar's value that shows the United States currency has fallen very little this year. The Fed's staff presents the index and other statistics to the Federal Reserve Board each Monday morning at a closed-door meeting on monetary policy.
The index shows the dollar's value in comparison to the currencies of Belgium, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The weight of each currency in the index depends on the volume of American trade with each country. Fed officials also keep an eye on other currencies like the Mexican peso.
Even though the yen has been trading at record highs lately, the overall index is higher now than it was in 1987 and during much of the Bush Administration. The index has edged down a couple of percentage points this month -- the latest compilation of the index will be presented today.
A popular rule of thumb among monetary policy experts is that a drop of 10 percent in the trade-weighted value of the dollar produces an increase of 1 percentage point in the inflation rate, but some economists now say the effect is smaller, despite the globalization of the world economy. These economists point to the rising share of American trade with the Latin American and East Asian countries that formally or informally link their currencies to the dollar, and with the oil-producing countries that price their shipments in dollars. Global Factor Played Down
During Congressional testimony on Wednesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, minimized the effect on inflation from the globalization of the economy. "At this point, we have little aggregate evidence that the increased openness of the United States economy over the past several decades has substantially altered the process of domestic price formation," he said.
But during the same hearing, Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Reserve needed to be ready to raise interest rates in response to expectations of inflation, particularly when the expectations were associated with an economy operating at or near full capacity.
Since World War II, Mr. Greenspan said, "tightened markets became increasingly associated with rising inflation expectations and burgeoning credit demands, which we were sometimes too slow to counter."
Clinton Administration officials, including Alan S. Blinder, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers who was approved by the Senate on Friday to become the next vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, have estimated that the economy is operating at 98.5 percent of full capacity -- or better.
The Federal Reserve directly controls only short-term rates, but changing them strongly influences the level of long-term rates. Central bankers try to hold down long-term rates to encourage investors to borrow money for long periods of time and build factories, instead of borrowing for short periods of time and speculating in markets for gold, commodities and other goods. Raising short-term rates tends to dampen inefficient short-term bank lending, economic growth and inflation, eventually pushing down long-term rates as lenders conclude that inflation will not erode their returns. Defensive Policies Abroad
To be sure, part of the recent fall in the American dollar reflects the strengthening of the German mark and Japanese yen against currencies all over the world, Wall Street economists say. By keeping interest rates fairly high, the German and Japanese central banks have guarded against inflation in their own countries but drained investment money from other countries like the United States, where slackening growth may make higher interest rates less appropriate.
During the last few years, such an international discrepancy in interest rates has often been handled through coordinated changes in rates by central banks. But Robert E. Rubin, the President's national economic adviser, said on Friday that there would not necessarily be talks on such an effort when the leaders of seven industrial democracies meet next month in Naples. Not-So-Distant Memory
The worst-case chain of events, which no policy makers were willing to discuss publicly, is that the American economy is replaying the events of 1978. As now, the United States economy was then growing faster than those of other large industrial countries and imports soared, so foreigners were being paid more dollars than they were spending for American goods. The value of the dollar began to fall, a problem worsened by an international skepticism about the Carter Administration's foreign policy, similar to the current doubts about the diplomatic skills of the Clinton Administration.
"We're close to that, and certainly the parallels will be drawn, and that will make it more difficult for Secretary Bentsen and President Clinton," said John H. Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington. "We've been over this ground in the living memory of a lot of people in the market."
The Federal Reserve chose in 1978 to raise interest rates fairly gradually, a decision that has been heavily criticized as inadequate since then by monetary economists. When inflation jumped to 11 percent in 1979, the central bank was forced to raise short-term interest rates to 20 percent to bring it under control, provoking a deep recession by 1981 and a long, slow reduction in inflation during the 1980's.
But the current situation is different in that, as Mr. Greenspan noted in his Congressional testimony on Wednesday, the amount of money and loans available in the economy is fairly tight. The money supply was expanding quickly in the late 1970's, and inflation was rising then, rather than falling as it has been during the last year.

Abstract: Mr. [Alan Greenspan] first cited the research in Congresssional testimony at the end of last month to argue that further reductions in inflation may be needed. "We don't have enough observations to know that it's conclusively the case," he told the Senate Banking Committee, "but I think it's becoming persuasively the case that not only is it -- which everyone agrees to -- important to bring the inflation rate down from 10 percent to 5 percent, but it's increasingly becoming evident that the lower we get under 5 percent, the more stable and growing the economy is." Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, disagrees with Mr. Greenspan's argument. She said in an interview that while extremely high levels of inflation might have hurt productivity in foreign countries, inflation in the United States had never been high enough to have a demonstrable effect on productivity, even in the late 1970's. Other research has suggested that high productivity may produce low inflation, rather than the other way around, Ms. Tyson said. Mr. [Glenn D. Rudebusch] and Mr. [David W. Wilcox] tried to show this was not the case by using a statistical technique known as a Granger test. In using the test, the two economists compared each year's productivity with inflation in four previous periods and found a strong correlation. They found no correlation when they compared inflation with productivity in four previous periods.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has found another argument to justify its attempts to shove inflation ever lower with repeated increases in short-term interest rates.
Buttressing his argument with a new Federal Reserve study, he is contending that the central bank can increase the productivity of the nation's people and factories by at some point pushing consumer price inflation even lower than the 2.4 percent for the year that ended in April. The reasoning goes that lower inflation forces businesses to become more efficient because they cannot raise prices, and that when businesses are more efficient, the nation's economic output and standard of living rise.
Mr. Greenspan's fascination with the link is important not only as a defense of past interest rate increases but also as one of many signals about future policy. The research may help to explain why Mr. Greenspan has gradually become more willing than most Federal Reserve officials to raise interest rates this spring, after some initial reluctance. Findings, and Skepticism
A preliminary draft of the study contends that with a reduction of one percentage point in the inflation rate, the nation's productivity and economic growth rates both rise by two- or three-tenths of a percentage point.
But the argument does not impress Administration officials or some private economists, who are skeptical of the Federal Reserve's new claims and worry that in using higher interest rates to slow the economy and therefore push down an already low inflation rate, the Federal Reserve will excessively restrict the economy and needlessly cost the country hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Mr. Greenspan first cited the research in Congresssional testimony at the end of last month to argue that further reductions in inflation may be needed. "We don't have enough observations to know that it's conclusively the case," he told the Senate Banking Committee, "but I think it's becoming persuasively the case that not only is it -- which everyone agrees to -- important to bring the inflation rate down from 10 percent to 5 percent, but it's increasingly becoming evident that the lower we get under 5 percent, the more stable and growing the economy is."
Mr. Greenspan has previously indicated a desire to reduce inflation to 1 or 2 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The productivity research is the latest of many justifications that the central bank has offered over the years for raising interest rates. In effect, the central bank is arguing that short-term economic pain may be necessary for long-term economic gain.
The new Federal Reserve study found that low inflation has gone hand in hand with high productivity, and high inflation with low productivity, during the last 40 years in the United States. The same correlation was found in similar periods in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and, to a lesser extent, Japan.
The study also used a much-debated statistical device to make the case that it was low inflation that raised productivity, rather than high productivity causing low inflation. Finally, the study's authors, two Federal Reserve economists, attempted to adjust for the booms and busts in the business cycle, although they acknowledged that their success could be questioned.
Instead of using consumer prices, the new Federal Reserve study uses a different inflation measure -- prices charged by businesses for all goods -- that produces slightly lower numbers and offers a broader comparison to business productivity. The study excluded prices and productivity on farms and in government agencies.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, disagrees with Mr. Greenspan's argument. She said in an interview that while extremely high levels of inflation might have hurt productivity in foreign countries, inflation in the United States had never been high enough to have a demonstrable effect on productivity, even in the late 1970's.
"I don't think it has been well documented at lower levels," she said. Link or No Link?
Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said earlier academic research had failed to document any clear link to productivity for inflation rates below 20 percent. He suggested that in arguing for the existence of a link at much lower levels, Mr. Greenspan might be looking for a politically palatable explanation for the central bank's interest-rate increases this spring.
"I think it's a bit of throwing everything at the fan and seeing what sticks," Mr. Bosworth said. "He wants to make the argument for the benefits of low rates of inflation."
But Stanley Fischer, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who will soon become the deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said that his own research in the last two years suggested that Mr. Greenspan might be right, at least for inflation rates of 3 percent or more.
The new Federal Reserve research will be discussed at length on Thursday during a Bank of England conference on monetary and financial policy, he said.
Federal Reserve officials initially expressed reluctance to share the new study even after Mr. Greenspan had mentioned it in his testimony, but they relented last weekend.
Economists at the Federal Reserve said Mr. Greenspan had taken a strong personal interest in the research. Other central bank officials were largely unaware of the work until Mr. Greenspan mentioned a link between inflation and productivity.
"I was taken by that comment myself -- it has some intuitive appeal but I have not seen any of the data," said Robert P. Forrestal, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Computer Modeling
The study consists of highly esoteric statistical calculations and computer modeling, rather than any field research involving interviews with companies or workers. The study also does not address why low inflation may cause higher productivity.
It suggested that temporary shrinkages in the economy might be needed to curb inflation and increase productivity. "Even if a one-percentage-point reduction in inflation boosts the trend growth of productivity (and hence output) only 0.2 percentage point, then an initial sacrifice of, say, two and a half percentage points of G.D.P. is more than recovered within five years," the draft says. The arithmetic is true because of a compounding effect.
Two Federal Reserve economists, Glenn D. Rudebusch and David W. Wilcox, wrote the paper.
Susan M. Phillips, one of the five sitting governors of the Federal Reserve Board, said on Tuesday that when inflation was low, businesses were more willing to judge long-term investments on their own merits and tended to make more efficient decisions, adding to productivity. When inflation is high, she said, businesses tend to time investments to minimize the erosion of returns by inflation.
But other research has suggested that high productivity may produce low inflation, rather than the other way around, Ms. Tyson said. Mr. Rudebusch and Mr. Wilcox tried to show this was not the case by using a statistical technique known as a Granger test. In using the test, the two economists compared each year's productivity with inflation in four previous periods and found a strong correlation. They found no correlation when they compared inflation with productivity in four previous periods.
Some economists have criticized the Granger test over the years as unreliable for examining indicators like productivity that tend to rise and fall with the health of the overall economy.

Abstract: Indeed, no sooner did "The Reckoning" -- the book by David Halberstam that focused on Ford and Nissan to tell "the story of Japan's ascent and America's subtle industrial decline" -- appear in 1985 than did Ford begin its comeback and Nissan begin to falter. Ford's market share has since climbed to 25.5 percent of the American market from 21.3 percent, while Nissan, with 5.0 percent today, never improved on the 5.3 percent it held in the mid-1980's. "More Americans are familiar with these technologies and are using them in everyday life," Mr. [Bruce Steinberg] said. "And more American businesses have learned to use the technology to improve productivity." The Reasons Economic 'Vices' Are Also Virtues So America's back in the lead. But that's no excuse to relax. "Things are going to get different again," said Mr. [Michael Hammer]. "People think the hard work is over, but hard work is going to be a permanent condition."

Full text: DURING the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton often fretted that the United States economy was fast becoming the world's also-ran. But more and more it looks as if he inherited a winner.
A 3 percent economic growth rate, a gain of two million new jobs in the past year and an inflation rate reminiscent of the 1960's make America the envy of the industrialized world. The amount the average American worker can produce, already the highest in the world, is growing faster than in other wealthy countries, including Japan. The United States has become the world's low-cost provider of many sophisticated products and services, from plastics to software to financial services. And after years of decline, the nation's share of the world export market has been rising.
For the most part, these advantages will continue even after countries like Japan and Germany snap out of their recessions. It is the United States, not Japan, that is the master of the next generation of commercially important computer and communications technologies and also of leading-edge services from medicine to movie making. And American managers are not only investing heavily in new equipment, they are also much farther along than those in Europe and Japan in streamlining and re-engineering their companies to make them more competitive. That's one reason that American industries that recently were losers -- like automobiles, machine tools, steel and computer chips -- are back with a vengeance.
The turnaround reflects more than 10 years of sometimes innovative and often wrenching change, driven by recession, deregulation, tougher foreign competition, the threat of takeovers, and, not least, new technology.
The image of the United States as an economic winner, once associated only with apologists for the Reagan era, is catching on. The French newspaper Le Monde and the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun have each run long series on the new American competitive threat. Foreign leaders and executives who once lectured Americans on their shortcomings now speak enviously of this country's cleverness in churning out everything from jobs to Jeeps.
While such sentiments may seem more common abroad, there are signs that America's self-esteem is recovering. Some polls show that Americans once again see the United States as an economic giant. Rush Limbaugh, who likes to brag about America's prowess, is one of the most popular radio talk show hosts. By contrast, Bruce Springsteen, the balladeer of dying American factory towns, hasn't had a hit in a couple of years.
"Image and reality have both undergone a remarkable change in the last few years," said Michael Hammer, a business consultant and co-author of the best-seller "Re-engineering the Corporation." "American business -- not just manufacturing -- is again perceived as the world leader."
David Rolley, an international economist at the forecasting firm DRI/McGraw Hill, added: "Everyone thought the U.S. was a basket case, but others turned out to be bigger basket cases. Germany has too many good things, too many vacations. Japan is too much like I.B.M., such a successful model that nobody figured out what to do when it exhausted the model."
None of this is an excuse for giddiness. The gains have come at a high price. Even as the economy created new jobs, tens of millions of people lost their old ones and were forced to pull up stakes, take pay cuts, carve out new careers. The United States is still second best (or third or fourth) in many pursuits. And tomorrow's stars, from Malaysia to Mexico, pose growing challenges for many an American business.
Also, the recovery here and the recessions abroad are bound to highlight American strengths and foreign weaknesses. America's turnaround may look better than it is because reports of the nation's demise were exaggerated to begin with. And, as always, what looks like a lot of improvement to one person looks like too little to another.
Finally, the benefits of economic leadership are mostly psychic. The struggle to make the economic pie bigger and insure that all citizens get a slice is largely a race against oneself, not against other countries. And being the economic leader is no cure for some of the most serious problems American society faces, including crime, inadequate education, the growing isolation of the underclass, the rampant economic insecurity that many middle-class Americans feel, and, for that matter, the malaise that can come with working so hard to do better.
But the changing perception of America is already subtly influencing the way we think. Infatuation with the Japanese or German model of capitalism is becoming less fashionable, and the massive government meddling advocated by so many critics to reverse the nation's supposed decline is less appealing to a lot of people.
For example, despite promises of more government help for so-called strategic industries, the Clinton Administration has not budgeted much money for such an industrial policy. And Washington will probably not lurch toward European-style "managed trade," through which the Government sets targets for how much companies should buy from, and sell to, foreigners -- recent threats to limit Japan's access to the American market notwithstanding. And almost no one expects the big worker-retraining programs proposed during the Presidential campaign to materialize.
In fact, interest is growing in less costly ways to let people roll with the punches -- from getting welfare mothers into jobs to making it easier for workers to change jobs without losing pensions or health coverage.
The climate could still change. A trade war with Japan, while unlikely, is nevertheless a possibility. The Federal Reserve Board could turn a blind eye as the inflation genie slips out of the bottle. There's always the possibility that health care reform, if it happens, will add costs to businesses and therefore stifle job creation. Efforts to protect the people who have suffered in the economic transformation could backfire -- as they have in Europe -- if they take the form of protectionism or laws that make it harder for businesses to shrink payrolls or get out of unprofitable businesses.
But many people, including the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, think that the many recent positive signs, especially the rebound in productivity growth, signal that the United States economy will do even better in the 1990's than in the 1980's. That means, they argue, that more Americans will share in the economy's gains. The Evidence Glowing Numbers And More to Come
Some of the evidence of America's impressive economic performance has been around for years but ignored. Most of it is fairly new.
Start with the most basic yardstick of economic health, the growth of productivity, or output per worker. Productivity determines how fast living standards can rise.
The American worker is the most productive in the world by far, producing on average $49,600 in goods and services a year in 1990 -- $5,000 more than German workers, $10,000 more than Japanese counterparts. Moreover, while productivity was growing more quickly abroad than in the United States for most of the 20th century, America has lately been gaining more quickly, as companies here figure out how to provide more and better products and services with new technologies and fewer workers.
Since the start of the economic recovery nearly three years ago, United States productivity has been growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, more than twice as fast as the average between 1970 and 1990, and markedly better than elsewhere.
The United States lead is widest in services. Retailing is twice as productive in the United States as in Japan, where laws protect the shopkeeper from the discount chain. The deregulated American telecommunications industry is at least twice as productive as Germany's government monopoly. The fragmented American banking industry is a third more efficient than Germany's banking oligopolies. The American edge in these industries has recently been expanding, not shrinking.
Gains on the factory floor have lately been even more stellar than for the economy over all: Hourly output has been rising nearly 5 percent a year for three years even as it has flattened or fallen in Germany and Japan. The United States lead in manufacturing, which had been shrinking as Germany and Japan caught up or moved ahead in some industries, has lately been widening again.
"You're seeing today the results of actions undertaken in the second half of the 1980's," said Stanley Gault, the chief executive who helped revive the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Rubbermaid Inc.
THERE are at least two reasons for thinking that the American productivity lead won't evaporate when Germany and Japan recover from their recessions. One is that investment, especially in computers, is booming. The other, more important, reason is that corporate America started the painful task of learning how to make more, more quickly and with fewer resources, earlier than many of its overseas counterparts, especially in Europe.
In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Shintaro Hori, a director of the consulting firm Bain & Company Japan, estimated that Japanese companies will have to shed 15 to 20 percent of their white-collar work forces to match the low overhead in America.
"There are far fewer re-engineering efforts under way in Japanese and German companies compared with the United States," said Mr. Hammer, the consultant, whose firm has trained thousands of American managers to overhaul their companies in the last few years but few from foreign corporations.
Hard evidence is the reward American companies are reaping: Despite the moderate pace of the economic recovery, inflation-adjusted corporate profits are close to an all-time high.
In some smokestack industries -- steel, machine tools and especially cars -- the choice was to raise productivity and quality a lot or cede the field to the competition, as American companies did in consumer electronics. American managers chose the former, lifting productivity in the auto plants, for example, by an average of 10 percent every year during the late 1980's, according to McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
Indeed, no sooner did "The Reckoning" -- the book by David Halberstam that focused on Ford and Nissan to tell "the story of Japan's ascent and America's subtle industrial decline" -- appear in 1985 than did Ford begin its comeback and Nissan begin to falter. Ford's market share has since climbed to 25.5 percent of the American market from 21.3 percent, while Nissan, with 5.0 percent today, never improved on the 5.3 percent it held in the mid-1980's.
IN the first half of the 1980's, many American products were not only inferior to, but also pricier than, those offered by other nations. The grossly overvalued dollar -- which made American exports expensive and imports cheap -- was largely to blame. But so were a clutch of bad habits -- from executives' granting fat pay increases to Washington's tolerating too much inflation.
These days, by contrast, American factories ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne and Spandex to Siena (for bicycle pants). America's exports have been rising nearly 9 percent a year since 1985, even faster than Japan's 6.6 percent and Germany's 4.2 percent. Even more telling, the United States' share of exports by industrialized countries, which shrank to nearly 10 percent a decade ago, close to a post-war low, has rebounded to its 1980 level, around 14 percent.
Small wonder. Thanks to the weaker dollar, more moderate wage settlements and gains in efficiency, American production costs have been rising more slowly than those in Europe and Japan: 1.1 percent a year since 1985, compared with 2.5 percent in Europe and 1.7 percent in Japan. BMW of North America Inc. and Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. are building their new plants in the American South. And, to hold down the price of their new models, Japanese car makers with plants in America are resorting to a strategy considered unthinkable just a few years ago: raising as much as possible the content of locally procured parts, as Honda said it would do this year.
Contrast this with Germany's cost problem. At current exchange rates German manufacturing workers are paid about $26 an hour, $10 more than American and Japanese factory hands. The problem is so serious that Chancellor Helmut Kohl devoted the German equivalent of the State of the Union message last October to the problem of German competitiveness.
"It seems as if there is still nothing more important than thinking about how we can expand our recreation time," he scolded. "If we want to secure Germany's future, we cannot organize our country as if it were one big recreation park."
Making things less expensively isn't enough to captivate a world full of ever more affluent, increasingly sophisticated consumers. That requires a prodigious stream of new ideas and invention. A case in point is the converging world of computing, telecommunications and television.
"We're in the midst of the third industrial revolution," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, "and the United States is leading it."
The European technology industry is in deep trouble, its stagnant revenue, lack of new products and need for billions in government subsidies evident even before the recession. Japan has been a leader in consumer electronics. But, as its retreat in high-definition television shows, that country is still mainly the master of mass-produced components -- flat panel displays, memory chips, fax machines.
Six years ago, the fear was that Japanese dominance would spread to leading-edge technologies. But Japanese electronics giants like the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, the NEC Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation haven't been able to keep up with changing technology and American companies like the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation are in the lead in virtually all the key ingredients of the business- and personal-computer revolution: software, workstations, laser printers, computer networks and the computers-on-a-chip known as microprocessors.
"Everything important gets invented here," said Charles Ferguson, a Cambridge, Mass., technology consultant who a few years ago was warning darkly of the Japanese threat. The growing demand for sophisticated products will probably play to the strengths of American producers. So might the fact that American consumers are already more familiar with new technology than people abroad. Compared with Japan, for example, the United States has more than three times as many personal computers per worker.
"More Americans are familiar with these technologies and are using them in everyday life," Mr. Steinberg said. "And more American businesses have learned to use the technology to improve productivity." The Reasons Economic 'Vices' Are Also Virtues
Are there reasons for the American comeback other than inventiveness, streamlining, re-engineering, the adaptability of workers and managers, lower inflation and interest rates, and a weaker dollar?
Yes, indeed. Often overlooked is that some of this nation's supposed vices -- from a reluctance to protect and regulate industries, to an obsession with short-term profits -- have turned out to be virtues as well. And the much-praised features of Japanese and German capitalism -- from managed trade to lifetime employment -- have proved to have drawbacks.
The fact that American companies are regularly exposed to the toughest competitors on their home turf is a blessing as well as a curse. Detroit was forced to compete head to head with Japanese cars. European auto makers enjoyed far more protection from Japan. For a while, the jobs of tens of thousands of European auto workers and their bosses were safe, but now a huge downsizing is all but inevitable.
Lighter regulation in the United States than in other nations proved bracing for many American service companies because it encouraged competition. American shopkeepers cannot fall back on the kind of zoning laws that shield mom-and-pop stores in Japan from certain death by would-be Wal-Marts. A.T.& T. has been at the forefront of communications technology in large part because of challenges from the likes of MCI Communications Inc. and the Sprint Corporation. United Airlines gives passengers a better price because Southwest Airlines does. Contrast the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and United with their German counterparts, which remain carefully guarded state monopolies, though things are beginning to change.
Even the focus by investors and bankers on last quarter's bottom line may turn out to be less of a handicap than some argue. Impatient institutional investors blew the whistle when profits shrank, as did bank lenders without the cozy ties to corporate boards that exist in countries like Germany and Japan.
And the deep pain of layoffs has produced important gains. To be sure, the dislocation caused by layoffs in one American industry after another since the early 1980's is staggering. In the past decade, estimates Steven Davis, a labor economist at the University of Chicago, 1 in 10 manufacturing jobs -- two million -- vanished every year, even though the net decline in factory jobs over the decade was only about 1 million.
But it is becoming clear that the ability to move workers quickly from one industry to another also has benefits to the economy -- in the form of increased productivity that is essential to raising the standard of living.
For all the layoffs, the fact is that the number of new jobs has far outstripped the number of jobs lost in recent years. The United States economy has added 18 million jobs in the past decade, a net gain of more than 20 percent, including 2 million in the past year. And the unemployment rate has dropped about 1.5 percentage points in the past 18 months, to just over 6 percent. The economies of the European Community, which combined are the same size as the American economy, have added just 7 million jobs in 10 years, a net increase of 7 percent, and have grappled with unemployment rates, now in the double digits, that haven't fallen below 8 percent in a decade. The Dissent But What About That Trade Deficit?
Perhaps the most compelling counterargument to the notion that America is doing so well is this: Imports are rising three times faster than exports and the trade deficit, which was shrinking during the late 1980's, is swelling. "How can Japan pay wages that are higher, have productivity that is lower and still sell us $60 billion more than they buy?" asked Lester Thurow, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is much in favor at the White House by dint of his book "Head to Head: The Coming Battle Among Japan, Europe and America."
But the trade deficit is not a particularly reliable yardstick of the health of an economy for two reasons. The first is that how much countries buy abroad depends on their income as well as the attractiveness of the foreign products, and America's income (in short, its gross domestic product) is rising more rapidly than that of most other nations.
The more subtle reason is that critics of American competitiveness have a habit of focusing on trade figures that capture only goods that are traded internationally, ignoring the service sector. Yet America's economic performance depends far more on service industries, which now employ three out of four American workers.
So America's back in the lead. But that's no excuse to relax. "Things are going to get different again," said Mr. Hammer. "People think the hard work is over, but hard work is going to be a permanent condition."

Full text: DURING the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton often fretted that the United States economy was fast becoming the world's also-ran. But more and more it looks as if he inherited a winner.
A 3 percent economic growth rate, a gain of two million new jobs in the past year and an inflation rate reminiscent of the 1960's make America the envy of the industrialized world. The amount the average American worker can produce, already the highest in the world, is growing faster than in other wealthy countries, including Japan. The United States has become the world's low-cost provider of many sophisticated products and services, from plastics to software to financial services. And after years of decline, the nation's share of the world export market has been rising.
For the most part, these advantages will continue even after countries like Japan and Germany snap out of their recessions. It is the United States, not Japan, that is the master of the next generation of commercially important computer and communications technologies and also of leading-edge services from medicine to movie making. And American managers are not only investing heavily in new equipment, they are also much farther along than those in Europe and Japan in streamlining and re-engineering their companies to make them more competitive. That's one reason that American industries that recently were losers -- like automobiles, machine tools, steel and computer chips -- are back with a vengeance.
The turnaround reflects more than 10 years of sometimes innovative and often wrenching change, driven by recession, deregulation, tougher foreign competition, the threat of takeovers, and, not least, new technology.
The image of the United States as an economic winner, once associated only with apologists for the Reagan era, is catching on. The French newspaper Le Monde and the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun have each run long series on the new American competitive threat. Foreign leaders and executives who once lectured Americans on their shortcomings now speak enviously of this country's cleverness in churning out everything from jobs to Jeeps.
While such sentiments may seem more common abroad, there are signs that America's self-esteem is recovering. Some polls show that Americans once again see the United States as an economic giant. Rush Limbaugh, who likes to brag about America's prowess, is one of the most popular radio talk show hosts. By contrast, Bruce Springsteen, the balladeer of dying American factory towns, hasn't had a hit in a couple of years.
"Image and reality have both undergone a remarkable change in the last few years," said Michael Hammer, a business consultant and co-author of the best-seller "Re-engineering the Corporation." "American business -- not just manufacturing -- is again perceived as the world leader."
David Rolley, an international economist at the forecasting firm DRI/McGraw Hill, added: "Everyone thought the U.S. was a basket case, but others turned out to be bigger basket cases. Germany has too many good things, too many vacations. Japan is too much like I.B.M., such a successful model that nobody figured out what to do when it exhausted the model."
None of this is an excuse for giddiness. The gains have come at a high price. Even as the economy created new jobs, tens of millions of people lost their old ones and were forced to pull up stakes, take pay cuts, carve out new careers. The United States is still second best (or third or fourth) in many pursuits. And tomorrow's stars, from Malaysia to Mexico, pose growing challenges for many an American business.
Also, the recovery here and the recessions abroad are bound to highlight American strengths and foreign weaknesses. America's turnaround may look better than it is because reports of the nation's demise were exaggerated to begin with. And, as always, what looks like a lot of improvement to one person looks like too little to another.
Finally, the benefits of economic leadership are mostly psychic. The struggle to make the economic pie bigger and insure that all citizens get a slice is largely a race against oneself, not against other countries. And being the economic leader is no cure for some of the most serious problems American society faces, including crime, inadequate education, the growing isolation of the underclass, the rampant economic insecurity that many middle-class Americans feel, and, for that matter, the malaise that can come with working so hard to do better.
But the changing perception of America is already subtly influencing the way we think. Infatuation with the Japanese or German model of capitalism is becoming less fashionable, and the massive government meddling advocated by so many critics to reverse the nation's supposed decline is less appealing to a lot of people.
For example, despite promises of more government help for so-called strategic industries, the Clinton Administration has not budgeted much money for such an industrial policy. And Washington will probably not lurch toward European-style "managed trade," through which the Government sets targets for how much companies should buy from, and sell to, foreigners -- recent threats to limit Japan's access to the American market notwithstanding. And almost no one expects the big worker-retraining programs proposed during the Presidential campaign to materialize.
In fact, interest is growing in less costly ways to let people roll with the punches -- from getting welfare mothers into jobs to making it easier for workers to change jobs without losing pensions or health coverage.
The climate could still change. A trade war with Japan, while unlikely, is nevertheless a possibility. The Federal Reserve Board could turn a blind eye as the inflation genie slips out of the bottle. There's always the possibility that health care reform, if it happens, will add costs to businesses and therefore stifle job creation. Efforts to protect the people who have suffered in the economic transformation could backfire -- as they have in Europe -- if they take the form of protectionism or laws that make it harder for businesses to shrink payrolls or get out of unprofitable businesses.
But many people, including the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, think that the many recent positive signs, especially the rebound in productivity growth, signal that the United States economy will do even better in the 1990's than in the 1980's. That means, they argue, that more Americans will share in the economy's gains. The Evidence Glowing Numbers And More to Come
Some of the evidence of America's impressive economic performance has been around for years but ignored. Most of it is fairly new.
Start with the most basic yardstick of economic health, the growth of productivity, or output per worker. Productivity determines how fast living standards can rise.
The American worker is the most productive in the world by far, producing on average $49,600 in goods and services a year in 1990 -- $5,000 more than German workers, $10,000 more than Japanese counterparts. Moreover, while productivity was growing more quickly abroad than in the United States for most of the 20th century, America has lately been gaining more quickly, as companies here figure out how to provide more and better products and services with new technologies and fewer workers.
Since the start of the economic recovery nearly three years ago, United States productivity has been growing at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, more than twice as fast as the average between 1970 and 1990, and markedly better than elsewhere.
The United States lead is widest in services. Retailing is twice as productive in the United States as in Japan, where laws protect the shopkeeper from the discount chain. The deregulated American telecommunications industry is at least twice as productive as Germany's government monopoly. The fragmented American banking industry is a third more efficient than Germany's banking oligopolies. The American edge in these industries has recently been expanding, not shrinking.
Gains on the factory floor have lately been even more stellar than for the economy over all: Hourly output has been rising nearly 5 percent a year for three years even as it has flattened or fallen in Germany and Japan. The United States lead in manufacturing, which had been shrinking as Germany and Japan caught up or moved ahead in some industries, has lately been widening again.
"You're seeing today the results of actions undertaken in the second half of the 1980's," said Stanley Gault, the chief executive who helped revive the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and Rubbermaid Inc.
THERE are at least two reasons for thinking that the American productivity lead won't evaporate when Germany and Japan recover from their recessions. One is that investment, especially in computers, is booming. The other, more important, reason is that corporate America started the painful task of learning how to make more, more quickly and with fewer resources, earlier than many of its overseas counterparts, especially in Europe.
In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Shintaro Hori, a director of the consulting firm Bain & Company Japan, estimated that Japanese companies will have to shed 15 to 20 percent of their white-collar work forces to match the low overhead in America.
"There are far fewer re-engineering efforts under way in Japanese and German companies compared with the United States," said Mr. Hammer, the consultant, whose firm has trained thousands of American managers to overhaul their companies in the last few years but few from foreign corporations.
Hard evidence is the reward American companies are reaping: Despite the moderate pace of the economic recovery, inflation-adjusted corporate profits are close to an all-time high.
In some smokestack industries -- steel, machine tools and especially cars -- the choice was to raise productivity and quality a lot or cede the field to the competition, as American companies did in consumer electronics. American managers chose the former, lifting productivity in the auto plants, for example, by an average of 10 percent every year during the late 1980's, according to McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
Indeed, no sooner did "The Reckoning" -- the book by David Halberstam that focused on Ford and Nissan to tell "the story of Japan's ascent and America's subtle industrial decline" -- appear in 1985 than did Ford begin its comeback and Nissan begin to falter. Ford's market share has since climbed to 25.5 percent of the American market from 21.3 percent, while Nissan, with 5.0 percent today, never improved on the 5.3 percent it held in the mid-1980's.
IN the first half of the 1980's, many American products were not only inferior to, but also pricier than, those offered by other nations. The grossly overvalued dollar -- which made American exports expensive and imports cheap -- was largely to blame. But so were a clutch of bad habits -- from executives' granting fat pay increases to Washington's tolerating too much inflation.
These days, by contrast, American factories ship steel to Seoul, transistors to Tokyo, cars to Cologne and Spandex to Siena (for bicycle pants). America's exports have been rising nearly 9 percent a year since 1985, even faster than Japan's 6.6 percent and Germany's 4.2 percent. Even more telling, the United States' share of exports by industrialized countries, which shrank to nearly 10 percent a decade ago, close to a post-war low, has rebounded to its 1980 level, around 14 percent.
Small wonder. Thanks to the weaker dollar, more moderate wage settlements and gains in efficiency, American production costs have been rising more slowly than those in Europe and Japan: 1.1 percent a year since 1985, compared with 2.5 percent in Europe and 1.7 percent in Japan. BMW of North America Inc. and Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc. are building their new plants in the American South. And, to hold down the price of their new models, Japanese car makers with plants in America are resorting to a strategy considered unthinkable just a few years ago: raising as much as possible the content of locally procured parts, as Honda said it would do this year.
Contrast this with Germany's cost problem. At current exchange rates German manufacturing workers are paid about $26 an hour, $10 more than American and Japanese factory hands. The problem is so serious that Chancellor Helmut Kohl devoted the German equivalent of the State of the Union message last October to the problem of German competitiveness.
"It seems as if there is still nothing more important than thinking about how we can expand our recreation time," he scolded. "If we want to secure Germany's future, we cannot organize our country as if it were one big recreation park."
Making things less expensively isn't enough to captivate a world full of ever more affluent, increasingly sophisticated consumers. That requires a prodigious stream of new ideas and invention. A case in point is the converging world of computing, telecommunications and television.
"We're in the midst of the third industrial revolution," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, "and the United States is leading it."
The European technology industry is in deep trouble, its stagnant revenue, lack of new products and need for billions in government subsidies evident even before the recession. Japan has been a leader in consumer electronics. But, as its retreat in high-definition television shows, that country is still mainly the master of mass-produced components -- flat panel displays, memory chips, fax machines.
Six years ago, the fear was that Japanese dominance would spread to leading-edge technologies. But Japanese electronics giants like the Hitachi Zosen Corporation, the NEC Corporation and the Toshiba Corporation haven't been able to keep up with changing technology and American companies like the Intel Corporation and the Microsoft Corporation are in the lead in virtually all the key ingredients of the business- and personal-computer revolution: software, workstations, laser printers, computer networks and the computers-on-a-chip known as microprocessors.
"Everything important gets invented here," said Charles Ferguson, a Cambridge, Mass., technology consultant who a few years ago was warning darkly of the Japanese threat. The growing demand for sophisticated products will probably play to the strengths of American producers. So might the fact that American consumers are already more familiar with new technology than people abroad. Compared with Japan, for example, the United States has more than three times as many personal computers per worker.
"More Americans are familiar with these technologies and are using them in everyday life," Mr. Steinberg said. "And more American businesses have learned to use the technology to improve productivity." The Reasons Economic 'Vices' Are Also Virtues
Are there reasons for the American comeback other than inventiveness, streamlining, re-engineering, the adaptability of workers and managers, lower inflation and interest rates, and a weaker dollar?
Yes, indeed. Often overlooked is that some of this nation's supposed vices -- from a reluctance to protect and regulate industries, to an obsession with short-term profits -- have turned out to be virtues as well.

Abstract: "We urged them to strengthen their efforts to bring inflation under control," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "We told the Russians that a strong stabilization program is needed to trigger more support from the International Monetary Fund." "We have continued to urge Japan to live up to its commitment to put in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen domestic demand, to reduce its large trade surplus, to open its markets," Mr. Bentsen said. "That is in the interest of all of Japan's trading partners and in the interest of Japan." Pressed on speculation that the United States would try to encourage the continued increase in the exchange-rate value of the Japanese yen to make Japanese products more expensive on United States and world markets, Mr. Bentsen refused to be drawn.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
Finance officials of the seven most powerful industrial nations agreed today that economic aid to Russia could continue as soon as it began credible measures to control inflation and budget deficits, but that Moscow still had much to do, Western officials said.
"We urged them to strengthen their efforts to bring inflation under control," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "We told the Russians that a strong stabilization program is needed to trigger more support from the International Monetary Fund."
Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany said the Western countries had agreed to work with the Russian authorities on measures to help the population cope with the consequences of economic change -- unemployment from bankrupt state industries as they are sold off or closed down, for instance. But he added that the Russians would have to come up with most of the money for such measures themselves.
Two senior Russian officials, Finance Minister Sergei K. Dubinin and Economics Minister Aleksandr N. Shokhin, said they had pledged to bring monthly inflation down from 22 percent to 7 to 9 percent by the end of this year. I.M.F. Talks Expected
Mr. Dubinin also said he expected discussions to resume by mid-March between Moscow and the Monetary Fund about a second $1.5 billion loan to help Russia make the transition to a market economy.
Echoing the caution expressed by European officials at the meeting here, Mr. Bentsen said: "I hope they can make that. It will be a difficult target."
For the American delegation here, trade friction between the United States and Japan came close to overshadowing concern about Russia.
"We have continued to urge Japan to live up to its commitment to put in place a substantial and effective program to strengthen domestic demand, to reduce its large trade surplus, to open its markets," Mr. Bentsen said. "That is in the interest of all of Japan's trading partners and in the interest of Japan."
But a senior Treasury official said that "there was no breakthrough of any kind" before the Japanese left this evening. Bentsen Wary on Yen
Pressed on speculation that the United States would try to encourage the continued increase in the exchange-rate value of the Japanese yen to make Japanese products more expensive on United States and world markets, Mr. Bentsen refused to be drawn. "We believe in the fundamentals dictating exchange rates," he said.
Finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Italy, and Canada , known as the Group of Seven, met in a resort hotel in the hills north of Frankfurt that was built as a castle for the Queen of Prussia. The meeting followed a week of turmoil on international financial markets that has seen long-term interest rates rise steeply and the Japanese yen strengthen considerably against the dollar.
Some of the turmoil was caused by fears of inflation because of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the American economy while most of Europe except for Britain is still mired deep in recession, and some by tensions between the United States and Japan on trade issues.
Mr. Bentsen met his Japanese counterpart, Hirohisa Fujii, in the hotel this morning before the broader discussions began, but he made clear beforehand that he expected no breakthrough.
Originally, Mr. Waigel of Germany convened the gathering so representatives from the seven nations could hear reports from Russian officials about what would happen to plans by President Boris N. Yeltsin to move toward a market economy after the political backlash in last December's elections. Little Money Delivered
At their summit meeting in Japan last summer, leaders of the Group of Seven promised $28 billion to Russia in grants and loans, mainly through the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions, but made the assistance conditional on Russian steps to bring inflation and government deficit spending under control. Only a small amount of money has actually been delivered.
The fund had provided Russia with $2.5 billion in loans since 1992, but has held back on an additional $1.5 billion as Mr. Yeltsin's commitment to change has seemed to waver.
Before today's meeting, officials made clear that no additional Western assistance was under consideration, but that they would like to give the Russians assurances that previous commitments would be met if Moscow continued reform.
"Our response will be dictated by their behavior," a senior Treasury Department official said. No Effect From Spying Seen
American officials said they did not expect American assistance to be affected by accusations that a senior Central Intelligence Agency official had been a spy for the Soviet Union and, after its collapse, for the Russian Government.
Mr. Dubinin, Russia's Finance Minister, Mr. Shokhin, the Economics Minister, and the central bank chief, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, repeated earlier pledges by Mr. Yeltsin to keep moving ahead with privatization of state-owned industries and budget reforms, but not so fast as to suddenly throw millions of Russians out of work or into poverty.
Fears that change was proceeding too fast are thought to be the main reason for the strong showing of ultranationalist opponents of Mr. Yeltsin in the December parliamentary elections, when they won around a quarter of the total vote.
The latest Russian budget target is to reduce the deficit this year to about $30 billion, but only with Western aid and agreement to roll over much of the $80 billion foreign debt, and to reduce annual inflation to 400 percent.

Abstract: As Federal Reserve officials and private economists gathered in this Rocky Mountain resort for an annual conference, the economists were divided over whether the Fed's policy-making committee had maintained the bias when it met on Tuesday. Several economists speculated that the Fed maintained its tilt toward higher rates because it was eager to convince financial markets that it wanted to keep inflation subdued. But others said they thought the Fed adopted a neutral stance because it was pleased by recent inflation reports but worried about slow growth. Federal Reserve officials refused to discuss what was decided at Tuesday's meeting. Several committee members called for dropping the bias toward raising rates, suggesting that a neutral policy was more consistent with the weak growth and the subdued inflation being reported. But those members ended up voting with the majority after being convinced that if the committee abandoned that bias so soon after adopting it in May it "could convey a misleading impression" -- in the report's words -- that the Fed had become less committed to fighting inflation.

The Federal Reserve's main policy-making committee voted in July to maintain its bias toward raising short-term interest rates, even though some members urged it to drop that bias because economic growth was so weak.
As Federal Reserve officials and private economists gathered in this Rocky Mountain resort for an annual conference, the economists were divided over whether the Fed's policy-making committee had maintained the bias when it met on Tuesday.
The Fed panel meets eight times a year but its deliberations are not disclosed until after the next meeting.
Several economists speculated that the Fed maintained its tilt toward higher rates because it was eager to convince financial markets that it wanted to keep inflation subdued. But others said they thought the Fed adopted a neutral stance because it was pleased by recent inflation reports but worried about slow growth. Federal Reserve officials refused to discuss what was decided at Tuesday's meeting.
According to a summary that the Federal Reserve released today of the July 6-7 meeting, the policy-making committee, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, voted 11 to 1 to continue its bias toward tighter rates. The action gives the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, the authority to raise rates somewhat without seeking board approval, although he usually consults board members before acting
At the July meeting, Wayne D. Angell, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, cast the dissenting vote, arguing that the central bank should raise interest rates immediately. He said that there was a disappointing lack of progress in reducing inflation and that monetary policy was overly expansive because the central bank's short-term interest rates, currently 3 percent, were less than the inflation rate.
Several committee members called for dropping the bias toward raising rates, suggesting that a neutral policy was more consistent with the weak growth and the subdued inflation being reported. But those members ended up voting with the majority after being convinced that if the committee abandoned that bias so soon after adopting it in May it "could convey a misleading impression" -- in the report's words -- that the Fed had become less committed to fighting inflation.
The central bank adopted the bias toward raising rates in May, when its members grew upset that inflation was running at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the first four months of this year.
According to the summary of the July meeting, many Fed officials felt that the statistics pointed to a sustained rate of economic expansion -- a sentiment that may have been too optimistic because in late July the Commerce Department announced that the economy grew by a lackluster 1.6 percent in the second quarter.
The report of the July meeting said, "While current monetary policy seemed likely to support further economic expansion, the committee needed to remain alert to the potential for intensifying inflation."
Some members said that while the need for any change in policy seemed somewhat remote in coming months, the next policy move was more likely to be toward tightening rather than toward easing.
At the July meeting, the policy-making committee decided to put less stock in trying to meet certain targets for growth in the money supply. The members noted that the relationship between economic growth and growth in M-2 -- a broad definition of the money supply that includes cash in circulation and deposits in checking and savings accounts -- had largely broken down. A certain amount of growth in M-2 was no longer producing the expected rate of overall economic growth.
The committee considered, but rejected, relying on an even broader measure of the money supply: M-2 plus bond and stock mutual funds. The central bank concluded that that measure would be unreliable.
Federal Reserve officials said one reason M-2 had became such an unreliable yardstick was that millions of Americans had moved their money from savings and checking accounts, which are considered part of the money supply, into bond and stock mutual funds, which are not considered part of the money supply.

Abstract: "Brazil's gross domestic product is twice that of Mexico's, so the potential is enormous," said Richard R. Ades, director of the United States Department of Commerce's trade office here. Brazil "is becoming increasingly attractive to United States companies," he added, with inquiries by United States exporters up by an estimated 40 percent this year over last. Despite this tradition, two Government water pollution control projects, one in Rio de Janeiro and one in Sao Paulo, are expected to provide some of the greatest opportunities for American export companies in Brazil in the 1990's. The Sao Paulo project, a $4 billion effort to clean up the Tiete River, was described this week as Latin America's largest pollution control project by the Sao Paulo state governor, Luiz Antonio Fleury.

"America is Here" proclaims a banner beckoning customers to Radio Shack's new stores here and in Rio de Janeiro, emporiums stocked with goods for which Brazilians previously journeyed to Miami: cellular telephones, laser printers and laptop computers.
"Business is so good that we will open a second store by the end of the year," said Djalma Luiz Crispim, who planted Radio Shack's flag in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, three months ago by opening a store in Morumbi Shopping Center.
Brazil -- Latin America's largest economy -- is suddenly dismantling import barriers dating back to the 1960's. On Tuesday, for example, Brazilian journalists are to gather here to test-drive the Explorer, a luxury sport-utility vehicle imported from the United States by the Ford division of Autolatina Brasil S.A. The introduction of the Explorer will be the first large-scale promotion of an American car since Brazil banned almost all car imports in 1974.
For the United States, traditionally Brazil's largest trading partner, the opening of Brazil's $450 billion economy is good news.
"Brazil's gross domestic product is twice that of Mexico's, so the potential is enormous," said Richard R. Ades, director of the United States Department of Commerce's trade office here. Brazil "is becoming increasingly attractive to United States companies," he added, with inquiries by United States exporters up by an estimated 40 percent this year over last.
For decades, American exporters wrote Brazil off as a closed shop.
In the 1960's and 1970's, successive Brazilian Governments sought to stimulate local industrial production by banning the import of more than 1,000 products and by imposing tariffs as high as 205 percent on other products.
But in 1990, the list of banned imports was abolished, and the average import tariff has dropped steadily. From 78 percent in 1984, it fell to 14 percent last month in a final scheduled reduction -- and duties could fall even further.
Brazilians now find that their tariff levels are near Latin America's norm. Argentina and Chile impose average external tariffs of 11 percent. Mexico's average tariff is 12 percent. In the United States, the average import duty on industrialized products is 5 percent.
"Fernando Collor was criticized for many things, but he really opened the country up," Soumo Kabakian, trade director of Flowlevel Controls, said of the Brazilian president who resigned last December under a corruption cloud. Mr. Kabakian estimated that his company's annual imports of American and Canadian industrial-control instruments would rise to $500,000 this year -- 10 times the 1989 level of $50,000. Pent-Up Demand
Importers here sense an enormous pent-up demand for imported goods despite Brazil's poor economic situation -- a long-term recession and 32 percent monthly inflation.
[ On Friday, the president of the central bank, Paulo Cesar Ximenes, resigned and was to be replaced by Pedro Malan, who will become Brazil's fourth central bank president in a year. The new foreign debt negotiator is Andre Lara Resende. ]
"Miami Mania" blares advertisements for a national electronics store chain, Photo Mania. Each store now has an imports corner, hawking imported telephones, toaster ovens, stereos, radios and microwave ovens.
Last October, a 10-year ban on imported computers was lifted, and the impact was evident last month at the stands of Fenasoft, Brazil's largest annual computer show.
"The American presence at Fenasoft must have increased this year by 50 to 70 percent," said George Zelenjuk, a director of ABC Dados Informatica S.A., a major importer here of data communications equipment.
In addition to cutting tariffs, Brazil has helped imports by improving its bureaucracy. 'Simply Dreadful'
"We had a customs that was simply dreadful -- they did everything possible to stop imports," recalled Edmundo Klotz, president of Essencial Alimentos S.A., which imports Jack Daniels whisky and Sterling wine from the United States. "But that is changing very quickly, and I am very optimistic. I am investing in new product lines."
As a result of all these sales, the nation's trade surplus with the United States has dwindled, falling to $1.8 billion in 1992 from $5 billion in 1988. During that period, American exports to Brazil grew by 35 percent, hitting $5.7 billion last year. Over all, Latin America constitutes the world's fastest growing market for American exports.
Brazil's imports from all nations hit $11.1 billion during the first half of 1993. This was the highest level on record and an 18 percent increase from the comparable period last year.
Japanese and Korean consumer goods are also entering Brazil's market, but American exporters seem to enjoy an edge based, in part, on Brazilians' long-term cultural affinity with the United States.
Every year, about a million Brazilians study English at private language academies. This year, about 400,000 Brazilians are expected to visit the United States, the most popular tourist destination for Brazilians.
Brazil's economy -- which accounts for about 40 percent of the Latin American economy -- is expected to grow by 3 percent this year; as a rule, every 1 percent of new economic growth in Latin America increases United States exports by about $5 billion, according to Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a private study group in Washington. By comparison, every 1 percent of economic growth in Japan yields only a $1 billion increase in imports of American goods.
Hidden behind the flashy new consumer goods filling shelves here, the fastest growing sector of Brazil's imports is capital goods. Brazilian companies have responded to the competition by either seeking Government protection or by investing to make their factories internationally competitive.
Textile manufacturers, auto makers, tire manufacturers and growers of rice and wheat have all demanded import quotas in recent months.
"It seems to be a lot tougher for Brazilians to get licenses to import used tires this year," said Howard J. Levy, president of Tire Source Inc. of Pompano Beach, Fla., a major used tire exporter. He attributed the change to pressure by Brazilian tire manufacturers.
So far, however, the Government has resisted calls for import quotas, and in their absence many companies are cutting prices and improving products to compete with the imports.
Brazil's car industry, dominated by local operations of Ford, Fiat, General Motors and Volkwagen, plans to invest $2 billion to modernize production lines in the 1990's. This year, the industry plans to introduce 10 new models; it normally introduces two models a year. Productivity Gains
With tariffs on imported cars now at 35 percent, down from 85 percent in 1990, car manufacturers have increased worker productivity by 46 percent since 1990, according to a study by Exame, Brazil's leading business magazine.
"Our imports are only to fill niches in our product line," said Cassio Pagliarini, marketing plan manager here for Ford. In addition to the Explorer, Ford plans to start importing Taurus cars from the United States in March. By the end of this year, General Motors do Brasil plans to start importing Calibra cars from its German factories and Lumina APV mini-vans from a factory in Tarrytown, N.Y.
Over all, car imports are expected to hit 30,000 units this year, only 3 percent of Brazil's expected domestic production of one million cars.
In the processed food sector, Brazilian companies reacted to the import threat by improving packaging and by introducing 600 products during the first half of this year -- twice as many as during all of last year.
Prices in the electronics sector have dropped by an average of 40 percent since 1989, according to a survey by Veja, a weekly news magazine, which reported that the price of a locally made Gradiente videocassette player fell to $464 from $1,125. The price of a Sharp fax machine dropped to $630 from $1,600.
But the developments -- a boon for consumers and importers -- have often meant a loss for Brazilian workers. Many of the cost savings have been achieved by importing parts and laying off workers. Over the last four years, Gradiente increased the foreign-made portion of its television from 5 percent to 80 percent, while slashing its work force to 2,700 employees from 9,000.
Although Brazil's Government is resisting calls for imposing import quotas on consumer goods, the state bureaucracy hews to a "buy national" procurement policy, according to the Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, a study issued annually by the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
Despite this tradition, two Government water pollution control projects, one in Rio de Janeiro and one in Sao Paulo, are expected to provide some of the greatest opportunities for American export companies in Brazil in the 1990's. The Sao Paulo project, a $4 billion effort to clean up the Tiete River, was described this week as Latin America's largest pollution control project by the Sao Paulo state governor, Luiz Antonio Fleury. 'Excellent Chances'
"There are excellent chances for American companies to sell water filters and pollution monitoring equipment," said Ricardo E. Rose, trade assistant at the United States Trade Office here.
Despite the gains, corruption and bureaucratic paperwork still slow sales, importers complain.
"Last January, I had to pay $1,500 to get a $25,000 shipment out of customs," said one importer, who asked not to be identified. "The customs inspector was about to be transferred to Rio, and she wanted to get some dollars together for the move."
Aware of importers' complaints, Trade Ministry officials say they plan to reduce, starting in November, the number of documents needed for importing to one, from 30.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The Clinton Administration is preparing a broad new effort to weaken Iran by persuading reluctant allies to cut off loans, investment and arms sales to what American officials regard as a permanently hostile Government.
The plan, drafted as part of an intensive policy review, reflects a conclusion that Iran must be isolated if it is to be prevented from emerging as a substantial threat to Western interests. Thus, the plan rejects Reagan and Bush Administration policies that offered to reward Teheran for good behavior. Abandoning a Balance
Administration officials said the new approach aimed at denying Iran access to the money and weapons needed to complete a military resurgence. They said it was based on a decision that the United States and its allies should now treat Iran as harshly as it treats Iraq.
For much of the 1980's, the United States sought to play Iran and Iraq against one another. But with United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf war, the Administration has concluded that the wiser policy is "dual containment."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher hinted at the emerging shift earlier this year by denouncing Iran as an "international outlaw" and a "dangerous country" for its support of terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. But the new policy is far more sweeping than Mr. Christopher indicated when he said the United States would seek to block loans to Iran by international organizations.
Administration officials say the isolation of Iran should end only if Teheran halts its support for terrorism, curtails its military buildup, stops its subversion of other governments and ends its quest for nuclear weapons. Catalogue of Accusations
Among the antagonistic activities that United States officials attribute to Iran is active support for efforts by the Hamas and Party of God organizations to use violence to disrupt the Mideast peace talks. The officials say Iran has also helped establish terrorist training camps in Lebanon and the Sudan, and has assisted groups trying to overthrow the Governments of Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia.
The United States already subjects Iran to stiff sanctions that prohibit military and most commercial ties. Administration officials said their new policy could succeed only if other countries change course.
Among the top priorities, Administration officials said, are efforts to convince Russia and China to cancel deals to provide Iran with weapons and nuclear reactors, and to persuade Japan, Germany and Britain to cut off loans.
None of those countries have shown any willingness to sever such lucrative ties, and Japan in particular has argued that commercial links can encourage moderate elements inside Iran. But while the United States once harbored similar hopes, Administration officials now regard all factions in the current leadership as bound to remain hostile toward the West.
While many deals between United States companies and Iran are already prohibited, the new policy would almost certainly lead the Administration to reject a request by the Boeing Company to sell 20 Boeing 737 jetliners to Iran, a deal worth more than $750 million, officials say.
The broad outlines of the new approach were described in a speech last week by Martin S. Indyk, the senior director for Middle East policy for the National Security Council, to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a research group.
Mr. Indyk said bluntly, "If we fail in our efforts to modify Iranian behavior, five years from now Iran will be much more capable of posing a real threat to Israel and to Western interests in the Middle East."
The Iran review was one of several dozen studies requested by President Clinton shortly after he took office.
But the atmosphere surrounding it has been intensified by suspicions that Iran might have had a role in the World Trade Center bombing, Government officials say. Investigators have found that tens of thousands of dollars were wired from Iran to bank accounts held by suspects in the bombing. No Help Likely for Rebels
Final details of the plan await White House approval, officials say. But while Mr. Clinton made overtures to the main Iranian opposition group before he took office, his advisers said there was no chance that the new policy would involve closer ties with the group, the People's Mujahedeen.
The Administration has concluded that the Mujahedeen's ties to Iraq and its terrorist attacks against Americans in the 1970's makes it an unacceptable partner.
The officials also expressed little optimism that the organized resistance or other domestic unrest could force a significant change in the Iranian Government. They said they expected President Hashemi Rafsanjani to win re-election to a second four-year term in elections on June 11. The Political Issues
Administration officials also said the United States had rejected seeking an embargo on sales of Iranian oil. The rebels have called for such a ban, but the policy review concluded that it could not be enforced without imposing a military blockade, a step Mr. Clinton's advisers are unwilling to take.
In outlining the effort to isolate Iran, officials acknowledged that the task would be more difficult than the containment of Iraq, which carries the weight of United Nations sanctions.
In March, an initial United States attempt to isolate Teheran failed when the World Bank overrode Washington's objections and approved a $165 million loan to upgrade Iran's electrical power system. But officials who outlined the new policy said the United States intended to mount an aggressive effort to persuade other countries of the dangers Iran poses.
Administration officials have begun to argue that Iran, which has borrowed $25 billion in the last four years, is not a good investment. Teheran has already fallen $5 billion behind on its payments, and the Administration intends to warn countries that go ahead with sales of weapons and nuclear goods that they run the risk of not being paid.
Because of high inflation and unemployment, a senior Administration official said, Iran was "more vulnerable than it has been in the past or is likely to be in the future." But he repeated Mr. Indyk's warning that "this moment will not last long." The Military Issues
The Central Intelligence Agency has warned that Iran may acquire a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade. Its deals with Russia and China for nuclear reactors are regarded with uneasiness by some American analysts, who say the plants may be being used as a cover to acquire sensitive technology.
A simultaneous Iranian buildup of conventional forces has prompted similar concern. Officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency have said Teheran's $2 billion military spending spree may be merely an effort to rebuild forces depleted during its eight-year war with Iraq. But purchases of Russian submarines and a bid to buy top-of-the-line tanks have persuaded other officials that Iran seeks to become the dominant power in the Mideast.

Abstract: Q. Mr. President, there's a widespread perception that you're waffling, that you can't make up your mind. One day you're saying, in a few days, we'll have a decision, we have a common approach. The next day, you're saying, we're still looking for a consensus. A. I would say that the month before last, we had virtually no inflation, and you can't run the country on a month-to-month basis. You've got to look at some longer trends. There are some clear underlying reasons for this last inflationary bulge, which don't necessarily portend long-term inflation. I think it's, of course, a cause of concern, we ought to look at it, but we ought to wait till we have some more evidence before we raise interest rates in an economy where industrial capacity is only at 80 percent. I think the American people know one thing: that I'm on their side, that I'm fighting to change things, and they're finding out it's not so easy. But we are going to get a lot of change out of this Congress if we can keep our eye on the ball and stop worrying about whether we characterize each other in some way or another and keep thinking about what's good for the American people.

Full text: Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday in the Rose Garden at the White House, as transcribed by Reuters. OPENING STATEMENT
Three months ago, I presented a plan to our country and to the Congress designed to address what I believe are the significant challenges of this time. For more than 40 years our country was organized to stand up against Communism, to try to help develop the free world, and for most of that time we took our economic prosperity for granted.
It is now clear that at the end of the cold war we must organize ourselves around the obligation we have to be more competitive in the global economy and to enable our people to live up to their full potential.
That means we have to do a lot of things to turn this economy around, beginning with a serious effort to reduce our national debt, to invest in jobs and new technologies, to restore fairness to our tax code and to make our political system work again.
This week I was able to go back again to the American people, to take my case into the country, and to Cleveland and Chicago and New York, and here, in Washington, there were new efforts to break the gridlock and to put the national interest above narrow interests.
The results were particularly impressive in the work done by the House Ways and Means Committee. Achieving over $250 billion in deficit reduction through spending cuts with two dollars in spending cuts for each dollar in new investment in jobs and education, the program provides significantly everything that I presented to the Congress, even though there were some changes. In fact, some of the changes I think made the bill better.
Let me reiterate them. No. 1, significant deficit reduction. No. 2, taking on entitlements issues that have for too long been left on the table. No. 3, real investments for small businesses, and for big businesses, incentives to get people to invest money in this economy to create jobs.
And perhaps most importantly, a break for working-class families, a huge increase in the earned-income tax credit for people with incomes under $30,000, to relieve them of the impact of the energy tax and to say for the first time, people who work 40 hours a week with children in the home would be lifted above poverty.
And finally, of course, the plan was very progressive, 75 percent of the revenues coming from the top 6 percent of the American taxpayers.
I also reiterated that I don't want a penny in taxes without the spending cuts, and I proposed in New York that we create a deficit-reduction trust fund into which all the taxes and all the budget cuts could be put and kept for the five-year life of this budget.
This is a very important thing. I realize some have said it is little more than a gimmick, but the truth is there is no legal protection now for the life of the budget for these funds. This will provide it, in stone, in law.
In every element of this there has been some willingness on the part of those who have supported our efforts to take on powerful vested interests in behalf of the national interest, whether it is in repealing the lobby deduction, or in going for a direct loan program for college loans that will save $4 billion, but which will remove a Government-guaranteed income from several interests who like the system as it is now.
The Congress also moved this week to reinvigorate our democratic process by ending the filibuster and passing the motor voter bill.
These are the kinds of changes that the American people expect of us. They do not expect miracles, but they expect solid, steady progress, and I am determined to stay on this course. It has been a good week, and if we are willing to take more tough decisions, there will be more good weeks for the American people ahead. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS U.S. Role in Bosnia
Q. Mr. President, you've said that the United States will not go it alone with military action in Bosnia, and yet the European allies have refused to sign on to your proposals. If the allies refuse to follow suit, where does that leave the United States?
A. Let me reiterate what I have said because I think that the United States has taken the right position, and I think that we've gotten some good results. I have said, and I will reiterate, I think that the United States must act with our allies, especially because Bosnia is in the heart of Europe, and the Europeans are there. We must work together through the United Nations.
Secondly, I do not believe the United States has any business sending troops there to get involved in a conflict in behalf of one of the sides. I believe that we should continue to turn up the pressure, and as you know, I have taken the position that the best way to do that would be to lift the arms embargo with a standby authority of air power in the event that the present situation was interrupted by the unfair use of artillery by the Bosnian Serbs.
That position is still on the table. It has not been rejected out of hand. Indeed, some of our European allies have agreed with it and others are not prepared to go that far yet. But we have to keep the pressure up.
And I would just remind you that since we said we would become involved in the Vance-Owen peace process, two of the three parties have signed on, we've gotten enforcement of the no-fly zone through the United Nations, we've been able to airlift more humanitarian supplies there, and we've been able to keep up a very, very tough embargo on Serbia, which I think led directly, that and the pressure of further action, to the statement that Mr. Milosevic made to the effect that he would stop supporting the Bosnian Serbs.
Where we go from here is to keep pushing in the right direction. As we speak here, the United Nations is considering a resolution which would enable us to place United Nations forces along the border between Serbia and Bosnia, to try to test and reinforce the resolve of the Milosevic government to cut off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs.
If that resolution passes, and in its particulars it makes good sense, that is a very good next step. We're just going to keep working and pushing in this direction, and I think we'll begin to get more and more results.

Q. Mr. President, there's a widespread perception that you're waffling, that you can't make up your mind. One day you're saying, in a few days, we'll have a decision, we have a common approach. The next day, you're saying, we're still looking for a consensus.
Will American troops be in this border patrol that the U.N. is voting on? And you know, where are we?
A. Well, first of all, I have made up my mind and I've told you what my position was and I made it as clear as I can. But I also believe it is imperative that we work with our allies on this. The United States is not in a position to move unilaterally, nor should we. So that is the answer to your question. The resolution being considered by the United Nations, I think, contemplates that the Unprofor [ United Nations Protective Force ] forces would be moved and expanded and moved to the border. At this time, there has been no suggestion that we would be asked to be part of those forces. Military's Gay Ban
Q. A domestic question. Could you tell us, how were you affected by the testimony of Col. Fred Peck, whose son is a homosexual, who said that nonetheless he could not in good conscience support lifting the ban?
A. I thought all the testimony given in that hearing, and I saw quite a lot of it from more than one panel, was quite moving and straightforward. I still think the test ought to be conduct.
Q. Do you think that -- do you -- does this allow for the possibility of the "don't ask, don't tell," the compromise that would allow ----
A. You know what my position is. I have nothing else to say about it.

Civil Rights Appointment
Q. Your nominee to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division [ Lani Guinier ] has expressed what many regard as rather striking views about voting rights and a number of other areas, including expressing some misgivings about the principle of one man, one vote. And I wonder if you are familiar with all these views and if you support them, and if you do not, why you chose her?
A. I nominated her because there had never been a full-time practicing civil rights lawyer with a career in civil rights law heading the Civil Rights Division. I expect a policy to be made on civil rights laws by the United States Congress, and I expect the Justice Department to carry out that policy.
Insofar as there is discretion in the policy, that discretionary authority should reside either in the president or the attorney general, in terms of what policies the country will follow. I still think she's a very well-qualified civil rights lawyer, and I hope she'll be confirmed, and I think she has every intention of following the law of the land as Congress writes it.

Federal Reserve
Q. Mr. President, what would you say or what do you say to Federal Reserve officials who are arguing for a slight rise in short-term interest rates because they're concerned about resurging inflation?
A. I would say that the month before last, we had virtually no inflation, and you can't run the country on a month-to-month basis. You've got to look at some longer trends. There are some clear underlying reasons for this last inflationary bulge, which don't necessarily portend long-term inflation. I think it's, of course, a cause of concern, we ought to look at it, but we ought to wait till we have some more evidence before we raise interest rates in an economy where industrial capacity is only at 80 percent.
If you look at all the underlying long-term things -- long-term trends in energy prices, industrial capacity, the kinds of things that really shape an economy -- there is no reason at this time to believe that there could be any cause for a resurgent inflation.
Q. The argument is made at the Federal Reserve that higher taxes, higher burdens on business through health care fees or other things like that will indeed raise inflation while the economy stays weak.
A. Well, just a few weeks ago some people were arguing that all this would be deflationary and would repress the recovery. So I guess you can find an expert to argue any opinion, but there is no evidence of that.
The prevailing opinion at the Fed and the prevailing opinion in the economic community has been that the most important thing we can do is to bring down long-term interest rates by bringing down the deficit. You can't have it both ways. We're either going to bring down the deficit or we're not. And everything in life requires some rigorous effort if you're going to have fundamental change.
 
 

 
 
. . .

Opinion Polls
Q. Mr. President, in your opening statement you said this has been a good week for you, but the latest CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, as you probably saw, shows a 10 percent decline in your job-approval rating since the end of April, from 55 to 45 percent.
Why do you think that's happening? And is it your fault, or what can be done?
A. Well, for one thing, I'm trying to do hard things, and I can't do hard things, and conduct an ongoing campaign at the same time.
You know, I'm doing things that are hard, that are controversial, and anybody who doesn't want to assume responsibility can stand on the sidelines and criticize them. I never expected that I could actually do anything about the deficit without having some hits.
I never expected that I could take on some of these interests that I've taken on without being attacked. And whenever you try to change things, there are always people there ready to point out the pain of change without the promise of it, and that's just all part of it.
If I worried about the poll ratings I'd never get anything done here. My only -- the only thing I'd remind you is, for 12 years we've seen politicians in the Congress and the executive branch worry about their poll ratings every month, and then at the end of every four years things are a lot worse.
If things are better at the end of the period that I was given to serve, then the poll ratings now won't make any difference, and if they're not, they won't make any difference. So my job is to do my job and let the chips fall where they may. Yes?
Q. There seems to be a Catch-22 emerging on Bosnia. One would be that you have consistently said that you want to have a consensus with the U.S. allies, but until that consensus is formed, you've found that it seems very difficult to explain to the American people precisely how that war should be defined. Is it a civil war? Is it a war of aggression? And also not necessarily what the next step should be, but what are the principles, the overriding principles that should guide U.S. policy?
What can you tell the American people right now about that?
A. First, that it is both a civil war and a war of aggression. Because Bosnia was created as a separate legal entity, it is both a civil war, where elements of people who live within that territory are fighting against one another, and there has been aggression from without -- from the Croatians and from the Serbs, principally from the Serbs. That the inevitable but unintended impact of the arms embargo has been to put the United Nations in the position of ratifying an enormous superiority of arms for the Bosnian Serbs that they got from Serbia. And that our interest is in seeing, in my view at least, that the United Nations does not fore-ordain the outcome of a civil war. That's why I've always been in favor of some kind of lifting of the arms embargo -- that we contain the conflict and that we do everything we can to move to an end of it and to move to an end of ethnic cleansing.
Those are our interests there, and those are the ones I'm trying to pursue, but we should not introduce American ground forces into the conflict in behalf of one of the belligerents, and we must move with our allies.

Youth in the White House
Q. Mr. President, one of the charges leveled by critics of you in Arkansas and now at the beginning of your term as President is that you've surrounded yourself with too many young people and put them in too many senior positions. How do you respond to that criticism?
A. Like Lloyd Bentsen and Warren Christopher?
I mean, who are you referring to? Mr. McLarty, Mr. Ruin, Ms. Rasco and Mr. Lake, to name four, and I, are all I think older than our counterparts were when President Kennedy was President.
There are a lot of young people who work here but most of the people in decision-making positions are not particularly young. And I'm amazed sometimes that, you know -- you think I ought to let some of them go?
 
 

 
 
. . .

Cutting the Deficit
Q. Mr. President, you've been talking a lot recently about deficit reduction, the deficit reduction trust fund. You're talking now about having to stretch out your investment programs, postpone some of the things. What do you say to people in urban areas, some of the liberal congressmen on the Hill, who say, wait a minute, we're the ones who elected this guy and now the programs that have been starved for 12 years that we need aren't going to be able to get money? What sort of political position does that put you in with your core supporters?
A. Well, I ask them, first of all, to look at the five-year budget. The enormous squeeze on domestic spending, including investment spending, began 12 years ago. I can't turn it around overnight. And I ask them to look at the five-year budget and look at in light of the fact that the deficit numbers were revised upward after the election by $50 billion a year in three of the next four years.
And I ask them also to consider this: until we can prove that we have the discipline to control our budget, I don't think we'll have the elbow room necessary to have the kind of targeted investments we need. I think the more we do budget control, the more we'll be free to then be very sharply discriminating in those things which actually do create jobs. I don't think we have any other option at this time. Crisis of Hope
Q. Mr. President, in your New York speech this past week at Cooper Union, you spoke of a crisis of belief and hope, and earlier Mrs. Clinton in a speech talked about a crisis of meaning. How do you see these crises manifesting themselves, what are the causes of them, and how severe do you see this?
A. Well, I think they manifested themselves in people's honest feelings that things are not going very well in this country and that they haven't gone very well in a long time, in the alienation people feel from the political process, and in the alienation they often feel from one another in the same neighborhoods and communities.
There are real objective reasons for a lot of these problems. After all, for most people the work week is lengthening and incomes are declining, the job growth of the country has been very weak, the crime rate is high, and there's a sense of real alienation there. And I don't think we can speak to them just with programs. I think that in our different ways that's what both Hillary and I were trying to say.
And the thing I was trying to say to the American people at the Cooper Union that I want to reiterate today is that you can never change if you have no belief in the potential of your country, your community or yourself, and that the easy path is cynicism, the easy path is to throw rocks. The better path is doing the hard work of change.
 
 

 
 
. . .

As I said at Cooper Union, when President Kennedy occupied that office, nearly three-quarters of the American people believed that their leaders would tell them the truth and that their institutions worked and that problems could be solved.
So there was a lot more elbow room there. You know, a year or two years could go by, people could be working on something with maybe only slightly measurable progress, but the country felt that it was moving forward. That is what we have to restore today, a sense that it can be done, and it cannot be done by the President alone, but the President has to keep saying that, that faith is a big part of this.
 
 

 
 
. . .

Justice Dept. Nominee
Q. Okay. I'd like to go back to your Justice Department for just a second, Mr. President, since during the campaign you said it was a mistake and in fact apologized for playing golf at an all-white country club in Little Rock, shouldn't it disqualify your nominee for associate attorney general, Webb Hubbell? Is there an exception because he's a family friend and, and are the local ----
A. Absolutely not.
Q. ---- are the local civil rights leaders wrong when they say that his attempts to integrate the club appear to have been a last-minute political conversion?
A. No, as a matter of fact, if you go back -- first of all, let me, let me -- the first question is no, he should not be disqualified. The second question is, is it a last-minute conversion? The African-American who joined the club testified that Webb Hubbell had been trying for years to get him to do it and he had not agreed. That's what the record shows.
Thirdly, my belief is that the overwhelming majority of African-American leaders in my state would very much like to see him confirmed.
He's always had a reputation as being a strong advocate of civil rights whether as Mayor of Little Rock or chief justice of the Supreme Court of my state.
 
 

 
 
. . .

Strength of Policy
Q. Mr. President, I want to go back to a question that Helen asked earlier about your indecisiveness over Bosnia. I'm wondering how you think that's affected perceptions of you as a leader. There is a concern reflected in polls and in some comments from Democratic members in Congress that you are indecisive and perhaps not tough enough to tackle all the problems.
A. Well, I'd just like to ask you what their evidence is. When Russia came up the United States took the lead and we got a very satisfactory result. When I took office, I said we were going to try to do more in Bosnia. We agreed to go to the Vance-Owen peace process, and two of the three parties signed on. We got enforcement of the no-fly zone. We began to engage in multinational humanitarian aid.
We got much, much tougher sanctions. We got the threat of military force on the table as a possible option, Milosevic changed his position all because this Administration did more than the previous one.
And every time I have consulted the Congress, they say to me in private this is a really tough problem, I don't know what you should do, but you're the only president that ever took us into counsel beforehand. Instead of telling us what you were going to do, you actually ask us our opinion. I do not believe that is a sign of weakness. And I realize it may be frustrating for all of you to deal with the ambiguity of this problem, but it is a difficult one.
I have a clear policy. I have gotten more done on this than my predecessor did, and maybe one reason he didn't try to do it is because if you can't force everybody to fall in line overnight, the people that have been fighting each other for centuries, you may be accused of vacillating. We are not vacillating. We have a clear, strong policy.
In terms of the other issues, who else around this town in the last dozen years has offered this much budget cutting, this much tax increases, this much deficit reduction, and a clear economic strategy that asks the wealthy to pay their fair share, gives the middle class a break and gives massive incentives to get new investment and new jobs in the small business community and from large business as well?
I think -- you know, I don't understand what -- on one day people say he's trying to do too much, he's pushing too hard, he wants too much change; and then on the other day says, well, he's really not pushing very hard.
I think we're getting good results. We've been here three months, we've passed a number of important bills, and I feel good about it.
I think the American people know one thing: that I'm on their side, that I'm fighting to change things, and they're finding out it's not so easy. But we are going to get a lot of change out of this Congress if we can keep our eye on the ball and stop worrying about whether we characterize each other in some way or another and keep thinking about what's good for the American people.
Every day I try to get up and think about not what somebody characterizes my action as, but whether what I do will or will not help to improve the lives of most Americans. That is the only ultimate test by which any of us should be judged.
Thank you very much.

Abstract: In the end, the 10-year auction went fairly well, with an average yield of 5.96 percent, the lowest since the Treasury began regular auctions in 1978. But that was not enough to lift the cloud created by the inflation report or to offset concerns about today's $8.25 billion auction of 30-year bonds. That auction could be undermined by the hangover of yesterday's inflation report and the release of the Consumer Price Index today. The April report on retail sales could also give traders headaches on the final day of the Treasury's quarterly auction series. "When the market was rallying earlier this year, people expected that the rate of inflation would be lower," Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said. "I think the market has realized that inflation won't be lower, but I do not think that it has realized that it will be higher." "10-Year Treausry Notes" tracks average yields at quarterly autions, in percent, since the beginning of 1989.

Full text: There was a rude awakening for the Treasury market yesterday: The April jump in producer price inflation was much higher than expected and signaled that there is less hope now for a new rally based on declining inflation.
The metaphorical slap in the face pushed prices lower, with the 30-year bond down 19/32 point and the yield up to 6.85 percent, from 6.81 percent Tuesday. The prices of two-year to five-year notes fell much less, however, because inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments, has less impact on shorter-term securities.
The selling, which came in the morning, might have actually helped the Treasury's auction of $10.76 billion of 10-year notes because the price of that issue also fell ahead of the 1 P.M. bidding deadline, making it more attractive to dealers.
In the end, the 10-year auction went fairly well, with an average yield of 5.96 percent, the lowest since the Treasury began regular auctions in 1978. But that was not enough to lift the cloud created by the inflation report or to offset concerns about today's $8.25 billion auction of 30-year bonds. That auction could be undermined by the hangover of yesterday's inflation report and the release of the Consumer Price Index today. The April report on retail sales could also give traders headaches on the final day of the Treasury's quarterly auction series.
The bad news for traders and investors was in the six-tenths of one percentage point increase in the Producer Price Index for finished goods. Some analysts dismissed the April increase as an aberration, in part because of the weather-induced 44.7 percent increase in the prices of fresh and dried vegetables.
Some traders said if the figures had been taken as a new sign of rising inflation and not just an aberration, the selloff would have been steeper.
But this is the third out of the first four months of the year that the index has been higher than expectations because of aberrations and "these aberrations are adding up to a higher P.P.I. number," Michael H. Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International, said. "Bond investors should take a look at it."
If future reports make it clearer that inflation will be higher this year, there will be more upward pressure on interest rates. The C.P.I. rose 3 percent last year. But those who think it will be higher this year say the increase will be small.
Traders were able to dismiss the jump in food prices. But they had trouble with the more than 1 percent increase, after seasonal adjustment, in the price of passenger cars. "The car prices are real to me," one trader said.
"When the market was rallying earlier this year, people expected that the rate of inflation would be lower," Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said. "I think the market has realized that inflation won't be lower, but I do not think that it has realized that it will be higher."
However, some traders and forecasters, including those at Merrill Lynch, still expect inflation to decline, despite yesterday's report. Four Themes
Inflation is one of the four themes that have been influencing trading recently. And because traders can quickly turn from positive to negative, the bond market has been locked in a narrow trading range for two months.
The others are the pace of economic growth, President Clinton's handling of the economy and the deficit, and technical factors, which include the strong demand for Treasury securities because portfolio managers still have a lot of cash to invest.
The inflation theme had been a worry but was put to rest temporarily by the small increases in the producer and consumer price indexes in March. That confidence was unsettled a bit yesterday.
On growth, the data have been relatively positive for the market as it shows that the economy continues to appear to be moving ahead at a slow pace that would not put any upward pressure on prices. But this could change later in the year. Deficit Doubts
The recent setbacks to President Clinton on his economic program have raised some doubts about the outlook for significant deficit reduction, although it was his promise of such reduction that fueled the rally earlier this year.
The fate of today's 30-year bond auction is likely to hinge on the C.P.I. report and retail sales reports for April. A jump of two-tenths of one percentage point in the C.P.I. and a 1.2 percent rise in retail sales, which are the consensus forecasts, would settle inflationary jitters and help the auction. Stronger inflation and stronger sales would cause trouble.
The success of yesterday's 10-year note auction was reflected in trading afterward, when the yield in the when-issued market fell to 5.92 percent, from the 5.96 average at the auction.
The 10-year notes are the same as the 6.25 percent issue that was originally sold in February and matures in February 2003. The Treasury reopened the issue because there was a severe shortage of the notes available for trading, which left open the possibility that the issue could be manipulated.
The reopening policy was set after the Treasury bidding scandal at Salomon Brothers in 1991. The 30-year bond sale will also be a reopening of the 7.125 percent issue sold in February and maturing in 2023.
Following are the results of the 10-year note auction yesterday: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price . . . 102.098 Average Yield . . . 5.96% Low Price . . . 102.024 High Yield . . . 5.97% High Price . . . 102.178 Low Yield . . . 5.95% Accepted at low price . . . 77% Total applied for . . . $26,185,998 Accepted . . . $10,762,398 N.Y. applied for . . . $25,107,215 N.Y. accepted . . . $10,418,800 Noncompetitive . . . $448,000 Interest set at . . . 6 1/4% The 10-year notes mature May 15, 2003.

Abstract: "Latin America is our highest strategic priority and we do not see a more compelling investment opportunity anywhere in the world," said Ken Ross, chief spokesman for the corporation's international division. "We've had explosive growth in the region." NBC and Fox have announced plans for Latin American cable television networks. China's state-owned steel group has acquired Peru's state iron company. The NEC Corporation has entered a telecommunications joint venture with Argentina's largest industrial concern, Perez Companc. Mitsubishi has won a $150 million contract to build a power-generation plant for Chile's state copper company. And Hilton is building a luxury hotel in Punta del Este, the posh Uruguayan resort. Mr. [David Mulford] argues that Latin America has a number of other attractions. "We have a common historical religious and social heritage with Latin America, and it is now made up almost exclusively of democratic governments," he said. "They have much more sophisticated market economies than the new states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. "It's a market of almost 600 million," he said, referring to an estimate for the population in 15 years. That would even put Europe in the shade.

Full text: EVEN as much of the world dissolves into a single, faceless market, some things just won't happen. Dunkin' Donuts would not try to sell baguettes to Parisians. Benihana would not open hot-dog stands in the United States. Pepsico, surely, would not sell tacos to the Mexicans.
Think again on that last one. Pepsico, which owns the Taco Bell chain, saw the fattening wallets of Mexico's younger generation, splashed some extra hot sauce onto its tacos and headed across the border.
Call it Pepsi's Latin invasion. And it's not just tacos, and not just Mexico. Last month the company announced a $750 million, five-year assault in Mexico, including plans to buy interests in big bottlers, buy distribution routes and advertise heavily. The company is opening Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC franchises throughout Latin America, and selling Fritos, Ruffles and Doritos chips as far south as Tierra del Fuego. And it will soon announce that later this year it will spend tens of millions of dollars to sponsor Michael Jackson on an eight-city tour of Latin America.
"Latin America is our highest strategic priority and we do not see a more compelling investment opportunity anywhere in the world," said Ken Ross, chief spokesman for the corporation's international division. "We've had explosive growth in the region."
Pepsico has company. Led by the consumer-products, technology and service sectors, businesses in the United States, Japan and Europe have quadrupled their investments in Latin America in the past three years. Nearly $100 billion was invested in the region from 1990 through 1992, primarily in Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, up from $24 billion for the previous three years.
A few examples: Wal-Mart, Kmart, Sears, J. C. Penney, Price Club and other retailers have entered Mexico in the last year or stepped up operations there. Anheuser-Busch is buying a $477 million stake in Mexico's largest brewery. Ford has opened a modern axle factory in Argentina. Digital Equipment has teamed with Chile's largest software producer to sell its machines across Latin America. A small California disk-drive maker, Memotech, is moving its manufacturing operations to Chile.
NBC and Fox have announced plans for Latin American cable television networks. China's state-owned steel group has acquired Peru's state iron company. The NEC Corporation has entered a telecommunications joint venture with Argentina's largest industrial concern, Perez Companc. Mitsubishi has won a $150 million contract to build a power-generation plant for Chile's state copper company. And Hilton is building a luxury hotel in Punta del Este, the posh Uruguayan resort.
In addition, investors seeking profits in Latin America's volatile emerging stock markets have poured billions into the Buenos Aires, Santiago, Sao Paulo, Caracas and Mexico City stock exchanges. A Surging Population
The rush into Latin America is based on an idea that only a few years ago would have seemed unthinkable -- that this market of 470 million people from Mexico to Argentina (including the Caribbean) could be one of the more stable growth investments of the closing years of this century and beyond.
Some economists and government officials are arguing that now is the time for the United States to alter longstanding economic policies that favor Europe and Asia in favor of one that promotes closer ties in the Americas, arguing that Latin America's booming markets can be a critical source of economic strength to American business.
"If you are the new President of the United States and your top priority is restoring domestic economic growth, then Latin America is your best customer," said David Mulford, former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under Presidents Bush and Reagan and now vice chairman of First Boston. "It is returning to strength at a time when Europe and Japan are in recession, and you should be very much aware of the fact that Latin America is contributing to Main Street America, creating jobs and economic activity."
Indeed, since the region's collective nadir in 1989, most Latin American nations have significantly increased their growth and lowered their inflation rates. Only Brazil and Peru lack a healthy rate of growth, and only Brazil currently suffers hyperinflation, although several other countries have rates above 25 percent.
Mr. Mulford argues that Latin America has a number of other attractions. "We have a common historical religious and social heritage with Latin America, and it is now made up almost exclusively of democratic governments," he said. "They have much more sophisticated market economies than the new states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. "It's a market of almost 600 million," he said, referring to an estimate for the population in 15 years. That would even put Europe in the shade.
He added that the United States already accounts for 57 percent of Latin American imports, compared with only 11 percent of Japan's and 22 percent of Europe's. The Risks
That is not to say that Latin America is not still a risky investment.
To keep investment dollars coming, many of its central banks have kept real interest rates high, a drag on growth. Much of the pent-up consumer demand from the 1980's was satiated in 1991 and 1992, dimming the outlook for this year. There is pressure on governments to devalue their currencies to make exports more competitive, but such devaluations would quickly lift inflation.
In December, the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth projections for the region, to 2 percent in 1993, from 3.9 percent. The main reasons were a continued recession in Brazil and slower than expected growth in Mexico and Argentina as high trade deficits robbed local industry of production and jobs.
And politics could change the picture for the worse. This is a year of presidential or other important elections in Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. The elections tend to put more pressure on governments to increase spending, which can lead to higher rates of inflation.
Moreover, memories of a troubled past are still fresh. The democratic regimes that now govern all Central and South American countries except French Guiana are still fragile -- susceptible to military coup attempts, as was seen last year in Venezuela, and leaders who seize extraordinary powers, as has Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori. Social unrest, the product of entrenched poverty and guerrilla and drug-trade violence, threatens the political order in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. Remember the 1970's
The recent surge in interest in Latin America is not the first.
In the 1970's, banks and international lending organizations lent hundreds of billions of dollars in the region, primarily to governments and state-owned businesses. But the money went to cover budget deficits and finance projects that became plagued by bureaucratic tangles, corruption and mismanagement. Foreign companies followed the lead of the lenders and set up shop in Latin America, but frequently encountered attempts at nationalization, high inflation and policies favoring local companies.
The investment climate here has changed radically since then. Now, much more of the lending is to privately owned local industrial groups for specific projects. And foreign investors are being much more cautious, often refusing to commit unless they can find prestigious local partners to share the risk.
The economic approaches recently embraced by most Latin governments -- emphasizing open markets, low inflation and balanced budgets -- have enabled them to strike agreements with commercial banks to reduce once-onerous debt levels. That has opened the door to the international markets and new borrowing both by companies and governments, reversing a history of defaulting on debt payments that left Latin America a pariah throughout the 1980's.
In 1991 and 1992, for example, Latin America raised an average of $12 billion each year in bond and stock offerings in the international markets, compared with an annual average of less than $1 billion throughout most of the 1980's.
Still, corporate managers say they are moving much more cautiously than in the past. William Rhodes, the Citicorp vice chairman who heads negotiations with countries over reorganizing their commercial bank debt, said the most important thing to businesses is the assurance that the new economic thinking will last.
Investors, he said, are waiting longer than they did in the 1970's before jumping in. "Corporate executives want to have the feeling that the continuity is there," he said, "that after two years of reform, the change is permanent, not a fleeting thing." Five Favorites
Economists and bankers generally agree that the most attractive Latin American countries for investment are these:
* Mexico, the top choice, because of proximity to the United States and the chance of a free-trade agreement with Washington, plus a huge domestic market and economic reforms.
* Chile, the second choice, with the fastest-growing and perhaps most open economy; the smallness of its market and distance from the United States are slight disadvantages.
* Argentina, third, because of the vast changes in the past two years in a country that was prone to hyperinflation and military government; but investors are worried about an overvalued peso and continued government corruption.
* Venezuela, fourth, with vast oil reserves and open markets; but two attempted coups against President Carlos Andres Perez have worried investors.
* Brazil, fifth, for its sheer size, industrial strength and natural resources; but 1,200 percent inflation and a lack of a coherent economic policy have investors essentially in a holding pattern.
The cautious new invasion of Latin America is not led by heavy industry, nor by the historical attraction of exploiting low-cost labor and abundant natural resources. Rather, it tends to be a tapping of parts of the local market that sorely need development.
Throughout Latin America there is an acute shortage of banking services, computerization, telecommunications, shopping centers, supermarkets, hotels, insurance and a host of other services. Thus, many of the corporate players are in consumer-products, technology and services.
"Most people think computer sales can only grow more or less at the rate of overall economic growth, but that is just wrong for less developed countries such as in Latin America," said Richard O. Martorana, president of I.B.M. in Argentina. "In these markets, the demand for such services often far exceeds growth." The Move Into Chile
Chile is a good example of heightened investment by consumer-product and technology companies. Pepsico late last year announced a $100 million investment program, buying the country's largest bottler and snack-food concerns, and opening KFC's and Pizza Huts in Santiago. In late 1991, Digital Equipment teamed up with Chile's largest software manufacturer, Sonda, adapting its hardware to accommodate Sonda software and marketing it in 14 Latin countries. It is now the largest Latin computer company.
Also, Sonda recently joined Memotech International of Milpitas, Calif., which found the costs of making hard disk drives prohibitive in California. Memotech now plans to start manufacturing in Chile in July, not only for the Latin American market but for Europe and the United States as well.
Foreign investment in mining, fishing, energy and other natural resources is also strong. In Chile, for example, the Phelps Dodge Corporation and the Sumitomo Mining and Metals Company announced last November a $1.5 billion mining project for copper and gold. And in Venezuela last month, the Exxon Corporation, the Mitsubishi Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell signed a $3 billion joint venture agreement with the state gas company to develop natural gas.
As for Pepsico, the attraction of Latin America seems obvious. "It's a very young population and a growing one," Mr. Ross said. "The markers are all favorable." CHANGING THE PERSPECTIVE IN WASHINGTON
BUENOS AIRES
IN Washington, it is generally acknowledged that United States policy toward Latin America has historically involved little more than worrying about containment of Communism and the promotion of democracy.
As a strategic economic market, Latin America has been hardly a blip on the political radar in Washington, with the exception of Mexico and the occasions when governments defaulted on debt payments in the 1980's, threatening the stability of the international banking system.
But if Latin America continues to show growth as it has in the past two years, to control inflation and to maintain stability, it may have to be considered in a different light.
Some are arguing that Washington should take a lead in this, if for no other reason than safeguarding the United States' own commercial interests.
Policy recommendations generally have two goals. One is to insure that the region, historically prone to protectionism, remains open to American business by keeping tariffs low and helping governments in modernizing their capital markets, banking systems and regulation of industry -- in effect, integrating them more into the world financial markets.
Don E. Newquist, chairman of the International Trade Commission, has recommended that the United States use the hope of bilateral free trade pacts as a prod. He has suggested that such an accord be signed with Chile even before the one with Mexico, arguing that it would send a signal to other Latin countries that democratic governments promoting open markets will be rewarded.
David Mulford, former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and now vice chairman of First Boston, says the Clinton Administration should continue many of the programs begun under President Bush's Initiative for the Americas.
Among other things, these would create investment funds to help the development of small businesses, to study ways of reducing regulation and to institute changes in the judicial process to insure equal protection for foreign investors.

CREDIT MARKETS; Inflation News Heartens the Bond Market

Abstract: The selloff in the market since early March had been sparked by sharp jumps in the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price index in January and February and a surprisingly large jump in jobs over the first quarter of the year. The data did not portend a surge in inflation but indicated that if the pace continued, inflation would not decline below last year's level, which some forecasters and investors were betting on, and that it would likely be a little higher. Traders said part of yesterday's bond market surge came from buyers who had previously sold Treasury securities short because they expected the core inflation rate to be higher. When their speculative bet proved wrong, they had to buy back the securities quickly to limit their losses. That added to the sharp rise in prices and the steep decline in yields, said Andrew S. Brenner, a trader at Nomura Securities International. "I think people understand that inflation is not going to be horrible," said Nancy Kimelman, the chief economist for Technical Data in Boston. "But they understand that it is not going to be 2.5 percent either and that keeps us confined in a trading range."

Full text: After several weeks of nervousness and a heavy selloff in the bond market, traders and investors got some reassuring news on inflation yesterday and drove the yields on Treasury bonds and notes sharply lower.
Prices of bonds and notes spiked higher in the morning after the Labor Department reported that the core producer inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose just a tenth of 1 percent in March, well below the rate in February and January and below market expectations.
The negligible increase in the core inflation rate allowed the market to ignore what probably would have been a very disturbing four-tenths of 1 percent increase in the overall Producer Price Index for finished goods.
Prices surged again later in the day when the the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, offered reassuring comments on inflation, saying that the economy was nearing price stability.
By the end of a shortened trading day ahead of the Good Friday holiday today, the price of the 30-year bond was up 110/32 , while its yield plunged to 6.85 percent, down from 6.95 on Wednesday.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note, another longer-term issue that is sensitive to inflation, was up 24/32 as its yield fell to 5.96 percent, from 6.06 percent the day before.
The selloff in the market since early March had been sparked by sharp jumps in the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price index in January and February and a surprisingly large jump in jobs over the first quarter of the year. The data did not portend a surge in inflation but indicated that if the pace continued, inflation would not decline below last year's level, which some forecasters and investors were betting on, and that it would likely be a little higher.
Given how far the bond market had rallied, that was enough of a reason to sell until the outlook was clearer.
But while yesterday's inflation report was positive, the course of the market from here is still uncertain. The Consumer Price Index for March will be released today, when the market is closed. If the consumer price increase is not in line with the small rise in producer prices, much of the market's good feeling of yesterday would be lost.
Traders said part of yesterday's bond market surge came from buyers who had previously sold Treasury securities short because they expected the core inflation rate to be higher. When their speculative bet proved wrong, they had to buy back the securities quickly to limit their losses. That added to the sharp rise in prices and the steep decline in yields, said Andrew S. Brenner, a trader at Nomura Securities International.
Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said the report on March producer prices -- combined with the recent declines in the prices of commodities like lumber and copper -- provides a signal that inflation will decline this year.
Yesterday, Mr. Yardeni reaffirmed his forecast of a 2 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index, compared with 2.9 percent in 1992. He said such a small increase would mean that the yield on the 30-year bond should move toward 6.5 percent or lower, which is below the 16-year closing low of 6.72 percent reached on March 8.
But other analysts are not as sanguine. While the March producer price data provided a signal that inflation is not rising as fast as it was in the first two months of the year, they still forecast that prices will rise at the same or a slightly faster pace this year. And that means bond yields will remain around their current levels, but in a trading range that will preclude a breakthrough to new lows. Yields Are Locked
"I think people understand that inflation is not going to be horrible," said Nancy Kimelman, the chief economist for Technical Data in Boston. "But they understand that it is not going to be 2.5 percent either and that keeps us confined in a trading range."
Robert Giordano, the director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he expected data later in the year to show the inflation rate slowing to around last year's level. He said such data would send bond yields to new lows.
"But whether or not this is the start of that is another question," he added, saying that for now he believes that yields are locked in a trading range.
The bond market's rally yesterday was also aided by other data, including a small decline in initial jobless benefits claims and weak March store sales, which indicate that the economy is growing at a slower pace than at the nearly 5 percent clip at the end of last year. The slower growth means there is little chance that prices will be pushed higher by the demand of consumers or the exhausting of production capacity.

Gasoline in the United States sells for less than one-third the price in France, Italy and the Netherlands, largely because of those countries' high energy taxes, which seek to encourage conservation. The organization praised the Bush Administration's banking proposals, which call for allowing unrestricted interstate branch banking and common ownership of commercial banks and investment banks.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today that the United States economy would recover far more slowly from its recent recession than it has from most other recessions of the last three decades.
The Paris-based organization predicted that the economy would grow by 1.4 percent in the second half of this year and by 2.5 percent next year, which compares with an average growth of 6 percent in the four quarters immediately after the last seven recessions.
In its annual report on the American economy, the organization said the expansion phase of the cycle is expected to be muted compared with those of typical recoveries.
The report said a shallow recession was likely to be followed by a weak recovery because not much spending was forgone in the downturn to fuel the upturn.
The organization, comprising 24 industrial nations, projected that by the end of 1993 the United States unemployment rate would fall to 5.75 percent (it was 6.8 percent in October) and the inflation rate would drop to 2.9 percent (from the 3.9 percent predicted for this year).
The organization said United States exports would continue to expand, but more slowly than in recent years. It forecast that exports of goods and services would grow by 4.7 percent this year and 7.1 percent next year, compared with double-digit jumps in 1988 and 1989.
The increases in exports will help stabilize the United States' current-account deficit at about $60 billion, the organization forecast, compared with annual deficits of more than $100 billion from 1985 through 1989.
It said the major components of private-sector demand were expected to rebound, but it added that the excessive supply of commercial real estate from the late 1980's would dampen activity in this sector for some years.
The organization praised the Bush Administration's banking proposals, which call for allowing unrestricted interstate branch banking and common ownership of commercial banks and investment banks. The report said the proposed changes would increase the efficiency of the financial sector as a whole by increasing competition, and should pose little risk to the stability of the financial system. Stance on Deposit Insurance
The organization questioned proposals to limit deposit insurance coverage, saying depositors might not be able to impose effective discipline on bankers. But proposals to increase capital requirements for banks were praised as a possible aid in restoring market discipline by insuring that the owners of a bank have a large stake in its financial health.
Discussing energy efficiency, the report noted that energy prices were far lower in the United States than in most other industrial countries and that the United States consumed far more energy per capita than most other nations. Gasoline in the United States sells for less than one-third the price in France, Italy and the Netherlands, largely because of those countries' high energy taxes, which seek to encourage conservation.
Raising energy taxes would be consistent with both environmental goals and enhanced energy security, the report said.

Abstract: Some inflation, then, "greases the wheels of the economy" for manufacturers, and also for wage earners, said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist. Rising prices for gasoline or haircuts means that a $400-a-week wage can lose purchasing power without having to be cut from $400. With zero inflation, the same loss in purchasing power requires a wage cut and "people scream about cuts in their nominal wages," Professor Blinder noted. Still, the case for pushing down the inflation rate to zero, or nearly zero, attracts many followers. They acknowledge, for example, that a 4 percent inflation rate would be no more damaging to the economy than a 1 percent annual rise -- if the 4 percent rate remained steady and predictable. But 4 percent inflation is, by definition, hard to maintain, they say, and is therefore unpredictable. For that reason, the anti-inflationists prefer to aim for zero inflation, which they say is easier to maintain than 4 percent. "Price-level stability, popularly called zero inflation, is superior to inflation-rate stability," W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, wrote recently. It is this behavior that demonstrates the problem in pushing inflation down too hard: Falling employment levels can prolong a recession or make a recovery very weak. "To achieve zero inflation," Paul R. Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a recent article, "the Fed would probably have to engineer a recession that would keep the average rate of unemployment at 7.5 percent for the next five years."

Full text: FOR the first time since the late 1980's, inflation is clearly in decline. The most popular inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, has fallen by more than a percentage point, to an annual rate of less than 3 percent, in the first seven months of 1991. Various other measures also show inflation to be edging down. And that raises the question, should the Government use its powers to push the inflation rate even lower? The consensus, for the moment, is no.
Economists offer three main reasons. First, trying to reduce inflation from its already relatively low level would come at a high cost in more unemployment and recession. Second, inflation is not a problem as long as prices rise each year by the same predictable percentage. When the inflation rate jumps around, the uncertainty about what prices will do next is disruptive. Or, as William Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, put it: "A stable 4 percent inflation rate is better than an unstable zero rate that might soon rise."
Finally, pushing down the average inflation rate would be much harder on manufacturers than on service companies. Medical care fees, for example, are still rising at an 8.6 percent annual rate, but the General Electric Company could not make a recent price increase stick for its appliances and backtracked as sales fell. If the Government were to succeed in reducing the average inflation rate in this situation, doctors would probably still raise their fees, although not by as much as before, but manufacturers would have to cut prices. For them, the Government's strategy would be deflationary.
"You kill off profits when you do this, and with profits, new investment also goes, and that reduces potential economic growth," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. "You never get the economy out of the woods."
The inflation-fighting process explains why manufacturers bear the brunt. The Government's main agent in fighting inflation is the Federal Reserve, which tries to keep interest rates high enough so that people will be discouraged from financing new refrigerators, cars or homes. The recession that began last July, with its weak demand and falling production, was a byproduct of this anti-inflation effort. But the impact is always uneven.
The demand for refrigerators, cars or houses, and therefore their prices, is much more affected by interest rates on loans than are medical fees or the prices of other services. Whatever the cost of borrowing, medical fees tend to get paid, although they rise. Health insurance, Medicaid and Medicare sustain the demand.
Some inflation, then, "greases the wheels of the economy" for manufacturers, and also for wage earners, said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist. Rising prices for gasoline or haircuts means that a $400-a-week wage can lose purchasing power without having to be cut from $400. With zero inflation, the same loss in purchasing power requires a wage cut and "people scream about cuts in their nominal wages," Professor Blinder noted.
Still, the case for pushing down the inflation rate to zero, or nearly zero, attracts many followers. They acknowledge, for example, that a 4 percent inflation rate would be no more damaging to the economy than a 1 percent annual rise -- if the 4 percent rate remained steady and predictable. But 4 percent inflation is, by definition, hard to maintain, they say, and is therefore unpredictable. For that reason, the anti-inflationists prefer to aim for zero inflation, which they say is easier to maintain than 4 percent. "Price-level stability, popularly called zero inflation, is superior to inflation-rate stability," W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, wrote recently.
Those who invest in Treasury securities and corporate bonds also tend to favor zero inflation, because inflation reduces the purchasing power of the money they have tied up in these securities. And then there is the argument that downward pressure on inflation forces companies to be more efficient and productive. If General Electric cannot raise refrigerator prices, it tries to preserve profit margins in the face of rising labor costs through automation, layoffs and new procedures.
Manufacturers generally respond more quickly than service companies to the anti-inflation prod, but lately the service sector, too, seems to be pushing for efficiencies, mostly through layoffs, as obtaining price increases becomes more difficult.
It is this behavior that demonstrates the problem in pushing inflation down too hard: Falling employment levels can prolong a recession or make a recovery very weak. "To achieve zero inflation," Paul R. Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a recent article, "the Fed would probably have to engineer a recession that would keep the average rate of unemployment at 7.5 percent for the next five years."

Full text: Special to The New York Times
The Canadian economy is stirring again after a recession, far longer and deeper than the one in the United States, cut output by billions of dollars and sent unemployment to the highest levels since the early 1980's.
Like the United States, Canada has benefited from cuts in interest rates, which appear to be helping the housing and auto markets. Canada's economy is only a tenth the size of the United States' and Americans buy three-quarters of everything Canada exports, so it remains highly dependent on what happens south of the border.
Government indexes of leading indicators, used on both sides of the border to predict activity, are now pointing up. The Canadian index has just posted its first gain in 14 months, and most forecasting services expect further advances. 'At a Turning Pint'
"I think we're at a turning point, though we may be bouncing along the bottom for the next three or four months," said Warren Jestin, chief economist in Toronto for the Bank of Nova Scotia.
His feelings were echoed by Purdy Crawford, chief executive of Imasco Ltd., a consumer goods and services holding company that owns drug stores, variety stores, tobacco companies and the Canada Trust bank, as well as the Hardee's fast-food chain in the United States.
Mr. Crawford said he had noticed a "quickening of the tempo of business" in the various company operations in Canada, especially in the last few weeks.
But serious problems and questions do remain, including the federal debt, high unemployment, and the direction of long-term interest rates. And while economic concerns have for now brushed aside the burning issues linked to Quebec's drive for greater sovereignty or independence, they are still lurking.
Prominent economists say there are solid signs that the ice may finally be cracking. They point to strength in exports, rising investment in the energy industry and a surge in provincial government spending in Ontario. That province accounts for nearly half of the nation's economic output.
As might be expected, the national government in Ottawa waxes even more enthusiastic. "I'm very encouraged," said Finance Minister Donald Mazankowski, adding that the Canadian recovery "looks pretty solid."
Especially heartening for the Government are the upward revisions in economic growth rates earlier this year, signaling that the economy was not as weak as first indicated.
Yet the severity of the recession has spurred great popular discontent against the Progressive Conservative Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who has led the country for seven years.
Poll results show an overwhelming number of Canadians want Mr. Mulroney to resign, even though his mandate, renewed in 1988 elections, runs until 1993.
Last summer, before interest rates started falling here, the polls showed the Prime Minister's popularity, in terms of his percentage of supporters, had fallen below the prime rate.
The prime was about 15 percent then. It is now around 9.75 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in the United States.
"At least for now there is a fury in the land against the Prime Minister," said Keith Spicer, a former political science professor and broadcaster. Mr. Spicer, the chairman of the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, appointed and financed by the Government, made the statement in his preface to the forum's report, published in late June.
While economic prospects have improved, the recovery here, as in the United States, still seems a bit anemic and fitful. As a result, in neither country does business or consumer confidence yet correspond with the more promising statistics.
"The momentum for new growth is already here in Canada, but it could run out of steam if the U.S. doesn't really move," cautioned Patrick Grady, a partner in Global Economics, an Ottawa consulting firm.
In both the United States and Canada, debt burdens weigh heavily on governments and consumers. The Bank of Montreal could have spoken for both countries when it noted in its recent Business Review that debt "will not only inhibit further expenditures but keep long-term interest rates higher than would otherwise be the case, further slowing activity."
Unemployment is far higher here than in the United States and is a source of deep anxiety. The unemployment rate for June was 10.5 percent, matching a six-year high, and 3.5 percentage points above the American rate.
Taxes are also much higher, causing thousands of Canadian shoppers to bolt across the border for bargains in the northern United States. High Interest Rates
The cost of money is another preoccupation. Real interest rates after adjustment for inflation are still considered lofty in the United States, even after steep declines in the last 12 months. But they are even higher in Canada, a result of deliberate Government policy.
"The Bank of Canada has been given a free rein to squeeze inflation out of the system here," said Ernie Stokes, director of Canadian services for the WEFA Group, a research and consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. "The whole direction of policies here is much tougher against inflation."
Mr. Stokes, whose office is in Toronto, and others note that the health of the banking and credit system has not been a factor in the monetary equation here, as in the United States, allowing the Canadian authorities greater freedom to tighten credit.
To some, the Government's high interest-rate policy is a problem because it has raised the Canadian dollar from 70 American cents in the mid-1980's to about 87 cents now. Many economists and exporters say that appreciation is damaging this country's competitiveness. Currency May Decline
With growing expectations that Government inflation targets of 5 percent by the end of this year and 3 percent by the end of 1992 will be met, the Canadian dollar could move lower, some economists say.
Then there is the cloud over Quebec's future. If the French-speaking province makes foreign investors nervous. they might pull their money out of Canada. That could endanger the recovery.
The Mulroney Government expects to introduce new constitutional proposals this fall to try to keep Quebec in the federation while meeting the province's demand for recognition as a "distinct society."
All sides agree it will be a delicate balancing act.

Abstract: The ways of the Fed often appear arcane. But to the economists, bankers and stock and bond traders who track the secretive board's every twist and turn, last July's deliberations provided a glimpse of the ideas and attitudes that are shaping a broad new intellectual consensus about the Fed's goals: making inflation-fighting the top priority. The idea that the Fed could let inflation creep up a little in order to bring down unemployment was a policy staple of the 1960's. The tandem rise of inflation and unemployment in the 1970's killed that thought. "Not only do I think there is no long-term trade-off between inflation and growth, but I think there is no short-term trade-off either," said Mr. [David W. Mullins Jr.]. "If we drove down short-term interest rates aggressively now, we would drive up long-term rates, making the recession longer." A more basic issue concerns how much the Fed should give up its discretion over setting its goals and strategies. Reflecting a consensus in academia, a growing minority within the Fed, including Mr. [W. Lee Hoskins], believes that monetary policy should be conducted as much as possible according to rules. "Rules let the public judge whether the Fed is doing what it says it is. That increases credibility," said Art Rolnick, research director at the Minneapolis Fed.

Full text: Last July, when the Federal Reserve Board's powerful Federal Open Market Committee met to decide the central bank's next move in managing the nation's money supply, a new member, Fed governor David W. Mullins Jr., did not hesitate to speak up.
On the eve of the meeting, which is always conducted in strict secrecy and in as formal a manner as a Japanese Kabuki play, there were signs that the nation's banks were becoming unusually reluctant to make loans to business. The worry was that credit-starved companies would be forced to slash spending, weakening the already-sluggish economy. The F.O.M.C. had to decide whether to nudge interest rates down, a move that would loosen credit and might keep the economy from slowing more. The risk was that easier credit might fan inflation fears and push up long-term interest rates.
Mr. Mullins, by his own account, waded right in. He argued that lowering the Federal funds rate, the rate that banks pay for overnight loans, would not amount to a shift toward easier money. The banks' credit squeeze was having the same effect on the economy as if the Fed were tightening the money supply. To keep money supply growth on its intended course, he maintained, the Fed needed to loosen up a bit. His argument helped persuade the committee. The funds rate was lowered by a quarter of a point.
The ways of the Fed often appear arcane. But to the economists, bankers and stock and bond traders who track the secretive board's every twist and turn, last July's deliberations provided a glimpse of the ideas and attitudes that are shaping a broad new intellectual consensus about the Fed's goals: making inflation-fighting the top priority.
To be sure, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is the dominant figure at the institution. But the Fed is far from the monolith it sometimes appears and Mr. Greenspan, more than most chairmen in the past, encourages other F.O.M.C. members to air their views. Those inside and outside the Fed frequently mention three people on the 19-member committee whose intellectual arguments and pursuasive skills have become key to forging the central bank's philosophical underpinnings -- and broad policy.
Besides Mr. Mullins, a Harvard Business School finance whiz and former Treasury official who has been nominated by the Bush Administration to become the Fed's vice chairman, they are: W. Lee Hoskins, a Milton Friedman disciple who heads the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank and frequently dissents from majority decisions, and Wayne D. Angell, a Fed governor and contrarian who has taken stands that have earned him first the label of a dove, later that of a hawk.
Mr. Mullins, who is 45, and Mr. Hoskins, who is 50, were children in the prosperous, low-inflation Eisenhower era and came of age in the restless 1960's. Mr. Angell, who is 61, was raised in the Depression and Dust Bowl years on a Kansas farm and was a wheat farmer and state legislator. He taught economics at a Baptist college before becoming a central banker.
At the Fed, the new consensus generally favors the kind of steady-as-she-goes, hard-money policies that central bankers pursued back in the Eisenhower and Kennedy years, when inflation rarely crept over 2 percent and home mortgage rates stayed south of 6 percent.
"I don't think there are broad philosophical differences at the Fed," Mr. Mullins said. Debates mostly concern assessments of the economy and how best to implement monetary policy, not goals or the long-run course that has been set.
The new consensus, heavily influenced by recent academic research and modern theories of finance and rational expectations, is a far cry from the one that dominated the 1970's, when the Fed was supposed to smooth out the ups and downs of the American economy, and began to crumble in the 80's. In practical terms, that policy meant slamming on the brakes by raising interest rates when the economy boomed and inflation took off and hitting the monetary accelerator by lowering interest rates when the economy started to slump and unemployment rose.
In the new consensus, inflation is Enemy No. 1. "There is widespread agreement that stable prices are at all times the goal of monetary policy," said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann, a brokerage. Some credit the outspokenness of Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Angell on price stability for the fact that most F.O.M.C. members, including Mr. Mullins, now support legislation mandating that Fed policy pursue near-zero inflation.
The consensus also embraces the idea that "monetary policy should focus on maximizing long-term economic growth," as Mr. Angell puts it. It holds that economic growth comes from an anti-inflation policy.
The Fed's change in thinking is being crafted within the purview of the F.O.M.C., which consists of Mr. Greenspan and the six other Fed governors, plus the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, who share four votes.
Influential members, notably Mr. Mullins, Mr. Angell and Mr. Hoskins, shape the consensus through presentations at the meetings. They give speeches, have their staffs conduct research and write scholarly papers, write papers of their own and circulate comments on colleagues' work. The three are also considered adept at interacting with their colleagues both in the office and socially.
The idea that the Fed could let inflation creep up a little in order to bring down unemployment was a policy staple of the 1960's. The tandem rise of inflation and unemployment in the 1970's killed that thought. "Not only do I think there is no long-term trade-off between inflation and growth, but I think there is no short-term trade-off either," said Mr. Mullins. "If we drove down short-term interest rates aggressively now, we would drive up long-term rates, making the recession longer."
That inflation is ultimately fueled by excessive money growth is a monetarist notion that is now all but gospel within the Fed. Mr. Mullins, Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Angell -- as well as Mr. Greenspan -- all agree that the Fed should gradually lower the growth of M2, the broad measure of the money supply, to roughly the same rate as the growth of the economy's productive capacity.
Matching deeds to words, the Fed has nudged down its targets for money supply growth since the mid-1980's. Actual growth in the past four years has averaged half the pace of the prior four and month-to-month zigs and zags have shrunk sharply. "The focus on M2 targets is indicative of more systematic policies and less fine-tuning than in the past," said John B. Taylor of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.
The big test, of course, is whether inflation and long-term interest rates come down as the recession ends. Fed officials hope that will be the payoff of the past four years' policies. At the moment, long-term interest rates still reflect investors' worries that inflation will stay stuck at around the 4 percent rate of the past few years.
If in the past Fed policy debates could be framed in terms of monetary doves pitting themselves against monetary hawks, in the Greenspan Fed the doves are gone. Now, it's various breeds of anti-inflation hawk.
In one debate, monetarists like Mr. Hoskins argue that monetary policy should not be geared to the dollar's foreign-exchange value. Others, like Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Fed, favor fixed exchange rates, which means coordination of monetary policy with other countries.
A more basic issue concerns how much the Fed should give up its discretion over setting its goals and strategies. Reflecting a consensus in academia, a growing minority within the Fed, including Mr. Hoskins, believes that monetary policy should be conducted as much as possible according to rules. "Rules let the public judge whether the Fed is doing what it says it is. That increases credibility," said Art Rolnick, research director at the Minneapolis Fed.
But there is dissent. Mr. Mullins, for example, does not believe that any simple rule can work for long. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed and as such the most powerful of the regional bank presidents, believes that future crises are unpredictable and that the Fed cannot afford to limit its options.

Abstract: On one side of the tables sat lawmakers terrified that they would be blamed for another Federal bailout. On the other sat the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, [Alan Greenspan], afraid that Congress would hurt the banks more than help them. Mr. Greenspan urged House Banking Committee members on Thursday to limit their plans for higher deposit insurance premiums. The General Accounting Office had warned two days before that bank failures might deplete the Federal insurance fund. Better to cushion losses by having banks bolster their capital than by making them contribute more to the fund, Mr. Greenspan said. Some analysts agree, saying that as much as risky lending and a weak economy have buffeted the banks, they remain far more healthy than the savings and loans. Arthur P. Soter, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said politicians risk compounding the banks' problems: ''You keep raising these insurance payments,'' he said, ''and ultimately you're going to undermine their safety and soundness.'' This time, some economists say, higher oil prices might not ignite rapid inflation. Last week's report that producer prices rose 1.3 percent in August was troubling, but no surprise. Higher energy prices were to blame; without food and energy, wholesale inflation rose just three-tenths of 1 percent. Declines in retail sales and industrial production had some economists wondering whether producers will be able to pass on their higher energy costs. In the 1970's, a roaring economy turned an oil crisis into high, persistent inflation. ''This time, you have a very, very weak level of economic activity,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities. Others fear that several categories of services - health care, education - might keep consumer prices rising even if wholesale prices settle down. As Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, ''The overall inflation picture is not nearly so bright as the core P.P.I. picture alone.'' They might not buy American cars, but American movies are always welcome. The Japanese remain the largest overseas market for United States films. Fashions and fads in Japan tend to absorb everyone or no one, so movies already certified as hits in the United States do best there. Tom Cruise, and Indiana Jones, are national heroes, and the popularity of ''Gone With the Wind'' lingers, with many Japanese products adopting antebellum themes. American film producers say the Japanese market is still young. But they are confident that better promotion and more theaters and screens will attract far more viewers.

THE ECONOMY

Preventing Another Banking Crisis

On one side of the tables sat lawmakers terrified that they would be blamed for another Federal bailout. On the other sat the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, afraid that Congress would hurt the banks more than help them.

THE ECONOMY

Preventing Another Banking Crisis

On one side of the tables sat lawmakers terrified that they would be blamed for another Federal bailout. On the other sat the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, afraid that Congress would hurt the banks more than help them. Mr. Greenspan urged House Banking Committee members on Thursday to limit their plans for higher deposit insurance premiums. The General Accounting Office had warned two days before that bank failures might deplete the Federal insurance fund. Better to cushion losses by having banks bolster their capital than by making them contribute more to the fund, Mr. Greenspan said. Some analysts agree, saying that as much as risky lending and a weak economy have buffeted the banks, they remain far more healthy than the savings and loans. Arthur P. Soter, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said politicians risk compounding the banks' problems: ''You keep raising these insurance payments,'' he said, ''and ultimately you're going to undermine their safety and soundness.''

More Pressure on Oil Prices

Word that the Bush Administration might dip into strategic oil reserves failed to keep prices from rising last week. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said on Thursday that shortages might require the release of some supplies. But on Friday came news that Iraqi troops stormed the French Embassy in Kuwait. Traders who saw an increasing threat of war bid oil up to $31.76 a barrel on Friday, for a gain of $1.72 on the week.

Inflation Protection

This time, some economists say, higher oil prices might not ignite rapid inflation. Last week's report that producer prices rose 1.3 percent in August was troubling, but no surprise. Higher energy prices were to blame; without food and energy, wholesale inflation rose just three-tenths of 1 percent. Declines in retail sales and industrial production had some economists wondering whether producers will be able to pass on their higher energy costs. In the 1970's, a roaring economy turned an oil crisis into high, persistent inflation. ''This time, you have a very, very weak level of economic activity,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities. Others fear that several categories of services - health care, education - might keep consumer prices rising even if wholesale prices settle down. As Lawrence Krohn, an economist at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said, ''The overall inflation picture is not nearly so bright as the core P.P.I. picture alone.''

Philadelphia Finances

A statue of Benjamin Franklin still looks out on Philadelphia from a perch on City Hall, but his city has cast aside his thrifty ways. After running deficits since 1988, the city failed last week to arrange $375 million in temporary financing to stave off default. As city and state politicians feud, Philadelphia faces drastic cuts in most services, and insolvency by the end of the year.

In Brief

The New York Stock Exchange approved limited after-hours trading for the first time in its history, initiating a program intended to establish 24-hour activity by the year 2000.

The Senate plans to vote next week on a bill to require that auto makers achieve an average efficiency of 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001. The Administration says the bill would force the auto makers to sell smaller, less safe cars. But many lawmakers say the fuel savings are essential.

COMPANIES

Re-regulating Cable Television

The House of Representatives voted unanimously last week to restore some regulation and competition to cable television. During the Reagan era, viewers complained that cable companies rapidly raised their charges, exploiting their local monopolies and exclusive rights to popular programs. The legislation gives the Federal Communications Commission power to roll back rates, and bans programming contracts that prevent competition. Advisers to President Bush have threatened a veto.

S.& L. Deal Doesn't Pass Muster

Federal regulators blocked the $3 billion sale of the Columbia Savings and Loan Association's ''junk bond'' portfolio to a Canadian investment partnership that planned to have Columbia lend 90 percent of the price. The Office of Thrift Supervision said Columbia could get a better, preferably all-cash, deal.

In Brief

ARCO agreed to pay $287 million last week to settle a 13-year lawsuit over royalties on North Slope oil owned by the state of Alaska. Other oil companies face a trial next year.

New York City Council President Andrew Stein has proclaimed Sept. 26 Accountant Appreciation Day. ''New York City is composed of caring, giving people,'' he said, with accountants among them.

INTERNATIONAL

Yeltsin Seizes the Lead

He was at the vanguard of reform; now he is at the rear. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's endorsement on Tuesday of a plan for free markets in 500 days came so grudgingly and late that he can claim little credit or capacity to lead. He was pulled both ways. His own economic adviser, Stanislav S. Shatalin, led the group that drew up the plan. But Mr. Gorbachev's Prime Minister proposed a more cautious course, limiting private ownership and maintaining state control of prices. The same day that Mr. Gorbachev sided with Mr. Shatalin, Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Republic, regained the initiative by rushing the program through his Parliament. The vote: 251 to 1. ''Yeltsin just forced the issue,'' said Joe Tragert, an economist at the Planecon consulting firm. And Mr. Gorbachev has little choice but to go along.

Cigarette Shortage

With cigarette shortages provoking riots and demonstrations, the Soviets are sending in RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris. The companies agreed on Thursday to ship 34 billion cigarettes, which represents more than a month's supply. The need is so urgent that both producers might transport some loads by air freight. Marlboro cigarettes, from Philip Morris, are virtually legal tender in the Soviet Union; just ask any cabby whether he wants American cigarettes or rubles.

The Soviet Share of the Pie

It took truckers from Finland, wine from Hungary and a contractor from London to bring American pizza to Moscow. Pizza Hut, a unit of Pepsico Inc., opened its first two restaurants in the Soviet Union on Tuesday with an investment of $10 million. The chain's executives say they actually receive 60 percent of their food and service supplies from Soviet sources. They also say they will be able to use this approach across the Soviet Union. The McDonald's Corporation spent more than $50 million to arrange the production of its own beef patties, milk and buns.

Building Trade Ties With Mexico

As economic alliances coalesce in Europe and Asia, President Bush is rushing to cement a regional trade agreement of his own. And what better time than an energy crisis to snuggle up to Mexico, which sells about 30 percent of its oil to the United States? Administration officials said last week that the President will ask Congress to let him negotiate a broad free-trade agreement with Mexico, like the one between the United States and Canada. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has already cut some tariffs from 100 percent to 10 percent - effectively reversing his country's historic opposition to free trade. The Mexicans have pledged to produce more oil, and American companies expect to sell them more oil equipment.

Japanese Film Deficit

They might not buy American cars, but American movies are always welcome. The Japanese remain the largest overseas market for United States films. Fashions and fads in Japan tend to absorb everyone or no one, so movies already certified as hits in the United States do best there. Tom Cruise, and Indiana Jones, are national heroes, and the popularity of ''Gone With the Wind'' lingers, with many Japanese products adopting antebellum themes. American film producers say the Japanese market is still young. But they are confident that better promotion and more theaters and screens will attract far more viewers. Kyoko Hirano, director of the Japan Society film series in New York, says Japanese films in the United States have a much more limited audience: ''The Japanese import 100 Hollywood films and the Americans import just one.''

A report on the Business Diary page last Sunday about Philadelphia's finances misidentified the statue on top of City Hall. It is of William Penn, the city's founder, not of Benjamin Franklin.

Abstract: This view of a weakening dollar gives investors a fairly attractive opportunity. Some analysts now expect the Tokyo stock market, as measured by the Nikkei 225 Index, to rally to between 35,000 and 40,000 by the end of the year, a remarkable rebound from the 30 percent decline in the first months of this year. At 40,000, the Nikkei would be at an all-time high. Those who feel the United States economy is slowing while West Germany's and Japan's continue to grow expect the dollar to fall some against marks, yen and other currencies. With moderating growth in Japan and low inflation, and with stronger growth in West Germany, these economies are more attractive than a slowing United States with inflation stubbornly holding around 5 percent.

While the dollar has been relatively tame this year, it has still raised the returns of some Americans who invested away from Wall Street.
And if forecasters who think the dollar will decline later this year are right, this could be a good time to invest in stock markets abroad - in Britain, West Germany and Japan - that look as though they have a chance to rally in the second half of the year. A weaker dollar later this year would give investors more for their money when stronger pounds, yen, marks or other foreign currencies are turned back into dollars.
In the first half of 1990, this exchange-rate gain - because of a weakening dollar - has accounted for most or all of the profits from several European stock markets and has mitigated the losses in others.
A 9.5 percent rise in the Swiss franc against the dollar accounted for most of the 11.9 percent gain in dollar terms from the Swiss stock market through last week, according to the Financial Times World Indicies. The market is up only 2.2 percent this year. This is the first time in two years that Americans investing in Switzerland have received foreign-exchange gains. In 1988, a 10 percent gain in the market was turned into a 7 percent loss because of a rise in the dollar. Last year, a much smaller rise in the dollar chipped a 23.7 percent gain in the stock market down to 21.4 percent. The investor in Britain also has been helped this year by the recent weakening of the dollar against the pound. Through last week, the London market was down 2 percent for the year. But with a 7.5 percent gain against the dollar, the dollar investor has more than a 5 percent gain. In Spain, a 4 percent fall in the market is cut to 1 percent when the stronger peseta is turned into dollars.
In the case of Japan, the reverse has occurred. A stronger dollar has made the sharp losses in Tokyo even more painful because the yen now buys fewer dollars. The Tokyo market, measured by the Financial Times index, fell 21 percent through last week, but the foreign-exchange factor increased this loss to 26.5 percent in dollars.
Unfortunately, forecasters are divided on what direction the dollar will take the rest of this year. But it looks as though the variables favor a weaker dollar, although there is no expectation of a collapse.
Those who feel the United States economy is slowing while West Germany's and Japan's continue to grow expect the dollar to fall some against marks, yen and other currencies. With moderating growth in Japan and low inflation, and with stronger growth in West Germany, these economies are more attractive than a slowing United States with inflation stubbornly holding around 5 percent.
If the Federal Reserve Board decides in the next few months to lower interest rates because the economy is growing too slowly, the dollar's decline could quicken. Analysts already expect the West German Bundesbank to raise interest rates later this year to curb any inflationary spurt from the economic union of the two Germanys. This would make the mark more attractive to investors.
The dollar, which now commands 1.6745 marks, could drop to 1.50. Now worth 154.85 yen, it could fall into the 140's by some estimates. The pound, although it is at $1.7335 and its high for the year, could move even higher if the euphoria over a British move to join the European Monetary System continues.
This view of a weakening dollar gives investors a fairly attractive opportunity. Some analysts now expect the Tokyo stock market, as measured by the Nikkei 225 Index, to rally to between 35,000 and 40,000 by the end of the year, a remarkable rebound from the 30 percent decline in the first months of this year. At 40,000, the Nikkei would be at an all-time high.
The market in Germany, which has fallen about 10 percent since reaching a record high at the end of March, does have the potential to recoup or even move higher if the jitters about monetary union subside after the two German economies are unified in July. This major European market has offered the smallest boost from foreign-exchange rates so far this year.

U.S. FACES STRAINS FROM GLOBAL JUMP IN INTEREST RATES

Abstract: ''It makes people nervous,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, a research organization. ''There had been an expectation that interest rates would continue to slide down, and suddenly people have woken up to the idea that maybe they won't.'' Some American economists argue that the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan are overreacting. They contend that inflation is not all that big a problem and they predict that the two central banks will back down soon on interest rates, which are now unusually close to American rates. (Yields on 10-year government notes range from 8.3 percent in the United States to 6.3 percent in Japan.) ''Our current view is that Japan has a case of inflation jitters,'' said Nicholas Sargen, the chief of bond research at Salomon Brothers. ''We can't identify what has changed so much in Japan in recent weeks to trigger such a jump in rates.'' Some policy makers at the Federal Reserve show signs of concern that the economy might be rebounding. Two of the central bank's governors, Manuel Johnson and Wayne Angell, have said they see little likelihood of a recession ahead. And Robert L. Parry, president of the Frederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said yesterday that the West Germans and Japanese are only partly responsible for the rise in long-term American rates. ''It seems to me that a prime additional suspect putting pressure on rates is heightened inflationary concerns in the United States,'' he said.

Full text: LEAD: Interest rates in Japan and West Germany are suddenly surging, in the process dragging up American rates at what most economists say is just the wrong moment for the nation's fragile economy.
Interest rates in Japan and West Germany are suddenly surging, in the process dragging up American rates at what most economists say is just the wrong moment for the nation's fragile economy.
Rarely has the global economy forced itself so vividly on the United States. West Germany and Japan, currently the engines propelling the world's economic growth, are trying to curb inflation. But their chief tool, higher long-term interest rates, is spilling over into the weak American economy and that could be a hammer blow, further slowing growth.
''This is a terribly inconvenient time to have rates pulled up,'' said Lawrence Veit, an economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Free Flow of Money

Experts say the huge Federal deficit has left the American economy hostage to a continual flow of investment funds from abroad.
In today's international economy, with so few legal or practical obstacles to the flow of money across national boundaries, borrowers in this country must match the higher interest rates being offered abroad. Otherwise, savers throughout the world will pursue higher returns by buying the bonds issued in Japan and West Germany.
Although the market's spontaneous forces, not the Federal Reserve, have pushed up long-term rates, the central bank is nevertheless on the spot. The Federal Reserve could stand pat, allowing the market flows to take their course. But the higher interest rates could well nudge the vulnerable American economy into recession.
Higher interest rates have spread throughout the money markets. In the United States, mortgage rates have rebounded in the last month, just when the housing industry is weak. Many corporations, already heavily in debt, are facing higher monthly payments, which would further cut into their profits. Car loans might be pushed up as the higher rates force a General Motors or a Beneficial Finance to pay more for the money they lend to consumers.
'It Makes People Nervous'

As in any market, expectations are often self-fulfilling. Lenders who expect interest rates to rise will demand a higher rate before committing funds.
''It makes people nervous,'' said Nigel Gault, senior economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill, a research organization. ''There had been an expectation that interest rates would continue to slide down, and suddenly people have woken up to the idea that maybe they won't.''
A month ago, with the rate on 30-year Treasury bonds at 7.84 percent, no mainstream American economist was predicting its rise to 8.4 percent or forecasting that 30-year mortgage rates would be back to 10 percent after being closer to 9 percent in December. But the steps taken by West Germany and Japan made that chain of events inevitable, economists now say.
This is the first time in more than a decade that American economic growth is significantly less vigorous than in West Germany and Japan. With the robust growth, prices in Germany and Japan have climbed at rates deemed alarming in those inflation-resistant nations.
The West German inflation rate almost tripled last year, to 3 percent, and the prospect for 1990 is for more strong demand. Eastern Europeans are pouring into West Germany at the rate of 2,000 a day, adding to the national demand for goods.
Boom Times in West Germany

What is more, a capital spending boom in Europe has drawn heavily on German products, and the country's exports are up strongly. And now the metal workers union, seeking a greater share of the profits, is demanding what amounts to a 15 percent wage increase. The union represents more than 10 percent of the nation's organized labor.
In such a situation, the Bundesbank pushed up interest rates, the classic central bank strategy for curbing an expansion that threatens to increase inflation. The higher rates are intended to raise the cost of the loans that finance spending by consumers and businesses.
Similarly, the inflation rate in Japan more than doubled last year, to 2.5 percent, and workers are seeking a 6 percent wage increase in nationwide negotiations now under way. Rising land prices also were a problem, and, inexplicably, the yen weakened a bit against the dollar, perhaps because of the uncertain outcome of the national election next month. In this situation, the Bank of Japan on Dec. 25 raised its key discount rate by half a percentage point. The move helped to push up 10-year notes to more than 6.3 percent, from 5.5 percent.
Some American economists argue that the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan are overreacting. They contend that inflation is not all that big a problem and they predict that the two central banks will back down soon on interest rates, which are now unusually close to American rates. (Yields on 10-year government notes range from 8.3 percent in the United States to 6.3 percent in Japan.) ''Our current view is that Japan has a case of inflation jitters,'' said Nicholas Sargen, the chief of bond research at Salomon Brothers. ''We can't identify what has changed so much in Japan in recent weeks to trigger such a jump in rates.''
A Different Viewpoint

A few economists in this country hold that the rising rates abroad are fortuitous, coming at a time when inflation again threatens the American economy.
These economists argue that recent data - particularly an upturn in industrial production and in the Producer Price Index, an important inflation measure - indicate that the long slowdown in American economic growth ended late last year. As a result, they say, the annual inflation rate, which declined from about 5.5 percent in early 1989 to 4.5 percent by year-end, will be on the rise again by springtime. So, in their view, the higher long-term interest rates forced on the nation by the West Germans and the Japanese will help to arrest the inflation.
Some policy makers at the Federal Reserve show signs of concern that the economy might be rebounding. Two of the central bank's governors, Manuel Johnson and Wayne Angell, have said they see little likelihood of a recession ahead. And Robert L. Parry, president of the Frederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said yesterday that the West Germans and Japanese are only partly responsible for the rise in long-term American rates. ''It seems to me that a prime additional suspect putting pressure on rates is heightened inflationary concerns in the United States,'' he said.
Awaiting the G.N.P. Report

But it remains uncertain whether the economy is getting a second wind. Government data measuring developments in recent weeks are still too sparse to tell. The first major assessment will come on Friday, when the Commerce Department releases its initial estimate of what happened to the gross national product in the fourth quarter.
Most economists guess that the G.N.P., which measures the total value of the nation's goods and services, grew by less than 1 percent from September through December. Growth of 1 percent or more would feed the economic-rebound viewpoint while a growth rate of less than five-tenths of one percent would be viewed as evidence that the economy remains very weak.
Whatever the state of the economy, the mechanism through which rising interest rates abroad affect American rates is causing a problem of its own: the increased competition for funds. The United States Treasury in recent years has counted on Japanese buyers to purchase roughly one-third of the long-term securities that the Government issues periodically to finance its budget deficit.
The next major auction of these securities is scheduled for early February, and the question is whether American rates will be high enough to attract not only Japanese investors, but Americans as well. Their alternative is to purchase Japanese or European securities. Salomon, in fact, recommended to clients this week that they consider this possibility.
Looking Abroad to Invest

''For the first time in two years, we have told customers that the Japanese bond market may be attractive to U.S. investors,'' Mr. Sargen said. If they agree, then rates on the securities auctioned in early February will have to rise above their current levels to draw investors.
But more than just rates influence investors' decisions. Foreign investors might not purchase Treasuries, for example, if they believe that the dollar will decline in value after they make the purchases. Currently, the dollar is just beginning to fall against the yen and has been losing ground since last fall against the mark. On the other hand, the Japanese might invest here for political reasons, because their Government encourages them to do so.
Right now, neither Japanese nor American nor German investors are buying many bonds, as the selloffs in all three marketplaces in recent days indicate. Most investors are holding their funds in cash, waiting to see what will happen, Mr. Sargen said.

Abstract: ''It's very important for the world economy and the United States that Europe in conjunction with Japan should exhibit stronger economic growth,'' said George A. Magnus, chief international economist at Warburg Securities in London. ''To a degree, Europe is fulfilling a locomotive role as the U.S. economy slows down.'' ''There's a lot of dynamism in Europe,'' said Norbert A. Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest bank. ''Nineteen ninety-two and the Eastern Europe reforms have created the perception around the globe that Europe is on the move, that there is a renaissance in Europe.'' Heavy investment from companies based outside the community is one big reason this growth is so strong. ''Enticed by both the opportunities and the fears that outsiders may be prevented from exploiting them, companies from outside the European Community - especially the Japanese, the Swedes, the Finns and the Australians - are continuing to pour money into the community,'' said Martin Waldenstrom, president of Booz Allen Acquisition Services, a unit of Booz Allen & Hamilton, the consulting firm.

The benefits already flowing from the European Community's continuing effort to create a single market by 1992 and the changes in Eastern Europe are prompting economists to predict that Western Europe's economic growth will exceed that of the United States in the 1990's.
For much of the 1980's, the fast-growing American economy was the envy of Western Europeans, who seemed to think that the high unemployment and sluggish growth plaguing most of their nations were insurmountable problems.
No longer. Last year, the economy of all Western European nations outpaced that of the United States. It grew 3.5 percent, while the United States economy grew about 3 percent.
Economists expect growth in Western Europe to continue to outpace that in the United States for at least two years and possibly much longer. While annual growth in the United States is widely expected to average 2.5 percent in the 1990's, many economists expect Western Europe to grow by 3 to 3.5 percent a year.
'A Locomotive Role'

''It's very important for the world economy and the United States that Europe in conjunction with Japan should exhibit stronger economic growth,'' said George A. Magnus, chief international economist at Warburg Securities in London. ''To a degree, Europe is fulfilling a locomotive role as the U.S. economy slows down.''
With the 12 nations of the European Community moving ahead with their program to create a barrier-free common market by 1992 and with Eastern Europe moving toward democracy and market-based economies, there is a palpable excitement in Europe - a feeling that the Age of Europe may be dawning.
''There's a lot of dynamism in Europe,'' said Norbert A. Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest bank. ''Nineteen ninety-two and the Eastern Europe reforms have created the perception around the globe that Europe is on the move, that there is a renaissance in Europe.''
For a couple of years there have been signs that optimism is replacing the pessimism that had long gripped Europe. But with unemployment in Europe remaining high and inflation inching upward, many economists still feared that the expansion would lose steam.
About the only major nation where that has happened is Britain, whose Government's use of high interest rates to combat an inflation rate of 7.7 percent has brought growth nearly to a standstill.
With West Germany and other major European countries maintaining a relatively tight monetary policy, most economists are now cautiously optimistic that inflation, which hit a plateau in the second half of last year, will remain under control. Annual inflation in the European Community could average 4 percent between 1990 and 1995, down from 5.4 percent last year, said Paul Cockle, chief European economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the economic consulting firm.
Reflecting the cheerful new outlook, economists have managed to find a virtue in Western Europe's high unemployment rate, which has been falling only slowly. The rate -now about 9 percent - means Western Europe does not face the kinds of limits on growth confronting the United States, where unemployment is 5.3 percent, they say.
In a turnaround from just a year ago, some economists say it is possible that unemployment could fall to 6 or 7 percent by the mid-1990's. But any sizable reduction will require sustained economic growth of 3 to 4 percent, they say.
Boom in Capital Spending

One big reason for the current optimism is the capital-spending boom that has been under way in the European Community for several years. ''By helping to make sure that demand does not outstrip supply, the buoyant investment is an important factor in a continued noninflationary expansion,'' said David A. Currie, an economist at the London Business School.
While the spending boom has been slowing, it shows no signs of petering out. ''We had expected a greater moderation than there has been,'' Mr. Cockle said.
This spending, economists say, is being fueled by a combination of excitement and fear that the 1992 program has created.
Some companies are spending heavily to exploit the opportunities for expansion that they think the single market will offer them. Others are doing so to defend themselves against the increased competition they expect.
Investment in machinery and equipment has been growing at 9 percent annually in West Germany, even more in France and more than 20 percent in Spain and Portugal, Dr. Walter of Deutsche Bank noted.
Money From Outside

Heavy investment from companies based outside the community is one big reason this growth is so strong. ''Enticed by both the opportunities and the fears that outsiders may be prevented from exploiting them, companies from outside the European Community - especially the Japanese, the Swedes, the Finns and the Australians - are continuing to pour money into the community,'' said Martin Waldenstrom, president of Booz Allen Acquisition Services, a unit of Booz Allen & Hamilton, the consulting firm.
Mr. Waldenstrom, who recently completed a study for the European Community, said American direct investment in the community, which soared in the mid-1980's, has declined since its peak in 1987.
The European Commission, the community's executive branch, estimated earlier that the 1992 program could add as much as one percentage point to the community's medium-term economic growth.
The surprise is that the rise has come so soon. Given the heavy capital spending, some economists now say that 1992 has already added a total of two to three percentage points over the last three years to the European Community's economic growth and that the total extra growth from the 1992 program could exceed the commission's prediction.
'Clear Change' in Behavior

''There has been a clear change in European economic behavior,'' Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said of the new optimism.
While it may be too early to pronounce Communism dead in Eastern Europe, the widespread hope is that the leadership role that Western Europe would play in rebuilding Eastern Europe will take up where 1992 leaves off in keeping Western Europe's expansion rolling along.
West Germany, already the economic locomotive of Western Europe (its gross national product represents 25 percent of the European Community's), is expected to reap the greatest benefit from any rebuilding of Eastern Europe. Mr. Walter predicted that the portion of West Germany's exports going to Eastern European countries could soar to 15 percent of its total within 10 years, from 5 percent now.
While such forecasts may be too optimistic, the flood of immigrants from the East is already giving a boost to West Germany's economy. The influx of 1.3 million ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the last three years is adding one-quarter to three-quarters of a percentage point to West Germany's gross national product, economists figure.
Help for Labor Shortage

Most of the immigrants are younger people who are in their prime spending years and who can help alleviate the shortage of skilled workers in West German industry. In addition, it is already clear that the immigration will force the Government to increase social spending to house the new arrivals.
To keep West Germany's inflation, now about 3 percent, under control, the Bundesbank, the country's central bank, is expected to continue to pursue its tight monetary policy. But economists do not expect it to slow the economy much. They note that besides the stimulus from the immigration, a sizable tax cut went into effect on Jan. 1.
With many economists expecting this tight monetary policy and looser fiscal policy to continue well into the 1990's, the result could be a higher value for the West German mark and an increase in imports that would stimulate the economies of West Germany's trading partners.
''What the capitalist economies could never persuade the West Germans to do, the demise of Communism is achieving - a more expansive policy,'' said Mr. Lawrence of Brookings. Implications for the U.S. What does all this mean for the United States?
Exports to Western Europe will undoubtedly continue to rise. A surge in such exports - to an estimated $100 billion last year from $61.6 billion in 1986 - has largely eliminated America's trade deficit with Western Europe.
Most economists note that this amount of exports is still tiny compared with the size of the $5 trillion American economy, and will not spell the difference between growth and recession.
The growing attractiveness of Europe - both East and West - as a place to invest could pose some threats to the United States. For one thing, the United States may find it increasingly difficult to attract the foreign capital it needs to finance its big trade and budget deficits.
'Pressure on the Dollar'

As a result, ''it may end up putting a lot of downward pressure on the dollar,'' said Charles R. Bean, an economist at the London School of Economics. That, he said, could translate into higher inflation and a drop in the standard of living for Americans.
If disarmament continues, reducing the importance of United States military power, American influence in the world could continue to slip because of its weakening economic muscle. The back seat America seems to be taking in the West's response to the events in Eastern Europe reflects this decline, political analysts and economists say.

Abstract: Those economists who have been warning for years that the United States is bound to suffer a ''hard landing'' actually demonstrate how resilient the American economy is. In saying just that, Lawrence Summers of Harvard, who was Michael S. Dukakis's chief economic adviser in the 1988 campaign, warns that the wolf could still come. Writing in The Financial Times this week, Professor Summers said: ''In the end, the wolf ate the boy. It would be a mistake to bet too strongly on the American economy in general or the dollar in particular over the next few years.'' This is not a partisan position. Speaking at a news conference in Atlanta last week, Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, foresaw moderate growth in 1990 but warned that the United States faces the danger ''not of a heart attack, but cancer'' - a gradual wearing away of its economic strength from inadequate savings and continuous dependence on foreign savings to finance domestic budget deficits, trade deficits and private investment. Deregulation, according to this analysis, has enhanced United States growth prospects, ''even though it has not repealed the business cycle.'' Financial market liberalization acts as a ''shock absorber'' for the real economy, with price substituting for quantity in rationing credits. And deregulation means greater labor and capital mobility, attracting resources from weak sectors or regions to strong or growing sectors.

Most economists foresee no recession in 1990 or 1991, and 1992 will be another Presidential election year, when the odds tip strongly against recession. Japan, West Germany and most of the other capitalist countries of Europe and Asia are also on a long upward roll, with no end in sight.
IS the business cycle dead? The United States economy has now completed seven straight years of expansion, the longest in its peacetime history. Most economists foresee no recession in 1990 or 1991, and 1992 will be another Presidential election year, when the odds tip strongly against recession. Japan, West Germany and most of the other capitalist countries of Europe and Asia are also on a long upward roll, with no end in sight. It is time to consider whether the capitalist system has experienced a fundamental change in its stability, as important in its own way as the decay of the Communist system.
To be sure, plenty of people worry that the long spell of stable growth may still end with a bang, conceivably this year. Ravi Batra's latest best seller is called ''Surviving the Great Depression of 1990.'' But the crash of October 1987, and the market plunge of Friday, Oct. 13, 1989, have come and gone without stopping the expansion of the real economy.
Those economists who have been warning for years that the United States is bound to suffer a ''hard landing'' actually demonstrate how resilient the American economy is. In saying just that, Lawrence Summers of Harvard, who was Michael S. Dukakis's chief economic adviser in the 1988 campaign, warns that the wolf could still come. Writing in The Financial Times this week, Professor Summers said: ''In the end, the wolf ate the boy. It would be a mistake to bet too strongly on the American economy in general or the dollar in particular over the next few years.''
This is not a partisan position. Speaking at a news conference in Atlanta last week, Michael J. Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser, foresaw moderate growth in 1990 but warned that the United States faces the danger ''not of a heart attack, but cancer'' - a gradual wearing away of its economic strength from inadequate savings and continuous dependence on foreign savings to finance domestic budget deficits, trade deficits and private investment.
Nevertheless, why has the danger of an economic ''heart attack'' ebbed? And why have those economists who expected a collapse of the real economy erred, year after year, despite the instability of financial markets and the dollar?
One source of error, common since the development of national income accounts and the heavy focus on the national economy, has been to see the United States economy as ''closed.'' In this view, the principal determinants of national income are domestic consumption, private domestic investment and government spending - with net exports a small tail incapable of wagging a very big dog.
In the postwar years the United States has increasingly become an ''open economy,'' as international flows of goods and services - and, far more important, capital - have grown to shape the national economy, thus far toward greater real stability.
The shortage of private domestic savings, aggravated by the Federal budget deficit, has been covered by capital inflow from abroad, thereby sustaining business investment and keeping the American economy growing. Of course, this has meant the transfer of United States assets to foreign hands. That disturbs many nationalists, but the immediate consequences for American growth in output, income and employment have been positive. Cutting off that foreign capital inflow now would drive United States interest rates through the roof.
A team of economists at Salomon Brothers, headed by David G. Shulman, contends that the liberalization of financial markets has, paradoxically, increased the volatility of securities and currency markets but has improved the stability of the real economy. The Salomon team concludes that this trend will continue and that the economic climate in the coming decade will still favor financial assets over real assets or cash.
Deregulation, according to this analysis, has enhanced United States growth prospects, ''even though it has not repealed the business cycle.'' Financial market liberalization acts as a ''shock absorber'' for the real economy, with price substituting for quantity in rationing credits. And deregulation means greater labor and capital mobility, attracting resources from weak sectors or regions to strong or growing sectors.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve holds to a cautious policy, accepting modest growth in exchange for lower inflation. The Salomon economists predict that disinflation will pave the way for lower interest rates, aided by lower Federal deficits resulting from the scaling back of military spending.
Similarly, Thomas W. Synnott 3d of U.S. Trust predicts that with a smaller Federal deficit relative to G.N.P. and lower inflation, long-term real interest rates on Treasury securities ''could easily move down from the current 3 1/2 to 4 percent range to 1 1/2 to 2 percent, their historic norm.''
Such a cut in the cost of capital would spur the industrial and public investment so urgently needed to enhance United States international competitiveness - a major goal for the 1990's.

Full text: LEAD: In two and a half months in the presidency, Carlos Saul Menem has woven a kind of magic over the Argentines.
In two and a half months in the presidency, Carlos Saul Menem has woven a kind of magic over the Argentines.
He has played soccer in a packed stadium alongside one of the world's greatest players, Diego Maradona. He has kept up his end of a basketball game with men half his age and two feet taller. He has elegantly danced the tango and the zamba, the folk dance of the Argentine gauchos, or cowboys, on prime-time television.
In his 20-hour days, he has also tamed Argentina's soaring inflation, refilled the Central Bank with dollars and forged an alliance with private enterprise and capitalism that would have troubled the founder of his political party, Juan D. Peron.
Now he hopes to weave some of that magic abroad as he sets out Saturday night for the United States on a mission to convince foreign officials, bankers and investors that Argentina is a serious country and has stopped living, in his words, ''from party to party.''
Mr. Menem said in an interview that on this trip he wants to transmit ''live and direct'' the news that Argentina's finances are improving dramatically, that he is pushing ahead with efforts to sell off or dismantle Government-owned companies and that the doors are open to foreign investors. Inflation Down Sharply
''Fundamentally, what we want to accomplish is a more fluid insertion of Argentina in the international field,'' he said. ''It is well known that we are coming out of a very conflictive situation, with the image of a decadent Argentina, I would say, a chaotic Argentina without future.''
In July, the month in which Mr. Menem succeeded Raul Alfonsin in the presidency, Argentine inflation almost hit 200 percent, just for the month. On an annualized basis, that was equal to any known world record.
The soaring inflation, attributed to huge deficits by state companies and tax evasion in the last months of the Alfonsin presidency, was accompanied by a drop in the foreign reserves to less than $100 million, next to nothing for a country of 32 million people.
Mr. Menem, bringing respected businessmen and free-market economists into his Government, reduced inflation to 38 percent in August through negotiated wage and price accords. It is expected to fall to 7 or 8 percent this month. Reserves have recovered to almost $2 billion, Mr. Menem said today.
But important tests lie ahead in terms of how quickly the Government can move with plans to turn over state companies to private ownership or management and whether it can come out of the unofficial wage and price controls without new inflation or a recession.
The one-week visit, which is to include a meeting with President Bush in Washington on Wednesday, a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, and meetings with several European foreign ministers in New York, will be the first ever made to the United States by a sitting President from the Justicialist Party, better known as Peronism. Lifting the Shadows
Mr. Menem, who was in the United States several times before he was elected President, said this visit ''will end an old and stupid legend'' about the supposed anti-Americanism of Peronism and ''lift all shadows from relations between the United States and Argentina.''
General Peron, after first coming to power in 1946, created a kind of populist socialism in Argentina, under which the state became the primary motor of the economy and created a vast network of programs and services for the working class that went further than most social welfare systems, including things like direct gifts to children and vacation hotels for laborers and their families.
Mr. Menem, whose partnership with capitalism has pleased many of those who did not vote for him and dismayed many of those who did, denies he is rejecting Peronism's traditional identification with social justice. He now talks of a ''popular free market economy'' as his goal. He says that means ''private enterprise and free trade, with social justice incorporated.''

As the pomp and ceremony of the presidential inauguration continued into its second day, the Government of President Carlos Saul Menem today announced a plan to attack Argentina's hyperinflation and begin economic recovery.The new Government halved the value of the country's currency against the United States dollar and decreed sharp increases in charges for public services to halt runaway inflation, Economy Minister Miguel Roig announced in a television address.
With factories closing, foreign reserves almost gone and merchants raising prices 100 percent at a time, Mr. Menem said this was the worst crisis Argentina had ever known and warned that even tougher times lay ahead. In May, after the elections, 15 people died in riots and looting touched off by rising prices.
In his inaugural speech Saturday, Mr. Menem indicated that his Peronist Party was even willing to abandon its tradition of heavy state influence in the economy in hopes of rebuilding it. The official inflation figure was 114.5 percent for the month of June alone. #90-Day Price Freeze Aides to Mr. Roig, a retired business executive, said measures to take effect this week would be limited to trying to slow inflation, ease its effect on wage earners and resume tax collections.
Such questions as management of the $60-billion foreign debt and a promised structural overhaul of deficit-ridden state companies would be left for later, the aides said.
A key part of the package of measures is the freezing of prices for 90 days, a decision that caused dissension within the new Government and produced the withdrawal of Mr. Menem's first appointee for Secretary of Commerce before he could be sworn in. Price controls have a long history of failure in Argentina.
Alberto Albamonte of the Union of the Democratic Center, a party identified with free-market economics, had accepted the Commerce post only to renounce it Friday after losing his argument against price controls.
As details of this debate leaked out last week, merchants began doubling and tripling prices. A merchants group said the cost of bread rose 263 percent. Doubling of Exchange Rate
The foreign exchange rate was set at 650 australs to the dollar, more than double the current official rate and slightly ahead of the black market rate. With this the Government hopes to channel more hard currency into the Central Bank and convince some leading exporters to liquidate crops that they have been holding off the international market because of the gap between the official and black-market exchange rates. The Government hopes to begin to replenish public coffers quickly because of taxes on exports.
The Government was also expected to order that all workers be given a one-time payment of the equivalent of $14 to $20 to help ease the pain of inflation. State workers will also receive increases in wages slightly exceeding the June inflation figure.
Increases of 650 percent were also announced in the prices of gas and electricity.

Abstract: Why did the January numbers deal such a sharp blow to the markets? There had been general anticipation that the inflation rate would tick upward this year. ''The only thing new,'' as George Perry of the Brookings Institution said yesterday, ''is that the news is actually happening.'' To be sure, the January report was a bit worse than anticipated. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, called the rise ''disturbing'' and said it was ''a shade worse'' than he had expected. Particularly disturbing was the related report that weekly earnings jumped by six-tenths of 1 percent in January, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors. Without adjustment for inflation, weekly earnings leaped 1.2 percent in January, which translates into an annual rate of 14.4 percent. Instead, Mr. Greenspan has been inching toward tightness while trying, in his deliberately vague, nonconfrontational style, to coax both the Administration and Congress to take stronger action on the budget deficit. This is a tough, maybe hopeless, job, particularly as Mr. [Bush] has stuck to his campaign promises of ''no new taxes,'' a ''strong'' military program and some ''kinder, gentler'' social programs, while putting the overall budget into a ''flexible freeze'' with no increases in Government expenditures above the assumed rate of inflation.

WITH the six-tenths of 1 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index for January, 7.2 percent at an annual rate, the moment of truth on budgetary policy is fast approaching for the Administration. And the markets clearly sense that the test is coming.
Why did the January numbers deal such a sharp blow to the markets? There had been general anticipation that the inflation rate would tick upward this year. ''The only thing new,'' as George Perry of the Brookings Institution said yesterday, ''is that the news is actually happening.''
To be sure, the January report was a bit worse than anticipated. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, called the rise ''disturbing'' and said it was ''a shade worse'' than he had expected. Particularly disturbing was the related report that weekly earnings jumped by six-tenths of 1 percent in January, after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors. Without adjustment for inflation, weekly earnings leaped 1.2 percent in January, which translates into an annual rate of 14.4 percent.
That seems highly improbable. Nevertheless, that 1.2 percent jump was due to a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in both hourly pay and weekly work hours, and the tightness of the labor force would keep the heat under wages and prices if the recent pace of economic expansion continues.
What the markets most fear is a clash between the Administration's budget policy, built on the belief that strong economic growth can and must be sustained, and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, aimed at preventing inflation.
Mr. Bush has been seeking to play down any conflict between himself and Mr. Greenspan, saying there is nothing the press loves to cook up more than than a fight between the White House and the Fed. The President maintains that any differences with Mr. Greenspan are slight. For his part, the Fed chairman is certainly not spoiling for a fight. In Congressional testimony this week, Mr. Greenspan was at pains to avoid a conflict with the Administration, to praise it wherever he could but not to deny that the Fed was likely to nudge interest rates higher.
Mr. Greenspan would like to avoid a clash between fiscal and monetary policy, if it is avoidable; he has no desire to thrust the economy into recession as a cure for existing or anticipated inflation. Unlike his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, who had to stop a raging inflation in its tracks, Mr. Greenspan has no ''mandate'' to attack.
Instead, Mr. Greenspan has been inching toward tightness while trying, in his deliberately vague, nonconfrontational style, to coax both the Administration and Congress to take stronger action on the budget deficit. This is a tough, maybe hopeless, job, particularly as Mr. Bush has stuck to his campaign promises of ''no new taxes,'' a ''strong'' military program and some ''kinder, gentler'' social programs, while putting the overall budget into a ''flexible freeze'' with no increases in Government expenditures above the assumed rate of inflation.
That rate was assumed in the Reagan budget and Bush revisions to be only about 3 1/2 percent in 1989 and 1990. The Administration budget, with its optimism on inflation, also assumes steady economic growth at a rate of about 3 1/4 percent, not allowing for inflation. But as the news on inflation unfolds, and interest rates move higher, the markets increasingly find the Administration's budget and economic scenario incredible. The markets would particularly fear a rerun of the fiscal and monetary policies of the late 1960's and 1970's, which eventually sent inflation soaring.
As James J. O'Leary, economic consultant of the United States Trust Company, put it, ''The sharp escalation of inflation and interest rates during the decade ending in 1980-1981 had a lasting and revolutionary effect on investor psychology and upon the money and capital markets.''
And he added that the ''negative spread'' that developed between the cost of funds - interest on deposits - at the savings and loan institutions and the yield on their fixed-rate, long-term investments proved ruinous and lies at the base of the $100 billion-plus disaster that the savings institutions, and the American taxpayers, are facing.
Inflation and soaring interest rates also hurt the life insurance industry, long the steady and primary provider of long-term fixed-rate loans to business, through corporate bonds and commercial mortgages. This helped to create the conditions that gave rise to the ''junk bond'' market.
The Fed's job is to prevent a recurrence of the disastrous combination of higher inflation and higher interest rates. Mr. Greenspan has indicated that he intends to do the job by tightening money and raising interest rates as necessary. However, the Fed has held back from raising the discount rate, for reasons that remain murky but appear to be part of the effort to avoid conflict with the Administration.
All the same, the Fed chairman has continued a moderately restrictive policy and has made clear that, in his view, if the Fed does not arrest inflation by raising interest rates, the financial markets will take alarm and raise interest rates much higher, with far worse consequences for the economy.
The markets themselves are sending out the same warning to the Administration - and to Congress, which seems incapable of acting without Presidential leadership. That is why the moment of budgetary truth is approaching for Mr. Bush.

Abstract: ''We suggest that the United States has some additional crimes stored away for Iran, and that is why we do not push for any revenge,'' he said. ''Wise people understand why we do not take revenge.'' ''Compensation is not enough for what happened,'' he said. The hojatolislam said Iran wanted the United States ''to say they are guilty.'' Earlier this week, as Hojatolislam [Hashemi Rafsanjani] sought to encourage international condemnation of the United States and sympathy for Iran, Ayatollah Montazeri, in a message read on the Teheran radio, asked Ayatollah Khomeini to order ''revolutionary forces and resistance cells inside and outside the country to target America's material, political, economic and military interests.''

Full text: LEAD: The Speaker of Iran's Parliament said today that his nation would ''not push for any revenge'' against the United States for shooting down a civilian jet carrying 290 people last Sunday.
The Speaker of Iran's Parliament said today that his nation would ''not push for any revenge'' against the United States for shooting down a civilian jet carrying 290 people last Sunday.
The Speaker, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is also commander of the armed forces, told thousands of worshipers at Teheran University that further military confrontation with the United States was unwise.
''We suggest that the United States has some additional crimes stored away for Iran, and that is why we do not push for any revenge,'' he said. ''Wise people understand why we do not take revenge.''
Hojatolislam Rafsanjani told a crowd of several thousand who had gathered in an open-air theater that Iran should wait and see what the United Nations Security Council does on Tuesday, when it is scheduled to discuss the downing of the jet. Iran may be satisfied, he said, ''if they give us justice and condemn the warmonger and tell the United States to leave the Persian Gulf.''
The statement seemed to indicate that Iran would rely on diplomatic pressure and not violence to avenge the downing of the Iran Air jet by the American warship Vincennes.
As this country of 46 million continues to focus on the loss of the plane and the confrontation with the United States, Teheran's leaders appear to be trying to use the episode to reduce the Western armada in the Persian Gulf, which is containing Iranian military activities but leaving Iraq free to attack Iranian oil installations.
Iran's primary goal, its leaders say, is to reduce the high profile assumed by the United States.
These themes, often hinted at lately in interviews and various statements by Iranian officials, were fleshed out today in the speech by Hojatolislam Rafsanjani.
Hojatolislam Rafsanjani seemed to imply that Iran is not interested in Washington's talk of compensation. He said the victims of the incident ''did not ask for compensation.''
''Compensation is not enough for what happened,'' he said. The hojatolislam said Iran wanted the United States ''to say they are guilty.''
An element in this uncharacteristically toned-down Iranian attitude seems to be the exhaustion felt by the Iranian population after eight years of inconclusive war with Iraq.
For example, foreign diplomats here say fewer and fewer people show up at rallies to curse Iran's enemies. Heavy Economic Toll
The war has also imposed punishing economic penalties, which can be seen in dilapidated public buildings, neglected transportation, and high inflation.
Western diplomats say Iran's courting of the world press to report on its grief in the aftermath of the downing of the jet shows the degree to which the faction led by Hojatolislam Rafsanjani is anxious to find a pragmatic way to end Iran's military predicament.
But Hojatolislam Rafsanjani took pains to deny that there were differences among senior leaders of the Iranian Government. He said the seeming contradictions between his views an those of Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated successor of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, were all part of a complementary policy debate. Montazeri Pushes Hard Line
Ayatollah Montazeri, who is considered Hojatolislam Rafsanjani's leading rival for power, has called for attacks against American interests and property in response to the downing of the jet.
Earlier this week, as Hojatolislam Rafsanjani sought to encourage international condemnation of the United States and sympathy for Iran, Ayatollah Montazeri, in a message read on the Teheran radio, asked Ayatollah Khomeini to order ''revolutionary forces and resistance cells inside and outside the country to target America's material, political, economic and military interests.''
Ayatollah Khomeini's response, according to Westerners who follow Iranian politics, appeared to be a rebuff to Ayatollah Montazeri.
Westerners who study Iranian politics said before the plane was shot down that Iran's radical attitudes had diminished considerably in the last several months, and that many leaders seemed to be giving priority to economic changes and to a search for a way to end the war.

Abstract: There have also been indications that Mr. [Reagan] will pursue a favorite project, the North American Common Market. Last fall, the United States and Canada negotiated a free-trade agreement that must be ratified by the legislative bodies of both countries. In his State of the Union Message last month, Mr. Reagan described free trade as a concept he was ''determined to expand'' and said he looked forward to the day it would move ''south as well as north.'' ''I am not in favor of such a proposal because I believe that through the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs we have a multilateral way to deal with our neighbors,'' Mr. [Carlos Salinas de Gortari] said last month. ''There is such a different level between the United States and Mexico that I don't believe such a common market would provide an advantage to either country.'' For its part, ''Mexico will once again manifest its preoccupation with protectionist tendencies in the United States,'' the Mexican diplomat said.

Full text: LEAD: As President Miguel de la Madrid and President Reagan prepare for their last scheduled official meeting, Mexico is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis in half a century and hoping the United States will play a key role in helping it recover.
As President Miguel de la Madrid and President Reagan prepare for their last scheduled official meeting, Mexico is struggling to emerge from its worst economic crisis in half a century and hoping the United States will play a key role in helping it recover.
Officials of both Governments said the leaders, each in his final year in office, would spend a substantial portion of their four hours together on Saturday discussing economic matters. The meeting will be in the Pacific Coast resort of Mazatlan.
The issues expected to be atop the agenda are Mexico's foreign debt, including a novel Mexican plan to issue bonds backed by the United States Treasury, and bilateral trade.
Narcotics trafficking, Central America, border and immigration questions and other subjects will also be addressed. But Mr. de la Madrid comes to the meeting under enormous domestic criticism and pressure to stem the economic decline he inherited when he took office in December 1982. Inflation and Debt Soar
In many respects, the economic problems have deepened. Inflation is at an all-time high of 177 percent, and a wage and price indexing program, scheduled to take effect March 1, remains untested. The foreign debt of more than $105 billion is the second-largest in the developing world, real wages have declined by half during the 1980's and net economic growth has been negative during the last two years.
Increasingly, Mr. de la Madrid and his Cabinet have been looking to the rapidly growing export sector, one of the economy's few bright spots, to counterbalance the depression in the domestic market. The key market for exports is the United States, which is Mexico's biggest foreign investor and its largest trading partner. The United States accounts for more than 60 percent of both Mexican imports and exports.
Prospects for growth in bilateral trade have been bolstered by a trade consultation accord signed by the two nations in November. That document calls for the two countries to consult on trade in goods including steel and electronics; American officials said agreements on textiles and telecommunications might be signed this weekend.
But some additional fine-tuning is likely to be required on the innovative bond plan Mexico announced in December, officials said. Under that proposal, Mexico would use $2 billion in zero-coupon bonds purchased from the United States to buy back several billion dollars of its debt, at a discount of up to 50 percent, from commercial banks.
After the plan was announced, the Securities and Exchange Commission made recommendations that would limit the tax and accounting benefits available to banks taking part in the program. Mexican officials said they planned to raise that issue in the talks on Saturday and would seek further Treasury department backing for the bonds, which will be auctioned later this month.
A Mexican diplomat, who asked not to be identified, said the Mexican Government intended to point out that the bond plan is an idea that needs further lobbying, to persuade more American banks to participate. Common Market Concept
There have also been indications that Mr. Reagan will pursue a favorite project, the North American Common Market. Last fall, the United States and Canada negotiated a free-trade agreement that must be ratified by the legislative bodies of both countries. In his State of the Union Message last month, Mr. Reagan described free trade as a concept he was ''determined to expand'' and said he looked forward to the day it would move ''south as well as north.''
Mexican officials, however, have shied away from such proposals, which are politically explosive here. Both Mr. de la Madrid and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the former Minister of Budget and Planning who is expected to succeed him as President Dec. 1, have said such an arrangement would be both inappropriate and impractical.
''I am not in favor of such a proposal because I believe that through the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs we have a multilateral way to deal with our neighbors,'' Mr. Salinas said last month. ''There is such a different level between the United States and Mexico that I don't believe such a common market would provide an advantage to either country.''
An American official said Mr. Reagan did not expect immediate progress on the matter. Instead, he said, the President is ''laying a marker for the future, expressing a vision and a long-term goal.''
It is also expected that the United States will once again call for Mexico to loosen its rules and procedures governing foreign investment, which Washington views as cumbersome and unclear.
For its part, ''Mexico will once again manifest its preoccupation with protectionist tendencies in the United States,'' the Mexican diplomat said.

U.S. and Mexico: Trade Barriers Fall

Abstract: ''What we're seeing is a maturing of the bilateral trading relationship,'' said one American negotiator, B. Timothy Bennett, a Deputy Assistant United States Trade Representative. ''Both sides recognize the need to make mutually beneficial concessions for their mutual advantage.'' Integrated Market Foreseen ''Both the United States and Mexico now recognize that they share a common destiny,'' said Robert E. Herzstein, a former senior Carter Administration trade official, now a partner at the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter. ''Our relations with Mexico should be at the very top of our international agenda,'' he added. ''The threat,'' notes Geoffrey Kean, partner of Perception International, an economic intelligence service based in Ridgefield, Conn., ''is higher immigration, which affects us directly, if there is an economic downturn in Mexico. The opportunity is that a better economy in Mexico means both countries will benefit.''

Mars chocolate bars, Miller Lite beer, Avon products and WestPoint Pepperell towels are among American products that will become available in Mexico for the first time after a spate of unusual agreements between the two countries.
For its part, the United States will import more Mexican steel bars, cotton trousers and men's shirts.
Both countries, recognizing their deepening relationship, have suddenly embarked on a significant trade liberalizing course highlighted by the trade and monetary accords reached over the last two weeks.
''What we're seeing is a maturing of the bilateral trading relationship,'' said one American negotiator, B. Timothy Bennett, a Deputy Assistant United States Trade Representative. ''Both sides recognize the need to make mutually beneficial concessions for their mutual advantage.'' Integrated Market Foreseen
At this stage the goals are not as ambitious as the provisions in the Canada-United States free trade agreement signed last Jan. 2 that would almost eliminate trade and investment barriers between the two nations.
Still, the gradual, pragmatic lowering of trade fences at the Rio Grande is recognized as an achievement of potentially great importance. At some time, perhaps early in the next century, it could lead to a North American Common Market.
In general terms President Reagan has called for an integrated market from the Arctic to the Yucatan. A Reagan trade official, who asked not to be identified, recalled the President asking one Cabinet meeting: ''If the Europeans can create a Common Market, why can't we? '' Treasury Takes a Role
To support what has been a relatively new policy of the Mexican Government in favor of trade liberalization, the Treasury, under a previously announced plan to sell bonds to Mexico, has effectively become a partner in debt relief with commercial banks and Mexico.
The complex transaction might help extinguish as much as one-fifth of Mexico's outstanding debt and could free Mexico to spend an additional $1 billion on imports, much of which could go to American producers, analysts said.
The United States is Mexico's biggest foreign supplier. Mexico, with three times the population of Canada, is the fifth-largest customer of the United States after Canada, Japan, West Germany and Taiwan.
According to many analysts, these elements of a broad Mexican-American framework are shaping up: With a large labor force and plentiful natural resources including oil, Mexico would help the United States with its global competitiveness problems. The United States, with its capital and technology, would help Mexico realize its development ambitions. 'A Common Destiny'
''Both the United States and Mexico now recognize that they share a common destiny,'' said Robert E. Herzstein, a former senior Carter Administration trade official, now a partner at the Washington law firm of Arnold & Porter. ''Our relations with Mexico should be at the very top of our international agenda,'' he added.
Echoing this sentiment, Felix G. Rohatyn, partner of the investment firm of Lazard Freres & Company, has said, ''I believe that over the next 10 years our relationship with Mexico will be even more important to our vital interests than with either the Soviet Union or Japan.''
For years the United States had sought closer trade links with Mexico, but had been rebuffed by Mexico's political leadership, which was entrenched in policies of trade nationalism. These policies enforced high tariffs and large domestic subsidies to encourage domestic production as a substitute for imports. Old Policies Reassessed
The debt crisis and recognition of the need for greater economic efficiency brought a dramatic reassessment of the old policies - a process that is expected to be accelerated by the new presidential standard bearer, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the Harvard-educated Minister of Budget and Planning who is expected to succeed President Miguel de la Madrid later this year.
In August 1986 Mexico signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free-trade charter, and since then has reduced tariffs and dismantled other trade controls.
Last November the United States and Mexico agreed to establish their first dispute-settlement mechanisms for trade and investment and set a framework for pursuing liberalization in textiles, steel, agriculture, investments, technology transfer, electronic products, services, patents, copyrights and other ''intellectual property.''
In addition to increasing efficiency, Mexican authorities see reduced trade barriers as an anti-inflation weapon. Anticipation of lower prices from cheaper imports was one of the factors behind a forecast last Wednesday by Mexican Finance Secretary Gustavo Petricioli that the monthly rate of inflation would slow to 1 percent to 2 percent by the end of the year. By March, monthly inflation is expected to fall to 8 percent, from the current rate of 10 percent.
After petroleum, Mexico's two most important exports to the United States are textiles and steel - products involved in two of the recent agreements with the United States.
In steel, American negotiators agreed to a 12 percent increase in Mexico's allowable steel shipments to the United States, in return for a steel tariff reduction by Mexico to 20 percent, from 38 percent, and certain other liberalizing measures. In other action, a limit was set at 6,300 tons on imports of Mexican steel wire products, compared with imports last year of 11,000 tons.
Under a second pact, textile and apparel exports from Mexico to the United States would grow by 6 percent annually over the next four years, compared with a 50 percent increase in 1987.
In addition, Mexico is permitted much faster expansion of shipments here than the 1 percent to 3 percent annual growth that is the goal of similar accords with the major textile producers in the Far East.
But American textile and apparel makers also won greater access to the Mexican market as a result of Mexico's commitments to cut tariffs on yarn and fabrics and to permit the United States to sell up to $240 million of apparel and finished products, such as shirts, towels and pajamas, in Mexico. Previously, this market had been closed to all foreign suppliers.
Mexico also agreed to eliminate or significantly reduce its import restrictions on beer, wine, distilled spirits, agricultural seeds, confectionary chocolate, lotions and face creams, linoleum and other floor coverings, air deflectors for autos and more than 30 other products. 'Mutual Benefits' Emphasized
In announcing the agreements, the United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, emphasized the ''mutual benefits.''
''I am pleased by the cooperative spirit that has been present between our two nations throughout these consultations,'' he said.
Reaction in the private sector in the United States was mixed. Lynne Strang, an official of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said that the agreements ''can't do anything but good.''
But some analysts see Mexico as both a threat and an opportunity.
''The threat,'' notes Geoffrey Kean, partner of Perception International, an economic intelligence service based in Ridgefield, Conn., ''is higher immigration, which affects us directly, if there is an economic downturn in Mexico. The opportunity is that a better economy in Mexico means both countries will benefit.''

Abstract: ''Up to now, so many investors and the Administration have been living in what can only be described as a fool's paradise,'' said Geoffrey Bell, an international investment adviser. ''This was based on hopes that the trade deficit would soon begin to show modest but significant improvement, and this would keep money flowing to the United States.'' To be sure, Mr. [James A. Baker] added, not everything was right with the world. The United States wasn't getting the cooperation it had counted on from West Germany, he said, charging that four increases in an important German interest rate since July had violated ''the spirit of our recent consultations.'' He seemed to be warning that the dollar may have to decline further, presumably hurting other countries' exports. The Germans insist that ''the markets'' are lifting rates and, besides, Government and central-bank policy must be aimed at nipping incipient inflation in the bud. The problems of the United States, they insist, are of its own making. Despite this year's drop in the budget deficit, their belief - one that is shared by many economists and investors - is that little or no progress will be made in the coming two years, because the underlying deficit is rising and President Reagan refuses to accept tax increases or cuts in military spending.

IS the world economy beginning to fall apart?
Wall Street, plunging into a downturn that many analysts and investors feared was the end of the big bull market of the last five years, behaved last week as though the center would not hold.
The drop for the week in the Dow Jones industrial average of 235.48 points, or 9.49 percent, was a reaction to a gloomy trade report that was only one in series of symptoms of the precarious condition of the international economic system.
''Up to now, so many investors and the Administration have been living in what can only be described as a fool's paradise,'' said Geoffrey Bell, an international investment adviser. ''This was based on hopes that the trade deficit would soon begin to show modest but significant improvement, and this would keep money flowing to the United States.''
The August trade deficit of $15.7 billion, or $188 billion at an annual rate, dashed these hopes and led to a far-reaching fallout.
The prospect of a trade imbalance well above last year's $160 billion raised anxieties that Congress, concerned about the loss of American markets and jobs, would enact a protectionist trade bill, thus intensifying world inflationary pressures.
The trade outlook also brought the dollar under heavy selling pressure from private traders - pressure that the Federal Reserve and foreign central banks sought to contain by buying dollars.
That drove up interest rates, as the markets and banks anticipated that a falling dollar would heighten inflationary forces in the United States.
Rising interest rates are feared like poison by both the stock and bond markets, since capital values tend to drop as rates rise. The bond market, less noticed by the general public, also plunged with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, a bellwether for other bonds, landing above 10 percent.
Finally, the interest rate rise threatened problems for the national economy and was a reminder of smoking volcano in the world economy. At home, the prospect of slower spending by consumers and businesses raised worries about a recession in 1988, which most economists have not expected and which the Administration fears could cost the Republicans the White House in 1988.
Abroad, rising interest rates jeopardized the ability of the Latin American and other third world debtors to pay their bills, menacing the liquidity of some big American banks. Dispute With Germans
In what looked like one more symptom of the precariousness of it all, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d held a White House news conference to offer official reassurance. The Federal Reserve's decision not to raise the discount rate since its half-point hike on Sept. 4, he said, showed the Fed thought anxieties about inflation were overblown.
He also pointed to the economy's five years of steady growth, the low unemployment rate and relatively low interest rates.
He said the Federal budget deficit was getting better; at a little over $150 billion this year it would be $70 billion smaller than the record $221 billion of last year. And the trade deficit, he said, was also improving, in volume terms, if not in current dollars.
To be sure, Mr. Baker added, not everything was right with the world. The United States wasn't getting the cooperation it had counted on from West Germany, he said, charging that four increases in an important German interest rate since July had violated ''the spirit of our recent consultations.'' He seemed to be warning that the dollar may have to decline further, presumably hurting other countries' exports.
The effort of the United States to stabilize the dollar without accepting its trade deficit as irreparable, and without thrusting its economy into recession, depends on the cooperation of the other industrial countries in holding their interest rates down and accelerating growth.
Mr. Baker is relatively satisfied, if not ecstatic, about the performance of the Japanese but bitterly unhappy with the West Germans. In the last three months, while the United States' Federal funds rate (which banks charge one another for short-term loans) has been gone up 1.1 percentage points, the Japanese rate has gone up only one-tenth of 1 point and the West German rate has risen a full percentage point. The German economy continues to languish, with unemployment at nearly 9 percent.
The Germans insist that ''the markets'' are lifting rates and, besides, Government and central-bank policy must be aimed at nipping incipient inflation in the bud. The problems of the United States, they insist, are of its own making. Despite this year's drop in the budget deficit, their belief - one that is shared by many economists and investors - is that little or no progress will be made in the coming two years, because the underlying deficit is rising and President Reagan refuses to accept tax increases or cuts in military spending.
It now begins to look as though the Administration sold itself a bill of goods on the cooperative arrangements worked out at various meetings of the Group of Seven industrial countries during the past year. The financial markets seem to recognize that where policies for spurring growth, opening up trade, holding down interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates are concerned, it's every country for itself and the devil take the hindmost. In these circumstances, the plunge in Wall Street -by 95 points on Wednesday, 57 points on Thursday and an all-time record of over 100 points on Friday - did not seem irrational.
When the kissing stops among the allies, the money stops flowing on Wall Street and foreign capital stops flowing into dollars. That is the great danger that hangs over the American and the world economy - a danger that will take deeper and more genuine cooperative action to avert.

Abstract: While still far from complete, economists contend that the new order has begun to yield some tangible results. ''I think something good has happened,'' said Ralph C. Bryant, economist at the Brookings Institution and formerly a top official of the Federal Reserve System. ''The process of economic policy-making is a little better than it was.'' ''We didn't have it before,'' he added. ''We have it now. Is it nirvana? Never was intended to be.'' ''I just regard it as a joke,'' said Robert V. Roosa, partner in Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, the banking firm. And Lawrence H. Summers, an economist at Harvard, said, ''The gold thing, that's crazy, crazy.''

Full text: LEAD: Despite the turbulence in the financial markets and the barbs of skeptics, many economists find that the United States and other leading countries are making headway in a fit-and-start effort to regain control of the world economy.
Despite the turbulence in the financial markets and the barbs of skeptics, many economists find that the United States and other leading countries are making headway in a fit-and-start effort to regain control of the world economy.
Some 16 years ago the major nations gave up their battle to keep the dollar's value tied to gold and abandoned their old system. But they have since decided that the wide-open markets and often frenzied exchange rates that took gold's place have not served them very well either. As a result, they have been devising a new order that most likely will resurrect gold, although probably not to a role as powerful as before.
The new arrangement - two years in the making - is based on negotiation, compromise and the use of mutually accepted indicators of each country's economic performance. The aim is to anticipate and thwart the kinds of jolts to the world economy that arose in recent years -inflation, the yawning American trade and budget deficits, the loan-payment struggles of the developing countries and the volatile dollar.
While still far from complete, economists contend that the new order has begun to yield some tangible results. ''I think something good has happened,'' said Ralph C. Bryant, economist at the Brookings Institution and formerly a top official of the Federal Reserve System. ''The process of economic policy-making is a little better than it was.''
He cites the stability of the dollar since last February, when economists were predicting a further decline after a yearlong fall. Although many economists are still predicting that the dollar will drop, the seven leading countries can say they have had some success. They are members of the so-called Group of Seven, consisting of the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
Having agreed last February that the dollar's value stay put, they spent billions of their own currencies to buy dollars from the market and keep its price up in the face of heavy selling pressure. As a result, the dollar has remained stable in relation to the German mark, and has slipped only about 7 percent against the Japanese yen, compared with double-digit declines the previous year.
There have been other achievements. Economists cite Japan's lowering of interest rates twice last year, in tandem with similar actions by the Federal Reserve. Japan, they say, has also been stimulating domestic spending, as it had promised its partners.
And for their part, President Reagan and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, the principal proponent of the new order, have been promising to bring the United States budget deficits under control.
The 1987 deficit is down at least $60 billion from last year's record $221 billion, and last month the President, although reluctantly, signed a law helping to keep the deficit down in 1988. That was largely the result of domestic pressures but Mr. Baker said that, in part, it reflected promises the United States made to the other six countries.
The new approach to policy-making, Mr. Baker said in an interview, ''provides us with a political mechanism that was badly needed in order to improve the coordination of economic policy among the major trading nations of the world.''
''We didn't have it before,'' he added. ''We have it now. Is it nirvana? Never was intended to be.''
The United States still runs big budget and trade deficits, and Japan and Germany in recent weeks have been letting interest rates rise, to the fury of the Reagan Administration, because their increases have contributed to interest rate increases in the United States and to the turmoil in the American stock and bond markets.
But, Mr. Baker said, ''Are we considerably better off in terms of our chances of obtaining better coordination as a consequence of it? Yes we are.''
And Mr. Baker added that he thought that bringing gold back would make the system even better. During a speech here at the end of September, he proposed that the seven countries use commodity prices to gauge how their economies are performing, especially regarding inflation. One of the commodities would be gold.
The remark brought disbelief to many economists, but there was nothing idle about it. ''The President went for it like a duck for a June bug,'' Mr. Baker said when asked how the White House responded to the mention of gold.
Although Mr. Baker is not asking for a return to a gold-based system, some proponents of such a system -such as Robert A. Mundell, an economics professor at Columbia University, and Jude Wanniski, a supply-side lobbyist - see his proposal as an important step in that direction. More Cooperative Approach
Whether or not gold will have a formal role in the new system, the leading democracies are well along in constructing a more cooperative approach. In a sense, they are looking back, seeking to restore the sort of world economic order that followed the Bretton Woods, N.H., conference in 1944 that set up the postwar economic system, including the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
The value of the dollar was tied to gold and the value of other currencies was tied to the dollar. Countries were expected to maintain the values of their respective currencies by using dollars to buy and sell them. This was practical as long as each country's economy remained stable in relation to the others. If it did not, it was expected to devalue or revalue its currency, with agreement from its trading partners. The object was to prevent inflation and maintain steady growth.
The role of the United States was to pay gold to buy dollars from foreign governments that amassed the American currency as a result of their efforts to support its price. But that system broke down when high inflation in the United States caused speculators to dump dollars, exerting huge pressures on the nation's gold reserves. In a dramatic Sunday night television broadcast in August 1971, President Nixon closed the ''gold window'' and the system collapsed.
Although gold has lost its role, the concept of coordinating their economic policies has re-emerged as a basic ingredient of the economic philosophy of the seven nations. Growth With Low Inflation
Some economists say there are special reasons why the new approach shows signs of working. First, they say there is little pressure for radical policy changes because the economies of the seven countries have been growing with relatively low inflation for several years. Also, with the exception of Italy, all have like-minded conservative governments.
''Countries have been talking together for a long time,'' said Gottfried Haberler, economist at the American Enterprise Institute, ''and this has intensified. But I think some skepticism is still in order.''
The earlier hands-off policy of benign neglect reached its zenith with the soaring dollar of the first half of the 1980's. It began to crumble as Congress began demanding protectionist legislation because the strong dollar was making American goods less competitive and causing a loss of jobs.
To avert a trade war, in September 1985, Mr. Baker and Paul A. Volcker, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, asked the finance ministers and central bankers of Japan, West Germany, France and Britain to the Plaza Hotel in New York, where they declared they stood ready to push the dollar's value down. Since then, the dollar has declined by about 40 percent against other major currencies. Agreement on Indicators
From there, a new policy began taking shape. Two other countries, Italy and Canada, were brought aboard. At the Tokyo economic summit conference in May 1986, the group agreed to devise a set of indicators to measure their economies and to serve as an objective means of determining how their policies should be coordinated.
At subsequent meetings they established ranges within which their currencies would be allowed to rise and fall before the governments began buying and selling currencies to keep them within the zone.
More fundamentally, they negotiated changes in domestic policies, including the commitment to reduce the American budget deficits.
None of these initiatives has met with unequivocal success. Germany and Japan have resisted American appeals for changes in interest rates more often than they have gone along. Germany has lagged far behind its partners in fitting its economy into the goals set by the others. Even agreement on an acceptable set of indicators is still incomplete.
Mr. Baker now would like to see gold become part of that package. Gold, he said, can be effective in helping countries spot inflation - the price of gold was near rock bottom at $340 an ounce in the summer of 1986 when American inflation was only 1 percent, and now, with inflation around 5 percent, it is about $460. Avoiding a Delusion
Gold, Mr. Baker said, by enabling countries to measure the value of their respective currencies against something other than other currencies, helps avoid the delusion that occurs when inflation is rising everywhere while all currencies still seem stable.
But there are many doubters. John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist, said Mr. Baker's speech last month was a ''marvelous exercise in fantasy and obfuscation.''
''I just regard it as a joke,'' said Robert V. Roosa, partner in Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, the banking firm. And Lawrence H. Summers, an economist at Harvard, said, ''The gold thing, that's crazy, crazy.''
''I take it as mildly meaningful,'' said Stephen H. Axilrod, a former senior Fed official and now vice chairman of Nikko Securities Company International in New York. ''I think people are looking for a more objective indicator of inflationary tendencies, and every once in a while, gold tends to be that.''

Full text: LEAD: Following is an excerpt from President Reagan's address today to the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund:
Following is an excerpt from President Reagan's address today to the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund:
There is, of course, the trade deficit - something of justifiable concern both in this country and abroad. Corrections are necessary, and there are strong signs that corrections are under way.
It is vital, however, that policy makers not be stampeded into self-destructive action. There has been a chorus of American politicans playing to the fears of working people, singing the song of protectionism and charging that, as a result of the trade deficit, jobs will go overseas, unemployment will rise, and the United States will be deindustrialized.
It sounds good as part of a political campaign speech, but as an old Virginia lawyer once told his hometown jury, ''tain't so.'' Unemployment has declined in the United States by 40 percent since late 1982, even as our trade deficit has grown. In Japan and Germany, countries with large trade surpluses, unemployment has gone up. Rise in Real Wages
And a long-term analysis shows us holding our own in manufacturing jobs. Importantly, from the end of 1982 to the present, during a time of large trade deficits, manufacturing jobs in the United States grew by more than a million. Furthermore, real wages in manufacturing, which declined by 7 percent from 1977 to 1981, increased by 2 1/2 percent from 1981 to 1986.
The trade deficit is symptomatic of structural problems that we as managers need to address. Self-destructive protectionism, however, is definitely not the answer. I pledge to you that any protectionist legislation reaching my desk is going to be returned to the Congress with veto on the cover.
Part of the answer lies here at home. As I noted at the economic summit in Venice last June, it is imperative that the United States consistently reduce its Federal deficit spending. Today, I will sign a bill that reinstates our deficit reduction targets as part of an extension of the borrowing authority of the United States Government. This was not an easy decision. On one hand was the responsibility to preserve our 200-year history of meeting our obligations and maintaining credibility and reliability to our own citizens and to the world. Political Debate
On the other hand was the political debate being waged between those who favor either raising taxes or cutting defense - or both - and those of us committed to further reductions in domestic spending, reductions that will bring down the deficit and keep our economy strong.
As I said, it was a tough decision. It should be seen as a signal that America is not backing down from its responsibilities. But having made this decision, I call on the surplus countries to do the same - to find the political gumption to stimulate their economies without reigniting the fires of inflation.
It must be recognized that the health of the world economy does not hinge solely on U.S. budget policy. As U.S. budget and trade deficits decline, other countries must pick up the slack, particularly on imports from developing countries.

Abstract: CLIMBING interest rates, triggered by the declining dollar and worries about mounting inflation, have soured the mood on Wall Street. Some analysts have even started to write obituaries for the big bull market of the past five years. ''I don't think this is temporary,'' said [Sung Wohn Sohn], chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, the Minneapolis-based bank holding company. ''I certainly think we're in a bear market.'' It will do no good to try to minimize the danger of the nation's growing dependency on foreign capital. Earlier this year, before he became Fed chairman, Mr. [Alan Greenspan] warned his clients of the danger of a slackening of foreign investment in United States assets, which appeared to be taking place in the first quarter. But the foreign capital inflow picked up again in the second quarter, bolstering the stock market, even as the Fed gradually tightened money, sending interest rates higher. With the dollar weakening after the poor trade figures for the second quarter were announced, worries about a foreign pullback from dollar investments have intensified. In a recent analysis, David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, warned that concerns about renewed dollar depreciation, if they cause foreign investors to cut their holdings, could have ''a very adverse effect on share prices'' because foreign capital has played a major role in pushing up the price-earnings ratios of American stocks in the face of rising bond yields this year.

CLIMBING interest rates, triggered by the declining dollar and worries about mounting inflation, have soured the mood on Wall Street. Some analysts have even started to write obituaries for the big bull market of the past five years. ''I don't think this is temporary,'' said Sung Wohn Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, the Minneapolis-based bank holding company. ''I certainly think we're in a bear market.''
Needing to defend the dollar and check inflation while keeping the expansion going, the Federal Reserve (under its new chairman, Alan Greenspan) is up against a tricky problem: If it does too little to tighten money and credit, it could fan inflationary expectations; but if it does too much, sending interest rates up sharply, it could put the securities markets and the economy into a nosedive.
A steep drop in the United States securities markets and a fall in the economy, hurting the outlook for corporate profits, could cause foreign investors to cut their holdings of American equities, bonds and other assets. Not only would this be bad news for the markets but also it would mean a severe shortfall in the savings needed to finance the Federal budget deficit and the trade deficit. This would mean another downward shove in the value of the dollar and another upward twist in interest rates.
It will do no good to try to minimize the danger of the nation's growing dependency on foreign capital. Earlier this year, before he became Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan warned his clients of the danger of a slackening of foreign investment in United States assets, which appeared to be taking place in the first quarter. But the foreign capital inflow picked up again in the second quarter, bolstering the stock market, even as the Fed gradually tightened money, sending interest rates higher. With the dollar weakening after the poor trade figures for the second quarter were announced, worries about a foreign pullback from dollar investments have intensified. In a recent analysis, David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, warned that concerns about renewed dollar depreciation, if they cause foreign investors to cut their holdings, could have ''a very adverse effect on share prices'' because foreign capital has played a major role in pushing up the price-earnings ratios of American stocks in the face of rising bond yields this year.
Foreign investors, according to Mr. Hale, have been expected to purchase more than $40 billion in American equities this year, compared with $18 billion last year and only $3 billion to $4 billion a year during the early 1980's. He puts the current United States price/earnings ratio at 17, which appears expensive in relation to Treasury bond yields of more than 9 percent, but he maintains that this is not expensive compared with Japan's P/E ratios of 60 and bond yields of 5 percent.
''But not even the Japanese will be able to sustain U.S. equity multiples at high levels if inflation expectations rise sharply and U.S. bond yields rise into double-digit territory,'' Mr. Hale said.
The anxieties about inflation and the dollar seem bound to dominate Fed policy now. A further tightening of money runs the risk of slowing the economy. But the risks of failing to defend the dollar and head off inflation would probably be much bigger. In driving foreign capital out of the country, the upward wrench to interest rates would be far greater if inflationary expectations got out of hand.
With the world economy growing sluggishly and foreigners still accumulating dollars as a result of the American trade deficit - it ran at an annual rate of nearly $160 billion in the first half - foreign investment in the United States is unlikely to plummet unless a market panic explodes out of fear that American monetary policy has gone haywire.
Foreigners want a secure place for their capital; a safe and sane United States monetary policy has provided security, and Mr. Greenspan appears determined to continue it. The problem is worsened by a Federal budgetary policy that makes this country more dependent on capital inflow.
Sustained American economic growth has made possible continued growth of the world economy, though at a slow rate. The export-dependent economies of Japan, the Pacific Rim nations, West Germany and others have been kept afloat chiefly by America's trade deficits, although with painful economic and political strains on the United States.
As the growing American deficits have sustained foreign expansion, so has the willingness of foreigners to invest here made possible the continued growth and stability of the United States - and of their own economies - and they know it.
Despite tensions between the United States and its trading partners, foreign governments have not threatened to stem the flow of capital to this country or to replace the dollar as the world's key currency. On the contrary, they realize that their own fate is bound up with the continued key role of the dollar and continued expansion of the American economy. It would take monetary irresponsibility beyond anything yet experienced to wreck the confidence in America that has supported the emergence of a more closely integrated world economy.

Abstract: Lawrence A. Veit of Brown Brothers Harriman & Company concludes that, at best, the industrial nations of the capitalist world will ''muddle through a few more quarters of deficient growth until some combination of more stimulative policies and underlying demand reignites the engines of expansion.'' The combined output of the non-OPEC developing countries is projected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent both this year and next. But, because of extreme differences in the ''inertial'' inflation among the developing countries, and their wide spread from stringency to laxity in fiscal and monetary policies, their expected rates of inflation differ widely. They are: the direct effect on prices of imported goods such as autos and consumer electronics; an ''umbrella'' effect on American-made goods where competing import prices have risen; higher business costs for American companies resulting from more expensive purchases abroad; rising precious metals and commodities prices stemming from the increased purchasing power of strong-currency countries, and a strengthened American industrial sector, as the lower dollar, by stimulating exports, adds to demand-side pressures and makes it easier for businesses to pass on price increases.

Full text: LEAD: OIL prices tumbled this week, pushed down by the market's pessimism about the world's ability to absorb current output levels of crude and refined products. In addition, world demand for commodities is far from booming. But within a pattern of reasonable balance, individual countries, whether developing or developed, are capable of generating inflation.
OIL prices tumbled this week, pushed down by the market's pessimism about the world's ability to absorb current output levels of crude and refined products. In addition, world demand for commodities is far from booming. But within a pattern of reasonable balance, individual countries, whether developing or developed, are capable of generating inflation.
Lawrence A. Veit of Brown Brothers Harriman & Company concludes that, at best, the industrial nations of the capitalist world will ''muddle through a few more quarters of deficient growth until some combination of more stimulative policies and underlying demand reignites the engines of expansion.''
The Brown Brothers Harriman forecast puts the growth of real gross national product for the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole at 2.5 percent this year and 3.1 percent next year, with the predicted rate of inflation averaging 3.4 percent in 1987 and 4 percent in 1988.
The gradual advance of the industrial countries would mean only modest growth for the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, whose combined real G.N.P. is forecast to rise by 2.5 percent in 1987 and 3 percent in 1988.
The combined output of the non-OPEC developing countries is projected to grow at an annual rate of 4.5 percent both this year and next. But, because of extreme differences in the ''inertial'' inflation among the developing countries, and their wide spread from stringency to laxity in fiscal and monetary policies, their expected rates of inflation differ widely.
Mexico, whose consumer price index rose by 57.8 percent in 1985 and 84.5 percent in 1986, is expected, according to Mr. Veit, to hit 110 percent in 1987 and 120 percent in 1988. Argentina, whose inflation was reined in to 81.9 percent in 1986, is forecast to climb again to a 125 percent rate in 1987 and 1988. Brazil, with inflation of 166.2 percent last year, is expected to climb to a 300 percent rate in 1987 and 1988.
While the spread in inflation rates among O.E.C.D. countries is much narrower, wide differences are still exhibited, depending mainly on national economic policies. In 1986, the lowest inflation was in West Germany, where consumer prices dropped by two-tenths of 1 percent, and the highest was in Australia, where prices rose 9.1 percent. The overall O.E.C.D. average increase in the consumer price index was just 2.7 percent, with the United States near the bottom, at just 1.1 percent.
The Veit analysis puts the O.E.C.D. inflation average for 1988 at 4 percent, with the United States forecast to rise by 4.5 percent. Some American economists, such as those at Salomon Brothers, are now putting it as high as 6.5 percent.
The argument that the United States rate will shoot higher starts with the lagging effects of a cheaper dollar. Allen Sinai, chief economist of Shearson Lehman Brothers, names five effects of a lower dollar on United States inflation.
They are: the direct effect on prices of imported goods such as autos and consumer electronics; an ''umbrella'' effect on American-made goods where competing import prices have risen; higher business costs for American companies resulting from more expensive purchases abroad; rising precious metals and commodities prices stemming from the increased purchasing power of strong-currency countries, and a strengthened American industrial sector, as the lower dollar, by stimulating exports, adds to demand-side pressures and makes it easier for businesses to pass on price increases.
The sharp fall in the dollar this week exacerbated worries of higher domestic inflation ahead. How far the dollar falls will depend to a degree on how the Group of Five major industrial countries acts to carry out the currency agreements reached in Paris in February through central bank interventions and coordinated macroeconomic policies.
The most important determinant of the dollar's future value may be actions on the United States budget deficit. But here the outlook is gloomy. The Congressional Budget Office this week predicted that the deficit would ease this year but grow again to nearly $200 billion next year unless Congress and the President make good their promises to stanch the red ink. They are still stalemated and prospects of a significant compromise are not bright.
Another major cause for anticipation of higher United States inflation is the expectation of a catch-up of wages to faster-rising prices. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 5.4 percent in the first half of this year, but wages rose by only 2.2 percent, so living standards went down. A new study by Olivier Jean Blanchard for the Brookings Institution made the case for some catch-up, showing that 40 percent of the upward adjustment of wages to rising prices is complete after one year and 65 percent after two years.
But, in specific cases and time periods, there is no iron law binding wages to prices, or vice versa. The bargaining power of corporations versus organized and unorganized labor will determine the speed and degree of the wage rise. For instance, a battle between labor and management, regarded as likely to have national significance, is now being waged between the International Paper Company and the combined forces of the United Paperworkers International Union at a strikebound mill in Jay, Me. As a result of conflicts over wages and company demands for givebacks, the mill has been closed since June 16.
That strike typifies the battle building in the United States over stepped-up inflation and who benefits or suffers from it.

Abstract: This bias in the Fed's ''all-things-considered'' policy was a main cause of the inflation of the 1970's. That Mr. [Paul A. Volcker], who was chairman for eight years, resisted it is a tribute to him. His resistance was fortified by his experience with the weak anti-inflationary policies of the 1970's while he was at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Alan Greenspan, whom President Reagan has nominated as the new chairman, is probably as much ''against'' inflation as Mr. Volcker. Like Mr. Volcker, he has had experience with the difficulties of checking inflation once it has gathered steam. But he is to enter office in an environment quite different from the one that surrounded Mr. Volcker's entrance. A test of the Fed's priorities awaits Mr. Greenspan. We hear a great deal about two goals of monetary policy -to fight inflation and to ''defend the dollar'' - that is, to stabilize the dollar's exchange rate at the existing level.

Full text: LEAD: Paul A. Volcker deserves all the honors a grateful nation can bestow upon him, mainly for his battle against inflation.
Paul A. Volcker deserves all the honors a grateful nation can bestow upon him, mainly for his battle against inflation.
It does not belittle Mr. Volcker's achievements to say that they did not include a solution of the problems of inflation and monetary policy.
The country is left with no guidance for his successor except that he should be like Mr. Volcker. Presumably, this does not mean that he should be 6 feet 7 inches tall. It means that his policy should be like Mr. Volcker's. But what was Mr. Volcker's policy?
The Federal Reserve's policy throughout its history has been to look at all the nation's objectives, all facts and forecasts and make decisions that it would be prepared to change in a week or a month. Until he writes a book telling us something different, that was also Mr. Volcker's policy.
There are two problems with the Fed's institutional policy.
First, it leads to great uncertainty. Even in the financial markets, which had so much confidence in Mr. Volcker, there was always enormous uncertainty about what he would do next and what the consequences would be. Such uncertainty infects and injures the economy outside ''the markets.''
Second, and more important, this policy contains an inflationary bias. When the Federal Reserve considers anew each month relative priorities of employment, economic growth, the dollar's exchange rate, third world debt, the troubled banks and inflation, there is a strong tendency for the control of inflation to sink to the bottom of the list.
The effects of monetary policy on inflation tend to come later than the effects on employment and output. Short-run interests are overwhelmingly in favor of a policy of expansion, even at the risk of inflation - at least until the inflation is upon us in a devastating degree.
This bias is probably stronger in the public and the politicians than in the Federal Reserve, but for all the talk of independence the Fed cannot be indifferent to the opinions of the public and the politicians.
This bias in the Fed's ''all-things-considered'' policy was a main cause of the inflation of the 1970's. That Mr. Volcker, who was chairman for eight years, resisted it is a tribute to him. His resistance was fortified by his experience with the weak anti-inflationary policies of the 1970's while he was at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
But we must remember that he took office after a decade of rising inflation that had made the public and the politicians extraordinarily willing to accept the costs of an anti-inflationary policy.
Alan Greenspan, whom President Reagan has nominated as the new chairman, is probably as much ''against'' inflation as Mr. Volcker. Like Mr. Volcker, he has had experience with the difficulties of checking inflation once it has gathered steam. But he is to enter office in an environment quite different from the one that surrounded Mr. Volcker's entrance.
Six years have passed since America last suffered double-digit inflation. The public no longer thinks of inflation as its No. 1 problem. The chairman will soon be working with a President who will not be elected on a promise to make control of inflation a top priority.
Sometime in his term, Mr. Greenspan will almost certainly encounter a recession accompanied by rising unemployment. Can we be confident that in this new environment he will be as resistant as Mr. Volcker was to the advocates of expansionary and inflationary policy as a way out of recession? And if we are confident about Mr. Greenspan, can we be confident of his successor?
The country needs greater assurance of price stability than the prospect that the Fed chairman will be against inflation. Before Mr. Volcker, the chairmen under whom we got the inflation were also against inflation. We need assurances that control of inflation will continue to be the first and dominant priority of the Federal Reserve.
This proposition implies, of course, that unemployment, growth, levels of particular prices and the solvency of particular financial institutions are at most subordinate objectives of monetary policy, except insofar as they are promoted by price level stability.
This proposition needs to be clearly stated, publicly debated and endorsed by the political leadership, possibly in the form of an act of Congress declaring it to be the primary mission of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level.
A test of the Fed's priorities awaits Mr. Greenspan. We hear a great deal about two goals of monetary policy -to fight inflation and to ''defend the dollar'' - that is, to stabilize the dollar's exchange rate at the existing level.
These two goals are talked about as if they are twins, but in fact they are consistent with each other only on occasion and by coincidence. For example, to have tried to stabilize the dollar from 1981 to 1985 - to keep it from rising - would have defeated the effort to get inflation down.
The Federal Reserve would have had to buy foreign currencies, which would have increased the supply of dollars and raised the level of prices in the United States. Preventing inflation and stabilizing the dollar may be consistent objectives today.
But it is at least highly possible that defending the dollar by monetary means will require an otherwise unnecessary deflation here. The Fed should keep its eye on the main thing - inflation - and make clear that it is not committed to stabilizing the prices of foreign currencies. Those prices are no more the proper objects of American monetary policy than are the prices of I.B.M. stock and soybeans.

Abstract: ''Playing with fire'' is how Karl Otto Pohl, president of the West German central bank, described United States policy shortly before this weekend's meeting began. ''Blackmail'' was the word that Jacques Delors, president of the European Community's Commission, used recently to describe the American approach. ''Continued appreciation of key non-dollar currencies is now clearly slowing down these countries' growth,'' said J. Paul Horne, European economic analyst with the big United States brokerage house of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in Paris. 'Shotgun Cooperation' Referring to the pressure from the United States that Western Europe and Japan take steps to bolster their domestic economies, Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington said, ''There is a chance 1987 could turn out the year of shotgun economic cooperation.''

Full text: LEAD: As finance ministers from seven major industrial nations hold talks here this weekend on improving their economic performance and stabilizing currency values, economic growth in Europe and Japan is showing new weakness, largely as a result of the dollar's recent fall, economic figures show.
As finance ministers from seven major industrial nations hold talks here this weekend on improving their economic performance and stabilizing currency values, economic growth in Europe and Japan is showing new weakness, largely as a result of the dollar's recent fall, economic figures show.
The recent rise in the value of European currencies and the yen is raising the prices of European and Japanese exports and reducing sales on which the countries depend heavily for economic growth. This has caused their economic preformance to falter.
Higher oil prices that followed an accord by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in December are also depressing growth. Faster Growth and Imports
The Reagan Administration hopes the weaker economic trend will encourage these countries to agree this weekend on action to bolster their economies, officials report. The opening of the talks here today was surrounded in secrecy, and a communique is not expected until late Sunday. [ Page 13. ] The possibility of a further dollar decline has encouraged both Japan and West Germany to cut their interest rates more than they had appeared likely to do. West Germany is also considering advancing tax cuts planned for early next year, and Japan has announced a public works program, measures that would strengthen their domestic economies.
Faster growth in Europe and Japan would halt the appreciation of their currencies by drawing in more imports and provide the United States with the new export markets it needs to reduce its trade deficit, and could head off mounting protectionist pressure in Congress. Political Resentment
But this approach by the United States - implicitly threatening Europe and Japan with a futher dollar devaluation if they do not expand their economies faster - is also stirring political resentment, suggesting that agreement on international monetary reform will be difficult to achieve.
''Playing with fire'' is how Karl Otto Pohl, president of the West German central bank, described United States policy shortly before this weekend's meeting began. ''Blackmail'' was the word that Jacques Delors, president of the European Community's Commission, used recently to describe the American approach.
The most dramatic sign of Europe's weakening growth has occurred in West Germany, normally the Continent's economic powerhouse.
Total West German output dropped four-tenths of 1 percent during the final quarter of last year, the Government announced last week. The Government has revised downward its growth forecast for this year from 3 percent to 2.5 percent, but many private forecasters believe 2 percent is a more likely outcome without a change of policy.
Unemployment rose last month, and earlier this week the Berlin Economic Research Institute predicted that output would fall 1 percent in the first quarter of this year.
The French Government has also reduced its growth forecast for this year, from 2.8 percent to 2.3 percent.While French industrial production grew by 1.5 percent during 1986 as a whole, it began slackening at the end of the year, with a fall of 5.7 percent at annual rates in the final three months.
Italy presents a similar picture. Total economic output rose 1.5 percent at annual rates during the first nine months of 1986. But it weakened sharply in the third quarter of last year, dropping 3.2 percent at annual rates. Industrial production was down 7.1 percent at annual rates in the last three months of 1986.
The latest survey of European business confidence published by the Commission of the European Community in Brussels showed a decline last December in all major countries except Britain.
In Japan, overall economic growth is holding up, averaging 2.3 percent at annual rates in the third quarter of last year, compared with 2.6 percent during the first nine months. But industrial production declined 2.4 percent in the final quarter.
''Continued appreciation of key non-dollar currencies is now clearly slowing down these countries' growth,'' said J. Paul Horne, European economic analyst with the big United States brokerage house of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in Paris. 'Shotgun Cooperation'
Referring to the pressure from the United States that Western Europe and Japan take steps to bolster their domestic economies, Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington said, ''There is a chance 1987 could turn out the year of shotgun economic cooperation.''
But West Germany and Japan remain reluctant to put at risk the progress they have made in reducing inflation and cutting their budget deficits by adopting more stimulatory policies now. As a result, many economists and policy makers see the United States approach as risky. They fear a further decline in the value of the dollar against their currencies could get out of hand, forcing the Federal Reserve Board to raise American interest rates to break its fall and push the American economy back into recession.
''Germany and Japan are being frightened into cooperation but that may mean the economic news has to get worse before it gets better,'' warned Christopher Johnson, economic adviser at Lloyds Bank in London.
In West Germany, particularly, United States policy is resented as an attempt to make the rest of the world pay the cost of the Reagan Administration's inability to reduce the Federal budget deficit, which is seen as a major cause of America's poor trade preformance.

Abstract: ''We are now the crack labor market,'' says Orley Ashenfelter, a labor economist at Princeton University. ''Everyone now turns to the United States to find out how to manage a labor market. That's a real reversal from the '60's and most of the '70's when we envied Europe's low unemployment rates.'' Another legacy of the 1982 recession appears to be a doubling of the ranks of workers so discouraged about job prospects that they have ceased looking for work and have dropped out of the labor market all together. WHY does American unemployment seem to be stuck at what used to be an unacceptable level? ''There are plenty of things to point a finger at,'' says Marvin H. Kosters an economist with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, ''but there just is no good way of explaining the rise.'' It was widely supposed in the late 1970's that the Phillips curve, which plots on a graph the trade-off between inflation and unemployment, had been discredited. Looking at the United States' experience over two and a half decades, it is easy to see why. During the 1960's the theory seemed to work: when unemployment fell, inflation rose, though not by much.

Full text: They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks Foreman said these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back. - Bruce Springsteen THOSE lyrics, from a song written in 1983, might just as easily have referred to a steel mill or an automobile assembly line or a chemical plant. As the United States economy endured the wrenching recession of 1981-82 that wrung inflation from the system, the jobless rate surged to 10.7 percent, the highest level since the Great Depression, when a quarter of the work force was idled.
Since the end of 1982, the unemployment rate has declined to around 7 percent. But the recovery is now four years old: in the 1975-80 expansion, the unemployment rate fell steadily to below 6 percent. This time, the rate has been stalled stubbornly for a year.
Perhaps an even more troubling picture that emerges from a graph of the United States unemployment rate plotted back to 1890 is that the trend line is rising. The wild swings that characterized the early part of the century are gone, but the drift since the 1950's is clearly upward.
Most economists point out that the experience of Western Europe is even worse. Even West Germany, the economic powerhouse of Europe, has an unemployment rate higher than that of the United States. Britain, which had three percent unemployment in the 1970's, cannot seem to get its rate below 12 percent today.
Japan's unemployment rate looks lower, but part of that difference is due to peciliarities in the way Japan counts its unemployed. And recently, even Japan's rate has begun to creep steadily upward.
''We are now the crack labor market,'' says Orley Ashenfelter, a labor economist at Princeton University. ''Everyone now turns to the United States to find out how to manage a labor market. That's a real reversal from the '60's and most of the '70's when we envied Europe's low unemployment rates.''
Still, it is difficult to take comfort in the greater misfortune of workers in Western Europe's economies. And the raw number of unemployed in the United States masks some distressing situations.
For example, nearly 15 percent of the unemployed have been without work for more than six months, double the rate in 1973 when the economy was at the peak of its Vietnam war expansion. In addition, people who have lost jobs are still squeezing the new entrants - people returning to the labor force and young people seeking first jobs - out of the market.
Another legacy of the 1982 recession appears to be a doubling of the ranks of workers so discouraged about job prospects that they have ceased looking for work and have dropped out of the labor market all together. WHY does American unemployment seem to be stuck at what used to be an unacceptable level? ''There are plenty of things to point a finger at,'' says Marvin H. Kosters an economist with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, ''but there just is no good way of explaining the rise.''
Unemployment insurance, purportedly a seductive cushion for some unemployed, is blamed for part of the higher rate of joblessness. Rising participation in the labor force by women and young people surely is part of the reason. In the last five years it seems an inesacapable conclusion that some American jobs - especially in manufacturing - have left these shores permanently as the strong dollar allowed foreign companies to win a larger share of the United States market.
Structural changes in the economy, which made it difficult to match jobs and workers, also may have contributed. And many experts say that the nation is now more willing to use macroeconomic policies to control inflation rather than reduce unemployment.
It was widely supposed in the late 1970's that the Phillips curve, which plots on a graph the trade-off between inflation and unemployment, had been discredited. Looking at the United States' experience over two and a half decades, it is easy to see why. During the 1960's the theory seemed to work: when unemployment fell, inflation rose, though not by much.
Then the relationship seemed to fall apart: In the late 1960's and 1970's, the economy, overheated by the Vietnam War and rising social spending, experienced its first postwar bout of accelerating, not simply higher, inflation. The oil- and food-price shocks of 1973-74, and the severe oil-price increase in 1978-79 only made matters worse. The Phillips curve began to crawl in all sorts of directions.
The recessions of the early 1980's seem to have restored some validity to the curve -inflation has been cut to 2 percent and continues there at the price of a substantial unemployment. Thus policy now seems bound by a familiar constraint: Is it worth risking an increase in the inflation rate to push the unemployment rate lower?
Or, as some economists predict, will the demographic changes that contributed to the problem ultimately provide part of the solution. As women's participation in the labor-force more closely matches the over-all rate in the United States, their participation rate should climb more slowly. That slowdown should ease unemployment as fewer new workers try to find jobs. And, by the turn of the century, the first of the baby boomers will be preparing for retirement, not for entry into the work force.

Abstract: In their political statement, the seven condemned Libya as a sponsor of terrorism, a stipulation demanded by the United States, Britain and Canada. The statement also called for measures against terrorists and their sponsors, including a ban on arms sales, limits on the size of diplomatic missions, improved extradition procedures, stricter immigration and visa requirements and the ''closest possible'' police and security agency cooperation to combat terrorism. But the statement fell short of endorsing the use of military force, such as the United States raids on Libya, and did not mention specific economic action against Libya - two things the United States would have welcomed. Japan and France were unenthusiastic about the terrorism statement, but Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said it amounted to a message for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader: ''You've had it, pal.''

Full text: THE seven major industrial democracies found much to agree upon last week at their summit in Tokyo, and they managed, as summiteers will, to finesse sharp differences. The statements they produced on world politics and economics were specific, but not without carefully cut loopholes and omissions, allowing each head of state to report home that the meeting had been a victory for, variously, the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
In their political statement, the seven condemned Libya as a sponsor of terrorism, a stipulation demanded by the United States, Britain and Canada. The statement also called for measures against terrorists and their sponsors, including a ban on arms sales, limits on the size of diplomatic missions, improved extradition procedures, stricter immigration and visa requirements and the ''closest possible'' police and security agency cooperation to combat terrorism. But the statement fell short of endorsing the use of military force, such as the United States raids on Libya, and did not mention specific economic action against Libya - two things the United States would have welcomed. Japan and France were unenthusiastic about the terrorism statement, but Secretary of State George P. Shultz, said it amounted to a message for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader: ''You've had it, pal.''
The statement also chided the Soviet Union for delaying the release of information on the nuclear accident in the Ukraine; praised the United States for its ''negotiating efforts'' on arms control, and called on Moscow to ''negotiate positively.''
The economic agreements were broad and ambitious, but, finally, statements of intention that were not binding and not enforceable, except by self-discipline. They prescribed how the seven countries should cooperate to avoid disruption in any of their economies. The aim of the principal agreement was to reduce sharp currency variations through the newly formed Group of Seven, the chief financial officals of each of the summit nations, who are to meet at least once a year. Instead of trying to deal with currency fluctuation through governmental buying and selling, the group is to monitor the basic economic policy and performance of each country - inflation, interest rates, growth, unemployment, deficits, trade balance - and recommend change when the actions of one country threaten to disrupt the others. (Managing the float, page 2.) On trade restrictions, and particularly those affecting agriculture, the seven agreed there were problems but set no date for dealing with them.
In Japan, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone came under criticism because of the summit's failure to meet his nation's concerns, notably by acting to stem the rise of the yen's value against the dollar. Partly as a result, his plan to call elections soon for both houses of parliament was jeopardized.

WAKING UP TO THE GLUT ECONOMY

Abstract: ''Everybody felt that the growth rate of metals would continue and they went searching the continents for new mines,'' says David Williamson, a metals analyst in the London office of Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''So all this new production came on stream in 1981 and walked right into a recession. Massive inventories developed,'' he continued. ''But once you're committed to opening up new mines and smelters that cost billions, you have to continue to operate them even if there's a surplus.'' In the United States, where debt-bloated balance sheets have made businesses unusually vulnerable to gluts, many companies have begun to grapple with the problem of overabundance. The Ogden Corporation, following a pattern that is becoming increasingly familiar, sold its collection of industrial operations - including its Avondale shipyard, an aluminum smelter, and a rail car assembler - to managers in a leveraged buy-out. It has redeployed its assets into businesses that turn solid municipal waste into energy and that provide management and maintenance services for large buildings like New York City's new convention center. General Electric's chief, John F. Welch, is saying he wants to move to a ''leaner, flatter'' structure to deal effectively with ''an intensified competitive world, a slower growth world.'' He is eliminating an entire layer of senior management and increasing the duties of other top executives. BUT corporate America's most frequent response to the glut problem has been to appeal for protection. American car manufacturers, steel makers and textile spinners all have applied for - and received - some protection in the last five years. And there seems to be no end to the pleas for relief. Petitions to Washington for import relief are up 22 percent this year, according to International Trade Commission figures. In the 1980-84 period, they increased 44 percent. ''We've cut taxes. We've had a boom. I don't know what else we can do,'' said Mr. [Thomas G. Moore], the Adminstration's advisor. ''There are problems for some firms and some individuals. But from the point of view of society as a whole, if you try to prop up these prices, it's going to hurt. We're fortunate in a sense because these gluts are keeping prices under control.''

Full text: IN London, an eerie silence hangs over the tin trading ring at the Metal Exchange; trading has been halted because there are simply not enough buyers for the vast quantities of tin that producers in faraway Malaysia keep turning out. In America's farm belt, more than a million bushels of this year's record corn crop went directly into storage, piling up on top of last year's surplus. In corporate America, such blue chips as General Motors, Warner-Lambert and Standard Oil of Ohio are reeling from lackluster demand for their products. They have been forced to cut prices, lay off thousands of workers and write off billions of dollars in redundant production capacity.
All over the globe, in developed and developing nations alike, producers in a broad spectrum of industries are turning out more than consumers can buy, creating a new world economy - a glut economy.
Overabundance has replaced the chronic shortages of the 1970's. There are rising stockpiles of raw materials, underutilized and mothballed factories and vast pools of idle labor. Prices are weak or falling, not ratcheting out of control in an inflationary spiral. And protectionism is gaining in popularity as a quick way to bar some of the outpouring of new goods.
''Every protectionist bill in Congress represents a glut,'' says Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential Bache Securities.
Even in the United States, whose economy has been growing faster than those of most other advanced countries, the glut is taking a heavy toll. Edward Denison, a Brookings Institution economist who studies growth, estimates that this country has ''the largest reserve of unused production capacity since the 30's.'' His figures show that the drop in demand during the last recession, in the early 80's, was so great that even a relatively strong, three-year-long recovery has not taken up the slack - and is not likely to in 1986.
The glut has already produced widespread problems -among builders who flooded the market with too much office space and too many condominiums; among manufacturers of personal computers, cars and color televisions who also overproduced, and among executives who borrowed heavily to expand their businesses in the hope that higher sales would justify the risks.
But the new glut economy has its bright side. The changed environment, some say, presents an opportunity for economic growth without the nightmare of volatile inflation - and the chance for consumers to stop racing after products whose prices keep rising from one week to the next.
However they view it, most economists and businessmen agree that the economy is undergoing a major change, far more significant than its usual tendency to swing between shortages and gluts as the business cycle plays itself out. ''This is definitely not an ordinary period,'' said Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and president of Townsend-Greenspan, an economic consulting firm.
Despite the sea change, governments of the industrial nations are still directing their economic policies as if inflation and overly rapid economic growth were still the greatest dangers.
But the suddenness of the shift has forced business leaders to desperately shave costs and overhead to remain competitive. ''After years of growth and years of expansion the climate for business in the United States has changed dramatically,'' said Ralph Ablon, chairman of the Ogden Corporation, which has shed most of its manufacturing operations and moved into services. ''The adaptation to the new environment is going to be very painful,'' he added.
Some economists argue that the failure of government policymakers in the industrialized countries to switch gears to soak up the glut is making the adjustment more painful than neccessary - not only for business but for millions of unemployed workers.
Attempts here and abroad to keep inflation under control by restricting credit and carefully controlling government spending have created a situation that economists fear weakens growth and extends the duration of the glut economy.
''The combination of forces pointing to low world inflation also points to low economic growth,'' said the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in its December economic bulletin. ''The policy makers should hardly stand idle before this troubling prospect. What is needed is a cautious swing - away from the inflation-fighting preoccupations of the last several years - in favor of expansionary policies for the future.''
That swing is not evident yet, particularly in Western Europe and Japan. According to the Morgan Guaranty study, the lack of growth in those countries has totally offset whatever stimulus the United States provided. In the industrial countries as a whole, growth has averaged 2.2 percent a year since 1979, compared with 3.6 percent in the 1970's and 5.7 percent in the 1960's. IN part, the changed environment is a result of the 1970's, when skyrocketing inflation forced businesses to build and expand as if the shortages and the pressures on prices would never end.
''In the 70's, there was this idea that we were going to run out of everything. The Club of Rome was saying there was going to be mass starvation,'' said Thomas G. Moore, a member of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisors. Investors then went overboard, he contends: ''When the worldwide inflation stopped, people found themselves with a lot more capacity than was warranted by the market.''
In the United States, that realization came slowly. It took the effects of the strong dollar, which were felt initially in surging imports last year, and the slowing of economic growth to less than 4 percent in the first three quarters of this year from 1984's booming 6.8 percent to drive home the fact that excess production had become a serious problem.
Nowhere is it more serious than in the third world. As the glut forces down prices, those debt-strapped nations continue to pump out their products anyway, hoping to raise the same income with more output.
South Korea and Taiwan are heavily into color television manufacturing. Petrochemical plants and refineries dot Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries. China has expanded its textile industry. Yugoslavia is preparing to export cars. Argentina has doubled its corn and wheat acreage. Brazilian shoes have become ubiquitous in North America, and its growing steel output is another constant American worry.
The overcapacity, however, is most acute in raw materials. In some countries production has accelerated to compensate for the 15 percent drop in metals prices during the last year and to finance the importation of necessities. Copper prices, for example, have plunged from $1.50 a pound in 1980 to about 62 cents a pound now. In that period Chile, a major producer, has increased its production by more than 80 percent .
''Everybody felt that the growth rate of metals would continue and they went searching the continents for new mines,'' says David Williamson, a metals analyst in the London office of Shearson Lehman Brothers. ''So all this new production came on stream in 1981 and walked right into a recession. Massive inventories developed,'' he continued. ''But once you're committed to opening up new mines and smelters that cost billions, you have to continue to operate them even if there's a surplus.'' In the United States, where debt-bloated balance sheets have made businesses unusually vulnerable to gluts, many companies have begun to grapple with the problem of overabundance. The Ogden Corporation, following a pattern that is becoming increasingly familiar, sold its collection of industrial operations - including its Avondale shipyard, an aluminum smelter, and a rail car assembler - to managers in a leveraged buy-out. It has redeployed its assets into businesses that turn solid municipal waste into energy and that provide management and maintenance services for large buildings like New York City's new convention center.
''We made up in our minds several years ago that we wanted to be a total services company,'' because the obstacles to becoming competitive in manufacturing were so forbidding says Ogden's Mr. Ablon.
Companies that remain in manufacturing are having to cut prices to move their products. Chrysler and American Motors are again offering rebates ranging from $400 to $1,000 a car. General Motors renewed its offer of cut-rate financing after imports walked away with nearly one-third of the automobile market in November.
Similar price cutting is raging in other industries. The airline industry - with far more seats than travelers are willing to pay full fare for - is in the midst of a nasty price war that may get worse before it gets better because of all the new planes and seating capacity set to join the fleets in coming months.
Delta Airlines, whose profits have been declining recently, will make substantial additions to its fleet next year, despite the heated fare competition. ''Growth is necessary to protect your traffic base. Our competitors are all growing and adding new spokes and new hubs,'' said Robert W. Coggin, a Delta marketing executive. ''If everyone else is growing, the status quo is not acceptable.''
Not all the companies involved in price wars have the staying power of Delta and the automobile companies. Many are top heavy with debt. American corporations owe debts totalling $1.56 billion with annual real increases of 8.6 percent in the last two years.
Economists worry that many of the most debt-strapped companies will end up in bankruptcy after an extended period of weak profits. ''Excess debt creation has many of the characteristics of intoxication,'' warned Mr. Greenspan. ''The early stages are heady and expansionary. But the hangover is inevitable and unpleasant.''
He is worried that massive failures of marginal companies and farms will create widespread financial hardships that are ''no longer politcally acceptable.'' Such a crisis would coax the government into a series of case-by-case bailouts that may be insignificant in themselves but would be inflationary in the aggregate, he says.
Not all of business is waiting for a bailout, though. A phenomenal wave of cost-cutting is washing across corporate America. Companies are paring down and writing off marginal assets as never before. Amerada Hess announced last week that it would take a $430 million after-tax write-off to squeeze its refining, marketing and tanker operations down to more appropriate sizes.
Santa Fe Industries has put 650,000 acres of timberland in Texas and Louisiana up for sale in a deal that would include processing plants for plywood and particle boards. The markets for both products have been battered by imports from Canada and the weakness in homebuilding.
Delta Airlines is putting an increasing number of employees on part-time schedules to maintain flexibility and control over labor costs. Indeed, labor experts contend that the use of part-time labor, especially in unskilled jobs, represents one of the megatrends of the 1980's. Consequently, they say, the seven percent unemployment rate understates the glut of available labor.
Sohio is cutting back on its workforce also, taking a $1.15 billion after-tax charge to slim down its copper mining operation and to finance the early retirement of part of its work force.
General Electric's chief, John F. Welch, is saying he wants to move to a ''leaner, flatter'' structure to deal effectively with ''an intensified competitive world, a slower growth world.'' He is eliminating an entire layer of senior management and increasing the duties of other top executives. BUT corporate America's most frequent response to the glut problem has been to appeal for protection. American car manufacturers, steel makers and textile spinners all have applied for - and received - some protection in the last five years. And there seems to be no end to the pleas for relief. Petitions to Washington for import relief are up 22 percent this year, according to International Trade Commission figures. In the 1980-84 period, they increased 44 percent.
Last week, the Commerce Department, in a preliminary finding, ruled that Japanese semi-conductors, the silicon circuits used in computers and other electronic products, had been dumped in the United States at unfair prices. The United States also ended an imbroglio with the European Community over imported steel. The Government banned European steel for a week while quotas for 1986 were negotiated.
But the Reagan Administration has generally opposed protectionism as an adequate response to the glutted world. For several years, government policy-makers, here and abroad, have been in a quandary, fearing that if they stimulated growth to soak up the gluts, they would set off another price spiral. So far, there has been little agreement on policy prescriptions and the steps to reduce the gluts have been tentative so far.
But many economists saw September's meeting in New York of the finance ministers of France, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States as a first step toward a coordinated approach. The ministers agreed to work in concert, intervening in foreign markets to drive down the value of the dollar. A weaker dollar, theoretically, would lead to lower interest rates in the United States and throughout the world, sparking more economic activity and eating into the gluts.
That agreement was followed in October by a promise by the industrial nations to lend billions of dollars more to the developing nations to promote economic growth, in return for concessions that would increase the role of market forces in their economies. But many economists say both moves will not amount to much unless the industrial powers shake off their own fears of growth and inflation.
The debate among economists in the United States illustrates why settling on a policy that addresses the glut will not be an easy task. In fact, there is no unanimity on whether any action is even desirable.
''We've cut taxes. We've had a boom. I don't know what else we can do,'' said Mr. Moore, the Adminstration's advisor. ''There are problems for some firms and some individuals. But from the point of view of society as a whole, if you try to prop up these prices, it's going to hurt. We're fortunate in a sense because these gluts are keeping prices under control.''
The argument rages along ideological grounds, with more liberal economists generally calling for aggressively lowering interest rates to stimulate consumer demand and investment, and to lower the cost of servicing the deficit.
''We're like a Latin American country. We're getting into a situation where borrowing to pay the interest on the deficit is causing the deficit,'' said Kenneth Arrow, a Stanford economist. He would bring interest rates down by tightening fiscal policy - cutting defense, water resources programs and farm subsidies as well as raising taxes.
Proponents of leaving American government policy as it now stands point to the forced dieting of bloated companies as yet another benefit of slow growth and gluts. That, along with an inflation rate of less than 3 percent this year, is the main argument for keeping things as they are.
But pro-growth forces remain unconvinced. ''There's never been any doubt that with enough excess capacity you could lick inflation,'' said Mr. Denison, ''But that way you waste a lot of resources and create a lot of misery among people who are unemployed.''

Abstract: American jobs, so the argument goes, are thereby being ''exported'' to Far East and other low-cost producers whose products are pouring in at unprecedented rates that not only threaten United States prosperity but, combined with poor sales of American goods overseas, undermine the nation's very ability to survive in a ferociously competitive world. While the strong dollar has diverted American purchasing power to foreign products and may thus appear at first glance to penalize domestic production and jobs, that is far from the whole story, asserts Alan Greenspan, a New York economist and sometime adviser to Republican politicians. ''The heavy demand for United States dollars has also left interest rates lower than they otherwise would have been and has clearly contributed to a lower rate of inflation,'' Mr. Greenspan told Congress earlier this year. ''These in turn have reduced the sense of instability and risk associated with capital investment. It is thus unclear on balance how much of a job loss, if any, the strong dollar has produced.'' Responding to assertions by some that the strong dollar may have cost the economy as many as two million jobs over the last five years, Mr. [Henry C. Wallich] said that ''it is difficult to conclude that overall United States employment and output have been unduly restrained'' by the trade deficit and the rising dollar. He added, ''In the absence of the policies that have led to the capital inflow and the strong dollar, while losses of jobs from these sources would have been less, so probably would have been the creation of new jobs.''

Full text: IN the din of protectionist special pleading by such battered industries as shoes, steel and apparel, many people have come to believe that the nation's economic policies have caused a wholesale loss of American jobs.
The basic mechanism is this: The budget deficit drives up interest rates, high interest rates raise the international value of the dollar and this in turn produces a trade deficit that could reach another record this year of $150 billion.
American jobs, so the argument goes, are thereby being ''exported'' to Far East and other low-cost producers whose products are pouring in at unprecedented rates that not only threaten United States prosperity but, combined with poor sales of American goods overseas, undermine the nation's very ability to survive in a ferociously competitive world.
In this kind of atmosphere, it is perhaps not surprising that members of Congress have produced more than 300 bills that in one way or another offer protection for some segment of American industry. But while it is true that some jobs have been lost -overseas shoe producers now take a whopping 80 percent of the United States market, up from 50 percent five years ago - it is important not to mistake the admitted hardship of an often clamorous few for a national catastrophe.
In fact, at least in employment terms, it can be argued that the twin trade and budget deficits result in more jobs for Americans, not fewer.
First of all, while the strong dollar has undoubtedly resulted in lost sales of American agricultural and other products, exports have done far better than is generally believed. They actually rose last year by 8.7 percent from the level of 1983.
But what about imports, which climbed 26.4 percent last year? Doesn't the fact that imports rose three times as much as exports prove that there was an overall American job loss? In a word, no.
Although there is as yet no convincing data either way - and maybe never will be - one can plausibly argue that, in the aggregate, there has been no loss at all. For this, one does not even need to rely on official labor market data, which last week showed that the nation's unemployment rate fell in August to 6.9 percent, the lowest in more than five years, while employment was rising to a new record. This result is consistent with the thesis, but for various reasons, including possible seasonal aberrations, not in itself persuasive.
The main reasons for thinking the country might even be gaining jobs rather than losing them from the deficits begin to emerge when one looks at the overall dynamics of what happens in the real world when trade expands. For example, large numbers of workers are needed to unload ships carrying imported products and to transport, package, distribute, sell and service these goods. There is no denying that this adds to employment, though nobody knows by how much.
Then there is the inflation-suppressing effect of imported goods, with American consumers benefiting not only from lower foreign prices but from the fact that this competition prevents domestic companies producing such goods from raising their prices. Lower inflation implies a lowering of interest rates, which tends to spur economic growth.
While the strong dollar has diverted American purchasing power to foreign products and may thus appear at first glance to penalize domestic production and jobs, that is far from the whole story, asserts Alan Greenspan, a New York economist and sometime adviser to Republican politicians. ''The heavy demand for United States dollars has also left interest rates lower than they otherwise would have been and has clearly contributed to a lower rate of inflation,'' Mr. Greenspan told Congress earlier this year. ''These in turn have reduced the sense of instability and risk associated with capital investment. It is thus unclear on balance how much of a job loss, if any, the strong dollar has produced.''
And Mr. Greenspan has some distinguished, nonpartisan company in Henry C. Wallich, a member of the Federal Reserve Board.
Responding to assertions by some that the strong dollar may have cost the economy as many as two million jobs over the last five years, Mr. Wallich said that ''it is difficult to conclude that overall United States employment and output have been unduly restrained'' by the trade deficit and the rising dollar. He added, ''In the absence of the policies that have led to the capital inflow and the strong dollar, while losses of jobs from these sources would have been less, so probably would have been the creation of new jobs.''
Job growth, in fact, has been little short of spectacular. Employment now stands at 108.9 million, eight million more than in 1980. All of Western Europe showed practically no growth at all during this period. To be sure, employment in goods-producing industries, which are usually thought most affected by foreign competition, has fallen as a percentage of total employment. Employment elsewhere, however, has expanded more.
The main message in this for Congress is that protectionism will not save jobs, except in the most parochial and shortsighted terms. The best jobs bill would be to cut the Federal budget.

GROWTH AND INFLATION DEBATED

Abstract: Mr. [Lawrence A. Kudlow] warned that if Administation officials put pressure on the Fed into compromising its anti-inflation policy, the result would be higher rates in the future. ''A dose of restraint by the Fed in the first half of this year will keep inflationary expectations low and open the door to lower interest rates in the second half,'' he said. ''But a dose of ease in the first half will lead to significantly higher interest rates in the second half,'' Mr. Kudlow said. Too much stimulation early this year will bring higher rates as credit demands rise and investors anticipate an upturn in inflation and a subsequent vigorous Federal Reserve move to tighten policy. Although economists are convinced that inflation is a development that follows from periods of excessive money supply and economic growth, Mr. [Paul A. Volcker] said, the Fed ''has no preconceived notion as to just how rapid'' economic growth can be ''without straining our resources or giving rise to price pressures.'' The Fed's forecast for 1985 of about 3 3/4 percent inflation and the same amount of real growth are not targets which the Fed tries to achieve, Mr. Volcker said.

Full text: One of the thorniest issues facing economists - the relationship between money supply growth, the economy and inflation - is a matter of great debate among policy makers in the Federal Reserve Board and the Reagan Administration, who want both growth and low inflation.
''The fundamental question is how fast can the economy grow without creating pressure for more inflation,'' Dana B. Johnson, an economist at the Northern Trust Company of Chicago, said. ''The Fed is always going to be more inflation-conscious than the body politic, but when the body politic changes, the Fed must make some adjustments,'' he added.
Since 1984 was a year of fast growth without high inflation, Mr. Johnson and other analysts agreed, the Fed has been having a harder time reminding the public and politicians about the dangers of inflation. The Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, is still perceived by investors and economists as a strong inflation fighter, but, in his Congressional testimony last month, he indicated that he is bending a little to accommodate the Reagan Administration's desire for fast economic growth.
Tolerate Some Growth

In past years, for example, the Federal Reserve's commitment to reducing inflation has often included statements about the need to gradually reduce money supply growth year after year. In 1985, however, Mr. Volcker said, the central bank may tolerate money supply growth in the upper part of the 4 percent to 7 percent growth target, up from 5.2 percent growth in 1984.
Mr. Volcker said faster growth could be warranted by a slowdown in velocity, or the rate at which money is turned over. But some analysts worry that faster money supply growth is not consistent with the Fed's objective of gradually reducing inflation and money supply growth.
The rise in 30-year Treasury bond yields to 11.68 percent, from about 11 percent at the end of January, cannot be attributed to fear among investors that faster money supply growth this year will bring more inflation. But the rise in bond yields so far above 11 percent, even though consumer prices have increased at a rate of 4 percent or less for the last three years, is a sign that many investors are still worried that inflation will rise again.
Further Signs

Another sign of the Fed's willingness to adjust its anti-inflationary monetary policy statements was the special attachment to Mr. Volcker's Congressional testimony titled ''Targeting Real Growth.''
Although economists are convinced that inflation is a development that follows from periods of excessive money supply and economic growth, Mr. Volcker said, the Fed ''has no preconceived notion as to just how rapid'' economic growth can be ''without straining our resources or giving rise to price pressures.'' The Fed's forecast for 1985 of about 3 3/4 percent inflation and the same amount of real growth are not targets which the Fed tries to achieve, Mr. Volcker said.
''The commentary about real growth is a sign of the vitriolic debate between the Fed on one side and the White House and Treasury on the other,'' Lawrence A. Kudlow, president of Lawrence Kudlow Associates, said. ''The White House accused Volcker of undermining their fast growth policies by tightening in 1984. Now, Volcker is trying to allay their fears by saying that the Fed does not base its policy on targets for economic growth.''
Economic Growth

While the Fed may say it does not target economic growth, many economists are convinced that the Fed does play close attention to the rate of economic growth. When the Fed reacts to excessive economic growth it may say its actions are a response to excessive growth in money supply or credit, they said.
''I think that intuitively the Fed has some notion of what is too fast or too slow,'' Thomas Thomson, chief economist at Crocker National Bank, said. While Federal Reserve Governors Preston Martin and Martha Seger have suggested that real growth of 5 percent may be sustainable, Mr. Thomson said, ''I think the sustainable non-inflationary growth rate is considerably less,'' or about 3 percent.
Mr. Kudlow warned that if Administation officials put pressure on the Fed into compromising its anti-inflation policy, the result would be higher rates in the future. ''A dose of restraint by the Fed in the first half of this year will keep inflationary expectations low and open the door to lower interest rates in the second half,'' he said. ''But a dose of ease in the first half will lead to significantly higher interest rates in the second half,'' Mr. Kudlow said. Too much stimulation early this year will bring higher rates as credit demands rise and investors anticipate an upturn in inflation and a subsequent vigorous Federal Reserve move to tighten policy.

Abstract: The record level to which the dollar has risen is ''unsustainable'' and potentially ''detrimental'' to the United States and the rest of the world, the International Monetary Fund said today in its annual report. The I.M.F. also noted that, largely following patterns set by the United States, the average of short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries rose to 9 3/4 percent in the first half of 1984. The rates had fallen to 9 1/4 percent in the first half of 1983, from a peak of some 15 percent during 1981. ''The recent rise in interest rates,'' the report said, ''has been strongest and most persistent in the United States, where both short-term and long-term yields in the spring of 1984 reached levels roughly two percentage points higher than in the early months of 1983.''

Full text: The record level to which the dollar has risen is ''unsustainable'' and potentially ''detrimental'' to the United States and the rest of the world, the International Monetary Fund said today in its annual report.
The report appeared to presage another spirited debate about the dollar and Washington's policies when the fund's 147 member countries meet here later this month. The joint annual meeting of the fund and the World Bank starts Sept. 24.
The report also repeated earlier I.M.F. criticism of the large United States budget deficit, but went a step further by warning of some of the perils of the high dollar.
The 203-page report noted that at around midyear, when the study was being drafted, the dollar had risen to about 15 percent above its average value for the period 1973 to 1982 in relation to the Japanese yen and the British pound. It was up 40 percent over the West German mark and nearly 50 percent over the French franc.
In recent days the dollar has reached record levels against the pound, the franc and the Italian lira and an 11 1/2-year high against the mark.
Impact of the Deficit
The I.M.F. document, whose key passages are negotiated by governments and represent a consensus of the membership, said the United States budget deficit, by intensifying competition for savings, contributes to high interest rates, which in turn increases the value of the dollar.
The Reagan Administration does not endorse this causal relationship. It argues that the dollar's popularity is spurred by low inflation, high growth of the American economy and profitability of American investments.
The report cited the dollar's strength as ''an important factor'' contributing to the deterioration in the American trade accounts - to an estimated $130 billion merchandise trade deficit this year.
The I.M.F. study said the trade deficit ''could have disquieting implications for the international allocation of world private saving,'' by drawing in savings to the United States from the rest of the world to finance the deficit.
Easing of Debt Crisis
At the same time, the international agency, which has more than $30 billion of short-term credits outstanding to more than 40 countries, said that the trade deficit had contributed to an easing of the world debt crisis. The huge American appetite for imports has spurred economic activity abroad and has especially helped many third world countries improve their cash position and pay their debts, the I.M.F. report notes.
The I.M.F. also noted that, largely following patterns set by the United States, the average of short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries rose to 9 3/4 percent in the first half of 1984. The rates had fallen to 9 1/4 percent in the first half of 1983, from a peak of some 15 percent during 1981. ''The recent rise in interest rates,'' the report said, ''has been strongest and most persistent in the United States, where both short-term and long-term yields in the spring of 1984 reached levels roughly two percentage points higher than in the early months of 1983.''

LEFTISTS POSE LITTLE THREAT TO BOLIVIA'S GOVERNMENT

Abstract: Successive American administrations continued to act as if Bolivia were indeed vulnerable. The United States built up the weak military with training and materiel. From 1972 to 1976, it sent $47 million of military aid and outfitted five army regiments, bolstering an institution that was adding to the record of coups and countercoups and which eventually assumed a major role in the international narcotics traffic. Some Bolivian officers were even cited as criminals in Miami. Bolivia thus joined the list of Latin countries where the United States has been embarrassed by officers it chose as political allies. In Guatemala, Chile and Argentina, among other places, American support in the 1960's helped promote military regimes that rejected United States influence in the 1970's. In Bolivia's case, Washington suspended all military and most civilian aid in 1980 and called home its Ambassador. Confidence was restored in 1982 when Hernan Siles Zuazo became the first freely elected President in 19 years. Since then, Bolivia has received close to $230 million, including $7 million for the military and $5 million for drug enforcement, the linchpin of American policy. Last week, after long delay, the Government sent police and military forces into four cocaine-producing provinces. Heritage of Dictatorship The new democratic Government has been preoccupied with formidable obstacles. In the past year, it had to cope with near-bankruptcy, 1,000 percent inflation, general strikes, food riots, drought, floods, three coup plots and the kidnapping.

Full text: Almost daily, the United States Embassy here hears rumors predicting that Bolivia is about to fall into the hands of international communism. Alarm is spread by local politicians and businessmen and repeated by Latin American military envoys who find the current experiment in civilian democracy disturbing. Echoing these views, the daily newspaper El Diario complained recently that the United States was ''looking on with indifference'' while ''the communists are advancing as much as the drug traffickers.''
But American diplomats say they have found no substance to reports that scores of Libyans, Cubans, Nicaraguans and other unfriendly folk are preparing revolution. On June 30, the American Ambassador, Edwin Corr, even played a key role in blocking a military coup. Dissident army officers and narcotics policemen kidnapped the President, claiming they wanted to ''clean out the Communists.''
The Reagan Administration finds itself in an unusual role: Despite its strong commitment to fighting communism, in Bolivia it is supporting a left-of-center Government that includes two Communist Ministers and other officials who have been political exiles in Cuba and Eastern Europe. Washington apparently sees the elected Government as its main hope of combating Bolivia's large-scale cocaine trafficking. During previous regimes, ''top military leaders were up to their ears in the drug trade,'' a United States diplomat said, ''and several drug rings had protection from the armed forces.'' The power that enabled the military to become involved in narcotics was, to a good measure, an unintended result of United States policies. When Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara decided that Bolivia was ripe for a Cuban-style revolution, he drew Washington's attention to this poor region in the Andes. Before he was killed here in 1967, Mr. Guevara learned that he was wrong.
But successive American administrations continued to act as if Bolivia were indeed vulnerable. The United States built up the weak military with training and materiel. From 1972 to 1976, it sent $47 million of military aid and outfitted five army regiments, bolstering an institution that was adding to the record of coups and countercoups and which eventually assumed a major role in the international narcotics traffic. Some Bolivian officers were even cited as criminals in Miami. Bolivia thus joined the list of Latin countries where the United States has been embarrassed by officers it chose as political allies. In Guatemala, Chile and Argentina, among other places, American support in the 1960's helped promote military regimes that rejected United States influence in the 1970's. In Bolivia's case, Washington suspended all military and most civilian aid in 1980 and called home its Ambassador.

Since then, Bolivia has received close to $230 million, including $7 million for the military and $5 million for drug enforcement, the linchpin of American policy. Last week, after long delay, the Government sent police and military forces into four cocaine-producing provinces. Heritage of Dictatorship The new democratic Government has been preoccupied with formidable obstacles. In the past year, it had to cope with near-bankruptcy, 1,000 percent inflation, general strikes, food riots, drought, floods, three coup plots and the kidnapping. Years of dictatorship prevented new leadership from developing. The three most important civilians, now in their 70's, were already leaders in the 1952 revolution. The three, the President, labor leader Juan Lechin and opposition leader Victor Paz Estenssoro have since become enemies. President Siles once confided that he allied himself with the Communists to use them against Mr. Lechin, who has already ordered four general strikes against Mr. Siles this year, including one just four days after the President's abduction. The ruling coalition is also weakened by infighting among its four left-of-center parties and other leftists. American diplomats say there is no contradiction in supporting the Siles Government. ''There are a lot of people out of step here with the Reagan Administration,'' one said, ''but some act as a moderating influence on the President. We would gain nothing by pressing against the Communists here.'' It may be too early to say, but Washington's policy in Bolivia suggests that lessons may have been drawn from Central America, where repression of leftist opponents of the establishment ignited a violent guerrilla movement.

Abstract: Versailles, 1982 - Monetary stability and the Reagan Adminstration's call for economic sanctions against the Soviet Union were the two leading issues. The United States faced criticism about large budget deficits and relatively high interest rates. A study of the need for government intervention in currency markets was initiated, but the conferees later disagreed over who was to blame for continuing monetary disorder. Williamsburg, Va., 1983 - President [Reagan] managed to win a show of political solidarity on nuclear issues, but on key economic issues only broad goals, rather than specific actions, were formulated. The industrialized nations agreed to maintain economic recovery, to reduce inflation, interest rates and unemployment, and to roll back protectionism, but left without concrete policies. Despite their pledges, interest rates, especially in the United States, have risen substantially and the average unemployment rose last year to 8.3 percent, compared with 8 percent in 1982.

Full text: Rambouillet, France, 1975 - At this first gathering, which came during one of the worst business slumps since the end of World War II, participants declined to return to fixed exchange rates, but agreed to counteract disorderly market conditions. Although the need for economic cooperation was acknowledged, there was sharp division over individual actions, which generated some bitter debate.
Dorado Beach, P.R., 1976 - Inflation was the main issue, with a prominent theme the need to increase jobs without stimulating inflation. Even so, unemployment rose to 15 million over the next 12 months. There was also an agreement to consider a multinational credit facility to help developing nations.
London, 1977 - The focus was on recovery and the conferees committed themselves to a 5 percent growth rate for the year - a goal that West Germany and Japan failed to meet. Promises for a comprehensive energy program also went unfulfilled.
Bonn, 1978 - The Europeans were critical of the weak American dollar, of high inflation in the United States and of what was perceived as the apparent lack of an energy policy in Washington. A clearly articulated, diverse set of goals was formulated for each country. West Germany, Canada and France agreed to economic stimulation; the United States to reduced dependence on foreign oil; Britain and Italy to reduced inflation, and Japan to a cut in exports.
Tokyo, 1979 - Energy issues dominated the agenda when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a 50 percent increase in oil prices the day before the meeting. Participants agreed to place limits on oil imports, and the United States said it would let domestic oil prices rise to international levels to induce energy conservation. Interest in the oil market faded, however, as supplies increased.
Venice, 1980 - Energy remained the main issue, with the industrialized nations agreeing to develop alternate sources. Inflation was also called a priority. The meeting was plagued by political tension, with the conferees sharply divided over relations with the Soviet Union after the invasion of Afghanistan.
Ottawa, 1981 - This meeting was the first summit experience for many of the participating heads of government, including President Reagan, who sought to keep a relatively low profile. The nations agreed to substantive North-South discussions, but fell out over the level of aid to the less developed nations.
Versailles, 1982 - Monetary stability and the Reagan Adminstration's call for economic sanctions against the Soviet Union were the two leading issues. The United States faced criticism about large budget deficits and relatively high interest rates. A study of the need for government intervention in currency markets was initiated, but the conferees later disagreed over who was to blame for continuing monetary disorder.

Abstract: At Williamsburg the heads of state declared, ''We renew our commitment to reduce structural budget deficits, in particular, by limiting the growth of expenditures.'' The budget deficits of the summit countries are little changed from their levels of a year ago, but most of the deficits are largely cyclical - made up mostly of government spending (partly for unemployment benefits) to tide them through the recession. Others, however, see a discouraging trend in support of the ''fair trade'' alternative to free trade. To many Europeans, said Sven W. Arndt, international economist at the American Enterprise Institute, fair trade means protecting a country's share of the world export market. To Americans, he said, it means forcing other countries to remove government subsidies and other aid to exporting industries. The leaders also promised ''closer consultations on policies affecting exchange markets,'' and since Williamsburg there has been evidence of closer cooperation among monetary authorities of the seven countries.

Full text: Here, according to economists, is how seven major industrial democracies performed in trying to fulfill the commitments they made at their Williamsburg, Va., economic summit conference, held May 28-30, 1983:
Recovery
Last year the leaders of the United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada pledged themselves to economic growth, a painless commitment because recovery was well under way in the United States and stirring elsewhere.
The economies of the seven summit countries declined by an average of two-tenths of 1 percent in 1982, then grew 2.5 percent in 1983 and are expected to grow even faster, about 4.5 percent, this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The overall figures, however, camouflage weaknesses in major countries such as France and Italy and throughout Latin America.
Partly because of protectionism and imbalances in the recovery, says Howard J. Howe, an international economist at Wharton Econometrics, the growth of both world trade and the overall world economy so far lags the pace of other recent recoveries.
Economists attribute much of this year's expansion to the power of the United States economy, especially strong American consumer demand and the high- valued dollar.
Budget Deficits
At Williamsburg the heads of state declared, ''We renew our commitment to reduce structural budget deficits, in particular, by limiting the growth of expenditures.'' The budget deficits of the summit countries are little changed from their levels of a year ago, but most of the deficits are largely cyclical - made up mostly of government spending (partly for unemployment benefits) to tide them through the recession.
With the American economy completely recovered from the last recession, however, most of its deficit is structural, the result of increases in Federal spending (mostly for the military and interest payments on the national debt) and decreases in the growth of government revenues, the consequence of three years of individual and business tax reductions.
As a percentage of the gross national product, the American deficit last year was 5.4 percent, only slightly higher than those of the six other countries, but it has grown far faster than the others. In addition, the United States has a lower national savings rate than those of all summit countries but Italy, which means that the country is left with proportionately less to finance the deficit and to invest in industry.
Protection
The summit leaders pledged themselves to reverse the spread of protectionism as the world recovery grew. But all the countries continue to maintain a wide variety of restraints on imports and to provide numerous incentives for their exporters. The United States, which some economists credit with having adhered to this commitment better than many of the other nations, nevertheless decided to curb imports of Japanese automobiles for a fourth year and to stiffen restraints on imports of textiles and steel.
The United States realized some success in efforts to encourage Japan to relax its barriers to American goods. ''While proceeding with its usual glacial slowness, Japan has nevertheless made some progress,'' said Richard W. Roberts, president of the National Foreign Trade Council in New York, an association of export-oriented American companies.
Others, however, see a discouraging trend in support of the ''fair trade'' alternative to free trade. To many Europeans, said Sven W. Arndt, international economist at the American Enterprise Institute, fair trade means protecting a country's share of the world export market. To Americans, he said, it means forcing other countries to remove government subsidies and other aid to exporting industries.
And to many countries, fair trade means protecting young, fragile industries from foreign competition until they get established.
Unemployment For the seven countries, the unemployment rate averaged less than 4 percent from the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, according to the I.M.F., and the American rate was usually the highest. At Williamsburg the leaders pledged to reduce unemployment, but the average rose last year, to 8.3 percent from 1982's 8 percent. Despite the world recovery, forecasts show the average sliding this year to only 7.7 percent, the present level in the United States.
The average would be closer to 10 percent were it not for Japan's exceptionally low rate of 2.6 percent last year. Europe has been far less successful than the United States and Japan in fostering new, often technology-based, industries to provide jobs for workers displaced by fading, older industries.
Interest Rates
The Williamsburg communique sought lower rates, but American interest rates, in particular, have risen substantially since then. Now, for the first time in 15 years, they are higher than British interest rates. The prime rate of American banks has risen to 12.5 percent from 10.5 percent; the equivalent British rate is now 10 percent.
More sensitive rates on three-month certificates of deposit show a similar trend, according to Citicorp Information Services. The average American rate for the second quarter climbed to 11 percent from 8.8 percent. The rates have declined in Japan, Britain, France and Italy. Rates on German certificates have risen, but to only 6 percent from 5.4 percent.
Inflation
Average annual price increases for the seven countries were only 4.7 percent last year, 2 full percentage points below the rate in 1982. Britain, with inflation of 20 percent in 1980, recorded a rate last year of just 5.1 percent. A broad measure of inflation, the G.N.P. deflator, showed an average inflation rate in the United States last year of 4.1 percent, less than half the level of 1980.
The European countries brought inflation down partly by imposing severe restraints on the growth of government spending and partly by curbing the growth of their money supplies. In the United States, government spending rose, but other forces - such as the Federal Reserve Board's tight monetary policy and the strong dollar - helped tame inflation.
Currencies
The summit countries promised ''greater stability of exchange rates.'' By various estimates, the American dollar remains 20 percent to 30 percent overvalued, but the volatile activity in foreign-exchange rates has subsided a bit over the past year, economists say. European currencies, particularly, are far better synchronized now than a year ago.
The leaders also promised ''closer consultations on policies affecting exchange markets,'' and since Williamsburg there has been evidence of closer cooperation among monetary authorities of the seven countries.
The United States, which for years had practiced a free-market policy of ''benign neglect'' of turbulence in the currency markets has modified that position over the past year.
Third World
After the Williamsburg conference, the Reagan Administration won a difficult struggle in Congress to increase the American contribution toward a general increase in the money that the International Monetary Fund uses to help developing countries of the third world manage their debts.
The growth of the world economy, with the accompanying growth in trade, expanded markets in the West for the developing countries. For example, Brazil, the biggest of the debtor countries, increased its exports 24 percent from the first quarter of 1983 to the first quarter of 1984.
But with the rise in American interest rates, to which the debtor countries' payments are tied, the foreign debts of the developing countries that are not oil producers grew from $612 billion in 1982 to $669 billion in 1993. With this year's interest rate increases, economists say, the debts now total about $700 billion.

AN INTERVIEW WITH REUBIN ASKEW, EX-GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA

Abstract: A. Well, I think that for all the reasons I've set forth plus others, I think it's a very critical problem. I'm not one of those that believes the structural aspect of it is a myth. I believe it's real. Which means that the deficits are not self-correcting. Even with a substantial recovery we're not going to clear the deficits. So it's going to require strategy. A twofold strategy of both increasing revenue or preventing the loss of revenue now projected to be lost, and in addition, some reductions of spending. We've made proposals knowing full well that the Soviet Union wouldn't accept them. They've made proposals knowing we wouldn't accept them. I think one of the first things that you would want to consider, even though technically it would have to be worked out carefully, is to go in and combine both the Start talks and the I.N.F. talks because you reach a point where, with the Soviet Union, it's of little consolation where they can be reached with intermediate missiles and the long-range missiles. They're both missiles. So, it's not going to be just enough to try to understand the world of the 1980's, which I do, because I've been out negotiating for this country during the '80's as the chief trade negotiator. I know the country's got to adjust to the change in the nature of its competition. That's the big challenge facing this country economically. It has to live within its means. It can do that. It's just that there have to be national goals that engage the American people, the sense of fairness that they understand, feel a part of, plans and visions for the country and how you go about doing it, it's going to be free enough to do it.

Full text: Following are key questions and answers from an interview with Reubin Askew by William E. Farrell:
ASKEW. I think the most important problem, domestically, is getting control of the deficits, because the implications of not controlling the deficits are staggering. There's a structural aspect to these deficits that will continue to enlarge, and which will make difficult extended economic recovery, will contribute toward higher real interest rates in real terms. And will have its impact subsequently upon the housing industry, which will be critically important for the recovery of the country.
Now those deficits also have a very serious impact upon our external economic relations. As long as the deficits stay high and those interest rates in real terms stay high we're going to continue to see dollars coming in, capital coming into this country, seeking not only a profit from the yield, but this also being the safest state in the world for the investment of private capital. Now what this is going to do, it's going to keep the dollar very strong, it's going to make it difficult for us to be as competitive as we could otherwise be, based on price and quality, because it just makes our goods more expensive and makes our competitor's weaker currencies cheaper.
And then so much of the other countries, the industrialized democracies, losing that capital because of the United States will also impede their own recovery. And then the difficulty of the non-oil-producing third world nations to pay for their oil bill, because if their currencies get weaker they have to pay for those oil bills in dollars. It becomes critically important in terms of their own recovery. And that makes difficult their recovery and the more difficulty they have the less ability they have to service even the interest level on the debt service. Against the Grain on Trade
A. As far as the United States is concerned on the question of trade, I am going against the grain of the others, because I think it's critically important for our country to have policies that not only vigorously fight unfair trade practices, but that also positively work toward keeping our markets open. Otherwise we're going to find ourselves trying to insulate ourselves from areas where we're not competitive, and then in many instances retarding our own movement toward competitiveness. But then in addition we'll find markets closed to us overseas as a result of closing ours, and they'll be closed to us in areas where we are the most competitive.
Agriculture, for instance, will be the first victim of our turning inward. Of course we've got to be talking more about expanding exports abroad in nonagricultural as well as agricultural items where certainly we know that immediately now we're very competitive in those areas.
So all of these are problems that the solution to which at times is going to be elusive, but we know the key ingredients that triggers all of them is combating the deficits. How to Reduce the Deficit
A. Well, I think that for all the reasons I've set forth plus others, I think it's a very critical problem. I'm not one of those that believes the structural aspect of it is a myth. I believe it's real. Which means that the deficits are not self-correcting. Even with a substantial recovery we're not going to clear the deficits. So it's going to require strategy. A twofold strategy of both increasing revenue or preventing the loss of revenue now projected to be lost, and in addition, some reductions of spending.
And on the tax side, obviously I was against it from the very beginning because I don't believe that we were calculated to really see the economic spending list that was supposed to come as a result of it. It was supposed to produce this big pool of savings, and Americans are saving less now then they were the year Ronald Reagan became President. We were supposed to have substantial investment. That's not taking place. And the jobs aren't taking place to the extent that was envisioned. So the justification for the big cut simply hasn't transpired, and yet there's also been substantial loss of that to the Treasury.
So we're going to have to take some action on the top side. I doubt seriously, while I have been willing to talk about reinstating some of the tax cuts, I don't think, frankly, that it's going to happen. I believe also that it's that the tax has lost some of its progressive nature. I think that the corporate income tax, the changes have substantially reduced its overall contribution. But what I believe is feasible: first of all, I would support postponing of indexing of income tax brackets. He Explains Indexing
A. In 1985, we're going into a law that would say that when inflation goes up, your income tax brackets are adjusted commensurately downward. Hypothetically if you have a 6 percent inflation factor, the income tax bracket should come down 6 percent.
What I am suggesting is that it should be deferring this while they have a structural aspect of the deficit so at least they can get in it to reduce the deficit. However, because I believe that there is substantial validity in having the index in income bracket, I'm generally supportive of it. But what I'd like to see us do is I'd like to defer the first couple of percent of that so that for example instead of adjusting the income tax bracket down 6 percent, we would defer first 2 percent and adjust to only 4, which means you wouldn't have revenue loss that you otherwise envision to lose under the present revenue projections that continue to project an ever increasing amount of deficit. On the other hand, I think you also have to do the thing with the cost of living adjustments and all entitlement programs such as Social Security. Changes in Benefit Programs
A. I would start cutting the defense budget. It is increasing this year some 33 percent while your conventional forces are increasing somewhere around 8.5 percent. I would opt for a smaller figure, particularly on the strategic where so much of the money is located. Figures on Military Cuts
A. Oh, yes. I would not go forward with any further commitments on MX. I would prefer instead an alternative program of upgrading the Minuteman 3 missiles that presently contain the new warheads and put the new guidance system that would go in an MX, you put it on a Minuteman III. So you would have upgraded your Minuteman 3 and the fact that you achieve the same mission as the MX, which would save a significant amount of money and not only that the final deployment dates would be quicker.
I would not go forward with any further B-1's. I would opt more for the expanded use of cruise missiles on B-52's and then the technology on the stealth bomber. I would not continue production of any type of neutron bombs now. We have got to get control of the Defense Department budget.
One of the most serious problems facing the next President is the gap between what is anticipated that we require to achieve the the present missions before the Department of Defense and money in sight to try to fund them. We need to be much tougher on cost overruns; we need to do a better job of procurement. Growth in the Budget
A. As I view the budget, I believe we can do all that's necessary for us at 5 percent growth adjusted to actual inflation. And I must say to you that I would have to be convinced that the 5 percent is necessary and I would be willing to go above it if I was shown that it's necessary now.
And I also feel that we ought to go into a voluntary and affordable program of national service for young people that would seek to eventually take over the annual quota for the volunteer Army and as fast as you could possibly effect it.
A. I'm talking about voluntary national service for men and women with a military and a nonmilitary program of national service. But I'm speaking now principally on the military side of it because I believe that we're looking at spending too much money on the entry level for the volunteer Army in order to compete with private enterprise. We're getting the entry level now because of the economic downturn. Presently our problem is retention. But entry level also will become a problem as economic opportunities improve. And rather than continue to keep escalating the level of the entry, we need to start projecting a lower level pay and couple that with educational benefits, which is in effect a way of deferred compensation and we can save substantial money from the Department of Defense's budget.
Now on the nonmilitary side, I would be talking about expanding the Peace Corps, expanding the Youth Conservation Corps, existing programs that have proven to be successful. Tensions With Soviet Union
A. I think you have to recognize that our problems with the Soviet Union haven't been by accident. It's a different country, they think differently, it's a different culture, not a democratic country, it's an authoritarian country.
But in spite of all of this, I believe there is enough commonality of interests between our two nations to seek affirmatively more ways in which we can get along, and to be looking for ways in which to locate the commonality of interest to, hopefully, try to reduce the tensions so that the other efforts that we make would, frankly, seem less necessary.
The excessive rhetoric of the President, I think is a good example. I think it's just unnecessary. I think his excessive rhetoric has been counterproductive in terms of any hope of trying to come together on improving our relationships. Now some of the things he's said I completely agree with, but the excess of which he goes to say it, I think really is unnecessary.
As far as arms control, I think it's the paramount issue of our times. And what you have to realize is that no arms control agreement is going to keep the peace. It's lessening of tensions that reduce the likelihood of conflict, and a reduction of tensions also increases the likelihood of some kind of arms control agreement.
And how you reach the arms control agreement, there are different approaches. This President ran on a platform that he was going to immediately come forth with his options; he didn't do that. It became clear that what he was really talking about was to try to build up enough leverage to an arms control race to create the bargaining chips to go in and be able to get what he wanted. Value of Nuclear Freeze
A. Well, what I would do first of all is that I would recognize that the nuclear freeze itself, I think, as a negotiating strategy, will not produce the type of agreement that even his opponents want. The nuclear freeze movement I applaud, because I think without it I don't think the President would have ever gotten off dead center. But I think that we would have to be willing to be more challenging in the proposals we've made and then be more consistent, frankly, in the proposals.
We've made proposals knowing full well that the Soviet Union wouldn't accept them. They've made proposals knowing we wouldn't accept them. I think one of the first things that you would want to consider, even though technically it would have to be worked out carefully, is to go in and combine both the Start talks and the I.N.F. talks because you reach a point where, with the Soviet Union, it's of little consolation where they can be reached with intermediate missiles and the long-range missiles. They're both missiles.
In fact, they have less warning time with the intermediate missile than they do the long-range missile. So you have a lot more bargaining chips on the table. Change in Strategy Noted
Furthermore, something that had not been pointed out much, that the President adopted in that strategy, is that for the first time he's been willing to talk about aggregate destructive capability; that is, talking about the bombers and the missiles at the same time. They've been wanting to only talk about the missiles. Now one thing that that group recommended, and that I fully support, which I think he should have, and that is to put a ceiling on the number of warheads and the total destructive capability of all of our systems together. Just stop them where they are now in terms of capability and number.
Now this isn't freeze in the sense the others are talking about. This would allow modernization from within all during the time that you're reducing the numbers.
What we need to be doing is reducing the number, don't go any higher, try to bring the talks together and at the same time try to get rid of any destabilizing systems and try to reduce the number of destabilizing systems, which is one of my big complaints about the MX. Policies in Middle East
A. I think it's a mistake.
A. That's right. I think, like almost everyone else, I supported the initial United States participation in the multinational peacekeeping force to insure the orderly withdrawal of the P.L.O. from Beirut. We got that accomplished, we had an objective, we left.
We came back because of the exigencies of the moment because of the tragedies in the Palestinian camps.
Once we went back in, in my opinion, the President was incumbent under the War Powers Act to define the policy that then existed. And he didn't do that, and I think the Congress made a serious mistake that they ought to reconsider when they come back, ever extending the time, and I said so at the time. The President should have the pressure within the 60 plus 90 extension, or the 30 days extension to 90 days, to state what our mission is.
Because what is our mission there? View of What Should Be Done
A. What I'm saying is that that we ought phase out our presence in favor of a United Nations peacekeeping force of neutral nations.
See, the United States and the Soviet Union have a stake in the outcome. The British and the French have had interests in that area. Bring in others that will help stabilize the situation militarily but will not be perceived as taking one side or another, as the different factions attempt to get together on some form of power sharing. And that's really what it's about.
But we should not look toward Lebanon in a vacuum. We've still got to look to it in an overall context of Middle East negotiations. We should not be getting drawn into a war with Syria, and that's essentially what we're doing. Nor should we ever have placed Americans, fighting marines that aren't given a chance to be fighting marines, where their only mission there is to keep from getting killed.
Now I suggested way back that they ought to immediately start moving all the people who weren't otherwise on duty immediately off the airport and putting them on the ships and ferrying them back and forth. We may get to a point where you eventually might want to do that.
In other words, we need to be exploring ways to avoid getting drawn into a war, in ways that are more productive toward a reconciliation, as much as can be expected of the Lebanese situation, and understanding, too, it's always going to spill over into the Middle East conflict. Camp David Accords
A. Well, I believe, in retrospect, the President's initiative really was not consistent with Camp David. I know that, in all due respect to President Carter, he said it was, but one of the underlying, I think, understandings at Camp David was we weren't going to try to so impose so many different conditions that we would be perceived as forcing one side or the other as opposed to trying to create the atmosphere that would permit the negotiations between the parties themselves.
I think, in a sense, they have got to try to come to grips with it. But right now, you could be seeing some really basic shifts in the Middle East. You could really be seeing more of a split, you know, within the Arab side because you've always had these differences within a lot of these so-called Moslem nations, some of which, like Iran, that was a Persian nation and not Arabic. View on Central America
A. Well, the President is finally starting to take a tougher stand in El Salvador on supplying arms to that Government. I still don't think he's managed to convince them in terms of trying to reduce the killing by both government, both uniform and nonuniform security forces.
A. In El Salvador for the moment because that's the only place we're really military supplying for the moment. We're doing some things in Honduras that's common interest. But I think that until the El Salvadors realize that we are willing to go so far as to pull all military systems out from them and be prepared to do so, will they make the changes that without which they're not going to get the active support of their own people to really stabilize that government. So that's one situation.
And I believe a lot of the problem comes from without. I believe that the Communist threat is real in Central America. But I also notice it's against a backdrop - a backdrop of poverty, of political repression and economic injustice, you know, and if that area is worth our fighting for, it ought to be worth our spending some time with long-term goals economically.
In the case of Nicaragua, I don't think we should be supporting a mpvement whose purpose is to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua. I think that it will be counterproductive. I don't think we ought to be having 5,000 ground troops in Honduras. Again I think that draws fire. I think however the President was justified in going into Grenada because it was a difficult situation. I think the Americans were in fear. I think that there was anarchy. Possibility on Vice President
A. No. I'm not interested in the Vice Presidency. McGovern offered me that in 1972 along with others before the list grew long. The challenge to me is in the Presidency. So I think the strength of our candidacy has been a record of my willing to take risks over period of 25 years in public service plus that risk, even though risk-taking kept me with public support and that allowed me to do things and I think again the record speaks for itself.
So, it's not going to be just enough to try to understand the world of the 1980's, which I do, because I've been out negotiating for this country during the '80's as the chief trade negotiator. I know the country's got to adjust to the change in the nature of its competition. That's the big challenge facing this country economically. It has to live within its means. It can do that. It's just that there have to be national goals that engage the American people, the sense of fairness that they understand, feel a part of, plans and visions for the country and how you go about doing it, it's going to be free enough to do it.

Abstract: In the United States, the speed and pattern of the current recovery are broadly similar to past recoveries and much faster than elsewhere, Kjell Andersen, acting head of the O.E.C.D.'s Economics and Statistics Department, said at a news conference today. Much of this lopsidedness can be explained by expansionist monetary policy in the United States and a lack of market flexibility in Europe, the O.E.C.D. said. While Britain's economy should grow by about 2.25 percent in 1984 and the German and Italian economies by 2 percent each, the O.E.C.D. forecasts stagnation for France and many smaller European countries. As a result, unemployment will remain unchanged in Britain, at 11.5 percent, while it will rise in West Germany, France and Italy. This weak European performance means the recovery in the non-Communist world as a whole will remain disappointingly slow, the O.E.C.D. says, running at about half the 5 to 7 percent rate typical of similar phases of earlier recoveries. Overall growth in the 24 O.E.C.D. countries will average 3.25 percent next year, compared with an expected 2.25 percent this year. And unemployment will stabilize at 9 percent of the total work force.

Full text: Strong economic recoveries next year in the United States and Japan will not be sufficient to bring an equivalent resurgence in Western Europe, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today.
The forecast was contained in The Economic Outlook, a semiannual publication of the O.E.C.D. The group, made up of 24 non-Communist industrial nations, publishes economic analyses that are widely regarded as among the most comprehensive and authoritative.
In the United States, the speed and pattern of the current recovery are broadly similar to past recoveries and much faster than elsewhere, Kjell Andersen, acting head of the O.E.C.D.'s Economics and Statistics Department, said at a news conference today. Much of this lopsidedness can be explained by expansionist monetary policy in the United States and a lack of market flexibility in Europe, the O.E.C.D. said.
The United States recovery should continue strong next year, the forecast said, despite the likelihood that a big Federal budget deficit will keep interest rates high.
Faster Growth Rate The O.E.C.D. predicts that the American economy will grow at a 5 percent rate during 1984, after adjustments for inflation, or slightly faster than the 4.5 percent rate the Administration is forecasting and which the industrial group had forecast in its last report.
Prices are expected to rise by about 5.25 percent, an acceleration on this year's expected 4 percent inflation rate. But unemployment should fall, to 8 percent during 1984 as a whole before dropping further to 7.75 percent in the first half of 1985. The 1983 annual rate was put at 9.5 percent.
For Japan, the O.E.C.D. predicts a 4 percent growth rate in 1984, up from 3 percent this year. As usual, Japanese inflation will remain very low, averaging only about 1.5 percent this year and next.
But the economies of Western Europe, in marked contrast, will hardly grow at all next year, and unemployment is expected to continue rising.
Stagnation Seen
On average, the O.E.C.D. sees the European economies expanding by a mere 1.5 percent, compared with only 1 percent this year. As a result, unemployment that averaged 10.5 percent in 1983 is likely to creep up to 11.25 percent next year and 12 percent during the first half of 1985.
While Britain's economy should grow by about 2.25 percent in 1984 and the German and Italian economies by 2 percent each, the O.E.C.D. forecasts stagnation for France and many smaller European countries. As a result, unemployment will remain unchanged in Britain, at 11.5 percent, while it will rise in West Germany, France and Italy.
This weak European performance means the recovery in the non-Communist world as a whole will remain disappointingly slow, the O.E.C.D. says, running at about half the 5 to 7 percent rate typical of similar phases of earlier recoveries. Overall growth in the 24 O.E.C.D. countries will average 3.25 percent next year, compared with an expected 2.25 percent this year. And unemployment will stabilize at 9 percent of the total work force.
Deficit Warning Repeated
The O.E.C.D. warns, as it has done regularly in past forecasts, that the huge United States budget deficit, together with the high interest rates and the strong dollar it causes, remains a threat to America's own economic recovery and to the upturn in the rest of the world.
Next year, the O.E.C.D. expects the United States balance of payments deficit on current accounts to nearly double, from $43 billion to a new record of $82 billion, because the dollar's strength prices American exports out of foreign markets at the same time as it lowers the prices of imports into the United States.
But the O.E.C.D. fears that at some point the budget deficit's size will undermine confidence in the dollar, halting the inflow of foreign funds now financing the country's payments deficit and forcing the United States to take drastic deflationary action.
Nevertheless, at the moment, the O.E.C.D. welcomes America's expansionary fiscal policy as part of the reason why its economy is recovering so rapidly, while the big payments deficit this recovery creates is giving a major lift to Europe and Japan by increasing the demand in the United States for their exports.
But the United States economy is also performing better than Western European economies because it is more flexible, Dr. Andersen said, citing more functional markets, more flexible wage patterns and better profitability. As a result, employment is rising rapidly in the United States, generating stronger consumer demand.
European Rigidity
By contrast, the O.E.C.D. says, European economies continue to be hampered by rigidity. It also notes that most governments are still following restrictive fiscal policies aimed at reducing budget deficits and fighting off inflation.
Over the last year or so, the O.E.C.D. Secretariat has frequently hinted that West Germany, Britain and other European countries where inflation has been reduced could join the United States in giving a boost to world recovery by carefully stimulating their economies.
The latest Economic Outlook contains no trace of such thinking, however. Now the O.E.C.D. Secretariat emphasizes the need for European governments to make their economies more flexible and market-oriented as the necessary precondition for faster economic growth.

Abstract: Was the situation that critical? Certainly the American economy had performed worse in the 1970's than in the 1960's or the 1950's, if judged by inflation, unemployment or productivity growth. An analysis by John L. Palmer and Isabel V. Sawhill of the Urban Institute shows that inflation, measured as the percentage increase percent in the 1960's and 112 percent in the 1970's. The rate of economic growth in the 1970's, though about one-third slower than in the 1960's, was almost as rapid as in the 1950's. ''Real'' gross national product, total output adjusted for inflation, rose by 36 percent in the 1970's, as against 49 percent in the 1960's and 38 percent in the 1950's. Part of the reason for the slowdown may have been the economy's absorption of a greater proportion of the population into the labor force, as a growing number of women and of youngsters born in the postwar baby boom sought jobs. Total employment in the 1970's rose 27 percent as against 20 percent in the 1960's and 11 percent in the 1950's. By the same token, unemployment ran higher in the 1970's, averaging 6.2 percent, as against 4.8 percent in the 1960's and 4.5 percent in the 1950's.

Full text: Who is to blame for the country's economic problems? That is an important national issue in Tuesday's elections. By Leonard Silk
President Reagan and his supporters contend that the Republican Administratin inherited the problems and has taken bold and decisive actions to solve them.
The Democrats maintain that the policies adopted by the Administration and supported by the Republicans in Congress are at fault for the depth of the recession. If those policies are continued, the Democrats argue, the nation will face economic disaster.
What follows is an attempt to sort out the various assertions and counterassertions and to put the matter in perspective.
The Background
Mr. Reagan certainly inherited from earlier administrations a serious problem: how to achieve steady economic growth, price stability and low unemployment simultaneously.
Unemployment and inflation seemed to alternate, in the early postwar period, like opposite ends of a see-saw. But after the mid-1960's, the average levels of both inflation and unemployment moved upward together, from one business cycle to the next, in a new economic disease that came to be called "stagflation," a combination of economic stagnation and inflation.
Successive Administrations pursued policies aimed either at fighting stagnation and inflation.
Characteristically, Democratic administrations, with heavier support from labor, put greater stress on reducing unemployment, while Republican administrations, with a larger constituency among businessmen and the well-to-do, focused more on stopping inflation. Thus, the Eisenhower Administration underwent three recessions from 1953 through 1960. Richard M. Nixon, who lost to John F. Kennedy in 1960, felt that it was the third Eisenhower recession that cost him the White House on his first try. The average unemployment rate in 1960 was 5.5 percent. The rate of inflation that year was 1.5 percent.
President Kennedy had pledged ''to get the country moving again.'' When Congress resisted increasing public spending to stimulate the economy, he turned to tax reduction. He was assassinated before his in 1964, and the economy surged.
By the end of 1965 the unemployment rate had fallen to 4 percent, then regarded as equivalent to full employment. The Vietnam War buildup was beginning, and inflation loomed, since a rapid growth in Government and private spending would not call forth enough additional production to meet the demand. Johnson Resisted Tax Increase
Mr. Johnson resisted a tax increase for more than two years, partly to avoid a major debate on the costs of the Vietnam War, partly to insure against Congressional rejection of his Great Society program.
His refusal to choose between the guns of Vietnam and the butter of the Great Society set the economy on an inflationary course that still persists. But in the final year of the Johnson Administration, 1968, inflation was still moderate by present standards: 4.7 percent. And the unemployment rate was only 3.6 percent. President Nixon started out by trying to rein in the economy gradually, depending chiefly on slow monetary growth, but the rise in unemployment to 6.2 percent, together with the rise of inflation to 6.1 percent in 1969, alarmed him, as did Republican losses in the midterm elections of 1970.
He was determined to prevent the economy from costing him the White House in 1972, as he thought it had in 1960. On Aug. 15, 1971, he announced his new economic program, which included a freeze on wages and prices, devaluation of the dollar, a cut in taxes to stimulate business and, with the help of a cooperative Federal Reserve Board under the chairmanship of Arthur F. Burns, rapid monetary growth.
The economy boomed, prices were stable under the controls and Mr. Nixon was re-elected. But after the election, when wage and price controls were lifted, rapid inflation broke out.
At the same time, a world boom added to inflationary pressures on commodity prices. In October 1973 the Arab members of the on the United States. Oil prices soared, and the Consumer Price Index climbed to double-digit levels. Preoccupied by Watergate, President Nixon never made a strong response to the energy threat. In 1974, unemployment averaged 5.6 percent, and inflation reached 12.2 percent.
Gerald R. Ford, who became President after Mr. Nixon's resignation in August 1974, tried to bring inflation under control by fiscal and monetary tightening, and in 1975, under the impact of the deepest recession in 35 years, unemployment averaged 8.5 percent. Inflation fell to 7 percent.
In 1976, an election year, Mr. Ford was hesitant to try to pump up the economy. For the year, unemployment averaged 7.7 percent, but inflation came down to 4.8 percent. Jobless Rate Brought Down
Jimmy Carter, on taking office in January 1977, made a reduction in monetary policy, he brought the jobless rate down to 5.8 percent in 1979.
But one consequence of that course was a rise in the inflation rate. Consumer prices climbed by 6.8 percent in 1977, by 9 percent in 1978 and then, in 1979, under the additional impact of the second oil shock, by 13.3 percent, higher even than the rate in 1974.
To fight inflation and defend the dollar, then under heavy pressure in international markets, Mr. Carter, in July 1979, named Paul A. Volcker, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, who was regarded as a strong anti-inflationist, to the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Board. Mr. Volcker, in the fall of 1979, proclaimed that he would pursue a doctrine of ''operational monetarism,'' focusing on controlling the money supply rather than interest rates.
Strict monetary control aimed at bringing down inflation put the economy into recession. In 1980, an election year, the jobless rate summer, the decline in unemployment did not come soon enough to help Mr. Carter's electoral prospects. The unemployment rate was still at 7.4 percent when Ronald Reagan assumed the Presidency.
But the inflation rate, despite tight money and interest rates that rose to then-record levels, came down very slowly to 12.4 percent in 1980 from 13.3 percent in 1979. Fighting 'Economic Dunkirk'
Mr. Reagan came to office calling for a radically different policy to rescue the economy from what his aides called ''an economic Dunkirk.''
Was the situation that critical? Certainly the American economy had performed worse in the 1970's than in the 1960's or the 1950's, if judged by inflation, unemployment or productivity growth. An analysis by John L. Palmer and Isabel V. Sawhill of the Urban Institute shows that inflation, measured as the percentage increase percent in the 1960's and 112 percent in the 1970's.
The rate of economic growth in the 1970's, though about one-third slower than in the 1960's, was almost as rapid as in the 1950's. ''Real'' gross national product, total output adjusted for inflation, rose by 36 percent in the 1970's, as against 49 percent in the 1960's and 38 percent in the 1950's.
Productivity, measured as output per hour in the private business sector, slowed markedly in the 1970's; it rose by just 15 percent in the decade as against 33 percent in the 1960's and 32 percent in the 1950's.
Part of the reason for the slowdown may have been the economy's absorption of a greater proportion of the population into the labor force, as a growing number of women and of youngsters born in the postwar baby boom sought jobs. Total employment in the 1970's rose 27 percent as against 20 percent in the 1960's and 11 percent in the 1950's. By the same token, unemployment ran higher in the 1970's, averaging 6.2 percent, as against 4.8 percent in the 1960's and 4.5 percent in the 1950's.
But with more people employed and bringing home income, the American standard of living, defined as the percentage increase in per capita income, after adjustment for inflation and taxes, rose by 23 percent in the 1970's, slower than the 35 percent gain in the 1960's but faster than the 15 percent gain in the 1950's. The Reagan Record
President Reagan's chief claim for the success of his program is that it has stopped inflation. Indeed, the Consumer Price Index rose by just two-tenths of 1 percent in September, making the annual rate of increase in the first nine months of 1982 4.8 percent, the same as in 1976, the final year of the Ford Administration.
But the unemployment rate has climbed to 10.1 percent, the highest To what extent is the Reagan economic program responsible for the decline in inflation and for the recession and the rise in unemployment?
The rate of inflation had been coming down before Mr. Reagan took office, as a result of the worldwide oil glut, falling commodity prices and the recession of 1979-80. By the second quarter of 1981, the rate of price increase was down to 9.8 percent.
But the steep Reagan recession certainly shoved the inflation rate down a lot faster. The Reagan Administration did not set out deliberately to cause a recession to check inflation. On the contrary, its original economic program was intended to attack both stagnation and inflation by a combination of massive ''supply side'' tax cuts, to spur economic growth, and support for a restrictive Federal Reserve policy of slowing the growth of the money supply, to check inflation.
But this two-pronged attack on unemployment and inflation did not Sharply rising interest rates in the first half of 1981 thrust the economy into recession so hard on the heels of the Carter recession as to seem almost like a relapse.
The slump has pushed down not only inflation but also, to a lesser extent, interest rates, raising hopes of an economic recovery in 1983. Thus far, however, signs of the recovery are scarce.
The outlook for business capital spending remains ''dismal,'' a description used by Norman Robertson, chief economist of the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh. Profits in steel, oil and many basic industries are down. The manufacturing industry is operating at less than 70 percent of capacity.
Businesses are still struggling to bring down their inventories, but thus far declining sales have prevented a cleanup of surplus stocks. Worries Over Business The most worrisome aspects of the present slump are the high rate of business failures and the strained balance sheets, with high debt ratios, of many corporations.
Many banks are carrying heavy amounts of ''problem'' loans, and the world financial system is burdened by an enormous volume of national debt, much of it owed to private banks.
The stock and bond markets have surged forward in response to lower interest rates. However, uncertainties remain over whether the Federal Reserve means to push interest rates still lower by accommodating growing Government and private debt, or whether, as Mr. Volcker has insisted, it means to go on fighting inflation by holding to its fundamental course of restricting monetary growth.
Anxieties in the markets still focus on the Federal budget deficits. Returns for the fiscal year 1982, ended Oct. 1, show a record deficit of $110.7 billion. The prospective deficit for 1983 is estimated at $155 billion by the Congressional Budget Office. And the estimates that the 1984 deficit could exceeed $200 billion.
Financing such Government deficits in the face of rising credit demands of business and consumers, once recovery begins, could prevent strong and steady economic growth in the years ahead.
The Administration's newly appointed chief economic adviser, Martin Feldstein of Harvard, says he finds it ''not unreasonable'' that the economy will grow by 2.9 to 3.9 percent in 1983, the private consensus of economists. But that rate of growth would still imply an unemployment rate of about 9 percent next year. The Reagan Solutions
Mr. Reagan has been campaigning for Republican candidates by urging voters to ''stay the course.'' It is not entirely clear which course he means, since the President, over the opposition of his supply-side supporters, backed Congressional legislation to increase taxes by $99 billion over the next three years, to narrow the budget deficit. Basically, however, Mr. Reagan has held to his original course. He strongly opposes rescinding the third installment of the 1981 tax cut, which would reduce personal income taxes by 10 percent next July 1. He is holding out for a change in the tax law, already enacted, that would reduce personal income tax rates, beginning in 1984, to offset the effect of inflation.
Mr. Reagan is also resisting efforts to curb the military buildup, scheduled to add 7 percent or more annually to the military budget, after inflation. And he still wishes to scale back social expenditures, provoking Democratic charges of ''unfairness'' in his program.
A report by Mr. Reagan's advisory committee on Social Security, headed by Alan Greenspan, is due by the end of the year, but, whatever its recommendations, the prospect of significant cuts in the politically sensitive areas of Social Security and Medicare is dubious. without either rescinding the next income tax cut or raising other taxes, which Mr. Reagan said would take ''a palace coup,'' the likelihood remains for big budget deficits for at least the next few years. And these will create continuing problems for the Federal Reserve and the financial system. Democratic Solutions
The Democrats contend that if the Administration stays on this fiscal-monetary course, it could drive the economy into another depression.
Seeking to respond to the Republican charge that they have no alternative to the Reagan course, some Democrats have sought to put together a new program aimed at regenerating national economic growth by an approach different from the Administration's supply-side tax cutting.
A Democratic Congressional group headed by Representative Timothy development, increasing training programs for workers, rebuilding public works such as roads and bridges and investing more in energy resources. The Wirth group would also establish a council of public and private officials to build ''broad support for national initiatives.''
Other Democrats are widely dispersed along a political spectrum ranging from old liberals, laborites and New Dealers to Southern conservatives, the ''boll weevils'' who on economic policy have been closer to Mr. Reagan than to mainstream Democrats.
Despite their differences, however, most of the Democrats favor social programs of benefit to their constituencies among organized labor, the ''working poor'' and the aged or ailing poor, welfare recipients, blacks and other minorities. The party has offered no answer to the question of how to finance Social Security.
By and large, the Democrats support growth in military budgets but would trim the rate of increase advocated by Mr. Reagan. rigidly monetarist and as a prime cause, along with mounting deficits, of high interest rates, which have hurt the housing, auto and many other industries and cost millions of workers their jobs. Analysis
The chronic problem of how to arrest inflation and reduce unemployment at the same time has yet to be solved by the Reagan Administration. Inflation moved the electorate toward the Republicans in 1980; unemployment in 1982 appears to be exerting a polar tug toward the Democrats.
The greater interdependence of the world economy has made it more difficult than ever for a single nation, even the United States, to act alone to attack one problem to the exclusion of the other. In using tight money and high interest rates to stop inflation, the Administration caused unemployment to rise not only at home but also abroad, as other nations raised interest rates to protect their currencies. High rates in the United States also made the dollar so dear as to hurt American exports, endangering major industries, wiping out jobs and increasing pressures for protectionism. High unemployment worldwide endangers the entire economic and monetary system.
Likewise, for a single nation to try to attack unemployment simply by stimulating internal demand can also be perilous, as the Carter Administration found in 1979 and the Mitterrand Government in France and the Trudeau Government in Canada have since learned. Solving unemployment and inflation together will require greater international policy coordination.
It will also require each nation to do more than periodically expand demand, then contract it, tighten money, then loosen it, or set the money supply on automatic pilot, no matter what happens to interest rates and the economy. Specific policy tools are needed to reduce structural unemployment, restrain inflationary pressures from labor, cartels or other interest groups and encourage productivity growth.
The political process in the United States has not produced a diverse and balanced program for dealing with the complex economic problems facing all modern industrial societies.
Until it does, the political pendulum between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation seems likely to go on swinging awhile longer.

Abstract: Economists have defined inflation in various ways and have identified different types such as ''cost-push'' and ''demand-pull.'' It is probably best defined, however, as a sustained rise in the general price level. This means that while the relative prices of goods may frequently change - energy, for example, may go up while longdistance phone calls go down - the average price of all goods must rise to create inflation. Moreover, many of those who did acknowledge progress tended to complain that the gains had been made at unacceptably high cost because of soaring unemployment. Mr. [Reagan] has disputed this, declaring it to be the ''most cynical form of demagoguery.'' Inflation, not inflation-fighting, causes unemployment, Mr. Reagan says. There's little doubt that the high unemployment rate makes people uncomfortable about their general economic situation. ''When you have high unemployment,'' Ann K. Lower of the Consumer Federation of America said, ''the fact that something comes down a couple of pennies doesn't matter much.''

Full text: When the Reagan Administration took office 21 months ago, one domestic problem loomed above all others: Inflation had reached alarming, virtually unprecedented peacetime levels.
Warnings were sounded about the social breakdown that has accompanied extremely high inflation in other countries while tens of millions of ordinary Americans watched supermarket and other prices that seemed to rise with each successive purchase.
The situation is vastly different today. Double-digit unemployment is now identified as the top problem and inflation, which dropped from an annual rate of 12.4 percent two years ago to about 6 percent this year, ranks well down the list of public concerns.
President Reagan has been citing this inflation decline as evidence that his economic program is starting to work. And when the September consumer price figures are announced on Tuesday, for the last time before the Congressional election, they will immediately become part of the last-minute political rhetoric.
In the time since the days two years ago when alarmists were predicting runaway inflation on the South American model, the United States seems to have been more successful in cutting inflation than people have realized. Polls show that relatively few people believe there has been a substantial abatement of price increases, much to the chagrin of an Administration, which has been pointing to gains in the struggle with prices. Credit 'Has Been Lost'
Much of the credit ''has been lost,'' laments Robert F. Steeves, deputy director of the White House Office of Consumer Affairs. There are several possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between the facts and the perceptions of consumers. Perhaps the most popular measuring rod itself, the Consumer Price Index, is not accurately reflecting market conditions. The figures for September are to be reported Tuesday.
Another possible cause is that prices of some major items, such as used cars, school tuition, utilities and medical care, have continued to rise sharply. At the same time, the prices of some items such as clothing have risen scarcely at all, but few realize it because these purchases are often put off in a recession.
Psychological factors, however, are probably the most important. High unemployment and smaller raises make consumers uneasy, specialists note, and therefore they feel they cannot afford things even though their actual buying power may have risen.
Some, because of previous inflation, have switched their buying patterns from, say, steak to hamburger and have come to regard this as a more or less permanent decline in their standard of living caused by inflation. It is also natural for consumers who remember paying 35 cents a gallon for gasoline 10 years ago to disregard a decline from $1.40 to $1.30. Long Memories a Factor
According to Patrick C. Jackman, the branch chief for the Consumer Price Index at the Labor Department, this long consumer memory is significant because ''the same factors that pushed up prices most have been the factors showing the most moderation.''
Another explanation of why surveys show consumers still skeptical about progress is that ''most people probably give fairly flip answers'' to poll takers, Mr. Jackman says.
Economists have defined inflation in various ways and have identified different types such as ''cost-push'' and ''demand-pull.'' It is probably best defined, however, as a sustained rise in the general price level. This means that while the relative prices of goods may frequently change - energy, for example, may go up while longdistance phone calls go down - the average price of all goods must rise to create inflation.
Thus, economists say, one must be careful not to confuse particular big price increases with inflation itself. The Consumer Price Index is the most popular of several yardsticks for measuring inflation in the United States. It measures changes in the weighted average of a fixed sample of consumer goods.
Like most indexes, it has substantial flaws. One is that the market ''basket'' it tracks is only rarely revised, with the result that the index includes the prices of things that people may buy much less than they did in 1972-73, the data used when the latest revision was made in 1977. Quirk in Housing Index
The biggest current complaint is that the index overstates the cost of home ownership by heavy weighting of mortgage interest rates. Mortgage rates, however, are not a good proxy for housing costs because of the infrequency with which houses are purchased.
The Labor Department in January will amend the index by substituting a rental equivalence measure that will reduce the home ownership weighting by about one-third.
Because of the interest-rate distortions, according to Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, the index overstated the actual inflation rate from the end of 1979 to the end of 1981 by more than 3 percentage points.
What the index records is of great importance because of its role not only in recording higher prices but also in transmitting them throughout the economy. Some 44 Federal benefit programs are directly linked to it, including Social Security, with its 36 million beneficiaries. Relative Factors in Index
There are seven major categories in the index with the following relative importance: housing, 46 percent; transportation, 19 percent; food, 17 percent; medical care and apparel, 5 percent each; entertainment and other goods and services, 4 percent each.
Individual items have shown sharp and not unusual variations in the last year. Professional medical services, for example, rose 15.3 percent while school books and supplies rose 14.6 percent and used cars rose 14.1 percent. Fats and oils, a food component, showed the biggest decline, 4 percent, followed by declines of 3.2 percent for gasoline, 2.2 percent for fuel oil, coal and bottled gas and 1.5 percent for ''other apparel.''
It is a matter of debate how much credit the Reagan Administration can claim for these declines, but experts point out that the strongest factors affecting the prices of food and energy have been bountiful harvests and a worldwide recession.
With the vast number of goods and services in the American market and the frequent price changes of so many of them, it is not surprising that even the most diligent consumer often loses his bearings.
Then there are items sold at discounts from the regular price, there are prices that do not make much impression because they are paid by health or other insurers, and there are things like college tuition that go up only occasionally. A Labor Department official says the tuition component will climb ''substantially'' in the report Tuesday. Difference Hard to Grasp
Mr. Jackman says it is also hard for people to grasp the distinction between lower inflation rates and lower prices. ''Prices are still going up but at a much slower rate,'' he observes.
The Administration thus seems to have made relatively little headway in persuading voters that inflation has been substantially reduced. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last month showed that twothirds of those questioned thought prices were rising as fast as or faster than a year earlier.
Moreover, many of those who did acknowledge progress tended to complain that the gains had been made at unacceptably high cost because of soaring unemployment. Mr. Reagan has disputed this, declaring it to be the ''most cynical form of demagoguery.'' Inflation, not inflation-fighting, causes unemployment, Mr. Reagan says.
But there's little doubt that the high unemployment rate makes people uncomfortable about their general economic situation. ''When you have high unemployment,'' Ann K. Lower of the Consumer Federation of America said, ''the fact that something comes down a couple of pennies doesn't matter much.''

Abstract: While Mr. O'[Neill Jr.] said the current recession was ''not only stalled'' but ''starting to slide backwards,'' Mr. [Reagan Ranches] said, ''We aren't out of the woods yet, but we're getting there.'' As he has many times in recent weeks, the President cited the recent drop in inflation and interest rates, as well as the ''surge of investor confidence we've witnessed'' in the stock and bond markets. He also said that ''real wages,'' retail sales, housing starts and car sales were all ''heading up again.'' The Speaker said Mr. Reagan spoke ''easily'' of unemployment without realizing ''the horror that lies behind those figures.'' He said that, as a Presidential candidate in 1980, Mr. Reagan promised to protect Social Security benefits but then acted as if he had ''never made such a promise.''

Full text: President Reagan and the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., exchanged accusations on the economy today as the off-year election campaign went into its final 10 days.
Sounding their principal themes in a campaign that is viewed by both sides as a referendum on the Reagan Administration's economic policies, Mr. Reagan charged the Democrats with proffering ''fairy tales'' and Mr. O'Neill said the Administration had deliberately thrown people out of work.
Mr. Reagan used his weekly five-minute radio broadcast to denounce what he said were ''six big myths'' put forward by the Democrats. Specifically, he denied that military spending increases and the three-year tax cut had contributed to the Federal deficit and that his Administration had cut social programs.
Says Most Can Find Jobs
He also said that most of those unemployed were able to find jobs within two months. ''Bad as current unemployment is, in most individual cases it's a temporary problem,'' Mr. Reagan said.
Mr. O'Neill, in a radio broadcast taped in Boston, charged that Mr. Reagan's ''bold and confident promises of 1981 have become the tragedy and the excuses of 1982.'' He said the Administration had thrown ''millions of people out of work as part of a deliberate plan to slow down inflation.''
Just as Mr. Reagan appealed for patience, Mr. O'Neill sounded the principal theme of the Democrats this fall: that the Administration's policies were unfair. Equality of Sacrifice Urged
''I have found that the American people are willing to make tremendous sacrifices for their country, on one condition,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''They want the sacrifices to be shared equally by everyone.'' He said the Administration's budget cuts, tax cuts and anti-inflation policies had benefited the wealthy and hurt the poor.
While Mr. O'Neill said the current recession was ''not only stalled'' but ''starting to slide backwards,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''We aren't out of the woods yet, but we're getting there.''
As he has many times in recent weeks, the President cited the recent drop in inflation and interest rates, as well as the ''surge of investor confidence we've witnessed'' in the stock and bond markets. He also said that ''real wages,'' retail sales, housing starts and car sales were all ''heading up again.''
But the bulk of Mr. Reagan's speech was defensive in nature. In many respects it went so far as to seem in contradiction to what many of his aides acknowledge publicly and privately.
For example, Mr. Reagan said that ''myth No. 1'' was that ''increases in defense spending in recent years are one of the main causes of projected Federal deficits.''
''The fact is that the defense share of the Federal budget and the gross national product has been shrinking sharply over the last 20 years,'' he said. Agency Figures 11% Growth
The Office of Management and Budget has said that the Administration's plan to spend $1,500 billion over five years on the military constitutes a growth rate, after inflation is taken into account, of 11 percent from the base that existed in 1980.
Mr. Reagan also termed as ''a whopper'' the assertion that the tax cut was a cause of big deficits. ''That is just not true,'' he said, adding that it held tax rates even ''to keep the hard-pressed American taxpayer from being bled even drier through further hikes and the bracket creep caused by inflation.''
The tax cut enacted last year was calculated as diminishing Federal tax revenues by $750 billion over five years. Another myth, Mr. Reagan said, was ''the charge that this Administration has slashed Federal social spending and caused a lot of human hardship.'' He added, ''Well, that sounds bad. But is it true? The answer is no.'' He said the social spending budget had gone up. Cuts Were Offset
The Administration in the last two years has eliminated or cut scores of programs and tightened eligibility in such areas as public service jobs, school aid, student loans, food stamps, welfare, Medicaid and subsidized housing. The overall social program budget has gone up because these cuts were offset by Social Security, Medicare, veterans' benefits and other programs that were not cut as much.
Mr. Reagan said the other myths were the suggestion that the unemployed faced a permanant lack of jobs, the idea that ''America's best days are behind us,'' and what he called ''the biggest and cruelest myth of all, the doom-peddling argument that there is no end in sight for this bitter recession.''
While the President delivered his address live from Camp David, Md., shortly after noon today, Mr. O'Neill taped his Friday night for broadcast after 1 P.M. For the Speaker, whose aides acknowledge that he lacks Mr. Reagan's broadcasting abilities, the speech was a first. In the past, other members of Congress have responded to Mr. Reagan's weekly radio talks.
Mr. O'Neill said the Administration's program was ''not working because the program is not fair - and, just as important, because the people themselves know it is not fair.''
''It is not fair to throw millions of people out of work as part of a deliberate plan to slow down inflation,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''It is not fair to give huge tax breaks to the wealthy while denying the basics of life to those who need them. It is not fair to spend trillions on the Pentagon and, in the same breath, threaten to cut people's Social Security checks.''
Taking his cue from the principal Republican campaign theme, Mr. O'Neill said, ''Stay the course? That is unfair. America needs a change.'' He called on voters to send ''the clearest possible message on Nov. 2'' to that effect.
The Speaker said Mr. Reagan spoke ''easily'' of unemployment without realizing ''the horror that lies behind those figures.'' He said that, as a Presidential candidate in 1980, Mr. Reagan promised to protect Social Security benefits but then acted as if he had ''never made such a promise.''
Mr. O'Neill said, ''We must reform the Social Security system fairly and in a way that honors our commitment to America's elderly.''
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Speaker disputed Mr. Reagan's statement that most of those unemployed were only temporarily without jobs. Christopher Matthews, the Speaker's administrative assistant, said the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this month that the average duration of unemployment was 16.6 weeks, a rise from 13 weeks a year ago. ---- Tent Cities Erected By The Associated Press
Members of church, labor and community action groups began setting up tent cities yesterday in Lansing, Mich., St. Louis, Columbus, Ohio, and New Orleans in a Depression-style protest of President Reagan's economic policies. Organizers said that at least 30 more ''Reagan Ranches,'' as they called them, were to be set up in other cities by Election Day.
Much of the activity was organized by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which says it has 60,000 low-@ and moderate-income members in 26 states.

Full text: Squeezing Trucks in Canada
Congress is annoyed. United States truckers, it says, don't get a fair shake in Canada. So it has declared a moratorium on new licenses for Canadian truckers until Canada changes its discriminatory ways. That, of course, is not the end of the matter. Manitoba has already retaliated with a moratorium on route licenses for U.S. truckers. Other provinces, which under Canadian law control truck routes, will surely follow suit.
It is hard, at this point, to say who is right. But it's clear that both countries lose from interference in open trade and investment. Self-interest should be motive enough for Canadians to curb growing protectionism. And this country, for its part, should recognize Canadians' frustrations in living in the shadow of an economic giant. Disputes like this are more likely settled by compromise than by chauvinist posturing.
Canadian and U.S. truckers have long shared rights to transport goods across the border. The controversy over new licenses follows from deregulation on the U.S. side, and recession on both.
Until the late 1970's it was tough for any trucker to obtain new route authority in either country. Then, just as the recession hit hard, deregulation in the United States opened the door to Canadian as well as U.S. companies. U.S. competitors protested that they had a tougher time in Canada than Canadians did in the United States. With thousands of teamsters out of work, the Interstate Commerce Commission took the complaints seriously.
The commission suspended route applications by Canadians pending an investigation of the charges. Now Congress has formalized the deal: no more licenses for two years. The suspension may be lifted only if the President affirms that Canada has had a change of heart.
If this were an isolated incident it would be possible to ignore. The cost to consumers from a loss of international competition is probably modest. But the dispute reflects a general souring of economic relations that could mean substantial losses for both countries. The Canadian economy is in trouble, with unemployment and inflation at record highs. Many Canadians blame Washington. If only United States interest rates were lower and its business less exploitative, they say, life would be rosy.
Such views are simplistic. Canadian stagflation predated the United States interest rate explosion. U.S.-owned businesses are no more exploitative than native concerns operating under Canadian law. But the Trudeau Government has shamelessly seized on resentment of U.S. influence. It is forcing energy companies to the south to sell their assets to Canadians at bargain rates. Its Foreign Investment Review Agency unfairly hobbles U.S. citizens who want to make direct investments.
The urge to bite back is tempting - and should be resisted. First, any move to limit Canadian investment or shut out Canadian business hurts us as much as it hurts them. More important, it is unlikely to prompt Canadians to mend their ways. Protectionism only breeds more protectionism.
The better approach is quiet diplomacy, with a goal, in the case of trucking, of guaranteeing U.S. companies an equal shot at new route authority. More generally, the goal should be a softening of Canada's harsh restrictions on direct United States investment.
There is little chance the Trudeau Government will repeal anti-United States laws, but it might be persuaded to interpret them more liberally. Far from the television cameras, diplomacy may yet show Canadians where their real interests lie.

Abstract: Whatever the 1.7 percent second-quarter growth rate means, therefore, the [Paul Volcker] testimony assures that any recovery during the rest of the year, and perhaps next, will be weak and inadequate. As the economist Sidney Weintraub commented recently in the New Leader, ''So long as we rely on monetary policy for an inflation antidote we will persistently suffer either slow growth or recession.'' And monetary restraint is Mr. [Reagan]'s only antidote for inflation. That is the only part of his economic program that has been even moderately successful; Mr. Volcker went so far as to say that ''the inflationary tide has turned in a fundamental way.'' But he added the Catch-22 that to increase the money supply to aid recovery would only rekindle inflation - which might be true, if no other action were taken, but only makes Sidney Weintraub's point more dramatically. Besides, revised statistics suggest that inflation has not declined as much as was believed earlier in the year. I wrote in this space upon passage of his tax bill that such rhetoric confronted the President with a new problem - ''whether the recovery program can produce recovery, or at least what can plausibly be described as recovery.'' A year later, after fair testing, it's self-evident that it hasn't and won't.

Full text: he first anniversary of Congressional passage of President Reagan's three-stage tax reduction bill is just a week away, so this seems a good time to pronounce it a solid, ringing failure.
Economists within and without the Reagan Administration may differ as to whether the 1.7 percent second-quarter increase in gross national product means that the recession continues for a little while or quite a while. Supply-siders may debate whether the Reagan tax cut was big enough or fast enough to meet doctrinal criteria.
But the heart of the matter is that the predictions that stampeded Congress last year have not come true. Remember?
* A major, guaranteed reduction in marginal tax rates over a threeyear period would cause people - particularly the rich, who benefited most -to save and invest more, bringing on a boom in production and productivity.
* Monetary restraint, promised by the President and enforced by the Federal Reserve Board, would bring down inflation without the pain of a recession. In both cases, went the refrain, if people only knew what to expect, and had confidence that their expectations would be met, the problems of stagflation could be solved. And virtually no one save the slothful poor and the parasitic bureaucrats would feel any pain.
Scarcely one year later, unemployment is running at more than 9 percent - and nearly twice that for blacks. Newly released figures from the Labor Department show that one of every five American workers was unemployed at some time during 1981. Nearly three million were out of work all of that year, not including those so discouraged that they quit hunting for jobs.
Although G.N.P. did show a slight upturn for the second quarter of 1982, most of the gain was suspect - an increase in motor vehicle inventories, not sales - and did not necessarily suggest real economic growth. The Commerce Department's revised figures, moreover, showed that the declines in G.N.P. in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year were sharper than originally reported; the recession was worse than thought at the time, making the 1.7 percent increase for the second quarter even less impressive.
Interest rates, meanwhile, have risen to levels that even Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, called ''extraordinarily high.'' Perhaps the major reason for those rates is the huge federal deficits now impending as a result of the Reagan tax cut and the Reagan defense spend-ing boom, both dumped on a depressed economy and a budget already strained by runaway entitlement programs.
Mr. Volcker, testifying to the Senate Banking Committee, said the Federal Reserve would not increase its target rates for monetary growth this year and that the best it could do for next year would be to keep them the same - not least because the Fed has ''a strong sense that considerably more remains to be done to bring the deficit under control.''
Whatever the 1.7 percent second-quarter growth rate means, therefore, the Volcker testimony assures that any recovery during the rest of the year, and perhaps next, will be weak and inadequate. As the economist Sidney Weintraub commented recently in the New Leader, ''So long as we rely on monetary policy for an inflation antidote we will persistently suffer either slow growth or recession.'' And monetary restraint is Mr. Reagan's only antidote for inflation.
That is the only part of his economic program that has been even moderately successful; Mr. Volcker went so far as to say that ''the inflationary tide has turned in a fundamental way.'' But he added the Catch-22 that to increase the money supply to aid recovery would only rekindle inflation - which might be true, if no other action were taken, but only makes Sidney Weintraub's point more dramatically. Besides, revised statistics suggest that inflation has not declined as much as was believed earlier in the year.
Even one of the basic rationales for the Reagan tax cut has been found to have been overstated, if not mistaken. Supply-siders said a drop in the personal savings rate to a five-year average of only 5.4 percent, and to only 5.2 percent in 1978 and 1979, required a cut in tax rates to encourage more savings and investment. In fact, revised figures now show, the personal savings rate was 6.1 percent in 1978 and 5.9 percent in 1979; the five-year average was 6 percent.
In the early stages of his Administration, Mr. Reagan claimed unequivocally that his economic program ''would achieve all the essential aims of recovery,'' that it would produce 4.5 percent annual growth after 1982 and a balanced budget in 1984.
But I wrote in this space upon passage of his tax bill that such rhetoric confronted the President with a new problem - ''whether the recovery program can produce recovery, or at least what can plausibly be described as recovery.'' A year later, after fair testing, it's self-evident that it hasn't and won't.

''And an extraordinary situation requires that extraordinary measures be taken.'' Mr. MacEachan today continued to blame United States interest rates for much of Canada's ills. References to ''prudent monetary and budgetary policies'' in the final communique from Versailles, he said, were meant to warn the United States ''that if the world is to get any opportunity to get out of this recession, the United States must take action to reduce its interest rates.''

Full text: The Bank of Canada today raised its benchmark discount rate for the second time in two weeks in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to halt the slide in the value of the Canadian dollar.
On the heels of a half-point increase in its bank rate last week, to 15.87 percent, the central bank today raised the rate to 16.20 percent. But the dollar, which quickly fell below 80 cents American after last week's adjustment, has failed to respond. The currency closed today at 79.10 cents in Toronto and 79.17 in New York.
The major private banks responded to last week's increase by raising their prime lending rates by half a point, to 17 1/2 percent, and a further increase appeared probable for Friday. Sharp Criticism in Commons
In Parliament, opposition Members accused the Liberal Government of causing ''economic ruin'' through its interest-rate policies.
''Canada is in a crisis,'' Nelson Riis, the finance critic of the New Democratic Party told Finance Minister Allan MacEachan in the House of Commons. ''And an extraordinary situation requires that extraordinary measures be taken.''
The Government has consistently denied rumors that it intends to devalue the Canadian currency or impose exchange controls, actions that would support the dollar by curbing the flow of capital out of the country.
Canada, along with the other major industrial nations, has placed much of the blame for its deteriorating currency on high United States interest rates. At the summit conference in Versailles, France, over the weekend, the Canadian delegation sought in vain to win a commitment from the Reagan Administration to bring down United States interest rates. Countering High U.S. Rates
High American interest rates encourage foreign investors to sell their own currencies for dollars to take advantage of the high yields of dollar-denominated securities. The rise in the key Canadian bank rate is an attempt to counteract this by making the Canadian dollar more attractive as an investment currency.
Since last weekend's economic summit meeting, whose results Canadian officials called disappointing, Mr. MacEachan has faced sharp attacks in the House of Commons without being able to promise quick relief for the nation's economic problems.
Canada's unemployment rate currently stands at 10.2 percent, its annual rate of inflation has increased to 11.3 percent and a record number of business failures have been recorded in recent months.
High interest rates contribute to a recession by discouraging capital investment and installment buying because the financing is so costly.
Mr. MacEachan today continued to blame United States interest rates for much of Canada's ills. References to ''prudent monetary and budgetary policies'' in the final communique from Versailles, he said, were meant to warn the United States ''that if the world is to get any opportunity to get out of this recession, the United States must take action to reduce its interest rates.''

Full text: The Marshall Islands, part of the American trust territory in the Pacific since World War II, have signed a provisional agreement with the United States, granting it military rights for 50 years.
The pact, concluded here on Sunday by President Amata Kabua of the Marshalls and Fred M. Zeder, President Reagan's representative, is subject to approval by a Marshalls plebiscite and by the United States Congress.
The accord, completed after 13 years of intermittent negotiations, also commits the United States to pay the Marshalls up to $1.5 billion over the 50-year period, Mr. Zeder said. The exact figure will depend on adjustments to cover inflation, he said.
The accord would establish a new political relationship between the Marshalls and the United States known as a ''free association.'' It would make the islands independent in domestic and foreign affairs. The United States would retain control over security. Pacts Due With 2 Other Groups
The United States is negotiating similar accords with the Palau Islands and with a third island group known as the Federated States of Micronesia, consisting of Ponape, Truk, Yap, Kosrae and other Caroline islands. A fourth group, the Northern Marianas, voted in 1975 to become a commonwealth of the United States, like Puerto Rico.
The people of the four island groups, numbering 130,000, are mostly Micronesians, with a few Polynesians. Nine major languages are spoken.
The islands were taken from Japan by American forces as a result of World War II. Parts of the Marshall Islands, the Palau Islands and the Northern Marianas were captured by the United States in fierce battles.
Since then, the islands have been administered by the Department of the Interior as a United Nations trusteeship known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. For some time, they have been selfgoverning in internal affairs.
The Marshalls accord includes payment of $150 million to the hundreds who have suffered ill health from radiation effects as a result of nuclear weapons testing at Bikini and Enewetak between 1946 and 1962. Also included are payments up to $9 million a year to landowners of Kwajalein, which has become a missile testing base.
Anton A. de Brum, the Marshalls' Foreign Minister, said the basic agreement on free association would be submitted to a plebiscite of the 31,000 Marshallese on Aug. 17 with international supervision.
He has set a deadline of Oct. 1 for approval by Congress, provided the Marshallese assent. If the accord is rejected in the plebiscite or if Congress fails to act by the deadline, the Marshalls Government will consider the islands ''an independent nation,'' he said.

A MISERY THAT MAKES IT HARD TO LOVE COMPANY

Abstract: The five European Common Market countries at Versailles are also sorely divided. Britain last week reluctantly agreed to an $875 million rebate from the Common Market budget; it will contribute $1.6 billion more than it gets back. Trade disputes between Europe and the United States are breaking out again over steel and agriculture. And while all the participants at Versailles formally support Britain in its war with Argentina, they fear their trade with Latin America may suffer in consequence. But the leaders are likely to keep their disagreements under wraps. President [Francois Mitterrand] has prepared a modest, informal meeting confined to ''an exchange of reflections.'' Instead of a formal communique, the participants plan to issue a short ''declaration.'' At London in 1977, the more prosperous countries agreed to take more risks with inflation, expanding their economies in hopes of leading the world to recovery. They officially adopted this ''locomotive'' approach at Bonn in 1978, when Germany and Japan agreed to reflate if the United States would curb energy consumption. But the locomotives were derailed by inflation and Congress was slow to act on decontrolling oil and natural gas prices as a spur to conservation. At Tokyo in 1979, the leaders set energy-saving targets, but these were overtaken by recession after the second oil price shock. Last summer's meeting in Ottawa was noteworthy for its moderating impact on some of Mr. [Reagan]'s policies, especially toward the third world, and for establishing a working relationship between him and France's new Socialist President. The meetings have also been valuable in maintaining commitments to free trade and thus avoiding a protectionist upsurge that could have made a bad situation worse. Reagan-Style Priorities

Full text: PARIS Leaders of the West's largest economies will meet again this week at Versailles to try to recapture the prosperity that has eluded them since the big oil price increases of the 1970's. Again this year, they are trapped by concerted stagnation of their economies, with prospects for more of the same in 1983. Since their annual meetings began at Rambouillet, France in 1975, unemployment in the industrial democracies is up 40 percent to more than 25 million people and it is still rising.
Quarrels and doubts will abound when French President Francois Mitterrand welcomes President Reagan and the leaders of West Germany, Britain, Canada, Italy and Japan, plus Belgium as spokesman for smaller nations. The West Europeans, fearing prolonged damage from high American interest rates, see themselves as victims of President Reagan's tight budget and lenient tax policies. Japan's moves last week to open its markets to foreign goods and farm products were carefully timed to defuse resentment at Versailles of Tokyo's superior trading performance. But, as the United States special trade negotiator, William E. Brock, has warned, it will be a long time before increased Western sales in Japan can make up for the jobs lost to Japanese imports.
The five European Common Market countries at Versailles are also sorely divided. Britain last week reluctantly agreed to an $875 million rebate from the Common Market budget; it will contribute $1.6 billion more than it gets back. Trade disputes between Europe and the United States are breaking out again over steel and agriculture. And while all the participants at Versailles formally support Britain in its war with Argentina, they fear their trade with Latin America may suffer in consequence. But the leaders are likely to keep their disagreements under wraps. President Mitterrand has prepared a modest, informal meeting confined to ''an exchange of reflections.'' Instead of a formal communique, the participants plan to issue a short ''declaration.''
Their first economic summit in 1975 dealt with threats to the postwar economic rulebook under which they had prospered. Among the threats were the breakdown of the monetary system, with the dollar no longer convertible into gold, and the first big oil price increase. They agreed to curb disorderly currency markets, preparing for the decision the next year empowering the International Monetary Fund to exercise ''strict surveillance'' over Western exchange rates and economic policies. The agreement has been only partially observed, but it helped avert a ''war'' of currency devaluations aimed at increasing exports to pay oil bills.
At London in 1977, the more prosperous countries agreed to take more risks with inflation, expanding their economies in hopes of leading the world to recovery. They officially adopted this ''locomotive'' approach at Bonn in 1978, when Germany and Japan agreed to reflate if the United States would curb energy consumption. But the locomotives were derailed by inflation and Congress was slow to act on decontrolling oil and natural gas prices as a spur to conservation. At Tokyo in 1979, the leaders set energy-saving targets, but these were overtaken by recession after the second oil price shock. Last summer's meeting in Ottawa was noteworthy for its moderating impact on some of Mr. Reagan's policies, especially toward the third world, and for establishing a working relationship between him and France's new Socialist President. The meetings have also been valuable in maintaining commitments to free trade and thus avoiding a protectionist upsurge that could have made a bad situation worse. Reagan-Style Priorities
At Versailles, Western leaders are likely to return to some of the same issues they faced at their first meeting. The Reagan Administration says it cannot do anything about high interest rates, which it predicts will come down when the world realizes the United States has licked inflation. Washington offers to mitigate the deflationary impact of high rates by helping to stabilize the dollar against other currencies, to foster trade and investment.
In return, the Administration wants its economic partners to put real teeth into their 1975 promise to let the International Monetary Fund discipline their economic policies. The idea is to encourage the others to adopt Reagan-style priorities - against inflation and for free trade.
The proposal poses fewer difficulties for Britain, Germany and Japan, which already have similar priorities, than for France, which has been trying to reflate its way out of recession. But President Mitterrand's economic experiment is already in trouble with soaring inflation and a widening trade gap. Tighter I.M.F. surveillance might be welcomed by Mitterrand Government moderates who are calling for a new tack.
The Reagan Administration also hopes the Versailles meeting will mark a turning point in East-West economic relations. It is urging the leaders to recognize that they erred in providing financing for East European purchases of technology in the 1970's. The policy left Western banks loaded with loans that may never be repaid, while Eastern European resources were diverted to military spending. The Eastern European countries now are barely creditworthy. But as their position improves, they may go on another borrowing spree to finance planned development of Russia's vast natural gas reserves. The West may be more careful next time.

WORLD ECONOMY: PULLING APART

Author: Silk, Leonard

Abstract: Elsewhere in the industrial world, high unemployment, combined with the threat to business employers, is intensifying pressures for protectionism. In the United States, for instance, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, with the support of General Motors, have already induced the Government to exact ''voluntary'' export quotas from the Japanese. Steel producers, dissatisfied with the protection accorded them by a ''trigger price mechanism,'' are seeking stronger safeguards by bringing anti-dumping charges against foreign competitors, mainly in Europe. ''We have to remind ourselves that there is simply no precedent in history,'' Mr. Clausen said, ''for the dynamic rate of change in the geographic spread of global output in our era, and in the structure and character of world trade.'' Neither in the United States nor in Europe is that shift of labor taking place smoothly or painlessly. In Europe, not only are jobs scarce for the young and unskilled, but also lost jobs in old-line industries are causing nations to send their surplus ''guest workers'' back to their own countries, such as Turkey or Greece. In America, the shrinking of job opportunities is also having a major impact on young people, blacks and other minorities, and provoking rising popular - or populist - resistance to immigration from such countries as Haiti or Mexico. And strained budgets are causing social and job programs to be cut, not increased.

Full text: IN 1982, the world economy, which has been growing increasingly interdependent for decades, is being subjected to the most powerful disintegrative pressures, both economic and political, of the postwar period. Foremost among these pressures are recession and rising unemployment. In the United States, Canada, Britain, West Germany and the other Western industrialized countries, the slump is expected to lift total unemployment to 28.5 million workers in the second half of this year. High youth unemployment is exacerbating radicalism in Western Europe.
Economists at the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are projecting that, for 1982 as a whole, unemployment in the United States will average 9 percent; in Canada, 8 1/4 percent; in Britain, 12 percent; in West Germany, 6 percent; in France, 8 1/2 percent and in the rest of the O.E.C.D. countries, 10 1/4 percent. North American will have 10 3/4 million out of work, while 16 million Western Europeans will be jobless. These are the highest levels since World War II.
Only in Japan, thanks not only to its continued strong economic growth and export performance but also to its labor-management policies, is the jobless rate expected to be as low as 2 1/4 percent, only a little above its postwar average.
Elsewhere in the industrial world, high unemployment, combined with the threat to business employers, is intensifying pressures for protectionism. In the United States, for instance, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, with the support of General Motors, have already induced the Government to exact ''voluntary'' export quotas from the Japanese. Steel producers, dissatisfied with the protection accorded them by a ''trigger price mechanism,'' are seeking stronger safeguards by bringing anti-dumping charges against foreign competitors, mainly in Europe.
This country's industries are far from alone, however, in the push for protection. The members of the European Common Market recently joined with the United States in a new Multifiber Agreement to set tight limits on the growth of exports of the major textile exporters, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Whether individually or collect ively, openly or covertly, protectioni sm is growing, imposing strains both within the industrial world and between the developed and developing nations.
Moreover, strains between the so-called North and South - a vast oversimplification of the divisions within the world, regionally, politically and in stages of economic development - are being intensified by the shifting shares of global industrial production.
A.W. (Tom) Clausen, the former chairman of the Bank of America who has succeeded Robert S. McNamara as president of the World Bank, said in a recent speech in Tokyo that, even with a good recovery from the present recession in Western Europe and North America, the older industrialized countries were likely to account for less than half of total world production by 1990, compared with more than two-thirds in 1960. Newly industrialized countries, including Japan, are likely to increase their share of world output to 25 percent in 1990 fr om 8.3 percent in 19 60, he said.
''We have to remind ourselves that there is simply no precedent in history,'' Mr. Clausen said, ''for the dynamic rate of change in the geographic spread of global output in our era, and in the structure and character of world trade.''
In the current decade, world trade is likely to expand almost twice as rapidly as the growth in world output, with manufactured goods accounting for 80 percent of the increase. With exports of commodities growing more slowly, the newly industrialized countries will be driving for a bigger share of the markets for traditional manufactured goods in the older industrial countries. These countries, in turn - at least in an economist's frictionless world - would shift their production and employment to high-technology industries and to financial, communications, knowledge and other services.
But the world is by no means frictionless, and this ideal scenario depends on the highly industrialized countries' maintaining high rates of growth and employment - and also on labor-market and educational policies to shift workers out of contracting industries into expanding ones.
Neither in the United States nor in Europe is that shift of labor taking place smoothly or painlessly. In Europe, not only are jobs scarce for the young and unskilled, but also lost jobs in old-line industries are causing nations to send their surplus ''guest workers'' back to their own countries, such as Turkey or Greece. In America, the shrinking of job opportunities is also having a major impact on young people, blacks and other minorities, and provoking rising popular - or populist - resistance to immigration from such countries as Haiti or Mexico. And strained budgets are causing social and job programs to be cut, not increased.
Hard times exacerbate political antagonisms, which feed on economic conditions. The European Common Market, one of the great postwar achievements, is under intense strain, with Britain, France and West Germany pulling apart.
Differences between the United States and the West Europeans over how to deal with the crisis in Poland have imposed new strains on the North Atlantic alliance. The United States, which has levied economic sanctions on both the Soviet Union and Poland, is pressing West Germany to end its big natural gas pipeline deal with the Russians and urging the Germans and its other European allies to cut back on trade, especially in high technology, with the Soviet bloc.
But the West Europeans, with their economies far more heavily dependent on trade with the Communists, are resistant to American pressures. They caustically note that President Reagan lifted former President Jimmy Carter's curbs on grain sales to the Russians when American economic interests - and his own political interests - were involved.
The Europeans are also highly critical of Mr. Reagan's domestic economic policies. They blame his commitment to monetarism and huge supply-side tax cuts for causing high interest rates, which in turn they blame for disturbing world currency markets, and for forcing high interest rates upon them, thereby slowing world economic growth.
The United States rejects these charges, contending that high interest rates and sluggish growth throughout the industrialized world are a consequence of inflation and the efforts of all governments to check inflation, whether by tight fiscal policies, tight monetary policies, or both.
There may be some merit in both sides' arguments. Unquestionably, the current world slowdown, which is now more than two years old, stemmed from measures adopted by all the Western nations to prevent the second great oil shock of 1978-79 from worsening world inflation, as the first oil shock of 1973-74 had done.
The skyrocketing of oil prices through the 1970's has also created another serious source of world strain: the mountain of international debt, especially that of the oil-poor developing countries. By 1980 the total debt owed by the developing countries totaled $439 billion, of which $284 billion, or two-thirds, was owed to private lenders. The problems of debt repa yment, with the lending capacity of private institutions close to the ir limits, add another element of risk of disintegration to the trou bled world economy.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which exploited the tight markets and panic buying of oil importers, first in the wake of the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 and then of the Iranian revolution of 1978, is now faced with an oil glut. Pressures from other OPEC nations on Saudi Arabia to cut back its oil production are growing. But even a Saudi cutback of two million barrels a day, as Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani has suggested, might not end the glut, for the enormous increase in oil prices has resulted in a huge increase in production from non-OPEC sources and a cut in consumption by the major oil importers, weakening OPEC's grip on the world oil market.
Even with the heat off oil prices, however, and even in the midst of the recess ion, inflation in the industrialized countries is still a problem, al though rates vary widely, depending on national economicpolicies. In the United States, the price index used to deflate grossnational prod uct was 9 percent in 1981 and is expected to come down to 8 percent in 1982. Last year the inflation rates in Britain, France and It aly were 12 1/4 percent, 12 percent and 17 3/4 percent respectively, but only 4 percent in West Germany and 3 1/4 percent inJapan. Those widely differening rates of inflation will continue to breed instabi lity in foreign exchange rates, together with swinging trade surplus es and deficits. Japan is suspected in the West of having held d own the yen's rate below its market value to strengthen its already p owerful trade position.
Thus the world slump is embittering both economic and political relations all over the world: North-South, East-West, within the capitalist world and within the Communist world alike. Inflation hangs on, and the fear of worsening it is inhibiting national economic policies to stimulate recovery.

Full text: President Reagan's proposed budget has drawn highly unusual public attacks from West European finance ministers, central bank chiefs and many private economists, who assert that the big projected deficits will further depress their own economies.
President Reagan formally announced his budget last weekend, and since then Finance Minister Jacques Delors of France, Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe of Britain, Finance Minister Willie de Clercq of Belgium and Karl Otto Pohl, president of the West German central bank, have all called it, in effect, a threat to the world's economic health. They have urged Mr. Reagan and Congress to reduce the $91.5 billion deficit projected for the fiscal year that begins Oct.1. Effects Already Being Fe lt
Indeed, the complex economic mechanism by which a big United States budget deficit tends to raise interest rates and unemployment in Western Europe and throughout the world is already starting to operate: Since President Reagan made his budget proposals, American interest rates have gone up and the value of the dollar, in turn, has risen sharply against other major currencies as investors have transferred funds into dollar investments.
Senior officials at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, along with many private European bankers and economists, say another large United States deficit, coming on top of this year's expected $99 billion deficit, will keep interest rates high throughout the world.
That, in turn, will choke off the mild economic upturn that the O.E.C.D. has predicted for its 24 member nations in the second half of this year, the officials said, raising unemployment beyond its current level of 9 percent, the highest since the Depression.
Even with a recovery, which could see European economic growth rates rise from zero in 1981 to about 2.5 percent by the end of 1982, unemployment would edge up to 10 percent in 1983, O.E.C.D. analysts said. And without such an upswing, the picture is even worse.
To be sure, past inflationary policies of European governments are now forcing them to keep interest rates high in an attempt to curb rising prices. But the governments find it advantageous to blame American policies for their own political and economic difficulties.
Helmut Schmidt's coalition Government in Germany is in serious difficulty, and the Chancellor has been forced to initiate a $4.5 billion economic stimulation program to combat unemployment, which has risen to 1.7 million workers, a 50 percent increase in the past year, the steepest rate of increase in Western Europe.
Bonn's overall rate, however, is still well below most other countries. The O.E.C.D. projects that West Germany will have an unemployment rate of 6 percent this year, compared with 9 percent in the United States, 8 1/4 percent in Canada, 12 percent in Britain, 9 percent in Italy, 8 1/2 percent in France and 2 1/4 percent in Japan. Altogether, the organization says, North America will have 10.75 million out of work, while 16 million Europeans will be jobless, the highest levels since World War II.
The latest polls in Britain show the governing Conservatives heading for defeat. And France's new Socialist Government has recently lost four byelections and faces a serious loss of backing from its trade union supporters. Past Support From Tories
In the past, Britain's Conservatives have voiced strong support for the Reagan Administration, many of whose policies parallel those of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Nevertheless the Chancellor of the Excheq@uer, a ddressing the House of Commons Thursday, said it was ''important t hat our country and other countries help to make plain to the United States our concern about the level of their prospectivebudget defici t and its implications for interest rates around the world.''
The 10 members of the European Community had already made their views know to Washington, Sir Geoffrey added. In Brussels, Mr. de Clercq, who currently holds the presidency of the Community's Council of Finance Ministers, said in his criticism of the budget that continued high interest rates would ''increase the temptation for countries to go protectionist.''
European governments are particularly bitter about President Reagan's budget, officials say, because the finance ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Japan all urged Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan to raise taxes and curb the deficit at the most recent of their regular private meetings, held in the Palace of Versailles three weeks ago. 'Advice Has Been Ignored'
Although the Europeans and Japanese were ''completely unanimous,'' in the words of a French official present, in warning Mr. Regan that another big United States budget deficit could ''push the world into a depression,'' their advice had been ignored.
In a speech today in Bremen, West Germany, Dr. Pohl renewed the attack, warning that high United States defense spending, coupled with tax cuts, would produce a deficit that would ''either keep American interest rates high or raise inflation.'' Calling this prospect ''particularly disappointing,'' Dr. Pohl added: ''I cannot believe that the United States does not understand that it bears responsibility not only for its own economy, but also for the world economy.''
Earlier this week, Mr. Delors told an international business conference here that high American interest rates were now ''the principal obstacle'' to economic recovery in Europe. I f Western nations could not agree on coordinated steps to bring rates down, he said, France would try to cut its interest ra tes unilaterally. He gave no further details. Effects on the Alliance
In addition, many European leaders now argue that the United States is weakening the Western alliance and undermining many of its own political and military objectives because its high rates are spreading recession around the world. ''How can we defend our alliance with the United States when critics say American policy is making us bankrupt?'' Mr. Delors asked.
Privately, European officials talk of ''a complete breakdown'' in monetary cooperation between Europe and the United States and say that trans-Atlantic economic relations are now worse than at any time since Aug. 15, 1971, when former President Richard M. Nixon unilaterally ended the dollar's convertibility into gold and slapped a 20 percent surcharge on United States imports.
''We have simply never before seen a United States Administration that displayed this degree of indifference to the effects of its action on its allies,'' a senior German official commented.
Similarly, Paul King, chief economist at Forex, the London-based exchange-rate forecasting service, commented, ''European governments are finally realizing the Reagan Administration doesn't care about the international consequences of its monetary policy.''
Hans Mast, chief economist at Credit Suisse in Zurich, sees ''no room'' for an appreciable cut in interest rates in the near future. ''It's not very satisfactory to see so much private savings being chanelled to the Government instead of going into productive private investment,'' he said. Budget Is a 'Major Calamity'
''The Reagan budget is a major calamity not just for the United States but for the West as a whole and even for the whole world,'' said David Watt, director of Britain's Royal Institute for International Affairs, in an article this morning in The Times of London.
One reason the Europeans are distressed is that oil and many other imported goods must be paid for in dollars, so their import costs rise when their currencies weaken against the dollar. Thus, they raise interest rates to make their currencies more attractive and prevent depreciation, but this tends to choke off new investment and delay economic recovery.
The dollar's latest surge in value is particularly frustrating for some European governments because it appears to have ended their recent concerted attempt to take the edge off their interest rates.
During the last days of Janaury, the Bank of England, the Bundesbank and the Dutch central bank pushed down several key interest rates by about half a percentage point and sold large su ms of dollars fr om their reserves to prevent their currencies from declining aga inst the dollar.
At that time, monetary officials admitted that this experiment in coordinated rate-cutting was unlikely to go much further unless the United States raised taxes to reduce the deficit, a move that President Reagan opposes. Mr. Reagan also opposes intervening on the foreign-exchange markets to hold the dollar down - a move that the Europeans advocate.

WHY INTEREST RATES ARE SO HIGH

Abstract: Furthermore, ''real'' interest rates - the interest rate after inflation is subtracted - have also continued to run at record levels. For example, long-term Government bonds recently sold at a record 14.56 percent. With inflation currently running at about 8 percent, that means the real interest rate on those bonds was roughly 6 percent. Historically, real interest rates have been in 2 to 3 percent range. Q. Let's take those three factors one at a time. How much power does the Fed really have to control interest rates? A. The Fed does not have direct control over interest rates. It can indirectly affect the money supply, but even there its influence is somewhat tenuous. Factors that can dilute the Fed's impact include how fast the economy is growing and how actively people are moving their money around. If money is turning over faster, for example, rates may tend to be a bit lower than a situation of slower turnover but the same size money supply. For example, after a year of 10 percent inflation, it would take $1.10 to equal the value of a dollar a year earlier. Someone lending money for that year, therefore, must get back $1.10 just to break even. Although anything greater than $1 represents an interest payment, it is only the amount above $1.10 that represent a ''real'' interest payment, after inflation is taken into account.

Full text: With long-term interest rates at record levels, many business and political leaders are predicting that the President will have to bail out of his economic program before it fully begins to take hold. Many critics contend that the projected Federal budget deficits will push rates still higher, depressing financial markets and the economy. A discussion of interest rates, and why they are so high, follows.
Q. Why are interest rates so important? A. The American economy has become increasingly dependent upon borrowing as a means of financing various purchases. Business uses loans to help pay for manufacturing and for new plant and equipment. Consumers rely on borrowing to pay for automobiles, homes and other goods.
Interest rates represent the cost of the borrowed money, which then becomes part of the cost of these items to the purchasers. If interest rates get too high, items become too expensive and purchasers start backing away. Mortgage rates, for example, must be taken into account in calculating monthly housing costs.
When rates get too high, people stop buying houses and automobiles. Business stops investing in new plant and equipment because the h igher initial costs make projects less profitable.
Q. But haven't interest rates risen before? A. Yes, but never to the present levels and never for so long a period. Even a decade ago, long-term interest rates for blue-chip corporate borrowers were only about 7 percent, about half of what they are today.
Furthermore, ''real'' interest rates - the interest rate after inflation is subtracted - have also continued to run at record levels. For example, long-term Government bonds recently sold at a record 14.56 percent. With inflation currently running at about 8 percent, that means the real interest rate on those bonds was roughly 6 percent. Historically, real interest rates have been in 2 to 3 percent range.
Q. Why do we have such high rates now? A. Economists have many different theories about what determines interest rates generally and why they are so high now. The three reasons mentioned most frequently are the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, continuing strong demand for credit and continued expectations for high inflation.
Q. Let's take those three factors one at a time. How much power does the Fed really have to control interest rates? A. The Fed does not have direct control over interest rates. It can indirectly affect the money supply, but even there its influence is somewhat tenuous. Factors that can dilute the Fed's impact include how fast the economy is growing and how actively people are moving their money around. If money is turning over faster, for example, rates may tend to be a bit lower than a situation of slower turnover but the same size money supply.
Having recognized this, however, many economists agree that if the Fed pursues a restrictive monetary policy, it will have an impact. In the short term, such a policy is likely to result in higher interest rates. But in the longer run the Fed could elicit the opposite result. If the growth in the money supply is slow enough for long enough, it may result in lower inflation and thus lead to lower interest rates. The only questions are how tight the monetary policy must be, and for how long, and what it will mean in terms of unemployment.
Q. How does the demand for money affect interest rates? A. In a slack economy, if business is at a standstill and consumers stop buying, lenders lower their interest rates - the price of the money -to entice borrowers. In a booming economy, th ere is more active bidding for the same pool of lendable funds, and that pushes interestrates up.
That is what concerns some of the Administration's critics. They maintain that the Government will have to borrow huge sums to finance the huge budget deficits, leaving business and consumers scrambling for what is left, which will push interest rates up. The Administration, however, responds that there will be enough money to go around, particularly if their tax incentive programs attract new savings dollars that will be available for borrowing.
Q. How about inflationary expectations? What exactly are they and how do they affect interest rates? A. Since inflation erodes the value of money, a lender wants to make sure that the interest paid on a loan covers both the amount eroded by inflation and enough above that for his profit. Thus, although people can not predict inflation rates exactly, their expectations about inflation affect how much interest they charge.
For example, after a year of 10 percent inflation, it would take $1.10 to equal the value of a dollar a year earlier. Someone lending money for that year, therefore, must get back $1.10 just to break even. Although anything greater than $1 represents an interest payment, it is only the amount above $1.10 that represent a ''real'' interest payment, after inflation is taken into account.
Q. How accurate are the lenders in estimating inflation when they calculate their interest charges? A. There is really no good way to say exactly. People have to rely on predictions and expectations. That is one reason interest rates are so volatile. People's expectations change almost daily, every time there is a new report about the economy or a new announcement about the Government's budget plans.
In recent years, lenders underestimated inflation and found they were losing money. Now, even though inflation has begun to fall, lenders are being more cautious. Although long-term interest rates fell three percentage points in November, concerns about budget deficits have reignited fears of higher inflation and higher interest rates, and long-term rates have climbed upward again.

Abstract: Computer Directions looked at all possible 25-year holding periods and discovered that in each such period gains in common stocks outpaced inflation. For the most recent 25-year period the average annual increase was 7.9 percent, well in excess of the inflation rate for the period of 5 percent. The Salomon Brothers bond index was up 3.2 percent a year in that same period. United States Government bonds advanced 2.8 percent annually and Treasury bills 5.4 percent annually, also in that recent 25-year period. During the most recent 10-year period ended in 1981, common stocks advanced at an annual rate of 6.4 percent. Th at compared with an increase of 8.6 percent annually in the Consu mer Price Index. The Salomon Brothers index, meantime, was up 3 pe rcent annually and United States Government bonds advanced 3.2 p ercent a year while Treasury bills gained 7.7 percent a year in t hat 10-year period.

Full text: COMMON stocks work best. The longer you hold them, the more they outshine alte rnative securities. At least that's the thesis of a new study.
On the other hand, as a result of 10 years of rising oil prices, common shares have not served investors as well lately as in the past.
During the most recent 10-year period, inflation has eliminated gains in stocks on the average. Meanwhile, holders of longer-term, fixed-interest securities have been devastated by comparison.
These conclusions are from Computer Directions Advisors of Silver Spring, Md. Its study updates data originally published by Roger Ibbotson and Rex Sinquefield of the University of Chicago on investment results from 1926 through 1976.
Over that period, the two researchers found that common stocks advanced at a rate of 9.2 percent annually, assuming that all distributions were reinvested.
The current study indicates that common stocks continue to be a good long-term hedge against inflation. Emphasize the words long term. For example, over the entire 56-year period, total returns on common shares exceeded the rise in the Consumer Price Index by a ratio of 3 to 1. Still, the high rate of inflation during the last 10 years has taken its toll. The average annual gain for the full period eased one-tenth of a percentage point, as a result of the recent inflation, to 9.1 percent, the Computer Directions study found.
The picture is not so bright for recent intervals. For example, during the past five years common stocks showed an average annual return of 8 percent while the Consumer Price Index advanced by an average of 10.1 percent a year.
Even so, common stocks outpaced longer-term, fixed-income securities in that same five-year period. The Salomon Brothers highgrade corporate bond index declined by an average of 1.2 percent annually and United States Government bonds dropped by an average of six-tenths of 1 percent a year.
Three-month Treasury bills, meantime, proved to be superior even to stocks, almost holding their ground against inflation in posting an annual rise averaging 9.5 percent over the same five-year period.
Computer Directions did not say so, but the strong performance of Treasury bills is encouraging to investors in money market funds. Treasury bills are the bellwether for money market instruments, which usually offer somewhat higher returns.
Computer Directions looked at all possible 25-year holding periods and discovered that in each such period gains in common stocks outpaced inflation. For the most recent 25-year period the average annual increase was 7.9 percent, well in excess of the inflation rate for the period of 5 percent. The Salomon Brothers bond index was up 3.2 percent a year in that same period. United States Government bonds advanced 2.8 percent annually and Treasury bills 5.4 percent annually, also in that recent 25-year period.
During the most recent 10-year period ended in 1981, common stocks advanced at an annual rate of 6.4 percent. Th at compared with an increase of 8.6 percent annually in the Consu mer Price Index. The Salomon Brothers index, meantime, was up 3 pe rcent annually and United States Government bonds advanced 3.2 p ercent a year while Treasury bills gained 7.7 percent a year in t hat 10-year period.
Computer Directions notes that there were 47 possible 10-year holding periods over the 56 years and common stocks outpaced consumer prices in 41 of the 47 periods. All six lags occurred during the most recent 10-year holding periods.

Abstract: The forces of inflation and unemployment, in the [Reagan] view, confront each other at last. Eight percent unemployment, says his Council of Economic Advisers, "reflects the unfortunate but natural short-term consequences of unwinding the deeply rooted inflation that is embedded in the American economy." Once the unwinding is concluded, it suggests, a weaker but purer America will move forward again into the medium-term sunlight of "economic recovery." Since 1973, employment in America has increased rapidly - more rapidly than in other large industrial countries. But three-quarters of the new jobs created - 10 million positions - were in services, retail trade, and state and local government. New private-sector employment was further concentrated in health services, business services, and eating and drinking places (including fast-food restaurants). These "big three" labor-intensive industries generated almost five million new jobs between 1973 and 1980: more than the total employment in the automobil, steel, computer, electronic-components, aircraft, and petroleum industries combined. It is this structure of employment, these sources of new work, that Reagan policies may jeopardize. For three trends, each ominous for employment, are likely to coincide in the years ahead.

Full text: President Reagan greeted the autumn increase in unemployment with grim resolve - "I will not be deterred by temporary economic changes or short-term political expediency" - and with an affirmation of historic mission.
The forces of inflation and unemployment, in the Reagan view, confront each other at last. Eight percent unemployment, says his Council of Economic Advisers, "reflects the unfortunate but natural short-term consequences of unwinding the deeply rooted inflation that is embedded in the American economy." Once the unwinding is concluded, it suggests, a weaker but purer America will move forward again into the medium-term sunlight of "economic recovery."
This "Pilgrim's Progress" vision is familiar. But it is also deceptive. It obscures the real transformation of the work Americans do, the real dangers ahead, and the ways in which the Reagan policies could bring a far greater collapse in employment, above all in industries where jobs grew fastest in the 1970's.
Since 1973, employment in America has increased rapidly - more rapidly than in other large industrial countries. But three-quarters of the new jobs created - 10 million positions - were in services, retail trade, and state and local government. New private-sector employment was further concentrated in health services, business services, and eating and drinking places (including fast-food restaurants). These "big three" labor-intensive industries generated almost five million new jobs between 1973 and 1980: more than the total employment in the automobil, steel, computer, electronic-components, aircraft, and petroleum industries combined. It is this structure of employment, these sources of new work, that Reagan policies may jeopardize. For three trends, each ominous for employment, are likely to coincide in the years ahead.
The first is the recession itself, and the effects of restrictive monetary policies. Inflation is likely to remain high next year, particularly given the effects of tax cuts and increased military spending. It is hard to believe that the Republicans, faced with inflation plus unprecedented Federal-budget deficits, will soon abandon their hope of redemption through hard times. They are far more likely to maintain existing monetary policies, and even to tighten fiscal policies.
The second trend has to do with long-term developments in the new boom industries. Employment in the "big three" has been growing much slower in 1981 than it did from 1973 to 1980 - in eating and drinking places, the rate of growth this year has been a little more than 2 percent per year, compared to 8 percent per year between 1973 and 1980. The growth of demand for services and meals may be slowing down; the boom industries may be investing in processes that are less labor-intensive. A deep recession, moreover, might devastate small, recently established service businesses. Employment in trade and services increased rapidly in the 1920's but was far from immune to the recession of 1929 to 1932.
The third trend is the Administration's assault on nonmilitary public spending. This will have direct concsequences for employment. State and local government is no longer a source of new work: From April to October, this sector actually lost 350,000 jobs, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
The effects of spending cuts are also unlikely to be counteracted by eventual defense-related employment. Even at the time of the Vietnam War, military spending created less employment than other public spending. The new boom - buying research, accurate missiles, a communications system that would survive a nuclear war - would provide still fewer jobs, above all for unskilled and unemployed workers.
The indirect consequences of the Reagan cuts may be even more ominous. For the private health services, on which so much new employment depends, grew up in the interstices of public-health spending. Like certain business services that supply government, they will be hurt by cuts in public expenditure. Recent suggestions by Richard S. Schweiker, Secretary of Health and Human Services - to cut reimbursement of "ancillary hospital services," and to limit Medicaid payments for long-term care - could end the growth of jobs in the private hospitals and nursing homes so important in the 1970's boom.
The transformation of employment in the United States makes it essential to find ways of creating new jobs in industries where productivity is high; of creating jobs with possibilities for advancement and creativity; of increasing quality and efficiency in private and public services. These needs are obscured by an economic vision that looks only at the behemoths of overall inflation and overall unemployment. The chance of long-term growth in productive work may be lost for many more years to come - if the Reagan policies bring a collapse in employment in services, in government, and throughout the economy. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Emma Rothschild, author of "Paradise Lost: The Decline of the Auto-Industrial Ago," teaches in the Science, Technology and Society Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Abstract: Although it has been partly obscured by the fog of technical concepts and jargon, a conflict exists between the Administration and the Federal Reserve Board over how monetary policy should be conducted. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Fed, regards bringing down the rate of inflation as his top priority, and has been telling both the Administration and the public that he does not intend to relax restrictive monetary policy. He told a group of real estate brokers in Florida earlier this week that ''we can't effectively deal with your problems by pumping up the money supply.'' Even if this were to produce short-term relief, he said, it would only aggravate problems for the longer run. ''An increase in the rate of growth of money supply generated by the Federal Reserve in the face of unchanging money demands probably brings down short-term rates for some period ahead. But given the probably shortening lag between money and its economic effects, inflation will soon increase and expectations of inflation will increase even earlier. Long-term rates, therefore, might hardly come down at all in response to a Federal Reserve-induced acceleration of the money supply. An acceleration of inflation, moreover, would quickly compel the Federal Reserve to reverse its expansionary action.''

Full text: THE onset of a recession, which the Reagan Administration now expects to be severe, has focused national attention on the need for a new mix of economic policies that will check and reverse the slump without causing inflation and interest rates to soar again once the current recession ends. The American economy has been on a roller coaster. This is the second recession in two years, and if interest rates go shooting up again when the current slump ends, there could be a third recession close behind.
Although it has been partly obscured by the fog of technical concepts and jargon, a conflict exists between the Administration and the Federal Reserve Board over how monetary policy should be conducted. Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Fed, regards bringing down the rate of inflation as his top priority, and has been telling both the Administration and the public that he does not intend to relax restrictive monetary policy. He told a group of real estate brokers in Florida earlier this week that ''we can't effectively deal with your problems by pumping up the money supply.'' Even if this were to produce short-term relief, he said, it would only aggravate problems for the longer run.
The Fed, which has been blamed for the current recession by focusing solely on the money supply and letting interest rates skyrocket, is now trying to find a way to a more stable monetary policy that will produce less economic instability.
Henry C. Wallich, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, says the cost has been paid most heavily by the thrift industry, housing builders, the auto industry and other manufacturers of durable goods, but it is now being borne by the entire economy.
Nevertheless, the Administration's monetarists, such as Beryl Sprinkel, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, believe that it would be a mistake for the Fed to begin efforts to control interest rates rather than simply to keep the money supply growing within its present targets. The Administration is counting on the Fed, by feeding reserves to the banking system in a time of falling loan demands, to help bring down interest rates and turn the recession around.
While the Fed has not formally departed from that policy, it appears to be trying to avoid rigid commitments to targets that, by driving interest rates down too low in a slump or shooting them up too high in a recovery, will exacerbate the business cycle. Mr. Wallich, a former professor of economics at Yale, recently told a conference in Frankfurt, West Germany:
''An increase in the rate of growth of money supply generated by the Federal Reserve in the face of unchanging money demands probably brings down short-term rates for some period ahead. But given the probably shortening lag between money and its economic effects, inflation will soon increase and expectations of inflation will increase even earlier. Long-term rates, therefore, might hardly come down at all in response to a Federal Reserve-induced acceleration of the money supply. An acceleration of inflation, moreover, would quickly compel the Federal Reserve to reverse its expansionary action.''
Mr. Volcker has continued to press the Administration to close the yawning gap in the Federal budget as a means of reducing the problem of the Fed in managing money. He has suggested that the Administration needs to reconsider both its spending and tax programs as a means of slimming the deficit. As a result of the impact of the current recession, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 1982, which the Administration has estimated would be $44 billion, is now likely to double. Alan Greenspan, the former chief economic adviser to President Gerald R. Ford and president of his own economic consulting firm, estimates that the fiscal year 1982 deficit will be $84.3 billion. Even more disturbingly, however, his firm, Townsend-Greenspan, is estimating that the deficit will be $109.4 billion in the fiscal year 1983, presumably a year of economic recovery and growth.
If such deficit figures are realized, the Fed will face the thankless task of either accommodating the deficit and thereby breeding worse inflation or refusing to accommodate it and helping to drive interest rates even higher. In either case, interest rates are likely to soar once again, creating the probability of another plunge into recession.
For the economy to get back on a more stable course, with interest rates less volatile on a lower plateau, fiscal policy needs to carry more of the burden of checking inflation. This implies that either the amount of tax-cutting voted by Congress would have to be reduced, or budget expenditures, in both the military and civilian sectors, would have to be cut. However, after the experience of recent years, it appears increasingly unlikely that the job of stopping inflation and holding interest rates on a steady and lower course can be accomplished by monetary and fiscal policy alone. Inflation could be brought down by a continuing slump and climbing unemployment, but that course would be economically painful and politically suicidal.
To achieve steady and noninflationary growth, a better balance of fiscal and monetary policy will need to be reinforced by an incomes policy to restrain wages and prices. Tax cuts might be related to national policies for inducing more stable wage and price behavior by labor and management.
In addition, in a world in which the United States has been losing ground in productivity and innovation, an industrial policy that joins the talents of business, labor, academia and government would also appear to be required.

Abstract: Are we forever doomed to ''crippling interest rates'' and ''bulging deficits,'' as they say? I think not. First of al l, deficits are not themselves inflationary. The fiscal 1975 and 1976 deficits exceeded the projected 1982 deficit as a percent of gr oss national product, personal savings and Government spending (all the buzz ratios). Yet, in both years inflation moderated and rates fell. The second point is that there is nothing inflationary about interest rates falling to 13 or 14 percent. We have already built into current interest rates an inflation premium of 9 to 10 percent. (Indeed, this is widely perceived to be the underlying rate of inflation.) Whereas in the past lenders and investors have demanded a risk premium (or real underlying rate of return) of two percentage points, under the 13 to 14 percent scenario, their risk premium would be four percentage points. There was little concern in the past about low interests rates being inflationary, in fact, they were considered disinflationary. So what are we doing with rates at 17 to 20 percent? Producing more inflation, that's what.

Full text: Y OU can't inhale and exhale at the same time. Put differently, today's inflation and high interest rates are the result of a head-on collision between a tight monetary policy and a stimulative fiscal policy.
Wall Street's reaction to this collision is unmistakable - indifference to economic developments, fear of Government crowding other borrowers out of the credit markets, increasing paranoia about the Federal deficit. And negative psychology has reached alarming proportions.
For example, if the Federal Reserve tightens, it will raise interest rates, which is bad for inflation and bonds, and will slow down the economy, which is bad for stocks. If the Fed loosens, the money supply will grow, which means the Fed will soon have to tighten, which will drive up interest rates, which is bad for bonds, and will slow down the economy, which is bad for stocks. What's more, real interest rates - interest rates minus the rate of inflation - are the highest they have been in 50 years.
Are we forever doomed to ''crippling interest rates'' and ''bulging deficits,'' as they say? I think not. First of al l, deficits are not themselves inflationary. The fiscal 1975 and 1976 deficits exceeded the projected 1982 deficit as a percent of gr oss national product, personal savings and Government spending (all the buzz ratios). Yet, in both years inflation moderated and rates fell.
Why? Because the Federal Reserve did not monetize the deficit. In fact, in 1976 it bought only 6 percent of the Federal debt. The Fed does this by injecting reserves into the banking system, and by lowering interest rates, thus stimulating the demand for credit and reviving the economy.
When the Fed expands bank reserves, it provides the raw material for the growth of the money supply. This leads to increases in aggregate demand and interest rates, which starts the cycle all over again.
From 1956 to 1974, the inflation impact of budget deficits would have been statistically too small to quantify if the debt had not been largely monetized. Currently, the Fed can purchase 14 percent of the fiscal 1982 deficit (a figure it has stayed below in three of the past six years) and still have the money supply growing within its projected targets of 2 1/2 percent to 5 1/2 percent. Admittedly, this type of rationale holds little sway with the financial markets.
The second point is that there is nothing inflationary about interest rates falling to 13 or 14 percent. We have already built into current interest rates an inflation premium of 9 to 10 percent. (Indeed, this is widely perceived to be the underlying rate of inflation.) Whereas in the past lenders and investors have demanded a risk premium (or real underlying rate of return) of two percentage points, under the 13 to 14 percent scenario, their risk premium would be four percentage points. There was little concern in the past about low interests rates being inflationary, in fact, they were considered disinflationary. So what are we doing with rates at 17 to 20 percent? Producing more inflation, that's what.
M Y third point is that high interest rates do not combat inflation, but are in fact one of the principle causes of it. They slow the economy down, which reduces tax receipts and increases transfer payments. The implications for an expanding deficit are obvious. High rates work their way into the Consumer Price Index largely through mortgage rates and the housing component. Social Security, Federal pensions and veterans benefits are all tied to this index. There goes the deficit again.
I am not one to indulge in all this agnostic mischief without suggesting a remedy. The problem, it would seem, is one of perception. The deficit itself is not inflationary. It is the expectation and perception of that deficit. Low interest rates are not inflationary, but the perception of what would follow low interest rates is inflationary. Inflationary psychology is itself inflation ary. Workers, lenders and manufacturers raise the price they charge for their goods and services to rotect themselves from erosion of their future purchasingpower.
No one came down from the mountain with the deficit etched in stone tablets. There is plenty of fat in the defense budget. Social Security has for too long avoided the ax that cut up the rest of the New Deal. There are alternatives. But the deficit is not our problem. Our problem is understanding what is inflationary and what is not. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bayard F.

Abstract: Vietnam kicked off the current inflation, and the [Reagan] miltary buildup in th e midst of huge tax cuts could give inflation another cruel twist. An analysis by James R. Capra in the current Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that the Reagan miltary build up, concentrated in procurement, ''will apparently far exceed the Vi etnam procurement increase.'' Wassily Leontief of New York University, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for his analysis of interindustry flows, has warned that enormous new military outlays will concentrate scarce capital in the military area and ''will starve the rest of the economy of the investment it desperately requires to remain competitive in the tightening worldwide market.'' Nevertheless, increasing nuclear arsenals and delivery systems still gets top priority in American and Soviet military planning. In his study, ''Defense in the 1980's,'' William W. Kaufmann, a leading analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues that expenditures on nuclear arms should get a lower priority in the Reagan buildup than additional highly mobile, conventional air, sea and land forces. He concludes that, with the nuclear forces already programmed, the United States will continue to have a powerful second-strike capability through the 1980's and that the probability of any use of nuclear weapons remains low, although it could worsen if the arms race accelerates.

Full text: Falling stock and bond prices, persistently high interest rates, a widening budget gap and fears that worse inflation may lie ahead have forced President Reagan to reconsider his planned buildup in military spending.
Thus far the White House is talking about relatively small trims, amounting at most to $15 billion in each of the next three years. If fully carried out, those trims would still permit the Pentagon's budget to rise by $15 billion in 1982, $25 billion in 1983 and $42 billion in 1984. Beyond 1984, the costs of the military buildup would climb a lot faster - by $81 billion in 1985 and by $117.7 billion in 1986. Total miltary outlays in the next five years are scheduled to exceed $1.4 trillion.
But how is that huge outlay on the military to be financed within the context of tax cuts totaling, on the Administration's own figures, $750 billion in the next five years. The danger is that, instead of real economic growth making the miltary buildup and tax cuts compatible, the result will be worse inflation, which, with money held tight, will drive up interest rates and choke off the economy's real growth.
Vietnam kicked off the current inflation, and the Reagan miltary buildup in th e midst of huge tax cuts could give inflation another cruel twist. An analysis by James R. Capra in the current Quarterly Review of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York finds that the Reagan miltary build up, concentrated in procurement, ''will apparently far exceed the Vi etnam procurement increase.''
Where the Vietnam buildup lifted procurement authority (measured in constant 1982 dollars) from $42 billion in 1965 to $63 billion in 1967, but then dropped in each of the next three years, the Reagan military buildup would raise procurement authority from $41 billion in 1980 to nearly $70 billion in 1982 and on upward in the next three years to reach $100 billion in 1985.
The inflationary problem could now be somewhat easier than during Vietnam because of greater spare industrial capacity. However, the economy now has a much higher rate of inflation and greater inflationary expectations than during the Vietnam War.
Wassily Leontief of New York University, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for his analysis of interindustry flows, has warned that enormous new military outlays will concentrate scarce capital in the military area and ''will starve the rest of the economy of the investment it desperately requires to remain competitive in the tightening worldwide market.''
A nation's economic strength, balance and flexibility have become vital elements in both its domestic well-being and its strength abroad. But military planners seem to treat their goal as the maximizing of the level of miltary expenditures, regarding economic considerations as an unfortunate if necessary constraint.
The nuclear age seemingly downgraded the significance of a nation's economic capabilities to outlast and crush an economically weaker opponent, because what would count in a nuclear war that might last only a few days (conceivably only a few hours or minutes) were forces in being - nuclear bombs and missiles immune from attack and ready for instantaneous response to any threat. That concept of hair-trigger and short-lived war still dominates the military policy of both the United States and the Soviet Union.
But Vietnam was no hair-trigger war and, both by its incredible length and the failure of the United States to prevail, it signalized the importance, not only for this country but all other advanced industrial countries as well, of developing new strategies to protect or advance their interests.
Subsequent events, including the Petrodollar coup by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the Iranian upheaval, and, on the Soviet side, Moscow's failure to subdue Afghanistan or even Poland, reinforce the lessons of Vietnam in demonstrating the constraints on a superpower; those constraints are political, social and economic as well as conventionally military.
Nevertheless, increasing nuclear arsenals and delivery systems still gets top priority in American and Soviet military planning. In his study, ''Defense in the 1980's,'' William W. Kaufmann, a leading analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues that expenditures on nuclear arms should get a lower priority in the Reagan buildup than additional highly mobile, conventional air, sea and land forces. He concludes that, with the nuclear forces already programmed, the United States will continue to have a powerful second-strike capability through the 1980's and that the probability of any use of nuclear weapons remains low, although it could worsen if the arms race accelerates.
A rethinking of United States military strategy has become essential if the nation is to avoid exacerbating both its military and its economic problems. end [ TEXT OMITTED FROM SOURCE ]

Full text: Interest rates, once considered a topic that appealed mostly to financiers, have moved to the top of the agenda of this summit conference of the leaders of the industrial world.
The reason for this dramatic change is the extraordinary height of interest rates in the United States, Japan and Western Europe and the danger they pose to the industrial world in rising unemployment and falling output.
For months now, the Europeans have singled out the United States, and particularly the monetary policies of the Reagan Administration, as the culprit behind the run-up in rates, and the resulting disruptions that high rates have caused their economies.
Today, Secretary of the Treasury Donald T. Regan quoted a striking statement on the subject by Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany. Chancellor Schmidt, Mr. Regan recounted, recently told a meeting of the finance and economic ministers that interest rates in his country, at 15 to 16 percent, were ''the highest rates of interest in Germany since the birth of Christ, as far as real interest rates are concerned.''
By the ''real'' rate of interest, Mr. Schmidt meant the difference between the nominal rate charged by lenders -such as the 15 to 16 percent rate he cited - and the rate of inflation. Since the consumer price index in West Germany was rising at an annual rate of 5.8 percent in the second quarter of 1981, this means that the real rate of interest there was roughly 10 percent.
Historically, economists have considered a real rate of interest of 2 or 3 percent - the real sacrifice that lenders make in letting borrowers use their savings - normal over the longer run. Thus a 10 percent real rate - and it is slightly higher than that in the United States today, with the prime rate at 20 1/2 percent and inflation under 10 percent - is about five times normal.
Advances in the real rate of these dimensions are highly unusual, whether or not Chancellor Schmidt is right in saying that the current level, at least in his country, is the highest since the Christian era began. The leading American monetary theorist, the late Irving Fisher of Yale University, contended that the real rate of interest was remarkably constant over time, with the nominal rate of interest moving up and down more or less in phase with the increase or decrease in the rate of price inflation.
This theory in fact underlies the Reagan Administration's explanation of why interest rates have climbed so high. It is blaming the inflation created by earlier administrations for the high interest rates.
Treasury Secretary Regan, asked at a news conference here what kind of justification President Reagan was offering the other leaders, replied: ''What he has told them is: look what he inherited when he came in, the rate of inflation, things of that nature and high interest rates. Remember interest rates were high when the President took office. So what he is telling them is that his policies - his fiscal policy, the monetary policy, particularly that of the Federal Reserve, our deregulation policy, and above all, our tax policy, these things are going to get inflation down.'' Position Called Disingenuous
Oddly enough, the President and his aides are stressing at this summit conference that it is the Federal Reserve that controls interest rates, not the Administration. This position is being taken here as disingenuous, since the Administration has been leaning hard on the Federal Reserve - sometimes even publicly - to keep money tight, no matter what the effect on interest rates.
Again, the Fisher theory of the link between inflation and interest rates is why Administration officials up to President Reagan are assuring foreign leaders that they expect American interest rates to come down, possibly by the end of this year. By how much? The Treasury Secretary said he did not want to be pinned down but ''I'd say by several points.''
How long is the Administration prepared to stick with this policy of trying to bring down interest rates by keeping money tight to squeeze inflation out of the system? Secretary Regan said the policy had already been in effect for three months and ''sticking with it for another six months, that would be nine months of tight interest, would be really sticking with it; it's been a long time since we've done that in the United States.''
What might be the effect of this policy? The Europeans are growing increasingly concerned that it might have a more devastating effect on employment in their countries than on inflation. Secretary Regan acknowledged that President Francois Mitterrand of France had warned of the dire consequences that would develop if interest rates did not come down by the end of this year, and reported his saying that ''unemployment in France as well as in Germany and other countries in Europe was getting to a flash point, to a point where it might cause social upheaval.'' ''And,'' he said, ''they wanted to avoid that.'' Cost of Loans Increased
High United States interest rates force other countries to raise their own rates to prevent investors from shipping their funds abroad to take advantage of the rates. In raising their own rates, however, the other countries raise the cost of loans to their own industries and consumers. The higher rates dissuade industry from investing in the plants and machinery that provide jobs and discourage consumer buying of all those products that are bought on credit - houses, automobiles and other durable goods.
The widespread rioting and arson that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has faced in recent weeks in Britain clearly underlies the anxiety over a tight money and high interest rate policy being forced upon other countries by the United States. Although the Americans here have sought to describe high interest rates as a common problem among the industrial countries - really a consequence of general inflation - the Europeans are seeking to link the high interest rates to the United States. What they are suggesting is that it is not inflation alone but the monetarist solution to inflation being pursued by the United States that has driven interest rates so high.

Abstract: Money and credit are the essential lubricants of our economic system. In the past 10 years, money supply has contracted by onethird relative to G.N.P. - far more than can be explained away as a result of faster check clearing and other modern contributions to the ''velocity'' of circulation. Finally, interest rates can be reduced safely and promptly. Adequate money and credit can be supplied, provided that there is selective control in the application of credit. The Fed has the power and the ability, without significantly increasing its bureaucracy, to limit credit, which contributes to inflationary consumer demand, and to increase substantially credit available for ''supply-side'' capital investment in the development of new sources of energy, in increased production of goods and services and in costreducing equipment and technology. Today, Eurodollars are coming to the United States for investment. When they arrive here, these Eurodollars inflate the domestic money supply accordingly because they then become deposits in American banks. For our Federal Reserve Board to counter this by restricting the current money supply correspondingly is simply to deprive Americans of money and credit in order to offset the supply of Eurodollars coming into the United States from foreign investors. --------------------------------------------------------------------- John Winthrop Wright is president of Wright Investors' Services, an investment management and advisory organization in Bridgeport, Conn.

Full text: THE Reagan Administration, in conjunction with the Congress, has a mandate to increase productivity, improve the nation's standard of living, reduce wasteful Government spending and interference with the free enterprise system and stabilize monetary values. These objectives cannot be achieved unless there is a re-education of the Federal Reserve Board and the American public in the true causes of inflation and the effective control of money and credit.
There is no way that the waste of our manpower through unemployment can be reduced or the productivity of our workers increased while interest rates are significantly above 8 percent. Until interest rates are reduced to a level at which it is profitable for small, medium and large businesses tg borrow capital, unemployment will increase, Government expenses for unemployment and welfare will grow, while taxable revenues fall.
United States interest rates rose above the 8 percent level on a sustained peacetime basis for the first time in 1973. Since then, the prime rate has averaged 10 percent and long-term corporate bonds 9 percent, compared with 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, for the preceding 25 postwar years. These rates, if continued, will destroy the American economic system because of the following effects:
* They take from the poor and add to the rich.
* They diminish the producers and expand the lenders.
* They inhibit and diminish long-term capital investment, productivity, research and development, production and development of new sources and efficient applications of energy.
* They do not encourage capital formation and its productive applications.
* They bankrupt small businesses, increasing the concentration of economic productive power, drastically reducing effective, competitive price cutting.
Our nation has been drastically misinformed and misled by officials who have made it an article of faith that inflation has been the result of excessive monetary growth; that high interest rates can cure inflation, and that because they say so, interest rates cannot safely be cut and Americans must suffer a decline in their standard of living.
Let me respond to these doctrines with the documented truth that gives a much different picture. Although inflation can be caused by excessive monetary growth, there has been no such excessive growth in the United States during the last decade. Instead, while the gross national product rose 37 percent in constaft dollars, the nation's money supply (M-1B) declined by 3 percent.
Money and credit are the essential lubricants of our economic system. In the past 10 years, money supply has contracted by onethird relative to G.N.P. - far more than can be explained away as a result of faster check clearing and other modern contributions to the ''velocity'' of circulation.
T IGHT money and high interest rates in the early 1970's spawned the prolific growth of Eurodollars, dollar credits and dollar deposits created by foreign-domiciled banks including the foreign branches of American multinational banks. Indeed, since they came on the scene, Eurodollars have grown to $550 billion, compared to about $400 billion for the nation's basic money supply.
By 1973, the huge upsurge of Eurodollars doubled the dollar value of world commodity prices, causing wordd-wide inflation and setting the stage for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And the subsequent increase in the price of OPEC oil was more than 1,000 percent, while the G.N.P. price deflator rose only 76 percent.
In my opinion, the rise in the price of energy alone more than accounts for all of the United States inflation. The inflationary result of rising energy costs cannot be measured only in terms of its magnitude as a raw material component of G.N.P. Energy is also part of the cost of every other component and the cost of producing every component rises with the cost of energy.
High interest rates, instead of curing inflation, have stimulated it. They add to the costs of every business, to all forms of product distribution and to all types of consumer purchases. They are themselves a significant secondary cause of inflation. The interest rate rise in 1974 caused by the tight monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, created the second-greatest recession in this century. The 1974-75 recession increased welfare and unemployment costs and decreased Government revenues so much that our Federal deficit from 1975 through 1978 totaled $226 billion and became the greatest and most inflationary deficit in our history.
Finally, interest rates can be reduced safely and promptly. Adequate money and credit can be supplied, provided that there is selective control in the application of credit. The Fed has the power and the ability, without significantly increasing its bureaucracy, to limit credit, which contributes to inflationary consumer demand, and to increase substantially credit available for ''supply-side'' capital investment in the development of new sources of energy, in increased production of goods and services and in costreducing equipment and technology.
A system of variable reserve requirements related to the mix of bank loan portfolios can produce a communion of profit-making interest betweef our banks and our national economic objectives. What is lacking is simply the mental effort to devise the plan and the will to put it into action.
One more thing concerning Eurodollars. Although they are not obligations of the United States or of American domestic banks, they can and do buy goods and services for dollars anywhere in the world, including inside the United States. For nearly 10 years, Eurodollar growth has added to American import costs and thus to domestic inflation by depressing the foreign exchange value of the dollar. This was and is because foreigners, and American multinational corporations, can acquire dollars by borrowing them from foreigndomiciled banks instead of selling their foreign currencies in exchange for dollars.
Today, Eurodollars are coming to the United States for investment. When they arrive here, these Eurodollars inflate the domestic money supply accordingly because they then become deposits in American banks. For our Federal Reserve Board to counter this by restricting the current money supply correspondingly is simply to deprive Americans of money and credit in order to offset the supply of Eurodollars coming into the United States from foreign investors. --------------------------------------------------------------------- John Winthrop Wright is president of Wright Investors' Services, an investment management and advisory organization in Bridgeport, Conn.

Abstract: In the first three months of the year, the new report said, ''In the merchandise accounts, a large increase in exports, following several quarters of little change, more than offset an increase in imports associated with stepped-up U.S. business activity.'' In the services category, the report added, the United States account showed a decline in net income from direct investment by foreigners. However, that was more than offset by ''higher interest rates and a sustained high level of U.S. bank lending abroad.'' Foreign Official Assets Up United States official reserve assets increased $4.5 billion in the quarter, partly reflecting purchases of West German marks, the report said. Meanwhile, foreign official assets in the United States increased by $5.4 billion, ''due almost entirely'' to an increase in holdings by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Full text: The nation showed a $3.1 billion firstquarter surplus in its foreign trade balance as measured by the broad current account of goods, services and other financial transactions, the Commerce Department reported today.
The new report also sharply revised last year's current-account figures, which now show a $3.7 billion surplus in 1980 rather than the $118 million reported in March. It was the biggest yearly surplus since the $4.4 billion of 1976, but it was no longer the first surplus since that year, as earlier reported. The Commerce Department now says a $1.4 billion surplus was posted in 1979 rather than the $705 million deficit the department has been citing.
Department officials indicated earlier that the balance would show a big surplus for the January-March quarter, contributing heavily to the unexpectedly rapid 8.6 percent annual rate of growth in the inflation-adjusted gross national product during those three months. What Figures Measure
The current-account figures, which are also adjusted for seasonal variations, measure a wide variety of financial transactions, including those involving goods, services, foreign aid, loans to foreigners, the movement of gold and such payments as pensions to Americans who live abroad.
In the first three months of the year, the new report said, ''In the merchandise accounts, a large increase in exports, following several quarters of little change, more than offset an increase in imports associated with stepped-up U.S. business activity.''
In the services category, the report added, the United States account showed a decline in net income from direct investment by foreigners. However, that was more than offset by ''higher interest rates and a sustained high level of U.S. bank lending abroad.'' Foreign Official Assets Up
United States official reserve assets increased $4.5 billion in the quarter, partly reflecting purchases of West German marks, the report said. Meanwhile, foreign official assets in the United States increased by $5.4 billion, ''due almost entirely'' to an increase in holdings by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Over all, the merchandise trade deficit declined in the first quarter to $4.6 billion from $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter; the surplus in services receipts fell slightly to $9.2 billion from $9.3 billion, and the deficit in unilateral transfers, such as nonmilitary foreign aid and pension payments, declined to $1.5 billion from $2.3 billion.
The revision of 1980 figures was spread across the year, with the new statistics showing big surpluses in the final six months outweighing deficits in the previous two quarters.
The fourth-quarter surplus, originally reported at $687 million, is now said to have been $1.39 billion.

Abstract: Consequently, investors shunned the West German mark, and the dollar ''did quite nicely,'' one dealer in New York said. Uncertainty about the future course of interest rates in the United States also played a role in the dollar's rise, dealers said. Interest rates in United States credit markets were up. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose to 216.88 yen, from 215.40. The dollar rose to 1.1985 Canadian dollars, from 1.1957. It also gained against the British pound, with sterling at $2.1513, compared with Tuesday's $2.1720. In London, the pound weakened against the United States currency to $2.1594, a decline of nearly 2 cents from Tuesday's 2.1788. It was sterling's lowest level against the dollar in London since April 8, 1980, when it traded at $2.15825.

Full text: The value of the dollar climbed sharply against other key currencies in trading in Europe and the United States yesterday, largely in reaction to unfavorable economic developments in West Germany. Gold prices registered a decline.
In Bonn, the Government reported that wholesale prices were up, fueling fears of double-digit inflation. The Government also said its budget deficit in the first quarter rose 8 percent, more than had been allowed for the entire year.
Consequently, investors shunned the West German mark, and the dollar ''did quite nicely,'' one dealer in New York said. Uncertainty about the future course of interest rates in the United States also played a role in the dollar's rise, dealers said. Interest rates in United States credit markets were up.
The dollar ended the day in New York at 2.1895 marks, up from 2.1710 on Tuesday. In European trading, the dollar climbed to 2.1715 marks, from 2.1645 the previous day.
The dollar started the trading day by rising in Tokyo to 216.40 yen, from the previous session's closing rate of 215.70. As trading moved to Europe, the United States currency continued to gain ground against all major currencies.
As the trading day ended in New York, the dollar had registered these gains: 5.1613 French francs, up from 5.1250; 1.9970 Swiss francs, up from 1.9767.

Abstract: The tune sounds familiar, but the soprano seems to be singing the tenor's part. Only a few years back, it was the United States that complained that conservative financial policies in Western Europe were spoiling the West's prosperity. Now it is Europe, particularly West Germany, that blames the Continent's recession on stringent monetary policies in the United States. One obvious result of the fall from grace is discontent with the policies of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. The West Germans, whose 12-digit catastrophe in the 1920's left them dreading inflation more than anything, will not risk big budget deficits to stimulate their economy. And they cannot lower their interest rates while America's remain high without risking a massive shift to dollar investments. That, in turn, would cause the mark to depreciate further, raising the cost of imports, especially oil. So Bonn and its partners in the European Monetary System want a coordinated lowering of interest rates, in America as well as in Europe.

Full text: The tune sounds familiar, but the soprano seems to be singing the tenor's part. Only a few years back, it was the United States that complained that conservative financial policies in Western Europe were spoiling the West's prosperity. Now it is Europe, particularly West Germany, that blames the Continent's recession on stringent monetary policies in the United States.
These complaints cannot be ignored. They reflect political tensions created by economic stagnation in Europe and the uncertain prospects for recovery - tensions that can further damage the Atlantic alliance. But giving the Europeans what they say they want would probably not solve their problems, and it would certainly complicate America's.
The West German economy is in trouble. Trouble, of course, is a relative term. By any reasonable measure, West German living standards are among the highest in the world. And neither inflation nor unemployment rates are as bad as those in the United States. But the perception that West Germany's economy can do no wrong is fading. Production grew very little in 1980; what little gain was made is expected to be lost in 1981. A Helping West Germany By Cheapening the Dollar Could Hurt Everyone once-prosperous foreign trade is in deficit, and the mighty D-mark has lost about one-fifth of its value relative to the dollar in just 15 months.
One obvious result of the fall from grace is discontent with the policies of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. The West Germans, whose 12-digit catastrophe in the 1920's left them dreading inflation more than anything, will not risk big budget deficits to stimulate their economy. And they cannot lower their interest rates while America's remain high without risking a massive shift to dollar investments. That, in turn, would cause the mark to depreciate further, raising the cost of imports, especially oil. So Bonn and its partners in the European Monetary System want a coordinated lowering of interest rates, in America as well as in Europe.
But the Reagan Administration is in no mood to cooperate. It is determined to stick to a conservative monetary policy, lowering interest rates only gradually to break the psychology of inflation. Some American officials are privately skeptical, in any case, about the sincerity of Europe's request. They suspect that the main motive is to shift the blame for unemployment and high oil prices to Washington.
Besides, the allies too would benefit if Mr. Reagan succeeds in turning America's inflation rate downward. All would certainly suffer even more if he fails.
But two lessons can be found in this conflict. First, West Germany's main problem is oil imports. If worldwide demand for oil were lower, oil prices would decline, and so would Bonn's trade deficit. Energy conservation therefore remains a high priority for all the industrial democracies.
Second, there is an obvious international cost to using high interest rates as a bulwark against inflation. The United States feels obliged to keep them up, because it has yet to curb inflationary spending programs and because it has been unwilling to try to control wages and prices by more direct means.
It is a tangled policy web, woven in desperation. PETER PASSELL

SOME ADVICE FOR RONALD REAGAN

Abstract: In the past, interest rates tended to respond to inflation with a considerable lag. More recently, in view of experience with inflation gained since the mid-1960's, interest rates have been reacting more promptly. Indeed, they are now apt to respond to fears of intensified inflation even before inflation as such intensifies. The sad fact is that in spite of the recession that we have just gone through, the basic rate of inflation is no lower now than it was before the recession started. From the standpoint of our inflation problem, we have had a wasted recession. T HE most basic requirement is to create general confidence that anti-inflation policies will henceforth be pursued resolutely, consistently, and as far as feasible in ways that encourage business innovation and investment. The Federal Reserve should not be expected to carry the main burden of fighting inflation. Fiscal and structural policies must also be enlisted in the battle.

Full text: N UMEROUS stirrings in our economy since July suggest that the recession in economic activity has come to an end. But the ending of recess ion, if that indeed has taken place, do es not necessarily implythat a sustainable economic recovery has star ted. There are many reasons for concern about the immediate econo mic future. Let me mention some of them.
First, the recovery since midsummer is virtually confined to the consumer trades and home building. There is as yet little or no evidence of a revival in the machinery industries, in the equipment trades or in business construction. A recovery that originates in the consumer sector and that fails to embrace business capital formation is inherently fragile.
Second, the outlook for the automobile industry remains cloudy. The new models are still being tested in the marketplace, and the prospect for substantial recovery has not been improved by the latest increases in automobile prices.
Third, the economies of other industrial countries have recently we akened, and some are actually experiencing recession. Meanwhile, the less deve loped countries are suffering greatly from the sharp increase in o il prices. Our exports, therefore, may soon turn sluggish.
Fourth, the war in the Middle East has created major new uncertainties about the availability of oil and its price. Fifth, and still more important for the near-term future, interest rates have again risen sharply since mid-June. Such an increase is a highly unusual development at this stage of the business cycle. If interest rates rise further, or even remain at their present level for more than a short period, our economic recovery may be endangered.
The rise in mortgage interest rates is already having an adverse effect on sales of both existing and new homes. The recovery of homebuilding has therefore become precarious. Sales prospects for automobiles have been further dimmed by the rise in interest rates. Business investments are also being adversely affected. Many corporations that had planned bond issues have postponed them. Much the same is true of various public agencies.
Furthermore, the rise in interest rates has been causing tremors in markets for equities and real estate as well as in the bond markets. The severe difficulties already faced by thrift institutions are multiplying, and their troubles could spread to industrial and commercial enterprises.
The recent rise of interest rates is obviously an unfavorable development. More frequently than not, bankers or the Federal Reserve authorities are now being blamed for it. The fault, however, is not theirs. The fundamental cause of the rise of interest rates is the renewed expectation of rapid inflation.
In the past, interest rates tended to respond to inflation with a considerable lag. More recently, in view of experience with inflation gained since the mid-1960's, interest rates have been reacting more promptly. Indeed, they are now apt to respond to fears of intensified inflation even before inflation as such intensifies.
The sad fact is that in spite of the recession that we have just gone through, the basic rate of inflation is no lower now than it was before the recession started. From the standpoint of our inflation problem, we have had a wasted recession.
In view of the difficulties and uncertainties that surround the economy, I do not think we can have a robust recovery in 1981. However, our longer range economic future could improve dramatically if we went to work seriously on the inflation problem. I trust that the Reagan administration will do precisely that even as it seeks to revive enterprise and diminish unemployment.
T HE most basic requirement is to create general confidence that anti-inflation policies will henceforth be pursued resolutely, consistently, and as far as feasible in ways that encourage business innovation and investment. The Federal Reserve should not be expected to carry the main burden of fighting inflation. Fiscal and structural policies must also be enlisted in the battle.
In addition to a firm monetary policy, I would emphasize the following principles at this juncture of history: First, encouragement of productivity-enhancing capital investments by lowering business taxes, and accompanying these and any other tax reductions with significant cuts in projected Federal spending.
Second, revision of the budget process so as to require a balanced budget unless a deficit is authorized by more than a simple majority - say, by two-thirds - of each House of Congress.
Third, reduction of restrictions on competition that are now imposed by Government; for example, introducing a youth differential for minimum wages in order to increase job opportunities for teengers, and rescinding or amending the Davis-Bacon Act, which serves to escalate construction costs.
Fourth, reform of regulations concerned with the environment, public health, and safety so as to insure that basic national objectives a re achieved at minimum feasible c ost.
Fifth, encouragement of labor-management councils in individual shops, offices and stores and throughout the country, so that workers and managers will jointly seek ways of improving productivity.
Sixth, more rapid decontrol of oil prices despite adverse shortrun effects on the price level, in the interest of achieving price stability over the longer run as well as regaining national energy independence.
I would add that no policy will work unless it establishes confidence that progress toward reasonably stable prices is being made and that this will in time restore our nation's economic health. The new administration not only faces the problem of finding the road to reasonable price stability, it must also inspire hope that the path it p ursu es, however, rocky, will lead to that goal and to a better future . --------------------------------------------------------------------- Arthur F. Burns was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board for eight years and is an adviser to Ronald Reagan.
