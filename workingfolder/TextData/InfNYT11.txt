Full text: CIUDAD JU√ÅREZ, Mexico -- Francisca Hervis Reyes and her family have persevered on the border, working in factories more than 1,300 miles from their hometown. They remained even as deadly warfare between drug cartels turned this city into one of the most dangerous on the planet. But they may not endure the changing predilections of the Federal Reserve.
Ms. Reyes is paid in Mexican pesos, a currency that has been losing value as the Fed, the central bank of the United States, has signaled plans to raise interest rates this year. In the parched terrain just south of the United States border, the prices of food and other necessities follow the dollar, whose value has been climbing. It is as if the Fed has slashed her pay.
Like millions of other people from Southeast Asia to Africa to Latin America, Ms. Reyes and her family are absorbing the consequences of a major shift playing out in the global economy.
As the Fed lifted rates on Wednesday, it added momentum to a steady stream of money that has been abandoning emerging markets and flowing toward American shores. With further Fed increases expected this year, developing countries are bracing for additional impacts: more investment departing, more currencies falling, more economies weakening.
By mandate, the Fed is answerable to the people of the United States.
When times are lean and businesses are reluctant to hire, the Fed makes money more available by nudging down rates. When times are good and concern builds about elevated prices, it cools things off by lifting rates and tightening credit.
Yet in reality, the Fed is the central banker to the world.
The dollar is the money used most widely as the repository of savings and as the currency for trade. When the Fed lowers rates, it makes the dollar less attractive, encouraging investors to seek rewards elsewhere. When the Fed lifts rates, investors switch gears, yanking capital and selling off other currencies.
Across China, hundreds of millions of people who have plowed their savings into real estate are vulnerable if too much money washes out at once and housing prices drop. In Turkey, shopkeepers who have withstood an attempted military coup, a subsequent crackdown and relentless terrorist attacks now grapple with the plunge of the Turkish lira, which has lifted the price of imported wares.
In Malaysia, businesses struggle with higher costs for items priced in dollars as the local currency falls. In Mexico, families are buffeted by a volatile currency that was already flagging on threats from President Trump to tax goods coming over the border.
"Every time the peso goes down, we can afford less and less," Ms. Reyes said on a recent evening, as pale desert light gave way to chilly darkness. "We're thinking about going back to Veracruz. People are leaving the factories and going back to their towns."
The Fed forces can be traumatic, especially in less affluent places.
As the financial crisis unfolded in 2008, the central bank took extraordinary measures to keep credit flowing. The result was a surge of investment into emerging markets.
More than $259 billion poured into developing countries the next year, according to the Institute of International Finance, a trade association. From 2010 to 2015, the annual capital flows to those places averaged $328 billion.
In spring 2013, the Fed surprised markets with plans to slow its stimulus efforts. Investors then stampeded out of emerging countries, sending currencies plunging in Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey. The episode became known as "the taper tantrum."
"The effect of interest rate increases on emerging countries is surprisingly strong," said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, an international trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "It's a big thing."
Most economists assume the rate increases expected this year will play out far less dramatically. The Fed has telegraphed its plans, giving investors time to prepare. Many emerging countries have amassed larger reserves of dollars, giving them ammunition against a drop in their currencies.
Still, some countries are already showing strains.
Turkey's currency has dropped about 25 percent against the dollar since May, and its government is operating with relatively meager reserves. The Mexican peso has been falling as Mr. Trump threatens to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. China swiftly reacted to the Fed's action with its own interest-rate increase on Thursday.
Within the investing world, the peso functions as a proxy for all developing countries -- the thing to bet against when sentiments go negative. "It's kind of the first port of call for anyone who thinks something bad is going to happen to emerging markets," said Mark Weisbrot, a director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Mexico is vulnerable."
Barricading the Exits
Chinese leaders have long nursed fears about an uncontrolled exodus of cash.
A currency plunge would increase prices for Chinese consumers, generating public anger. It could pop the real estate bubbles that have developed in many Chinese cities. That would stick China's banks with billions in losses while eliminating wealth for masses of people who have come to see real estate as their ticket to enrichment.
Allen Zhang, an electrician who works at a coal mine in the mountains of central China, lives in a modest house on the edge of Jincheng, a gritty city whose population has roughly quadrupled over the last quarter-century, to about 500,000.
Mr. Zhang has sought to supplement his $290-a-month pay by satisfying new demand for housing. He has tapped into his savings and used his handyman skills to add six rooms to his family home, renting the new quarters out to factory workers.
A buyer recently offered $350,000 for the house -- a sum equivalent to what Mr. Zhang would earn in the mines over a century. He turned it down.
"I want more," he said.
These are the expectations confronting Chinese officials as the Fed makes it more difficult to keep money inside the country.
During the 1990s, China ignored lectures from Washington on the merits of opening up capital markets. When the Asian financial crisis arrived in the late 1990s and investors pulled money out of the region, many economies were leveled. China suffered little, claiming vindication.
In the face of the Fed, China retains formidable powers to support the value of its currency. It is sitting on some $3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, money it can use to buy its currency in world markets.
But supporting China's currency, the renminbi, entails tightly controlling who can take money out of the country, an approach that stifles business. In November, the government decreed that overseas transfers of $5 million or more required vetting by regulators.
"Money in China cannot get out without going through a lot of hoops," said Zhu Ning, an economist at Tsinghua University.
For Vincent Lo, a billionaire real estate developer, such hoops amount to an operational problem.
Mr. Lo has long raised financing for projects in China by selling bonds in Hong Kong and Singapore. Before new controls, his companies had over $2 billion worth of renminbi sitting in bank accounts in mainland China -- more than enough to pay his debts coming due outside the mainland.
But once China began imposing more limits on the movement of money, his cash and his debts were on different sides of the divide.
Mr. Lo has raised $500 million in recent weeks by selling dollar-denominated bonds in Singapore.
"I don't want to get hit with not having the foreign currency to pay," he said. "I might just get a couple hundred million more."
What Could Go Wrong
A year ago, the lights were burning brightly for Vivy Yusof, a prominent Malaysian entrepreneur. So brightly that, on an episode of her reality show, she joked, "I'm Kim Kardashian."
Ms. Yusof is at once a symbol of what has gone economically right in Malaysia and, with the Fed now raising rates, how much could go wrong.
She is part of a group of tech-savvy business leaders who have emerged as Malaysia tries to evolve beyond its traditional dependence on selling commodities like palm oil and petroleum.
Economic growth has been flagging, a reality playing out across Southeast Asia as the region adjusts to China's slowdown. China is not buying commodities like it used to.
Malaysia faces potential political instability, as Prime Minister Najib Razak confronts accusations that people close to him harvested $1 billion from a state investment fund he oversaw. He denies wrongdoing.
Even before the Fed's move, global investors were fleeing. Foreigners once owned more than half of Malaysia's local bonds, but have sold off 17 percent of their holdings since August. Their nervousness grew in November as Malaysia imposed controls on the movement of money.
Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, has lost 8 percent against the dollar in the last year. For Malaysia's consumers -- and for companies that serve them -- imports are getting more expensive.
Ms. Yusof sells hijabs and other clothing, catering to cosmopolitan Muslims with a taste for distinctive patterns. Some of her garments are made in China. When the dollar rises, her profit margins are squeezed. And though online sales are brisk, business at her three mall stores has begun to slow.
"We used to do a lot better," she said.
Southeast Asia's leading budget airline, AirAsia, based in Malaysia, is preparing for worse. Its biggest costs are in dollars -- fuel and jet leases. Yet most revenue is in local currencies, meaning that the airline is taking in less just as it must spend more.
AirAsia has increased its hedging -- basically, insurance against whipsawing markets -- to three-quarters of its dollar-based fuel costs, from about half. It hopes to raise $1 billion and reduce debt by selling an airline leasing business.
AirAsia's founder and chief executive, Tony Fernandes, has been lobbying the Malaysian government to cut the fees it charges for airport slots. "I'm going around seeing varying cabinet ministers saying, 'You've got to get your costs down,"' he said.
Across Asia, in a trendy Istanbul neighborhood along the Bosporus, shopkeepers complain that their sales have been savaged by the plunge in the Turkish lira, which has lifted their prices for imported sporting goods, luggage and clothing.
The chaos of a recent spate of terrorist attacks seems increasingly a memory, as college students have returned to the neighborhood of Kadikoy. But foot traffic is having little impact on the till.
"There is no decline in number of customers," said Serdar Celik, who runs a luggage store that specializes in foreign brands. "But sales fell by 25 percent compared to last year. Prices rose by 20 percent for almost everything in the last month."
Hunkering Down
In Mexico, Francisca Hervis Reyes has no way to cut her own costs, beyond putting less food on the table.
Born in southern Mexico, where her parents were farmers, she headed north nearly three decades ago, to the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, in a reach for upward mobility. The borderlands were buzzing with factories known as maquiladoras -- plants that assemble components for American manufacturing operations. Soon, Nafta would fertilize more.
Ms. Reyes, 47, began making upholstery for car seats. Her wages purchased fresh fruit and meat. She hired a nanny to look after her three daughters.
These days, she makes auto parts that go into transmissions, earning 162 pesos per day, or about $8.40. Her husband earns 149 pesos per day -- about $7.75 -- making fuses for electrical boxes.
But as the peso has surrendered roughly one-fourth of its value over the last five years, their living standard has deteriorated.
Throughout Mexico, the weak peso has been lifting prices for everything from cars to cooking gas to tortillas. As of February, prices were rising at an annualized pace of nearly 5 percent, Mexico's highest rate of inflation in seven years.
Mexico's central bank has been steadily lifting rates to protect its currency in the face of a possible trade war with the United States. With the Fed adding pressure, many analysts expect Mexico's central bank to deliver a fresh rate increase this month.
Chicken, beef, milk and vegetables have all risen in price, with many of these items imported from the United States. Ms. Reyes's family subsists mainly on beans and pasta.
She pointed toward a bodega across a patch of gravel from her house. "Eggs are twice the price they were six months ago," she said. "We've been buying less."
She used to send money back to her family in Veracruz, where one of her sisters is blind. Not anymore.
Inside the concrete-block home she shares with her husband, their three daughters and three grandsons, the ceiling is stained from leaks. The walls are crumbling. Two windows are boarded up and held together by masking tape, having been damaged by a rock fight between two gangs.
As the family prepared to share a lone queen-size bed, positioning their bodies sideways to maximize space, they had no heat to cut the 44-degree chill.
"We use blankets," Ms. Reyes said, "and what love we have."

Full text: Stocks held steady on Thursday, and bond prices gave back some of their big gains from a rally after the Federal Reserve increased a benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 3.88 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,381.38. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,934.55. The Nasdaq composite index rose 0.71 points, or 0.01 percent, to 5,900.76.
Yields increased as bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.53 percent from 2.50 percent late Wednesday. It had plunged 0.11 percentage points late on Tuesday, after the Fed doused speculation that would become more aggressive in raising rates.
The Fed hopes to lift rates gradually from record lows, where they stayed for seven years after the 2008 financial crisis. With economic data and inflation picking up recently, some investors began to consider the possibility that the Fed would try to raise rates four times this year. But the Fed held to its forecast for three.
That gradual pace is one reason investors remain enthusiastic about stocks despite rising rates, which historically have spooked stock owners because they can slow economic growth and corporate profits. With rates starting from such a low base and the pace set to be so slow, it may not be fair to call these Fed moves "hiking" or "tightening," said Richard Taylor, a fixed-income client portfolio manager at American Century.
"We are in the beginning stages of a re-normalization of interest rates," Mr. Taylor said.
The slight rise in yields on Thursday dulled the appeal of dividend-paying stocks. Utility stocks in the S.&P. 500 index lost 1.1 percent, the biggest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Health care stocks were also weaker than the rest of the index, after a strong start to the year.
Technology stocks did better, led by Oracle, which reported stronger revenue and earnings for its latest quarter than analysts had expected. Oracle, a computer technology company, jumped $2.68, or 6.2 percent, to close at $45.73 for the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500.
GoPro, which makes wearable cameras, surged after it announced a cost-cutting plan and said would stick to its forecast for 2017 profits. Its stock rose $1.16, or 15.8 percent, to $8.51.
Stock markets across the Atlantic were also strong, with the CAC 40 in France and the DAX in Germany up 0.6 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.6 percent and closed at a record high.
Investors had been nervous about the Dutch parliamentary election on Wednesday because candidates ran on pledges to get the Netherlands out of the European Union and to close borders to migrants from Muslim nations. After the British vote last summer to leave the European Union, investors worried that a wave of nationalism across Europe could eventually break up the European Union.
The party led by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte won over Geert Wilders, who campaigned against the European Union.
In Asia, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo rose 0.1 percent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 2.1 percent, and the Kospi in Seoul rose 0.8 percent.
Benchmark crude resumed its slide, slipping 11 cents to settle at $48.75 a barrel. It was the eighth drop for oil in the last nine days. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 7 cents to $51.74 a barrel.
Gold rose $26.40 to settle at $1,226.50 per ounce, silver rose 41 cents to $17.33 per ounce and copper rose 2 cents to $2.68 per pound.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- After eight years of chafing under President Barack Obama's fiscal priorities, congressional Republicans were longing for a budget proposal that did the two things that have become the party's mantra: Make broad cuts to federal spending and reduce the federal deficit. Instead, President Trump sent them a budget even many Republicans found difficult to love.
To fulfill a campaign promise to leave Social Security and Medicare -- which represent more than 40 percent of annual federal spending -- untouched while constructing an expensive border wall, Mr. Trump went after a relatively small pot of money, discretionary spending, goring Republicans' pet programs in the process.
He does propose increasing military spending by 10 percent, something many conservatives would also like to see, but he probably cannot unilaterally break through legal budget caps, imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government's statutory borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling.
Mr. Trump ran as a populist and stacked his cabinet like a conservative, yet he delivered a budget that in many respects is neither. The result is deeply unsatisfying for many in his party, which has been yearning for a unified government to finally make major changes to entitlement programs to bring the deficit in line.
"This is a good budget if you want to spend your time fighting small fires," said former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who as the Republican chairman of the Senate Budget Committee spent years trying to rally lawmakers to do the hard work to balance the budget. "It's a statement of policy, which is legitimate, that the government is too big," Mr. Gregg said. "As a practical matter, it does not affect the big issues that drive that."
Congress could have eliminated every penny of domestic spending at its annual discretion this year, and it would not have balanced the federal budget, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, much less rid the nation of its nearly $20 trillion in government debt -- which Mr. Trump told voters he could do easily in eight years.
It is precisely what conservatives have wanted to control.
"The fact is that until the president and Congress are willing to address the real drivers of our debt, Medicare and Social Security, we will be complicit in shackling future generations with the financial burden of our own lack of discipline," said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. "That is not a legacy I want to leave."
Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's budget director, who as a member of the House was one of the biggest deficit hawks, was confronted with the budget's failure to deal with the debt in a news conference with reporters on Thursday.
"It's a fair question," he said. "I would just suggest to you it's not the right time for the question. The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with the debt. It even doesn't even deal with the deficit. It is simply the first part of the appropriations process."
The budget document represents a broad-brush aspiration for Mr. Trump, leaving it to the House and Senate appropriations committees to do all the painful work, like finding a way to pay for a wall along the Mexican border that the White House wants.
But trying to pass appropriations bills with large cuts to popular domestic programs seems almost impossible in both chambers, especially the Senate, leading Congress on another path to short-term spending measures that Republicans have long wanted to escape.
The Congressional Budget Office foresees a federal deficit for the 2018 fiscal year of $487 billion, rising steadily from there until it reaches $1 trillion in 2023. But that is driven all by an aging population, rising health care costs and rising interest payments from the escalating debt.
Projected declines in discretionary spending under Mr. Trump's plan would be more than swallowed by rising payments to Social Security and Medicare because the population aged 65 and older is expected to grow by 39 percent through 2027. In that time, spending on people 65 and older who receive Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement income will rise from 37 percent of federal spending in 2017 to 45 percent in 10 years.
And many of his proposed cuts are at odds with congressional priorities.
His budget cuts spending for the National Institutes of Health, which lawmakers gave a big funding increase last year to help attack cancer and other diseases; community block grants, which help feed hungry children (a Democratic priority); and local law enforcement (popular with Republicans); as well as pet programs like funding to care for the Great Lakes, which Midwestern lawmakers have fought hard to maintain.
"The president proposes and Congress disposes," said Representative Charlie Dent, a Republican appropriator from Pennsylvania. "We can't finance a defense buildup entirely on the back of domestic, nondefense spending. It's not realistic and unfair."
Mr. Trump's budget also shows little regard for the political sensitivities of his party. His proposal to restart licensing for a nuclear waste repository in Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, creates a headache for Senator Dean Heller, a Republican who is up for re-election in that state next year. His response was swift and blunt. "As has been stated in the past, Yucca is dead, and this reckless proposal will not revive it," he said in a statement.
It even takes an ax to programs that are important to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, by proposing cuts in funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission and some air service that would probably eliminate two airports in his state.
Mr. McConnell on Thursday went in search of a silver lining.
"I'm pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets," he said in a statement. "These are positive steps in the right direction. I look forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring."
Mr. Trump is hardly alone in putting forth a budget dismissed by his own party. Mr. Obama pushed the idea of changing the way the inflation rate was calculated to slow the growth of big programs like Social Security, a proposal many Democrats opposed. President George W. Bush pressed to partially privatize Social Security, and many Republicans disliked that idea.
But it is striking to read Mr. Trump's budget and see clearly mixed messages from the opening pages delivered by Mr. Mulvaney, who praised the budget as a debt crusher, and from Mr. Trump, who emphasized his increases in military spending.
Those contradictions are among the many reasons that even members of Mr. Trump's party see his budget more as a mere suggestion than an edict.
"Historically, presidential budgets do not fare well with Congress," said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year would slash the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent and cut State Department spending by a similar amount in a brash upending of the government's priorities, according to congressional staff members familiar with the plan. The budget outline, to be unveiled on Thursday, is more of a broad political statement than a detailed plan for spending and taxation. But it represents Mr. Trump's first real effort to translate his bold but vague campaign themes into the minutiae of governance. The president would funnel $54 billion in additional funding into defense programs, beef up immigration enforcement and significantly reduce the nondefense federal work force to further the "deconstruction of the administrative state," in the words of Mr. Trump's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon.
Yet for all its headline-grabbing bold strokes -- and the White House claims that it will reset the process of Washington policy making -- major elements of the plan have already been declared dead on arrival by the Republican leadership in Congress, and much of the fiscal fine print will be filled in by Capitol Hill lawmakers and their aides over the next month.
House appropriations subcommittees began reviewing the plan late Wednesday. Among the cuts: drastic reductions in the 60-year-old State Department Food for Peace Program, which sends food to poor countries hit by war or natural disasters, and the elimination of the Department of Transportation's Essential Air Service program, which subsidizes flights to rural airports.
The plan to be released at 7 a.m. tomorrow is a "skinny budget," a pared-down first draft of the line-by-line appropriations request submitted by first-term administrations during their first few months. A broader budget will be released later in the spring that will include Mr. Trump's proposals for taxation as well as the bulk of government spending -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs.
Mr. Trump's version is likely to be even skinnier than usual, a result of the chaos, inexperience and staffing problems encountered by the Trump White House over the first two months.
Issues with coordination plagued Wednesday's briefing sessions: Republican communications staff members, who usually coordinate their messaging, complained that they had been given no White House guidance on its details or how to sell the plan, which covers the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
In addition to the cuts at the E.P.A. and the State Department, Mr. Trump's team is expected to propose a wide array of cuts to public education, to transportation programs like Amtrak and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, including the complete elimination of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which funds popular programs like Meals on Wheels, housing assistance and other community assistance efforts.
In recent years, far smaller proposed cuts to the popular grant program, which includes flexible funding for a variety of housing and community projects, created a bipartisan uproar that nearly scuttled the entire budget-making process.
The E.P.A. is, arguably, the hardest-hit agency under Mr. Trump's budget proposal: He wants to cut spending by nearly a third -- $2.6 billion from its current level of $8.2 billion, according to a person who had been briefed on the proposal but was not authorized to speak publicly about it.
That would take the budget down to about $5.7 billion, its lowest level in 40 years, adjusted for inflation. In an initial draft, the White House had proposed cutting about $2 billion from the agency's budget, taking it down to just over $6 billion, according to an aide familiar with the plan.
The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has himself spoken out against some of the core missions of the agency he leads, went to the White House to request a smaller cut after the White House budget office first presented him its preferred spending level. He pressed for about $7 billion, according to the person. Instead, the White House slashed his budget down even further, to about $5.7 billion.
Mr. Trump's proposed cuts to the E.P.A. are a magnitude greater even than those envisioned by congressional Republicans, many of whom forcefully oppose the agency's regulatory agenda. Last year, the House spending subcommittee that controls the E.P.A.'s budget proposed funding the agency at $8 billion, cutting just $291 million from President Barack Obama's request.
Representative Ken Calvert, the California Republican who is the chairman of that panel, said in an interview this year that he did not anticipate cutting the E.P.A.'s popular state grant programs, which fund projects like restoring the Great Lakes and cleaning and redeveloping formerly contaminated industrial sites.
The proposed State Department cuts, which leaked this month, have already created a backlash among some Capitol Hill Republicans.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has already said Senate Republicans will not agree to deep cuts to the $50 billion budget for the State Department and United States Agency for International Development initially proposed by the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget.
Mr. Trump's original plan was to slash the State Department by as much as 37 percent -- but budget director Mick Mulvaney has reduced the cuts to 28 percent to 31 percent, at the urging of legislators and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
"This is definitely dead on arrival," Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters at the Capitol late last month of the proposed cuts to the diplomatic corps and foreign aid.
Mr. Tillerson also requested greater discretion in choosing where to make the cuts -- although the White House instructed him to leave untouched the $3 billion annual foreign aid payment to Israel, officials said.

Full text: The economy will keep growing just enough to put more Americans back to work, but without overheating to generate excessive inflation. American workers will see gradual pay raises that keep compensation rising faster than inflation. Interest rates will rise gradually, while staying low by historical standards. And that's all before accounting for any major stimulative policies that may emerge from the Trump administration and Congress. That was the view of the economy sketched by the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, at her first news conference of 2017 on Wednesday. In short, the Fed believes that after nearly eight years of trying to nurse the economy back to health, its work is nearly done.
The general sense of rosiness isn't really anything new -- for years, Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, have forecast that the economy will steadily converge toward a Goldilocks-like state of being neither too hot nor too cold.
Two things have changed. First, that day now feels imminent, with the unemployment rate at 4.7 percent and inflation closing on the 2 percent the Fed thinks best. That is a key reason the Fed raised its interest rate target Wednesday. Second, markets now believe the Fed's message that higher rates are on the way; bond markets suggest that the Fed will actually follow through with its intentions on gradual interest rate rises. You couldn't say that a year ago.
"The simple message is: The economy is doing well," Ms. Yellen told reporters.
The overwhelming message was of gradualism -- both on the rate of economic improvement and the Fed's own efforts to wind down its era of low interest rates.
She suggested no urgency toward a tightening of the money supply that might suggest a hair-trigger readiness to accelerate interest rate increases. Ms. Yellen evinced little fear that the Fed is behind the curve, suggesting that two more interest rate increases are on the way over the remainder of 2017.
This will, if these plans stay in force, remain the slowest cycle of interest rate increases in modern history.
She also displayed little of the fear of setback that has been pervasive at the Fed for years. The central bank has spent the last eight years trying to help the recovery along with a series of monetary interventions; more than any other institution in Washington, it owns the recovery.
That has also meant that the Fed has acted with haste to signs of softening. In the winter of 2016, for example, barely a year ago, the central bank backed off plans for more rate increases after a steep stock market sell-off and a rise of economic pessimism.
After years of persistently undershooting its 2 percent goal for inflation, the Fed explicitly, if subtly, raised the possibility on Wednesday of erring in the other direction. The central bank's policy committee said it would be monitoring "actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal."
In this context, "symmetric" implies that it aims for 2 percent inflation and would be equally displeased by inflation that was too high or too low. That implies that the Fed is not inclined to overreact to the possibility that inflation could drift slightly -- and in the Fed's view temporarily -- above 2 percent in the coming months.
After the announcement, the interest rates on Treasury bonds actually fell. That implies that markets were ready for signals of even more aggressive rate rises.
And the clearest signal that the Fed is in steady-as-she-goes territory was in how Ms. Yellen talked about the possibility of new tax cuts or infrastructure spending that might arrive in the months ahead.
There has been "no reassessment" of those odds, she said. Presumably if that happens, the Fed would indeed raise interest rates more quickly, but Ms. Yellen shows no desire to pre-emptively get ahead of what the rest of the government is doing.
Given the vagueness and uncertainty around those plans, that maintains options for officials at the Fed. If policies along those lines materialize, they can plug them into their models and accelerate the pace of rate increases; if Congress is bogged down in stalemate, they won't.
It has been a long time coming, and Ms. Yellen went out of her way to avoid mounting a metaphorical "Mission Accomplished" banner. But in the substance of her policies, it is evident that the Fed feels it has mostly accomplished its job.

Trump Budget Seeks Big Tilt to the Military

Abstract: President Trump will send a budget to Congress on Thursday that sharply reorders the nation's priorities by spending billions of dollars on defending the southern border and bolstering the Pentagon while severely cutting funds for foreign aid, poverty programs and the environment. Funding to several smaller government agencies that have long been targets of conservatives -- like the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts -- would be axed entirely. The proposed $54 billion increase in military spending -- a 10 percent increase -- would also require a repeal of spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act; Democrats oppose such a move without equal spending increases for domestic programs. The brunt of the cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services would be at the National Institutes of Health, the country's medical research hub. Mr. Trump's team also proposed a wide array of cuts to public education, Amtrak and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, including eliminating the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which funds popular programs like Meals on Wheels, housing assistance and other community assistance efforts. Much of the money saved by these cuts would go to national security programs. Besides the military, the Department of Homeland Security would also receive an infusion of cash.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump will send a budget to Congress on Thursday that sharply reorders the nation's priorities by spending billions of dollars on defending the southern border and bolstering the Pentagon while severely cutting funds for foreign aid, poverty programs and the environment. The budget would fulfill Mr. Trump's campaign promise to shock Washington by slashing the government work force -- but it is virtually ensured to be discarded by Hill Republicans who see many of Mr. Trump's cuts as too rushed, indiscriminate and reckless.
"You can't drain the swamp and leave all of the people in it," Mick Mulvaney, the White House's budget director, said during a briefing on Wednesday.
The budget would cut the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent, the State Department by 28 percent and Health and Human Services by 17.9 percent. Funding to several smaller government agencies that have long been targets of conservatives -- like the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts -- would be axed entirely.
The chances of Mr. Trump's first budget passing Congress in its current form are slim. Many of the proposals would be nonstarters for Democrats, and some would be problematic for Republicans. The proposed $54 billion increase in military spending -- a 10 percent increase -- would also require a repeal of spending caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act; Democrats oppose such a move without equal spending increases for domestic programs.
The most significant cuts would be at the E.P.A., which the Trump administration has accused of overreach. The president wants to trim $2.6 billion from the agency's budget, in part by cutting about 3,200 positions, about a fifth of the department's work force.
If enacted, the proposal would cut the agency's budget to its lowest level in 40 years, adjusted for inflation. That would mean eliminating funding for climate change research, closing state environmental programs and ending regional projects like the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has bipartisan support.
Mr. Trump would also cut funding to the United Nations for its climate change efforts, and curb contributions to its peacekeeping efforts. Contributions to the World Bank would be cut by $650 million, and economic and development assistance would be "refocused" to countries of greatest strategic interest to the United States.
The brunt of the cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services would be at the National Institutes of Health, the country's medical research hub. The $403 million currently used for training nurses and other medical professionals would also be eliminated.
Mr. Trump's team also proposed a wide array of cuts to public education, Amtrak and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, including eliminating the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant program, which funds popular programs like Meals on Wheels, housing assistance and other community assistance efforts.
Much of the money saved by these cuts would go to national security programs.
Besides the military, the Department of Homeland Security would also receive an infusion of cash. An additional $2.8 billion would go largely to pay for a wall along the border with Mexico and the hiring of 500 Border Patrol Agents and 1,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers next year. The budget also calls for the hiring of 20 lawyers in the Justice Department who would work to obtain land along the border for the wall.
The White House is expected to make a supplemental request of $1.5 billion on Thursday to get work started on the wall this year.
Government funding for the current fiscal year will run out on April 28, and the 2018 budget needs to be in place by October. Democrats in Congress warned this week that there could be a government shutdown if Republicans insisted on including funding for the wall in their request.
The $1.1 trillion plan is a "skinny budget," a pared-down first draft of the line-by-line appropriations request submitted by first-term administrations during their first few months. A broader budget will be released in the spring that will include Mr. Trump's tax proposals as well as the bulk of government spending -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs.
Mr. Trump's version is even skinnier than usual, a result of Mr. Mulvaney's drawn-out confirmation process in the Senate.
As reports of Mr. Trump's cuts trickled out over the last month, some Republicans made their concerns known. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina declared the proposed cuts to the State Department "dead on arrival," and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said that foreign aid was a small investment that played an important national security role.
Mr. Trump's proposed cuts to the E.P.A. are a magnitude greater even than those envisioned by congressional Republicans, many of whom forcefully oppose the agency's regulatory agenda. Last year, the House spending subcommittee that controls the agency's budget proposed funding the agency at $8 billion, cutting just $291 million from President Barack Obama's request.
The E.P.A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who as Oklahoma's attorney general spoke out against some of the agency's core missions, went to the White House on Wednesday to request a smaller cut after the budget office first presented its preferred spending level. He pressed for about $7 billion, according a person familiar with the talks. Instead, the White House slashed his budget even further, to about $5.7 billion.
At the State Department, news of the proposed cuts -- rumored for weeks -- were met with a mixture of disbelief and defiance. Much of the senior staff on the building's seventh floor was recently reassigned, and nearly all of the department's top political posts remain unfilled.
With so few senior leaders, a top-to-bottom departmental overhaul would be difficult.
Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is expected to be given wide latitude in how to apportion any cuts. Having spent his career at Exxon Mobil, Mr. Tillerson barely knows the department, and he has so far been unable to choose a deputy steeped in the ways of Foggy Bottom.
Under a 28 percent cut, the department's $54 billion budget would go down to $39 billion, a number the department has not seen in inflation-adjusted terms since the Iraq and Afghanistan wars added enormous costs in staffing and security.
Many veteran diplomats said that injecting money into the Defense Department while slashing the State Department made little sense, since the functions of the two go hand in hand.
"We learned in both Iraq and Afghanistan that our military needs an effective civilian partner if victories on the battlefields are going to be converted into a sustainable peace," said Stephen J. Hadley, Mr. Bush's national security adviser. "And only a sustainable peace ensures that post-conflict states do not return again to becoming safe havens for terrorists."
Steve Bell, a budget expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said Mr. Trump's proposed cuts were the most severe in more than a half century. "When we passed the Reagan budget, we did not have cuts in the domestic programs anywhere near this size," said Mr. Bell, who was staff director of the Senate Budget Committee from 1981 to 1986.
Mr. Mulvaney acknowledged that lawmakers of both parties were likely to resist changes that would affect pet projects in their states. However, he said that Mr. Trump's budget was a sign that the president is a man of his word.
"We went to what the president said during the campaign," Mr. Mulvaney said, "and we turned those policies into numbers."

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street rose Wednesday for their biggest gain in two weeks and easily absorbed the Federal Reserve's latest increase in interest rates, a move that was widely expected. What was perhaps unexpected was the big drop in bond yields and the dollar's value against other currencies after the Fed's announcement. The central bank stressed that it planned to move gradually and stuck to its projection that it would raise rates a total of three times this year. That cooled expectations that the Fed might move more aggressively.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 19.81 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,385.26. It had been up through the day, and the gains accelerated immediately after the Fed made its announcement.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 112.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 20,950.10. The Nasdaq composite picked up 43.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,900.05.
The Fed raised short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, its third such move since the end of 2015. The move was widely expected after various Fed officials gave speeches telegraphing the increase and reports showed that the economy had continued to strengthen and inflation had picked up.
The encouraging data led some investors to speculate that the Fed might raise rates more aggressively. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is heavily influenced by changes in Fed policy, jumped on expectations for Fed action, for example. It climbed nearly a quarter of a percentage point in a little more than two weeks to 1.38 percent late Tuesday.
When the Fed said that it was sticking with its forecast for three rate increases this year, the two-year yield gave up nearly half of that increase in just a few minutes. It later pared its loss and sat at 1.29 percent late Wednesday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.49 percent from 2.60 percent late Tuesday, and the 30-year yield fell to 3.11 percent from 3.18 percent. Both remained higher than they were a few weeks ago, though.
The dollar sank to 113.22 Japanese yen from 114.72 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0632, and the British pound climbed to $1.2297 from $1.2145.
The drop in bond yields shined a warm light on stocks in industries known for paying relatively big dividends. Lower bond yields make the income provided by dividends more attractive, and real-estate investment trusts in the S.&P. 500 jumped 1.9 percent. Utilities rose 1.6 percent.
The day's biggest gains came from energy stocks. Those in the S.&P. 500 rose by 2.1 percent after the price of oil climbed Wednesday, the first time that's happened in more than a week. A barrel of benchmark crude rose $1.14 to settle at $48.86. The 2.4 percent jump was the largest since January. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, added 89 cents to $51.81 a barrel in London.
The weaker dollar also helped to lift prices for metals. Gold settled early in the afternoon at $1,200.10 per ounce, down $1.80. But it climbed following the Fed's announcement and was trading at $1,221.20 late Wednesday.
The Labor Department said consumer prices were 2.7 percent higher in February than a year earlier. After excluding the costs of food and energy, inflation was 2.2 percent.
In overseas trading, the German DAX stock index rose 0.2 percent, the U.K. FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 percent, and the CAC 40 in France was 0.2 percent higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index lost 0.2 percent, and South Korea's Kospi was little changed. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong edged 0.1 percent lower.

Full text: The Federal Reserve, which raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the second time in three months, this time to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent, is finally moving toward the end of its nine-year-old economic stimulus campaign, which began in the depths of the financial crisis. But Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said at a news conference after the decision was announced that the Fed did not share the optimism of stock market investors and some business executives that economic growth is gaining speed. It still plans to move slowly because the economy continues to grow slowly. She suggested that the Fed would have plenty of time to adjust its plans should President Trump and Congress cut taxes or spend massively on infrastructure.
Her announcement was full of confidence. But it certainly was not ebullient. "The data have not notably strengthened," Ms. Yellen told reporters. "We haven't changed the outlook. We think we're moving on the same course we've been on."
The Fed said that the United States economy continued to chug along, expanding at a "moderate pace." Employers are hiring, consumers are spending and businesses -- the laggards in recent months -- are starting to plow a little more money into their operations, too.
The Fed's sobriety did not appear to make much of an impression on investors. The stock market's heady march that began after Mr. Trump's election continued apace. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.84 percent to close at 2,385.26 Wednesday, moving up sharply after the announcement. Some said the Fed was still a long way from doing anything that might hurt.
"The first four to eight rate hikes are the low-hanging fruit," said Deron McCoy, the chief investment officer at SEIA, a Los Angeles firm. "The real test will be whether the economy can withstand positive real rates. And that still seems to be a 2019 topic."
Some analysts said the Fed will want to see an impact from its actions. "Policy makers hike rates to tighten financial conditions," said Ellen Zentner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "If this easing of financial conditions on the back of today's hike are sustained, that would tell policy makers they need to do more."
Ms. Zentner said she expected the Fed to raise rates again at its June meeting. The Fed's policy-making committee next meets on May 2 and 3.
She noted that the Fed's longer-term outlook is less clear. Ms. Yellen's term as Fed chairwoman ends in February, and Mr. Trump could then replace her.
The Fed, charged with maximizing employment and moderating inflation, is close to achieving both goals. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in February, consistent with the normal churn of people moving among jobs. And after several years of concern that prices were not rising fast enough, inflation is reviving. The Fed's preferred measure rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in January, close to its 2 percent annual target.
"The basis for today's decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy," Ms. Yellen said at the postmeeting news conference. "And it's been doing nicely."
The Fed, which had made more inflation a central objective, said on Wednesday that it was now focused on stabilizing inflation. Ms. Yellen took the opportunity to note that inflation may now rise a bit above 2 percent, just as it has been below 2 percent the last few years. "It's a reminder 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation," she said. "It's a target."
The Fed's increased confidence was reflected in a new round of policy forecasts it also published Wednesday. An increased number of Fed officials are expecting to raise rates at least twice more this year. Only three of the 17 officials who submitted forecasts expect the central bank to move more slowly. There was a similar coalescing around tighter policy for the following two years, marking the first time in recent years that the Fed's quarterly economic forecasts have shifted toward a prediction of tighter monetary policy.
This is the third time the Fed has raised rates since the financial crisis. The first hike came at the end of 2015 and the second almost exactly one year later. This time the Fed waited just three months. The benchmark rate remains below 1 percent, a very low level.
People with credit card debt are likely to see an immediate increase of about a quarter percentage point in their interest rates. The effect on longer-term loans is less direct, but the average rate on a 30-year mortgage rose by half a percentage point over the last year.
The nation's largest borrower, the federal government, will also feel the pinch of higher rates. The Congressional Budget Office expects federal interest payments, measured as a share of the economy, to double over the next decade.
Savers are unlikely to benefit immediately. Banks tend to raise interest rates on loans more quickly than they raise rates on deposits. Last week, the average rate on a six-month certificate of deposit was 0.14 percent. Last year at this time: 0.13 percent.
The Fed's move to raise rates puts it on course for a slow-motion collision with President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to increase economic growth through policies including cuts in taxation and regulation and more spending on infrastructure and defense.
Fed officials have emphasized that the economy is already growing at roughly its maximum sustainable pace; faster growth would therefore lead to faster increases in interest rates.
Some economists and liberal activists argue that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, an economist at the University of Rochester and a former member of the Fed's policy-making committee, noted that strong economic growth continued to pull people into the job market while wage growth remained relatively weak. That suggests, he said, that the economy has not yet returned to full employment.
"We should be seeing faster wage growth with this level of employment growth if we were close to full employment," Mr. Kocherlakota said on Twitter before the Fed's decision.
Mr. Kocherlakota's successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, cast the sole vote against raising rates on Wednesday.
The Fed's assessment of economic conditions remained quite measured. The economy expanded by just 1.6 percent in 2016, and there is little sign of an acceleration during the first quarter. Fed officials continue to forecast a Goldilocks economy, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.5 percent and inflation around 2 percent for the next three years.
Ms. Yellen played down surveys showing a sharp rise in the optimism of consumers and business executives since the presidential election, noting there is little evidence that such surveys predict spending decisions.
She said that Fed officials spoke regularly to business leaders, and that many were undoubtedly in "a much more optimistic frame of mind." But she added that many of those executives have adopted a wait-and-see attitude -- just like the Fed itself.

Full text: The Federal Reserve has been in the business of raising or cutting interest rates to better steer the changing dynamic of the American economy. Here are some pivotal moments of rate changes in the last 40 years. >
1979 TO THE 1980S
Taming Inflation
>
Fed chairman: Paul A. Volcker
>
In October 1979, Mr. Volcker held a late-Saturday-night news conference to announce a bold new package of measures to tame runaway inflation that was in part a result of oil price increases. The new policy raised the Fed's benchmark rate by 4 percentage points, to 15.5 percent, in a month. By late 1980, rates reached a record high of 20 percent.
Raising rates is often seen as a direct way to control inflation. Think of it as two sides of a seesaw: As one side goes up, it pushes the other down. Higher rates make it more expensive to borrow, slowing down an overcharged economy and restraining prices.
By using that tool in such powerful fashion, Mr. Volcker risked sending the economy into recession, which happened twice during his tenure (in 1980 and 1981-82). Among other things, his campaign brought about a spike in unemployment. And with interest rates so high, both political parties attacked the Volcker-led fight on inflation.
But by 1983, inflation had fallen below 4 percent, barely three years after a stretch in which it averaged 14.6 percent. Today, Mr. Volcker's actions are seen as setting the table for the long economic expansions of the 1980s and '90s. As a result of the Fed's intervention, both unemployment and inflation were tamed.
>
1987 to the 1990s
Black Monday and Economic Worries
>
Fed chairman: Alan Greenspan
>
Just a few weeks into Mr. Greenspan's tenure in 1987, the Fed lowered rates after the stock market crashed, and he encouraged banks to continue lending.
In the early years of Mr. Greenspan's tenure, inflation rose above 5 percent as the economy improved, and he responded with a sharp increase in interest rates. He faced criticism for failing to cut rates quickly enough as the country fell into a recession in 1990-91.
But the 1990s were later marked by the longest peacetime expansion in the nation's history. Mr. Greenspan resisted pressure to raise interest rates as unemployment declined. He argued that increased productivity, including the fruits of the internet revolution, had increased the pace of sustainable growth.
>
Sept. 11 Attacks and After
Rates at Historic Lows
>
Fed chairman: Alan Greenspan
>
After having presided over what was known as the Great Moderation -- nearly two decades of strong growth, modest inflation and low unemployment, with just a few bumps along the way -- Mr. Greenspan was credited with acting quickly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the ensuing recession.
Although the recession was brief, economic growth continued to be sluggish. By 2003, the Fed cut its benchmark rate to 1 percent, a 45-year low then regarded as the lowest viable level.
>
2004
Ending Stimulus
>
Fed chairman: Alan Greenspan
>
As the economy revived, the Fed removed its stimulus program slowly, raising interest rates at 17 consecutive meetings. (Some economists now argue that the Fed should have moved more aggressively and that its slow retreat helped to fuel the housing bubble.)
>
2008
The Great Recession
Fed chairman: Ben S. Bernanke
>
When Mr. Bernanke became chairman in 2006, the economy seemed to be humming along. But after the collapse in housing prices, the economy was plunged into what has become known as the Great Recession.
After the demise of Lehman Brothers in 2008 brought the financial system to the brink of disaster, Mr. Bernanke entered uncharted territory, pushing interest rates nearly to zero. With little leverage on rates, he also persuaded colleagues to start buying bonds, a supplemental strategy to stimulate the economy known as quantitative easing.
>
2012
Inflation Target
Fed chairman: Ben S. Bernanke
>
In January 2012, the Fed formally adopted a 2 percent inflation target, although it found itself at that point trying to raise inflation to that level rather than driving it down. The Fed was increasingly worried that sluggish inflation was restraining economic growth.
>
2015
Putting the Crisis Behind
Fed chairwoman: Janet L. Yellen
>
In 2015, a year after Ms. Yellen took over as chairwoman, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. It cited the steady growth of employment and other economic measures, and signaled that it expected to raise rates more quickly in the coming years to prevent the economy from overheating.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's point man on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is a longtime Trump Organization lawyer with no government or diplomatic experience. His liaison to African-American leaders is a former reality-TV villain with a penchant for r√©sum√© inflation. And his Oval Office gatekeeper is a bullet-headed former New York City cop best known for smacking a protester on the head. Every president sweeps into office with a coterie of friends and hangers-on who sometimes have minimal experience in the arcana of the federal government. But few have arrived with a contingent more colorful and controversial than that of Mr. Trump, whose White House is peppered with assistants and advisers whose principal qualification is their long friendship with Mr. Trump and his family.
There is Jason Greenblatt, the former Trump Organization lawyer, whose portfolio now includes peace in the West Bank, international trade deals and relations with Cuba. Omarosa Manigault, whose star turn on the "The Apprentice" propelled the show's breakout first season, is now among about two dozen aides with the rank of assistant to the president -- and one of the few with walk-in privileges for the Oval Office.
Most other staff members must go through Keith Schiller, who rose from part-time security guard at the Trump Organization to its director of security. Mr. Schiller is now the director of Oval Office operations, controlling physical access to a president whose whims and frustrations routinely send aides throughout the building scurrying to deflect, defend and justify.
The influence of longtime Trump friends and associates -- some of them with vague portfolios -- comes as a leadership void has been created by the Trump administration's slow pace in filling top jobs in many agencies. It has also added to the confusion of a West Wing already legendary for its power struggles, while bewildering Washington policy hands.
"Titles do matter," said Paul C. Light, a presidential scholar at New York University. "You don't say: 'You are my buddy; you are my friend; you were with me on my television show. I'm going to give you a really great title.' These are not things to be handed out like candy."
To help him wrangle Silicon Valley chief executives and modernize United States government technology systems, Mr. Trump has hired Reed Cordish, the scion of a Baltimore real estate dynasty who is married to a close college friend of Ivanka Trump, who set them up. In a statement, Mr. Cordish said his real estate experience had taught him how to successfully meld public and private interests.
The president also recently hired Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and a Trump family friend, to work in the White House Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mr. Giuliani, 31, who made headlines after he sued Duke University for kicking him off the college golf team, previously worked in sales and marketing at a small suburban New York financial firm.
Personal relationships with the president often bestow a power exceeding official West Wing job titles. Valerie Jarrett, a businesswoman, former city official in Chicago and longtime friend of the Obamas, was renowned for her unmatched access to President Barack Obama and reach into policy matters far beyond her official portfolio.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House press spokeswoman, said Mr. Trump had recruited highly skilled advisers with refreshingly different backgrounds. "Even though some of the staff doesn't have government experience it doesn't mean they are amateurs," she wrote in an email. "President Trump has promised to change Washington and you can't do that by putting Washington bureaucrats in charge of everything."
If Mr. Trump appears more eager than past presidents to bring in longtime associates with limited Washington experience, friends said, it stems partly from his background of four decades at the helm of a closely held family business, with no experience in public service.
He has had to assemble a White House team largely from scratch, tapping a party apparatus he believed had tried to deny him the nomination and a Republican policy elite that had largely opposed him. The bulk of his senior White House aides were unknown to him until two years ago.
"Trump doesn't have a longtime staff of political aides; these loyalists fill that vacuum," said Christopher Ruddy, a friend and chief executive of Newsmax Media, the conservative news site.
"He is figuring out who he can depend on."
Enforcer and Negotiator
Mr. Schiller, 58, a 6-foot-3 former narcotics detective, has protected Mr. Trump for 18 years. The head of a Praetorian Guard of private security detectives, Mr. Schiller occupied a Trump Tower office on the same floor as his boss and learned, he said, to anticipate his wishes.
A fierce protector of Mr. Trump's image and interests, he physically removed a reporter from a 2015 news conference on the campaign trail after he repeatedly questioned Mr. Trump without being called on.
Five activists later sued Mr. Schiller, the Trump Organization and other Trump security guards, claiming they had been assaulted during a protest outside Trump Tower in September 2015. Mr. Schiller has acknowledged hitting one man but said the man attacked him first.
No longer responsible for Mr. Trump's physical safety, he is now a combination gatekeeper, valet and security blanket -- a familiar face for a president who detests solitude and whose wife and youngest son have remained at Trump Tower.
But Mr. Schiller has not entirely shed his role as Mr. Trump's enforcer. During a briefing on health care legislation on Friday, he shouted at reporters to clear out of the Roosevelt Room after they tried to question Mr. Trump about continuing controversies.
Mr. Greenblatt's ties to Mr. Trump have translated into more striking levels of power and prestige. A lawyer who helped Mr. Trump negotiate business deals for two decades, Mr. Greenblatt rose to become the Trump Organization's chief legal officer and executive vice president.
Now, as special representative for international negotiations for the White House, Mr. Greenblatt, 49, is charged with negotiating trade agreements and overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and United States-Cuban relations. Mr. Trump has called him "brilliant."
But experts say it is hard to imagine how anyone, no matter how intelligent, could handle three such sensitive and complex assignments without previous experience.
"Our sense is that the Trump White House views the foreign policy establishment as pretty feckless. They seem to think that applying a business approach can work better," said Martin S. Indyk, the executive vice president of the Brookings Institution, who was President Obama's special envoy to the Middle East.
"Not to have experience or knowledge of the issues in dispute, nor any relationship with the Palestinians, will be a challenge," he said.
In announcing his appointment, Mr. Trump said Mr. Greenblatt's success in negotiating complex transactions and building consensus made him the ideal roving global negotiator. Mr. Greenblatt has told reporters that after so many years at Mr. Trump's side, "I know how he thinks; I know how to get his bidding done."
In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Greenblatt suggested calling back later when "I'll have something to actually say that's meaningful." Through the press office, he addressed the trade aspect of his portfolio, saying that working with Mr. Trump taught him how government can impede job creation.
Still, C. Fred Bergsten, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a member of the president's Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, said he had never known a White House official "outside of the trade policy network who has been assigned negotiation of trade issues."
By law, the Office of the United States Trade Representative is charged with negotiating trade deals. Various cabinet-level secretaries also weigh in on policy.
"So what would that leave for this guy?" Mr. Bergsten asked. "It's very mysterious."
A sign of Mr. Greenblatt's expansive role came last month, not long after he traveled to Capitol Hill with Peter Navarro -- a Harvard-trained economist who is head of Mr. Trump's newly created National Trade Council -- to discuss trade policy with staff aides of the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. Greenblatt missed a follow-up session with senators because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was visiting the White House that day.
"He's got to negotiate Middle East peace," Mr. Navarro quipped to the senators, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "So he can't be here today."
Although Mr. Greenblatt has not been given the title of special envoy to the Middle East, he appears to be acting in that role too. Visiting the region this week, he met Mr. Netanyahu in Israel on Monday and is scheduled to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. A State Department spokesman said Monday that a senior National Security Council official was accompanying Mr. Greenblatt, but was unsure whether a State Department official had been included.
Mr. Greenblatt appears more independent of the State Department than at least some previous envoys; he has told others he reports not to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but to the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, 36, one of the most senior White House advisers.
And where past envoys were foreign policy specialists, Mr. Greenblatt told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency in April that his main sources of information were daily email alerts, material supplied by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and a weekly Jewish radio program.
"There's just a tremendous amount of literature out there, emails and all that, so I read all of those as often as I can," he said then.
Still, Mr. Greenblatt seemed at that point somewhat taken aback that Mr. Trump had identified him to the news agency as his principal adviser on Israel, telling reporters that Mr. Greenblatt was so passionate that "when he goes on vacation, he goes to Israel."
"I knew that he was relying on me for certain aspects of Israel, but I didn't know I was his top adviser," he said.
The 'Apprentice' Rises
Ms. Manigault, 43, has no policy experience, a spotty history in her previous federal positions and a r√©sum√© that has cast her -- inaccurately -- as a university professor and a former top aide to Vice President Al Gore.
Yet, to the consternation of the president's chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and others, Mr. Trump has given her the same title of presidential assistant as Mr. Priebus and other senior aides -- and regularly includes her in high-level strategy sessions on the budget and other matters. She said in a January interview in Variety that Mr. Trump "really wanted me to have the freedom to work on many different things."
In a statement from the White House press office, Ms. Manigault said that "while some people try to tear me down," she was focused on giving women, minorities and other groups a voice in the White House.
Nominally, Ms. Manigault directs the office of communications in the White House's public liaison office, a midlevel post. She is also a bridge to African-American groups, including the heads of more than 60 historically black colleges and universities who met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last month.
She also joined a State Department delegation to the inauguration of Haiti's president, Jovenel Mo√Øse. She said Mr. Mo√Øse had invited her because of her previous hurricane relief work in the country.
"She is the highest-ranking African-American in the White House, and she has the ear of the president," said Paris Dennard, a White House director of African-American outreach under President George W. Bush. "That is a good thing."
During the presidential campaign, Ms. Manigault cast herself as an insider, saying Mr. Trump has called her "his Valerie Jarrett." In an interview published last June in Essence magazine, she said, "I'm the person who pulls him back when he goes too far."
In her White House post, she has already had a few run-ins reminiscent of her elbows-out reality-TV role on "The Apprentice," including a much publicized confrontation with a veteran White House reporter. (Mr. Trump also sponsored a short-lived dating show called "The Ultimate Merger" in which she starred.)
Ms. Manigault has told others that she earned her way to a White House position. She grew up on welfare in a housing project in Youngstown, Ohio, and lost her father to violence at age 7, but went on to earn a college degree and, at age 24, a job in the office of Vice President Al Gore.
But while her ascent is impressive, it is not quite as she has described it. On a 2005 r√©sum√© provided by a former employer, she described herself as Mr. Gore's "senior scheduling and advance coordinator" overseeing all aspects of his schedule. She continues to maintain that description is accurate and that she succeeded at the job.
But numerous former staff members in that office said that she was pushed out of an entry-level, $25,000-a-year job replying to invitations to Mr. Gore after 13 months, leaving a pile of unanswered correspondence under her desk. "She was the worst hire we ever made," said Mary Margaret Overbey, Mr. Gore's former office administrator.
Ms. Manigault transferred to a job as deputy associate director of presidential personnel, then eight months later moved to the Commerce Department. In her statement, she said she performed well in that job. But Cheryl Shavers, then the agency's under secretary for technology administration, disagreed, saying Ms. Manigault "was unqualified and disruptive," so "I had her removed."
On her official website and elsewhere, Ms. Manigault also has identified herself as a professor at Howard University in Washington. But Anthony D. Owens, a university spokesman, said she actually was a "facilitator and presenter." A letter from the university that Ms. Manigault provided states that she was an instructor, a temporary position.
Ms. Manigault also maintains that the only requirement left for her to complete a doctorate at Howard is to defend her dissertation. But Carolyn M. Byerly, chairwoman of the university's communications department, said that according to the university's rules, the seven-year period for her to do that expired more than a decade ago.
Ms. Manigault tweeted her support for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2014, but when Mr. Trump decided to run for president she joined his campaign and defended him vigorously. At an election-night victory party in November, she gave a television interview during which she warned that Mr. Trump's campaign was keeping an "enemies" list.
Her "Apprentice"-style pugnacity notwithstanding, Mr. Trump insists there is a side of her that she keeps well hidden.
"Omarosa's actually a very nice person," he joked at a Roosevelt Room breakfast that she helped organize last month to celebrate Black History Month. "Nobody knows that."

Full text: President Trump and the Federal Reserve are headed for a collision. Mr. Trump wants to go full steam ahead with faster growth. The Fed, for its part, wants to restrain acceleration in economic growth.
If the economy grows too fast it could lead to higher inflation, which could force the Fed to raise rates more quickly -- a course that often ends in recession.
And the Fed is set to make its first move this week by raising its benchmark interest rate.
Although rates would still be low by historical standards, the central bank would be moving earlier than expected because the economy appeared to be gaining steam.
The jobs report released on Friday showed that a healthy 235,000 jobs were added in February. "This number reaffirms everything that we're trying to do," said Gary Cohn, the director for the National Economic Council.
Small businesses, too, say they feel like the party is just starting and things are looking up for them.
But as a former Fed chairman once said, the central bank's mission is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.
What Happens to Preet Bharara's Cases?
As United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mr. Bharara is known as one of the nation's most aggressive and outspoken prosecutors of public corruption and Wall Street crime.
But he has been asked to step down just as his office is preparing to try a group of former aides and associates of New York's governor, Andrew M. Cuomo.
The office has also been investigating campaign fund-raising by New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, for about a year. That inquiry appears to be in its final stages.
Mr. Bharara would presumably be succeeded temporarily by his deputy, Joon H. Kim, a longtime prosecutor and the former head of the office's criminal division.
But it remains unclear how Mr. Bharara's departure might affect the investigations.
And all eyes are on who will replace him.
Financial circles, in particular, will be watching closely to see who is named to take his place, to see whether that person will employ the same tactics that Mr. Bharara did, The Wall Street Journal reports. Mr. Bharara oversaw the increased use of wiretaps and confidential informants in white-collar cases -- a controversial approach.
The Journal also reports that Marc Mukasey, a white-collar defense lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, is regarded as a possible successor.
And what about Mr. Bharara's career? Even though his time in the role came to a highly politicized end, he has said throughout his tenure that politics and prosecution do not mix.
But his dismissal will renew speculation about his postprosecutorial life. He has denied political ambitions and has said he was not sure that he had a "taste for private practice."
HSBC Looks to an Outsider
HSBC may be based in London, but it generates much of its profit in Asia.
And so, in a nod to that, it has named Mark Tucker, the chief executive of the Asian life insurer AIA Group, as its next chairman.
Mr. Tucker will replace Douglas Flint, who has been chairman since 2010, in October.
Although Mr. Tucker has spent much of his career in the insurance industry, he was group finance director for a year at HBOS, a British bank that nearly collapsed during the financial crisis and is now part of Lloyds Banking Group.
He has also been a director at Goldman Sachs since 2012, a position he will leave when he joins HSBC.
Mr. Tucker's first task will be to find a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, who has said he will quit as chief executive next year.
But there are other challenges: The bank has missed a string of financial targets and is in the midst of a restructuring.

Easy Money Isn't So Easy for the Fed to Give Up

Abstract: Over several days this month, half a dozen senior Fed officials made public comments that suggested greater collective confidence and unanimity that the economy can handle tighter money than has been on display since the onset of the financial crisis nearly a decade ago. The advent of unified Republican control of Congress and the White House also brings the possibility of tax cuts and other stimulative measures that would mean the economy needs less support from low interest rates to keep growing.

Full text: When the Federal Reserve made its first tentative step toward ending its era of extraordinary monetary intervention, it earned a nickname: the taper tantrum. Global financial markets metaphorically bawled like a toddler on news that the Fed planned on "tapering" its stimulus program. That was nearly four years ago. Ever since, the Fed has moved to decrease access to easy money with the caution of a technician defusing a powerful bomb. After raising its interest-rate target above near-zero levels in December 2015, the Fed waited a full year before doing so again, the slowest pace of rate increases in the modern history of the central bank.
But the era in which the Fed has moved so gingerly toward tighter money looks to be ending this week.
Under the chairwoman, Janet Yellen, the Fed is likely to raise its target interest rate a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday -- a mere three months after the last one. It will probably signal that two more rate increases, barring economic setbacks, are on the way in 2017.
It's not the policy alone that is striking. Over several days this month, half a dozen senior Fed officials made public comments that suggested greater collective confidence and unanimity that the economy can handle tighter money than has been on display since the onset of the financial crisis nearly a decade ago.
Fed officials seem to believe that the United States economy is nearing its full economic potential, that the expansion is more sturdy than it was just a year ago, and that inflation is closing in on the 2 percent mark that the Fed aims for. The advent of unified Republican control of Congress and the White House also brings the possibility of tax cuts and other stimulative measures that would mean the economy needs less support from low interest rates to keep growing.
"Recent developments suggest that the macro economy may be at a transition," said Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, in a March 1 speech, describing a situation of "full employment within reach, signs of progress on our inflation mandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad."
Making the comments all the more notable: Ms. Brainard was perhaps the Fed's most vocal advocate of caution on rate increases just a year ago, arguing that geopolitical risks loomed large.
But something deeper may be afoot than just an improvement in the economic data. In both their tone and actions, Fed officials are displaying greater confidence that they know where the economy is heading -- namely that it is converging on a state of full employment and inflation near their 2 percent target.
"We are seeing an evolution away from a tactical approach toward a strategic approach," said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz. "Their stance now is that they will focus on the destination, not the journey, and that they will lead markets rather than be led by markets."
Indeed, the biggest contrast with this time a year ago is that financial markets seem to believe it. At the start of 2016, Fed officials were envisioning raising rates four times over the course of the year, but bond market prices suggested investors weren't buying it and thought only one or two rate increases were on the way.
The markets were right. With some weak economic data and tumbling oil prices and volatile stock markets, the Fed stayed its hand.
The start of 2017 could hardly feel more different. Stock markets are booming, as are measures of consumer and business confidence. Economic data, including jobs numbers Friday, have been solid. Investors see a 60 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates three or more times this year, based on prices in futures markets Friday.
This time, in other words, the market actually believes the Fed will follow through with its plans to gradually raise rates.
One piece of evidence is that Fed officials, during the week of Feb. 27 to March 3, confidently signaled that a March 15 rate increase was imminent. By doing so before the February jobs report was released, they were making clear that even if that report had been soft, they were committed to rate increases.
The officials appear to have plotted a course to raise rates a few times a year with expectations of reaching the so-called neutral rate -- at which monetary policy is neither stimulating nor slowing the economy -- near the end of 2019. As of their December meeting, Fed leaders think that neutral rate is 3 percent.
But at the Fed, the momentum now evident in the economy feels hard won, and officials may be reluctant to risk it by tightening the monetary spigots prematurely.
Even if the central bank's most recent forecasts become reality, it will represent a historically slow pattern of monetary tightening -- four years to raise interest rates by about three percentage points. In the 1994 cycle, engineered by the chairman Alan Greenspan, a rate rise of that scale happened in just 13 months.
The big question for the months ahead is what it would take to change direction once again. Would a new soft patch in the economic data, a new bout of market turbulence or a new crisis lead Chairwoman Yellen and her colleagues to again retreat to the wait-and-see school of interest-rate increases?
"I do think there's some greater willingness to tolerate some shortfall in the data compared to expectations," said David Stockton, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former Fed official. "They are exhibiting more confidence in the economy, but that doesn't mean that confidence couldn't dissipate in the face of some scary event."
The new, more confident, interest-rate-raising Fed will last, in other words, as long as events allow it to.

Full text: Stocks held steady in a calm day of trading Monday, but the coming days are full of events that could swing markets. The Federal Reserve may raise interest rates, more countries around the world may shake up the economic status quo, and several significant updates on the United States economy are due.
Still, the economic calendar was decidedly light on Monday, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index flipped between modest gains and losses before closing at 2,373.47, up 0.87 of a point, or 0.04 percent. It remains within 1 percent of its record, which was set this month.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.50 points, or 0.1 percent, to 20,881.48. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.06 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,875.78. Three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
Most investors expect the Fed to raise rates this week for only the third time since they went to nearly zero during the financial crisis in 2008.
Usually, rising interest rates are bad news for stocks because they make borrowing more expensive and can be a drag on economic growth. But many analysts say that as long as the pace is gradual, the expected increases will only be getting rates back to normal rather than slamming the brakes on the economy.
Investors will most likely focus more on what the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, says after the announcement than on the rate increase itself, which is expected to be only a quarter of a percentage point.
"What the market is curious about is: How many more rate increases will there be, and what is the primary data that would drive that?" said J. J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.
The job market has been on the upswing recently, and so has inflation. But a recent drop in the price of oil may pull down inflation levels, which could encourage the Fed to move more slowly. The government will offer updates this week on inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels, with reports on retail sales and other economic indicators.
Among the major movers, shares of Mobileye, an Israeli autonomous-driving company, surged after it agreed to sell itself to Intel for $63.54 a share in cash. Its shares listed in the United States rose $13.35, or 28.2 percent, to $60.62. Intel slipped 75 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $35.16.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.62 percent, from 2.58 percent late Friday, and is approaching its highest level since 2014.
Other central banks are also meeting on interest rates this week, including the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.
Many economists expect the Bank of England to hold rates steady, but other action in London could garner more attention. The government could formally begin the process of exiting the European Union after a vote to leave last summer by one of a growing number of populations around the world trying to throw off the status quo.
In Europe, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.1 percent, the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.3 percent, and the DAX in Germany rose 0.2 percent.
The dollar largely held steady. It dipped to 114.77 Japanese yen, from 114.78 yen late Friday. The euro fell to $1.0660, from $1.0692, and the British pound rose to $1.2231, from $1.2177.
The price of a barrel of benchmark crude oil fell 9 cents to close at $48.40 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price international oil, slipped 2 cents to close at $51.35 a barrel in London.
Gold for the March contract rose $1.70 to settle at $1,202.40 an ounce.

Full text: BOSTON -- Remember Afghanistan? The longest war in American history? Ever? When it comes to wars, we Americans have a selective memory. The Afghan war, dating from October 2001, has earned the distinction of having been forgotten while still underway.
President Trump's Inaugural Address included no mention of Afghanistan. Nor did his remarks last month at a joint session of Congress. For the new commander in chief, the war there qualifies at best as an afterthought -- assuming, that is, he has thought about it all.
A similar attitude prevails on Capitol Hill. Congressional oversight has become pro forma. Last week Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of Central Command, told Congress that the Pentagon would probably need more troops in Afghanistan, a statement that seemed to catch politicians and reporters by surprise -- but that was old news to anyone who's been paying attention to the conflict.
And that's the problem. It doesn't seem that anyone is. At the Senate hearings on the nomination of James Mattis as defense secretary, Afghanistan barely came up.
To be fair, Mr. Mattis did acknowledge that "our country is still at war in Afghanistan," albeit without assessing the war's prospects. In response to a comment by Senator John McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, that "we are in serious trouble in Afghanistan," Mr. Mattis merely allowed that the Taliban had "eroded some of our successes."
That was it. No further follow up. Other members of the committee, Republican and Democratic, focused on more pressing concerns like seeking to induce Mr. Mattis to endorse military programs and installations in their home state.
The military brass deserves some of the blame. Soon after Mr. Mattis's hearing, Gen. John Nicholson, the latest in a long line of American commanders to have presided over the Afghan mission, arrived in Washington to report on its progress. While conceding that the conflict is stalemated, General Nicholson doggedly insisted that it is a "stalemate where the equilibrium favors the government." Carefully avoiding terms like "victory" or "win," he described his strategy as "hold-fight-disrupt." He ventured no guess on when the war might end.
All of this flies in the face of what the conflict in Afghanistan has become, a reality made clear in a recent report from the Defense Department's special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.
Despite appropriating over three-quarters of a trillion dollars on Afghanistan since 2001, Afghan security forces continue to be plagued by the problem of inflated rolls, with local commanders pocketing American-supplied funds to pay for nonexistent soldiers; according to the report, "The number of troops fighting alongside 'ghost soldiers' is a fraction of the men required for the fight."
Large-scale corruption persists, with Afghanistan third from the bottom in international rankings, ahead of only Somalia and North Korea. Adjusted for inflation, American spending to reconstruct Afghanistan now exceeds the total expended to rebuild all of Western Europe under the Marshall Plan; yet to have any hope of surviving, the Afghan government will for the foreseeable future remain almost completely dependent on outside support.
And things are getting worse. Although the United States has invested $70 billion in rebuilding Afghan security forces, only 63 percent of the country's districts are under government control, with significant territory lost to the Taliban over the past year. Though the United States has spent $8.5 billion to battle narcotics in Afghanistan, opium production there has reached an all-time high.
For this, over the past 15 years, nearly 2,400 American soldiers have died, and 20,000 more have been wounded.
What are we to make of the chasm between effort expended and results achieved? Why on those increasingly infrequent occasions when Afghanistan attracts notice do half-truths and pettifoggery prevail, rather than hard-nosed assessments? Why has Washington ceased to care about the Afghan war?
The answer, it seems to me, is this: As with budget deficits or cost overruns on weapons purchases, members of the national security apparatus -- elected and appointed officials, senior military officers and other policy insiders -- accept war as a normal condition.
Once, the avoidance of war figured as a national priority. On those occasions when war proved unavoidable, the idea was to end the conflict as expeditiously as possible on favorable terms.
These precepts no longer apply. With war transformed into a perpetual endeavor, expectations have changed. In Washington, war has become tolerable, an enterprise to be managed rather than terminated as quickly as possible. Like other large-scale government projects, war now serves as a medium through which favors are bestowed, largess distributed and ambitions satisfied.
That our impulsive commander in chief may one day initiate some new war in a fit of pique is a worrisome prospect. That neither President Trump nor anyone else in Washington seems troubled that wars once begun drag on in perpetuity is beyond worrisome.

Full text: TOLEDO, Ohio -- The cream of the small-business community here tucked into their lunch on a top floor of a bank building and pondered the question put to them by their local lender's economist. More than any other president since Ronald Reagan, President Trump is moving to strip away regulations and slash taxes, said Jeffrey Korzenik, an investment strategist with Fifth Third, a large regional bank in the Midwest and Southeast. In meetings with clients, Mr. Korzenik has been making the case that these policies will rouse the slumbering animal spirits in businesses across America.
"And now we have seen this huge spike in small-business confidence since the election," Mr. Korzenik said, pointing to a chart. "So I have to ask you: Do you feel more confident now?"
There was a moment of silence, broken only by a howling northwestern Ohio wind that rattled the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bank's boardroom.
Then, with rapid-fire speed, came the responses.
The president of a trucking company spoke of a "tremendous dark cloud" lifting when he realized he would no longer be feeling the burden of rules and regulations imposed by the Obama administration.
The owner of an automotive parts assembler gave thanks that he would not be receiving visits from pesky environmental and workplace overseers.
And the head of a seating manufacturer expressed hope that, finally, his health care costs would come down when the Affordable Care Act was repealed.
"My gut just feels better," said Bob Fleisher, president of a local car dealership. "With Obama, you felt it was personal -- like he just didn't want you to make money. Now we have a guy who is cutting regulations and taxes. And when I see my taxes going down every quarter -- well, that means I am going to start investing again."
While much has been made about the stock market's nearly 14 percent rally since the election, economists say that when it comes to assessing the genuine potential for the United States economy, confidence among small-business owners is a more grounded and forward-looking indicator.
Companies that employ several to a few hundred workers make up 99 percent of business in the United States and account for half of private sector employment. So for all that General Electric, Caterpillar or Ford Motor talks about building factories and hiring workers, the $18 trillion United States economy will not truly move until the burghers in Toledo and other parts of the country start to invest and add jobs.
The exuberance of small-city executives in Toledo, of course, represents just a small slice of the national economy -- an economy whose recovery had already been showing signs of gaining momentum. And their euphoria is being fed by promises, like a tax overhaul, that have not yet been kept.
Still, the views from the Toledo lunch are very much in tune with what business leaders, large and small, have been consistently saying in the months since the election.
Billed as a C.E.O. round table, the event felt more like a boisterous group therapy session as one businessman interrupted another with competing tales of Obama-era regulatory woes.
But all 11 executives agreed: Never in recent years had they been so bullish about their businesses as they were now under a president (and fellow small-business owner, albeit a very rich one) whom they see as one of their own.
Which is why Mr. Korzenik was so excited about the recent surge in the small-business confidence index, as measured by the National Federation of Independent Business, the industry's trade group.
In the month after Mr. Trump was elected, the gauge showed the largest monthly increase since 1986. And it has continued to reflect consistent gains as the president pushes for lower taxes, fewer regulations and a repeal of President Barack Obama's health care initiative.
Of course, the jump came off low levels. Since 2009, the index had been either on a downward trend or barely moving up as small businesses struggled to recover from the financial crisis. A heavier regulatory burden and uncertainty born of a weak economic recovery have kept small-business owners from making big bets in investments or hiring.
But in Toledo, this reluctance is changing -- and quickly.
Louis M. Soltis owns a small company that manufactures control panels for large factories and machines. After four years of not adding to his work force of 22, he has seen orders for panels jump in the last two months and is looking to take on as many as six new workers.
There may not be a direct correlation between his surging order book and the new president, but there is no doubting the psychological boost.
"That guy is a junkyard dog, doing his tweets at 3 a.m. and taking on the news media -- I just get strength from him," Mr. Soltis said over a wine-soaked dinner with a large group of his small-business friends and peers from around town. "And I have to say, it makes you feel gutsy -- ready to step up and start investing again."
The restaurant sits on the eastern bank of the Maumee River, offering up a view of the modest Toledo skyline. For years, many of the taller buildings have stood empty as this largely industrial city, a bit more than an hour's drive south of Detroit, suffered from the automotive industry's decline.
Of late, the local economy has been recovering as thriving industries like health care have picked up the slack, and the unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, stands exactly at the national figure of 4.7 percent for February. The latest employment data, released on Friday, showed that 235,000 workers were added to payrolls nationwide last month.
Mr. Soltis is not the only small-business leader to report a sharp pickup in activity.
Barton S. Kulish, the president of MTS Seating, which makes seats and tables for restaurants and offices, said that his sales were up 38 percent after the election. Since the beginning of the year, he said he has had to bring on eight more workers (and plans to hire an additional 12) to his 418-employee company.
Bryan Keller, the chief executive of Keller Logistics, said a sharp rise in trucking orders since the election prompted him to recently increase his shipping rates.
And the local real estate market is still buzzing with news of a 300,000-square-foot industrial space, which, after drawing little interest for the better part of a year, suddenly became the target of a frantic bidding war among three local parties before finding a buyer.
Yet there is a downside to animal spirits that persist too long, especially in labor markets, like Toledo's, that are operating on the tight side.
And that is a sharp uptick in inflation.
In his presentation to Fifth Third's banking clients, Mr. Korzenik raised this issue, suggesting that the broader economy was in the "seventh inning" of what has been a pretty long business cycle.
He also noted how the opioid epidemic in the Midwest had made it harder for companies to find qualified young people ready to work -- a comment that elicited nods from around the table.
Still, no one in the room seemed overly concerned. As the group saw it, the party was just beginning.
"Most businesses I know are just taking a deep breath, happy that there is finally someone in the White House who understands what they do," said Mr. Fleisher, the owner of the Lincoln car dealership. "So you say we are in the seventh inning -- well, I am not sure we are."

Abstract: Economists expect that the Federal Reserve will see the uptick in the Consumer Price Index as another sign in favor of raising its interest rates. The Bank of England will release its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday, but is likely to be overshadowed by the actions of the United States Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate this week. The British economy has performed better than expected since Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union, but the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is still widely expected to keep interest rates steady. In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain's economy over fears that "Brexit" could weigh on growth.

Island's revised debt plan faces federal scrutiny.
The federal board overseeing Puerto Rico's finances will meet in New York on Monday, when it must decide on a plan for ending the island's chronic deficits. Puerto Rico hopes to restructure more than $110 billion of debt and pension obligations, but it must first produce a credible fiscal plan. Last week, the board told Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell√≥ that his plan was unrealistic and asked him to make revisions. If there is no agreement by Monday, the board can impose its own fiscal plan over the governor's objections, something that would anger the many Puerto Ricans who believe their democratic rights are being trampled. Mary Williams Walsh
AUTO INDUSTRY
Volkswagen will discuss its 2016 earnings.
Volkswagen will hold a news conference in Wolfsburg, Germany, on Tuesday to discuss its 2016 financial results. The company said last month that net profit for the year was 5.4 billion euros (about $5.76 billion), after a loss of [euro]1.4 billion in 2015. Matthias M√ºller, the chief executive, will probably use the event to try to move the conversation away from the company's diesel scandal and toward the potential of new products like the Arteon, a model unveiled last week that will be positioned above the current top of the line, the Passat. But Mr. M√ºller is likely to face numerous questions about the continuing fallout from a criminal investigation in Germany. Jack Ewing
ECONOMY
China's premier may discuss debt and trade relations.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China will hold his annual news conference at the end of this year's session of the National People's Congress. Questions may involve how China will manage its long-running buildup of debt and its trade relations with the Trump administration. Mr. Li may also talk about continuing tensions with South Korea over the American deployment there of a missile tracking system aimed mainly at North Korea, but with the capability of electronically looking into China as well. Keith Bradsher
February consumer price data is on the way.
On Wednesday morning, the Labor Department is set to announce data on consumer prices for February. It is most likely that core inflation changed little from January, but rose at a faster pace than in February 2016. Economists expect that the Federal Reserve will see the uptick in the Consumer Price Index as another sign in favor of raising its interest rates. Zach Wichter
The Fed is set to raise its benchmark interest rate.
Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has taken the mystery out of this week's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee. Ms. Yellen effectively announced this month that the Fed plans to raise its benchmark interest rate for just the third time since the 2008 financial crisis. Markets regard the decision as a done deal. But there's still good reason to pay attention on Wednesday, when the rate increase is formally announced, since the Fed is likely to give some indication of its future plans. The central bank will publish a new round of economic forecasts, and Ms. Yellen will hold a news conference. Binyamin Appelbaum
The Bank of England's decision on monetary policy is due.
The Bank of England will release its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday, but is likely to be overshadowed by the actions of the United States Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate this week.
The British economy has performed better than expected since Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union, but the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is still widely expected to keep interest rates steady. Prime Minister Theresa May is expected this month to invoke Article 50, which would start a two-year negotiation process to leave the 28-country bloc. There remain concerns about the ultimate impact of the decision to leave the European Union on the British economy.
In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain's economy over fears that "Brexit" could weigh on growth. The rate had remained 0.5 percent since March 2009. Chad Bray
The Treasury secretary heads to a Group of 20 conference.
Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin will make his first foray onto the international stage on Friday, traveling to Baden-Baden, Germany, for the two-day Group of 20 gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors. World leaders have been anxiously looking for clarity about what the Trump administration's "America First" policies will mean for the world economy. Of particular interest will be any signals from Mr. Mnuchin about currency policy, deregulation and trade.
Advisers to President Trump have been particularly critical of Germany recently, accusing it of exploiting the low value of the euro and suggesting that a bilateral deal was needed to address America's trade deficit with the country. Such concerns will most likely be on the table when Mr. Mnuchin sits down with Wolfgang Sch√§uble, Germany's finance minister, in Berlin ahead of the conference. Alan Rappeport

Economic Steam Pits Trump Goal Against Wary Fed

Abstract: Both Fed officials and independent economists are quick to emphasize that the central bank is not trying to pre-empt the new administration's policies. Mr. Trump has repeatedly painted economic conditions in some of the bleakest language ever used by an American president, and he has described his fiscal policy agenda as necessary to revive growth and restore the nation's prosperity. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently reported that Texas employment in residential construction had nearly reached the level seen before the 2008 financial crisis and that skilled workers like framers, masons and bricklayers were in short supply. "Monetary policy cannot, for instance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would boost real G.D.P. growth over the longer run," Ms. Yellen said in a speech this month in Chicago. President Trump has promised "massive tax relief for the middle class," and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said last month that he wanted to see a bill passed before Congress goes on summer vacation in August. Mark Calabria, the chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, said last week that the White House planned to fill vacancies at the Fed and other regulatory agencies "in short order." The Federal Reserve Bank has Indicated It Will Raise Its Benchmark Interest Rate On Wednesday, Months Earlier Than Markets Expected at the Start of the Year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- For President Trump and his economic advisers, the strong February jobs report was a cause for celebration -- and a first step toward delivering on the president's promise of faster economic growth. For the Federal Reserve, it was the final confirmation that the time had come to raise interest rates to prevent the United States economy from overheating.
Mr. Trump and Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, appear to be headed toward a collision, albeit in slow motion. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he is determined to stimulate faster growth while the central bank, for its part, is indicating that it will seek to restrain any acceleration in economic activity.
On Wednesday, the Fed plans to make a first move in the direction of restraint. The central bank has all but announced that it will raise its benchmark interest rate at the conclusion of a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.
The move itself is minor. The rate is expected to remain below 1 percent, and interest rates on consumer and business loans will still be remarkably low by historical standards. But the Fed is moving months earlier than markets had expected at the beginning of the year, precisely because the economy appears to be gaining steam.
Both Fed officials and independent economists are quick to emphasize that the central bank is not trying to pre-empt the new administration's policies. The Fed is raising rates because economic conditions are improving. Winter did not chill the United States economy this year. The stock market keeps fizzing upward; employment and wages are growing; companies and consumers are optimistic.
"The thought that by tweaking the funds rate you could send some kind of political message is crazy, and they know that, and they're not going to do it," said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen. "On the other hand, this is the first first quarter in about six years that isn't looking scary, so it's not surprising they would be considering a rate increase."
The essential point, however, is that the Fed does not want faster growth. Fed officials estimate that the economy is already growing at something like the maximum sustainable pace. Fed officials predicted in December that the economy would expand 2.1 percent this year, slightly faster than the 1.8 percent pace they regard as sustainable. The Fed will publish new projections on Wednesday.
Growth above the sustainable pace can lead to higher inflation. That, in turn, can force the Fed to raise rates more quickly, a course that often ends in a recession.
Representative Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican, asked Ms. Yellen rather incredulously at a congressional hearing in February whether the Fed would really try to offset faster growth by raising rates more quickly. Ms. Yellen's response was carefully couched, but it amounted to "yes."
She said the Fed was fine with faster growth so long as it reflected an improvement in economic fundamentals. On the other hand, she said, the Fed would try to offset faster growth "if we think that it is demand-based and threatens our inflation objective" -- a technical description of what would happen if Congress cut taxes or increased spending.
The White House and the Fed have very different economic outlooks.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly painted economic conditions in some of the bleakest language ever used by an American president, and he has described his fiscal policy agenda as necessary to revive growth and restore the nation's prosperity.
Gary Cohn, the head of the president's National Economic Council, told CNBC on Friday that he expected job growth to strengthen in the coming months.
"We're very excited about what's ahead of us," he said.
Fed officials, by contrast, see the pace of job growth as unsustainable. The unemployment rate fell below 5 percent last May. Since then, employment has continued to expand at an average of 215,000 jobs a month -- more than twice the job growth necessary to keep pace with population growth. The faster growth is good news for the economy, indicating that adults who gave up on finding jobs are returning to work. The question is how long that can continue.
There are already growing signs of a tighter labor market. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently reported that Texas employment in residential construction had nearly reached the level seen before the 2008 financial crisis and that skilled workers like framers, masons and bricklayers were in short supply. Average hourly earnings, adjusting for inflation, climbed 20.3 percent in the Texas construction sector from 2011 to 2016, compared with 5.9 percent for all Texans in private-sector jobs, the Dallas Fed reported. The National Association of Homebuilders reported that 82 percent of builders regarded the cost and availability of labor as their primary concern.
The Fed's slow march toward higher interest rates is gradually raising borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage loan was 4.21 percent last week, up about half a percentage point from the same time last year, according to Freddie Mac. Rates on credit cards and car loans have also ticked higher, although borrowing costs remain well below historical norms.
As for interest on saving accounts, banks tend to raise those rates more slowly than they raise rates on loans. But as the Fed pushes up rates, savings rates will eventually increase, too.
Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have been careful to acknowledge the persistence of a range of economic problems. Labor force participation is low. Productivity growth remains weak. Middle-income families have seen little income growth.
But these problems, in the view of Fed officials, cannot be addressed by holding down the Fed's benchmark rate. "Monetary policy cannot, for instance, generate technological breakthroughs or affect demographic factors that would boost real G.D.P. growth over the longer run," Ms. Yellen said in a speech this month in Chicago. "And monetary policy cannot improve the productivity of American workers."
She noted that the White House and Congress could adopt fiscal policies that would improve those fundamental factors, although doing so would take time.
The Fed, an institution whose mission was famously described by a former chairman as taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, has a long history of angering politicians who would prefer to let the good times roll.
But in this case there is no reason for the Fed to rush. The Fed has indicated what it will do. Now, it can afford to wait and see what fiscal policy makers do.
President Trump has promised "massive tax relief for the middle class," and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said last month that he wanted to see a bill passed before Congress goes on summer vacation in August. That is an ambitious timetable, not least because health care legislation is first in line. But even if the deadline is met, more months will pass before the money accumulates in the pockets of businesses and consumers, and before the money is spent.
"The thing that makes it relatively easy for the Fed is that fiscal policy usually takes a long time," said James A. Wilcox, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. "Financial markets don't wait for all of that to happen, of course, but the actual spending and employment effects -- they usually take a while to show up."
President Trump and his advisers, meanwhile, have shown little sign of the belligerence toward the Fed that characterized Mr. Trump's campaign pronouncements.
Mr. Trump has also not seized quickly on the opportunity to appoint his own people to the central bank. Two seats on the Fed's seven-person board have been vacant for almost three years because Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama's nominees. But Mr. Trump has not put forward his own.
Mark Calabria, the chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, said last week that the White House planned to fill vacancies at the Fed and other regulatory agencies "in short order." But he added that the administration was still considering its options.
David Nason, a General Electric executive who was regarded as a leading candidate, recently withdrew his name from consideration.
Mr. Trump also has the opportunity to replace Ms. Yellen as chairwoman when her four-year term ends in February, although she could remain on the board.

Full text: Michael T. Flynn, who briefly served as national security adviser, gave President Trump at least one piece of excellent advice. According to The Huffington Post, it was 3 a.m. when Mr. Flynn got a call from the president with an important question: Is it good for the economy to have a strong dollar or a weak one?
Mr. Flynn, whose background is in the military rather than in macroeconomics, said he didn't know. He suggested that the president ask an economist.
Just so.
Judging by those with whom Mr. Trump chooses to surround himself, it seems that the new president is averse to talking with professional economists. But over time, he will probably get around to appointing the three members of his Council of Economic Advisers, as is required by law. (Some reports suggest that the council chairman may be Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, who would be a fine choice.) Here are a few things that the president could learn from his economists in his first briefing.
The overall economy is in reasonably good shape. Mr. Trump likes to say that he "inherited a mess." That was true for President George W. Bush, who came into office in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. And it was especially true for President Barack Obama, who was elected in the midst of a financial crisis.
But that is not at all true today. The unemployment rate is about 5 percent, close to what many economists consider sustainable in the long run. And inflation is close to the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. Those are real facts, not alternative ones.
Mr. Trump could try to push unemployment even lower through large tax cuts and vast infrastructure spending. But a large expansion in the aggregate demand for goods and services is not what the economy needs right now. It would either lead to higher inflation or, more likely, cause Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, to raise interest rates faster and further than she now intends.
Future growth is likely to be modest. Mr. Trump is right when he laments that growth during the current recovery has been low by historical standards. But the causes of that development may prove hard to reverse.
One cause is demographic. In earlier decades, the percentage of adults in the labor force was increasing, a result in part of the rapidly changing role of women in society and in part of the passage of the baby-boom generation into its working years. Now, the role of women has stabilized, and the baby boomers are retiring. Moreover, in light of the president's "economic nationalism," immigration is unlikely to be adding as many workers in the future as it has in the past. With lower growth in the labor force, we should expect slower growth in gross domestic product as well.
A second cause of slower economic growth is the decline in productivity growth, which has occurred not just in the United States but in most advanced economies. The reason for this slowdown is not fully understood, but I recently heard one explanation at a seminar given by the Stanford University economist Charles I. Jones.
According to a recent paper by Mr. Jones and three co-authors, the number of Americans engaged in research has increased more than twentyfold since the 1930s, yet there has been no similar explosion in productivity growth. Their interpretation is that big ideas are just getting harder to find. Unfortunately, there is no sign that this is about to change.
To be sure, Mr. Trump can do some things to promote growth. His plans for regulatory and tax reform, if well executed, could be a step in the right direction. But in light of the underlying demographic and technological trends, he should be cautious in raising expectations about how much policy can accomplish.
The stagnant wages of the president's supporters cannot be easily fixed. Mr. Trump's victory can be attributed largely to the support of white working-class Americans. Among all voters, according to the Pew Research Center, Hillary Clinton won the votes of those with college degrees by nine percentage points, while Mr. Trump won the votes of those without college degrees by eight percentage points.
It is easy to understand this divide. Since the 1970s, the average earnings of the highly educated have grown strongly. By contrast, the earnings of the less educated, adjusted for inflation, have been stagnant. For them, making America great again is a cogent rallying cry.
The question is whether Mr. Trump can alter these disturbing trends. Few economists point to flawed trade agreements as the main source of the problem, as the president often does. More important is what economists call skill-biased technological change.
When entrepreneurs introduce new technologies -- think robots, for instance -- those advances are likely to replace unskilled workers. At the same time, skilled workers are needed to implement and maintain the new technologies. As the demand for unskilled workers falls and the demand for skilled workers rises, the wage gap grows larger.
The solution is to increase the skills of the labor force through better education and training. Yet this is easier said than done.
Oh, and about the dollar. Finally, the president's economists will need to answer his question about the dollar. Here's the simple version: The value of the dollar in foreign-exchange markets is just a price. Like other prices, whenever it changes, some people gain, and others lose. It is not useful to think of a stronger or a weaker dollar as either good or bad. One has to look at the situation at hand and the underlying drivers of the change.
So those are a few of the things that Mr. Trump could learn from a team of economists. Let's hope he chooses to appoint some soon.

Full text: A wave of hiring in February -- President Trump's first full month in office -- pointed to a strong foundation for the nation's economy, providing further evidence for the Federal Reserve that the moment to raise interest rates has come. The Labor Department reported a gain of 235,000 jobs and healthy wage growth in a month when even the weather cooperated. It was the last major data release before Fed policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday, when they have signaled their intent to increase the benchmark interest rate.
"The economy is riding a wave of bullish sentiment postelection," said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, a career website. "We're seeing strong labor demand across the board and no sign of slowing right now."
Republicans and Democrats quickly jostled for credit.
Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had "jump-started job creation, not only through his executive action but because of the surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election."
Mr. Trump, who, as a candidate, repeatedly dismissed the official jobs reports as "phony," reposted a comment on Twitter from the conservative website Drudge Report that said, "GREAT AGAIN: +235,000." Mr. Spicer later quoted Mr. Trump on his faith in the report, "They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now."
The Labor Department repeated that it had not changed the way it collected and analyzed jobs data since Mr. Trump took office. "It's business as usual," said Megan Kindelan, director of public affairs at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Republican self-congratulation clearly irked Democrats. Tom Perez, labor secretary in the Obama administration and now chairman of the Democratic National Committee, countered that Mr. Trump had "absolutely nothing" to do with the job gains. "Trump inherited an economy from Barack Obama with the longest streak of private sector job growth in history," he said.
Although the economic anxiety that helped put Mr. Trump in the White House remains, the official jobless rate is near what the Fed considers full employment -- a threshold where, in theory at least, everyone who wants a job at the going rate can find one. The official jobless rate fell to 4.7 percent, from 4.8 percent in January, even as the overall labor force grew.
At the same time, jobless claims are near a 44-year low, and the stock market is surging. Revisions to previous estimates raised the three-month average of monthly job gains to 209,000 and annual wage growth to 2.8 percent, further bolstering the case for those who argue the economy is strong enough to withstand a rate increase.
The overall economic momentum received a push from February's unusually warm weather, with almost a quarter of the jobs -- about 58,000 -- coming from construction. Manufacturing and mining rose too.
Also significant was the increase in the labor participation rate to 63 percent, a result of rising employment even among people without a high school diploma. "There's got to be some optimism that these people are feeling they finally have a chance," said Diane Swonk, founder and chief executive of DS economics in Chicago.
On the other end are employers who are seeing acute labor shortages. "They're offering training programs now," Ms. Swonk said. "They're complaining about it. But that's what tight labor markets do. It forces you to invest more to work with less."
Bigger paychecks are something that most Americans are particularly eager to see, after years of stagnant wage growth. The Fed, too, has been waiting for an increase, but it is also wary of wages rising too fast. Its members want to head off incipient inflation without putting the brakes on hiring, especially because the benefits of the eight-year-old recovery have been so unevenly distributed.
Balancing those two goals is tricky.
Lauren Griffin, senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA, said the scarcity of qualified workers had compelled employers to raise wages, strengthen benefits and improve amenities at the office. "We've got people in orientation classes," Ms. Griffin said, "and they get up and leave because they're contacted about another job that might be more money."
At the same time, a broader measure of unemployment -- which includes the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work or who are working part time but would prefer full-time jobs -- dropped to 9.2 percent last month but is still high given how tight the labor market looks otherwise.
Cautioning the Fed against moving too quickly with a rate increase, Elise Gould, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, noted that, "Workers throughout the economy, including young workers, workers of color, and low-wage workers, need a chance to make up lost ground on wage growth."
Many Americans who live outside urban centers also have been excluded from most of the rewards of the recovery.
Large metropolitan counties have had more than twice the annual wage growth of nonmetropolitan areas, according to the latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Higher-wage jobs might be following educated, young workers, who are increasingly living in dense, urban neighborhoods as other demographic groups move to the suburbs," said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, a job-search site. "Broader economic shifts also favor big cities: The occupations projected to grow tend to be more urban, while shrinking sectors like manufacturing and farming tend to be located outside large metros."
That is disappointing for people with longstanding ties to smaller, more rural communities. "A lot of this has to do with mobility," said Steven W. Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, an insurance company. "People are going to have to move where the jobs are and not expect the jobs to come where they are."
Although the Trump administration has had little time to make any substantial policy changes, the expectation of a reduction in taxes and regulations and the possibility of vast infrastructure spending have created optimism among employers and blue-collar workers.
Mr. Trump has promised to expand the economy by 4 percent a year, create 25 million jobs in the next decade, revive manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit.
Achieving all that would be difficult in the best of circumstances, let alone with the potential headwinds facing the White House. Dissension among Republicans and the unpredictability of Mr. Trump's course in several policy areas could dampen job growth.
The future of the Affordable Care Act and a possible replacement is making hospitals and community health centers cautious about adding workers. A strong dollar and a potential backlash against the White House's travel ban could slow tourism and hiring in the sector. And Mr. Trump's across-the-board hiring freeze on federal government jobs, combined with declines at the state level, will probably reduce the total number of public sector employees.
The uncertainty extends to prospects for tax cuts. Some Wall Street analysts, expecting delays, have pared their growth forecasts for 2017, after recently raising them.
Certainly the snapshot of February's labor market is good. The question is, if the economy does slow, whether Mr. Trump will accept the legitimacy of weak reports as enthusiastically as he does good ones.
Mr. Spicer suggested the president would. "Numbers are going to go up and down," he said. "We recognize that."

Political Anxiety Has Euro Bank Feeling Pressure

Abstract: [...]with populism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, opinion polls have arguably become one of the European Central Bank's most important sources of data points. Analysts say they expect the European Central Bank to give a clearer view of its intentions around June, probably by signaling a reduction in purchases of government and corporate bonds, a way of pumping money into the economy. On Thursday, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rates unchanged, and it said it would continue the stimulus measure of buying government and corporate bonds through the end of the year, albeit at a reduced level starting in April. The central bank, which regulates commercial lenders in the eurozone, has endorsed a rescue plan for troubled Italian banks that critics in Germany say violates European rules. In Germany, by contrast, there are complaints that the European Central Bank's low interest rates penalize middle-class savers, who earn almost no return on their nest eggs. Consumer prices in Germany rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in January, above the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Central bankers like to portray themselves as being aloof from the hurly-burly of politics, coolly assessing the economic data as they ponder whether to add a jolt of stimulus or take some away. But with populism on the rise in Europe and elsewhere, opinion polls have arguably become one of the European Central Bank's most important sources of data points.
Faced with a series of national elections in which anti-euro candidates play prominent roles, Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, mounted a spirited counteroffensive on Thursday. He portrayed the currency as the key to European prosperity and even took an implicit jab at the protectionist rhetoric of President Trump.
"Open trade has been the pillar of world prosperity for many, many years," Mr. Draghi said.
Although it made no major changes to monetary policy on Thursday, the bank is under increasing pressure to begin withdrawing the stimulus program that has prevailed for a decade. That task, delicate in the best of times, is even more difficult in the charged political atmosphere that permeates not only Europe but also the United States and the rest of the world.
Some political candidates are questioning the whole idea of a united Europe and the European Central Bank's fundamental reason for being. The situation raises the stakes whenever the bank makes a decision.
Britain, which was never in the eurozone, has voted to leave the European Union. Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate for the French presidency, has worried investors with talk of bringing back the franc. Similar nationalist language has been heard from candidates in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy who have been emboldened by Mr. Trump's election.
A wrong move by the European Central Bank could upset a fragile economic recovery and provide fodder for the populists.
While insisting that the central bank's job is to keep inflation under control, Mr. Draghi was unusually direct on Thursday in rebutting opposition to European free trade and political unity.
"If we go back to when the euro was created, there were always people who said it's wrong, it's a mistake, it can't be done," Mr. Draghi said. "They are saying the same today."
Eurozone members have made "extraordinary shows of solidarity" toward countries in crisis, Mr. Draghi said. "The euro is here to stay."
No matter what Mr. Draghi does, he will continue to draw strong reactions. As one of Europe's most powerful institutions, the central bank serves as an all-purpose pi√±ata for nationalist politicians of all stripes.
Frauke Petry, leader of the right-wing Alternative for Germany party, regularly accuses Mr. Draghi of endangering Germans' savings with ultralow interest rates.
In Italy, where low interest rates have helped ease a severe credit crunch, sentiment runs the opposite direction. When the European Central Bank does begin gradually reducing its stimulus efforts, perhaps around the middle of the year, expect leaders of the populist Five Star Movement in Italy to accuse Mr. Draghi of selling out to the Germans.
The prospect that Ms. Le Pen could become president of France has pushed up the government's borrowing costs. The higher rates feed through to the economy and work against central bank measures intended to make sure credit remains cheap.
The political landscape in Washington is also a concern for the European Central Bank. The United States is the European Union's largest trading partner. If Mr. Trump erects trade barriers, as he has threatened to do, European exporters would suffer along with the region's economy.
Mr. Draghi will have his first direct contact with the new American administration next week at a summit meeting in Germany of central bank governors and finance ministers. He declined to say on Thursday what message he planned to deliver.
A further complication for the European Central Bank is that its policies are out of sync with those of the Federal Reserve. Fed officials have signaled that an interest-rate increase is likely next week. That could be a problem for the European Central Bank, if higher market interest rates in the United States spill over to the eurozone and undermine efforts to keep borrowing costs low.
Analysts say they expect the European Central Bank to give a clearer view of its intentions around June, probably by signaling a reduction in purchases of government and corporate bonds, a way of pumping money into the economy.
An increase in official interest rates may be years away. On Thursday, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rates unchanged, and it said it would continue the stimulus measure of buying government and corporate bonds through the end of the year, albeit at a reduced level starting in April.
However, in a statement, the central bank was less alarmist about the eurozone outlook than in the past. Mr. Draghi said the bank would not extend an emergency lending program for commercial banks because there was no need. "There is no longer that urgency in taking further actions," he added.
It will be nearly impossible to time the easing of the stimulus in a way that does not open the European bank to criticism. The economies of the eurozone are also badly out of step with one another. Unemployment in Italy, at 11.9 percent, is three times as high as Germany's.
The European Central Bank has already been drawn into Italian politics. The central bank, which regulates commercial lenders in the eurozone, has endorsed a rescue plan for troubled Italian banks that critics in Germany say violates European rules.
In Germany, by contrast, there are complaints that the European Central Bank's low interest rates penalize middle-class savers, who earn almost no return on their nest eggs. The resentment has grown recently because of an increase in inflation. Consumer prices in Germany rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in January, above the European Central Bank's target of just under 2 percent.
The inflation rate for the eurozone as a whole was 2 percent in February. But the increase was almost entirely because of food and fuel prices, which frequently fluctuate. The European Central Bank will probably not react until there is evidence that prices in other categories, like services, are also rising.
That may be too late for some in Germany.
"It is time for the European Central Bank to start phasing out its expansionary monetary policy in Europe," Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, an influential research organization in Munich, said on Thursday in a statement. "It should now take its foot off the gas."

Full text: Stocks meandered on Wall Street on Thursday as the eighth anniversary of the current bull market turned out to be a quiet one. Large-company stocks finished mostly higher, but declines in smaller stocks across the board meant that more companies fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index picked up 1.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,364.87 on Thursday. The other major indexes closed virtually flat: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.46 points to 20,858.19, and the Nasdaq composite rose 1.26 points to 5,838.81.
The market started out with small gains, then dipped in early afternoon. Thanks to late gains for energy companies, major indexes turned higher near the end of trading.
Industrial companies fell as Caterpillar, the heavy-machinery maker, continued to slide. Health care companies climbed and banks rose along with bond yields. Trading was light following a three-day losing streak.
The S.&P. 500 is up 250 percent since March 9, 2009, when it bottomed out in the depths of the financial crisis. The current bull run is the second-longest since World War II, and it may have a while to go, as wages are growing and hiring appears to be rising.
"Bull markets typically don't die of old age," said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. "They typically die because there's a downturn in the economy."
Mr. Lefkowitz said there were few signs that such a fall would soon happen. While the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates next week, inflation remains low, and he said the Fed's actions should not stifle economic growth.
"The key question is how quickly does inflation continue to rise from here, and how aggressive does the Fed need to get," Mr. Lefkowitz said.
Health care companies made the biggest gains. The leaders included Johnson & Johnson, which rose $1.85, or 1.5 percent, to $125.95. The cancer drug maker Celgene added $2.09, or 1.7 percent, to $125.13, while the medical device maker Edwards Lifesciences rose $3.53, or 3.9 percent, to $93.06.
Prices of crude oil continued to slip after the United States government reported a huge buildup in fuel stockpiles on Wednesday. Oil is trading at its lowest price since November, before OPEC countries agreed to cut production in an effort to shore up prices.
Benchmark oil fell 80 cents, or 2 percent, to $49.28 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 92 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $52.19 a barrel in London. Energy companies lost ground early in the day but jumped in the final hour of trading.
Bond prices fell further. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.61 percent, near its highest level in the past year, from 2.56 percent.
Caterpillar fell an additional $1.84, or 2 percent, to $91.39 as the government investigates the company's taxes and accounting. The stock is down almost 8 percent since March 1.
Signet Jewelers said it will spend more money on technology as it closes mall-based stores, and its stock rose $5.62, or 8.7 percent, to $70.02.
The dollar rose to 114.92 yen, from 114.33 yen. The euro rose to $1.0581, from $1.0542.
Gold fell for the eighth day in a row. It lost $6.10 to $1,202.40 an ounce.
The British FTSE 100 index sank 0.3 percent while German DAX added 0.1 percent and the CAC 40 in France gained 0.4 percent. The CAC 40 has jumped 2.5 percent this month, far more than other major European indexes.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.3 percent as a weaker yen lifted shares of exporters. South Korea's Kospi dipped 0.2 percent, and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 1.2 percent.

Full text: House Republicans are proposing to fundamentally alter the way the federal government has been financing Medicaid for more than 50 years. The changes are part of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. "This is potentially more major than repealing the Affordable Care Act," said Joan Alker, the executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. Medicaid provides health insurance to 74 million people, or one in five Americans. Of the 20 million who gained insurance under Obamacare, at least half were through Medicaid expansion. The changes would not begin until 2020. But the long-term impact on states would be unequal, with some faring better than others, depending on how much they spent on the program, their demographics and whether they participated in President Barack Obama's expansion of Medicaid eligibility. The Republican bill calls for capping how much the federal government gives each state per Medicaid enrollee, based on how much the state was spending on the program in 2016. Spending varies widely from state to state. Nevada and Georgia, for example, spend less than $4,500 per enrollee, while Massachusetts and New York spend more than $10,000 per enrollee.
Since it was created in 1965, federal funding for Medicaid grew as needs changed for the states. If more people became eligible, say, because of a recession, or if costs rose because of expensive new medicines or a public health crisis, states received more federal money. Federal spending on Medicaid flexes as states alter their policies, eligibility rules and payment rates for doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.
Under the Republican plan released on Monday, federal funding for every Medicaid beneficiary would essentially freeze, rising only with the medical component of the Consumer Price Index, or the price of medical care. That change would allow funding to grow if more people sign up for Medicaid, but not if the cost of care for Medicaid patients spikes, or states want to offer new benefits or increase payments to doctors. Some health experts worry that over time, states would be unable to respond to changes in the health care needs of their population unless they use their own money, potentially risking the survival of a program that has been a critical source of health coverage for the poor. "I think of it as essentially putting states behind bars," said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. "Whatever you were doing circa 2016 is what you're going to do forever." Virginia, where the governor has declared its opioid crisis a public health emergency, recently decided to significantly expand the scope of its Medicaid benefits to spend more on drug treatment for patients. If there was a cap on federal funding, the state would not be able to share these cost increases -- beyond simple medical inflation -- with the federal government, Ms. Rosenbaum said. "The core problem with aggregate limits, whether across the board or per capita, is that they're impervious to the factors that drive health care spending," she said. "The potential effects are enormous."
The Republican plan would set different spending targets for different types of Medicaid beneficiaries, like older Americans, blind and disabled people, children and adults. States with rapidly growing populations of older Americans, like Nevada and Arizona, may still be hit harder over time.
This is partly because spending for older Americans, along with disabled people, makes up a larger proportion of Medicaid spending, even though they are a smaller share of enrollment. Spending for that population is less likely than others to track the medical consumer price index, because much of the money tends to go to nursing home care, not traditional medical services.
Putting an end to the open-ended commitment from the federal government could create an incentive for states to drop their costliest populations, like older Americans, out of concern that their costs will grow faster than inflation, Ms. Rosenbaum said. In addition, people 85 and older have 2.5 times more Medicaid costs as people 65 to 74, according to Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group. So, if a state has more expensive people joining its mix, but the amount of money it gets from the federal government is fixed and grows slowly, states would have to pay the additional costs, Ms. Alker said.
In a shift from previous proposals, the Republican legislation does not immediately repeal Medicaid expansion. It allows states like Kentucky, Nevada and Colorado to continue receiving federal funding as they would have under Obamacare until 2020, delaying the potential impact on states that expanded Medicaid. Under Obamacare, 31 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid to cover adults whose income was at or below 138 percent of the poverty line, covering millions of low-income Americans who previously found it difficult to afford insurance. Kentucky saw the largest growth in enrollment, though some recent enrollees were probably already eligible even before the expansion.
The federal government currently covers nearly all the costs of Medicaid enrollees who became eligible under the expansion. But in 2020, enrollment under the expansion would freeze, and if a state decided to continue enrolling new beneficiaries under the expansion criteria, it would have to pay more to do so. Enrollment could inevitably decline because Medicaid is a program where people go in and out over time, say, if they lose a job, for example. It is not yet clear how much savings the new plan would produce, but Republican leaders have long argued that fixing federal funding for Medicaid would ultimately produce significant savings in the federal budget while providing states more flexibility in managing the program. "But states already have a lot of flexibility in Medicaid," Ms. Alker said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: You could almost hear the gasps from both sides of the ideological divide when President Trump unveiled the outline of his first budget late last month, proposing to slice $54 billion from the discretionary civilian budget next year to pay for a beefed-up defense. That part of the budget pays for pretty much everything the government does other than the military, pensions and health insurance for older people. And it has been slashed repeatedly already. It adds up to only some $500 billion, hardly the best place to balance a $4 trillion federal budget. After Mr. Trump's proposed cuts it would be 25 percent smaller than it was in 2010, adjusted for inflation.
Even Republicans in Congress, no friends of government spending, argued that the math made little sense. While they share Mr. Trump's twin goals of balancing the budget and slashing taxes, they would prefer to square the circle by cutting the entitlements of Social Security and Medicare.
And yet Mr. Trump's approach possesses a powerful political logic: The frazzled, anxious working-class men and women who voted for him like Social Security, Medicare and defense. Other government spending, not so much. Notably, there is little political cost for Mr. Trump -- in fact, potential benefit -- in going after means-tested programs for the poor.
These programs appeal to two constituencies that working-class voters show little affinity for: the poor and urban liberal elites who can express enormous sympathy for the disenfranchised while ignoring the struggle of the white working class.
While Mr. Trump is not the first Republican to propose cutting anti-poverty programs to pay for tax cuts, his bluntness breaks, at least rhetorically, with a Republican establishment that insists it cares about poverty.
His political calculation could, paradoxically, protect Social Security and Medicare, entitlements that the Republican Party has tried so hard to rein in. But in areas as diverse as food stamps and housing assistance, education for the disadvantaged and Head Start, it could further fray the rest of America's threadbare social safety net.
In "White Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in America," due out in May from Harvard Business Review Press, Joan C. Williams argues that white workers' resentment of the safety net should not be surprising: They get next to no benefit from it.
Ms. Williams, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, writes that these struggling workers resent not only the poor beneficiaries of the government's largess but also the liberal policy makers who seem to believe that only the poor are deserving of help. And they bristle at the perceived condescension of a liberal elite that seems to blame them for their failure to acquire the necessary skills to rise to the professional class.
By contrast, they see themselves as hard-working citizens who struggle to make ends meet, only to be left out of many of the government programs their taxes pay for.
Over all, 61 percent of poor Americans draw from one means-tested benefit program or another, according to an analysis by the Census Bureau. But among families with incomes above the poverty line -- many of which are barely better off, making just over $24,000 for a family of four -- only 13 percent do.
Struggling middle-income families may not understand that welfare programs are so meager that the poor hardly get any help. But they can directly understand that they missed out on the earned-income tax credit because their family income hit $50,000. It is not surprising that harried working mothers resent that 30 percent of low-income families using center-based child care receive some form of subsidy while middle-income families get next to nothing.
"All they see is their stressed-out daily lives, and they resent subsidies and sympathy available to the poor," Professor Williams wrote.
President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act -- the most significant expansion of the safety net since the War on Poverty in the 1960s -- has unsurprisingly bred class resentment, too. Many disgruntled workers see it as another program for poor people that just pushed up their own premiums, offering little of benefit.
The working-class whites who turned out so enthusiastically for Mr. Trump include people like Lee Sherman, 82, from Louisiana, living precariously on Social Security after a life of hard and dangerous work fitting pipes, and exposed to all manner of toxic chemicals, at a petrochemical plant.
Aversion to the safety net is built into his moral view of the world. "He knew liberal Democrats wanted him to care more about welfare recipients," wrote the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild, who portrayed Mr. Sherman in her book "Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right" (The New Press). "But he didn't want their P.C. rules telling him who to feel sorry for."
To people like Mr. Sherman, government benefits tied to work, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, are legitimate rewards for one's effort. Welfare recipients, by contrast, just "lazed around days and partied at nights," he told Professor Hochschild.
Racial mistrust is never far from the surface: Only 13 percent of non-Hispanic whites draw benefits from means-tested programs, according to the Census Bureau analysis, compared with 42 percent of African-Americans and 36 percent of Hispanics. So while most beneficiaries of welfare programs are white, many working-class whites perceive them as schemes to hand their tax dollars to minorities.
Mr. Trump's agenda serves both race and class resentment: Whites are twice as likely as blacks to prefer a smaller government, according to a Pew Research Center survey. Among middle-income Americans, 56 percent would like the government to be smaller and offer fewer services, while among the poor, only 38 percent would like the government to shrink. It is the middle-income whites whom Mr. Trump has promised to serve.
These resentments are hard to swallow on the left of the political spectrum. Since the 1960s, at least, liberal activists have held to the belief that a grand progressive alliance was possible: working men and women, the poor, immigrants, racial and other minorities coming together in a coalition to counter conservatives and their corporate allies.
November's election -- when whites without a college degree voted for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton by 39 percentage points -- pretty much drove a stake into those hopes.
But could they be revived? As the president takes an ax to much of the government, the pressing question for liberals is whether a coalition can be built to protect the meager social safety net that remains. Could they draw back in the white working-class voters who rejected them so soundly in November?
These voters care less about gender rights and minorities. They may not share liberal views on abortion rights. They are unlikely to support a safety net that allows a poor woman to stay at home while offering nothing to a hard-working couple tag-teaming day and night shifts to care for their children.
But, Professor Williams notes, the liberal goal can't be saved without them: "If America's policy makers better understood white working-class anger against the social safety net, they might have a shot at creating programs that don't get gutted in this way."

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea said on Sunday that it would quadruple the cash reward it provides for North Korean defectors arriving with important information to 1 billion won, or $860,000, in an effort to encourage more elite members from the North to flee. Since famine hit the North in the mid-1990s, more than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to the South. The South Korean government helps them resettle by providing job training, rent and other subsidies.
But it has also offered extra cash rewards for those who defected with information on the North Korean military or the inner workings of the secretive North Korean government, as well as for those who fled with military planes or other weapons.
On Sunday, the Unification Ministry, a South Korean government agency in charge of North Korea policies, said that it planned to increase the cash bonus for a defector with such information to $860,000 from $217,000.
Defectors who flee with a warship or a military fighter jet will also get $860,000, instead of the current $130,000.
Those who arrive with lesser weapons, like a tank or a machine gun, can expect rewards ranging from $43,000 to $260,000.
The new cash awards will take effect in April, the ministry said.
South Korea said the drastic increases reflected the effects of inflation over the 20 years since the rewards were last adjusted.
They come at a time when South Korean officials say that more elite members from North Korea, deeply disappointed with their leader, Kim Jong-un, and fearful of his "reign of terror," are trying to defect to the South.
Those fears can hardly have been eased by recent reports that North Korea had executed five security officials by antiaircraft fire, possibly because they had failed to prevent United States cyberattacks that disrupted several missile tests.
Last summer, Thae Yong-ho, the No. 2 diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in London, arrived in the South with his family, saying he wanted to escape the threat of execution and to give his two sons a better future in South Korea.
In 1983, a North Korean military pilot named Lee Woong-pyung fled to the South with his MiG-19 fighter jet, breaching the heavily guarded border between the two Koreas.
Today, almost all defectors from the totalitarian North flee through its border with China, though Mr. Kim has taken steps to tighten that border in the five years since he took power.
The number of North Korean defectors arriving in the South, which peaked with 2,914 in 2009, dropped to 1,418 last year.
Their trip can be costly, running into the thousands of dollars.
As it became more risky to cross the border into China, North Korean border guards demanded bigger bribes in return for letting people slip through, according to human rights activists who help defectors.
Once in China, defectors have to pay smugglers to take them to countries like Laos and Thailand, where they can seek asylum in the South Korean Embassy.
If they are caught in China and repatriated, they could face a long stretch in a prison camp or worse.
Many spend months and even years in China as illegal migrants to raise the cash they need to make the trip to the South.
More than 70 percent of the defectors who make it to the South are women. They are often forced to work in the sex industry in China, or sold to rural Chinese men who cannot find wives, before they escape to the South, human rights groups say.
Defectors who have settled in the South often pay smugglers to help bring their relatives from the North.
Some smugglers also collect their fees after the defectors arrive in the South and start earning wages.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. ENERGY INDUSTRY
Global executives will discuss climate change and other issues.
Global energy executives -- and the consultants, academics and news media who follow them -- will gather in Houston this week for the annual CERAWeek energy conference, sponsored by the consulting firm IHS Markit. Speakers include Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada; the Saudi Arabian energy minister, Khalid A. Al-Falih; and the Russian energy minister, Alexander Novak. Many chief executives, including the heads of Exxon Mobil and Chevron, will speak about a variety of issues, including climate change and new energy technologies. But much of the most serious business, the deal-making, will be done behind closed doors. Clifford Krauss
AUTO INDUSTRY
Trade will be a big question at a car showcase in Geneva.
The Geneva International Motor Show, one of the most important showcases for European carmakers, will open to the news media on Tuesday. Aside from new models, the focus at the show will be on how trade barriers could add to the industry's already formidable challenges. Carmakers are alarmed by President Trump's threats to tax imports from Mexico, where companies like Volkswagen have large factories. In Europe, "Brexit" could complicate sales to Britain. Industry executives will also debate the repercussions of PSA Peugeot Citro√´n's expected acquisition of the General Motors Opel unit, which would create Europe's biggest challenger to Volkswagen. The Motor Show will open to the public on Thursday and continue through March 19. Jack Ewing
TECHNOLOGY
A German court is poised to rule on a refugee's Facebook suit.
A German state court is expected on Tuesday to announce its ruling in the case of a Syrian refugee who is demanding that Facebook prevent users from reposting a selfie he took with Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015. The image, of the refugee, Anas Modamani, with the chancellor, initially came to symbolize the German leader's decision to let hundreds of thousands of unscreened migrants into Germany. But more recently, manipulated versions have shown up in fake news reports linking Mr. Modamani to terrorism. Melissa Eddy
LEGAL
Samsung's leader is set to go on trial.
The bribery trial of Lee Jae-yong, the de facto leader of Samsung, is scheduled to begin in a South Korean court on Thursday. Prosecutors and the South Korean news media were already declaring the case the "trial of the century," with the potential to lay bare longstanding collusion between politicians and powerful family-controlled conglomerates. Mr. Lee's arrest last month was an outgrowth of corruption allegations against South Korea's president, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached by Parliament in December. Mr. Lee is accused of buying political favors by paying $36 million in bribes to a secretive confidante of Ms. Park. Jonathan Soble
ECONOMY
The European Central Bank is to meet.
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank will meet in Frankfurt on Thursday amid calls for it to begin withdrawing its stimulus to the eurozone economy. After inflation in the eurozone hit the official target of 2 percent in February, economists in Germany said it was time to begin dialing back purchases of government bonds and other measures aimed at lowering market interest rates. The central bank is not expected to act yet, since the spike in inflation was due almost entirely to temporary increases in energy and food prices. But at a news conference after the meeting, Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, will face pressure to justify the central bank's loose money policies. Jack Ewing
A February increase in jobs is anticipated.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on the nation's hiring and unemployment for February. While analysts are not expecting this latest report to register as many job gains as January's, which said 227,000 had been added, the consensus points to a healthy monthly increase of 185,000.
Some of the suspense surrounding the release was lifted Friday by the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. The unemployment figures -- particularly those that come out right before the Fed's policy-making committee meets -- can have a big impact on the central bank's decision to shift its benchmark interest rate. But Ms. Yellen made clear in a speech in Chicago that only a huge upset would dissuade the Fed from raising rates this month. The unemployment rate is expected to tick back down to 4.7 percent from its current 4.8 percent. After a disappointing 0.1 percent increase in average hourly wages in January, economists are looking for a more robust 0.3 percent rise. Patricia Cohen

Full text: YAMBIO, South Sudan -- Simon Burete was weeding his peanut field a few weeks ago when he saw smoke coming from his house. He ran as fast as he could. He and his wife, Angelina, had enjoyed years of peace, he farming the fields, she selling the produce in the market. They were poor but welded to each other. Just that morning, they had talked about walking into town to buy their first mobile phones.
But as Mr. Burete made it back to the house, out of breath, red dirt still stuck to his knees, he couldn't believe his eyes. His wife was lying on the floor, burned to death in a rampage by government forces.
"I used to call her akara-ngba," he said, which means in the Zande language "the last word on beauty."
He could barely choke out the words.
South Sudan's war and its full ugliness are engulfing new, previously peaceful areas of the nation, spelling horror for the victims and signifying something deeper: This country is cracking apart.
Yambio, a midsize town of wide dirt roads and lofty kapok trees that seem to breathe tranquillity, used to be part of what was called a green state. This place was considered safe. It was not a red zone.
But now charred buildings and crushed huts line the roads leaving town. Bountiful fields -- here in a part of the country known as South Sudan's breadbasket -- lie untended during a desperate national food crisis. The names of dead loved ones circulate through hastily built displaced-persons camps all around Yambio, just as they do in cities and towns hundreds of miles away.
South Sudan's conflict started as a power struggle between the country's political leaders before slipping into a broader feud between the two biggest ethnic groups, the Nuer and the Dinka.
But as it enters its fourth year, this war, Africa's worst, is rapidly sucking in many of the nation's other ethnic groups, including the Azande, the Shilluk, the Moru, the Kakwa and the Kuku. The widening conflict is imperiling nearly every pillar that this young country's future rested on: oil production, agriculture, education, transport and most especially unity, which seemed so proudly on display six years ago when South Sudan was born in a halo of jubilation that now seems Pollyannish.
Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, and every major cease-fire that has been painstakingly negotiated by African and Western officials has been violated.
Dangerous fissures are opening up within the South Sudanese military, and the burst of bloodshed here in the Equatoria region is both cause and effect. An Equatorian general and a colonel recently quit, criticizing the government on their way out. One said the justice system was "too deformed to be reformed." The other accused the government of orchestrating a "tribally engineered war."
On top of all this now comes another calamity: famine.
Last month, the United Nations declared that parts of South Sudan, which receives billions of dollars of Western aid, were suffering a famine.
A formal famine declaration is rare -- in the past 25 years, only a handful have been made worldwide. They are a cry for help (and for donors to give more money) and an admission that aid efforts have catastrophically failed. Blaming the South Sudanese government and rebels for intentionally blocking lifesaving supplies, United Nation officials said more than one million people could die.
The hunger-stricken areas include some of the same ones afflicted during South Sudan's last famine in 1993, immortalized by a Pulitzer Prize-winning picture of a vulture squatting behind a starving toddler too exhausted to crawl.
A Repeat of Atrocities
The United States helped birth this nation, building ministries, training soldiers, pumping in more than $11 billion since 2005. Americans, especially powerful Christian groups, cheered on the South Sudanese rebels during their decades-long liberation battle to split off from the Arab-dominated government of Sudan, which southerners simply called "The North."
But South Sudan is going down the North's same bloody road.
By all accounts, South Sudanese soldiers have become brutal doppelg√§ngers of the widely vilified northern Sudanese forces that they had rebelled against, waging war ruthlessly against their own people.
Analysts say South Sudan has become shockingly similar to Darfur, the vast, western region of Sudan that plunged into conflict in the mid-2000s and became a global byword for atrocities against civilians.
What happened there is happening here: government-backed militias, and sometimes uniformed soldiers, sweeping into towns, burning down huts, massacring civilians, gang-raping women and driving millions from their homes, leaving many to crowd into disease-ridden camps protected by United Nations peacekeepers.
Human rights groups say the evidence of war crimes grows by the day. And just as in Darfur, United Nations officials in South Sudan are worried about genocide.
The South Sudanese government says it is putting down a rebellion -- the same rationale used in Darfur. And it is true that armed groups rose up in 2013, led by ambitious Nuer politicians challenging Dinka hegemony just two years after South Sudan won its independence from Sudan.
But the broader narrative of the two countries is beginning to blur. A commonly uttered line on Sudan is that it has been at war with itself since independence. Most analysts and even some South Sudanese government officials fear that could be South Sudan's destiny as well.
"We are doing exactly what the North was doing -- that is the irony," said John Gai Yoh, an adviser to South Sudan's president, Salva Kiir.
"I feel my life is meaningless," Mr. Yoh said, sitting in a large office in Juba, the capital. "Why is it that we had to fight all these years and end up here?"
He said he stayed on as a presidential adviser because if people like him left, "the whole system disintegrates."
Dinka Domination
South Sudanese officials admit that their government, led by Mr. Kiir, has been a huge disappointment.
Take the economy. When South Sudan gained independence, it was churning out 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, generating billions of dollars that were supposed to be spent on schools, roads, playgrounds, health clinics, water treatment facilities, police stations, all the gear of a functioning state.
But look around most of South Sudan and you won't see any of that. The reason? The oil revenue was stolen. Top officials have been accused of amassing fortunes, and they and their families were often spotted in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya next door, driving the snazziest cars -- $100,000 Land Rovers and gleaming Humvees that hogged up the road.
Back in South Sudan, teachers are paid less than $3 a month, and many said they hadn't seen even that. Even ambassadors often don't get paid.
A few years ago, the government struck a questionable revenue-sharing plan with Sudan. Instead of insulating themselves from oil shocks, as outside consultants urged, the South Sudanese cut a deal to make as much money as possible when oil prices were high.
But once oil prices collapsed, the costs of production were nearly as much as the market price, leading to almost no government revenue or foreign exchange and causing enormous inflation, which in turn has fueled the famine. For many South Sudanese, food prices have spiraled out of reach. And now that the war has disabled many pumps, oil production is a trickle.
One of the few shards of hope, analysts say, is that Riek Machar, the former vice president and powerful Nuer politician who led the rebellion against the president, has been sidelined, relegated to exile in South Africa. Mr. Machar has been widely blamed for stoking ethnic violence and was considered a destabilizing force in the 1990s during the liberation battles, and few of South Sudan's neighbors, which have been trying to broker a peace, want him to return.
But the issue of Dinka domination remains. The president, Mr. Kiir, is a Dinka, as are the chief of staff of the army and many top military and security officers.
Government officials admitted that some of their soldiers had committed abuses, but the government denies that it is trying to stir up an ethnically driven war.
In Yambio, most people are from the Azande ethnic group, and many say they have been brutalized by the Dinka. They also say some of their youths have joined the fight against the government.
They call the rebels "the boys in the bush."
It's often hard to tell which came first, the oppression or the rebellion.
In the past few months, small bands of Zande rebels have attacked government convoys and the houses of government officials. In response, the government has gone on a tear.
United Nations officials said that in December, government soldiers, commanded by Dinka officers, had burned down a string of villages outside Yambio and massacred scores of civilians. In Yei, another town in the Equatoria region, United Nations officials said that government soldiers chopped up babies and threw the body parts in a river.
The villages around Yambio have turned into ghost towns, empty huts staring lonesomely out at the wide dirt roads. Fields of peanuts, cassava, beans and corn have been abandoned. Some of the skinny papaya trees are so full of fruit at the top that they look like they're about to tip over. Nobody's around to pick them.
'Left Me for Dead'
Yambio was considered one of the best educated, peaceful and agriculturally productive parts of the country, but farmers have fled to camps for the internally displaced. The people here are now totally dependent on donations from aid groups, adding to the strain in dealing with the famine.
Few want to return home, fearing their own government.
"Six Dinka commandos raped me," said one woman in Yambio, who asked that her name not be used for fear of reprisals.
Not far away, David Angelo, 22, looked over his shoulders before slowly taking off his shirt. Standing in the sunlight, in front of a tiny hut in a displaced persons camp, he said he was not a rebel but had been captured by Dinka soldiers bent on revenge.
His back, his neck and his shoulders bore fresh machete scars. "The government soldiers left me for dead," he said.
Some analysts, both African and Western, feel the situation is so hopeless that they have proposed a radical solution: an international takeover. The argument says that South Sudan's government is not an effective or legitimate state, and that it should be nudged aside to let the United Nations and the African Union run a transitional administration for 10 to 15 years. South Sudanese officials say they would violently resist this.
"We went wrong," said Taban Deng Gai, the first vice president. But, he added, "South Sudan is not a banana state."
Many South Sudanese are now asking questions they thought they would never ask: Should they have voted for independence? Would their lives be better if South Sudan were still part of Sudan?
These questions are academic for Mr. Burete, whose eyes shine with tears when he remembers his wife.
He recalled how, at the end of each day, she would show him the money made from selling vegetables. If it was a good day, they would treat themselves to something special.
"She loved to eat meat," he kept saying. "She loved to eat meat."

Abstract: [...]women were 80 percent more likely than men to be impoverished at age 65 and older, while women age 75 to 79 were three times more likely to fall below the poverty level than men the same age. Many women take time off to raise children or care for an aging relative, which gives them fewer years to contribute to a retirement plan. [...]because employers will often match -- up to a set amount -- the money an employee sets aside in a workplace retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), those matching dollars are sacrificed. "Financial problems in retirement and senior debt arise with insufficient income as a result of lower lifetime earnings and less in savings, costs of family caregiving and divorce," said Cindy Hounsell, the founder and president of the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement, known as Wiser, a nonprofit organization dedicated to women's financial education and advocacy. [...]women often put their own needs last," Ms. Hounsell said. [...]about 54 percent of women said they were living from paycheck to paycheck.

Full text: Many women find it an uphill battle to save for retirement. Across all age groups, women have considerably less income in retirement than men, according to a report from the National Institute on Retirement Security. For women age 65 and older, their income is typically 25 percent lower than that of men. As men and women age, the gap widens to 44 percent by age 80.
As a result, women were 80 percent more likely than men to be impoverished at age 65 and older, while women age 75 to 79 were three times more likely to fall below the poverty level than men the same age.
To understand why, consider this: Working women, on average, earn less than their male counterparts, so they have less money to save for retirement. Their median wage is 80 percent of men's, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group.
Many women take time off to raise children or care for an aging relative, which gives them fewer years to contribute to a retirement plan. Moreover, because employers will often match -- up to a set amount -- the money an employee sets aside in a workplace retirement account, like a 401(k) or 403(b), those matching dollars are sacrificed.
"Financial problems in retirement and senior debt arise with insufficient income as a result of lower lifetime earnings and less in savings, costs of family caregiving and divorce," said Cindy Hounsell, the founder and president of the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement, known as Wiser, a nonprofit organization dedicated to women's financial education and advocacy.
Moreover, "women often put their own needs last," Ms. Hounsell said. They often choose to save for a child's education over their own retirement, for example, or work in a family business for no pay.
Women also live longer than men (81.2 years versus 76.4 years), according to statistics from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. "Living longer and needing more money for the extra years for health care, medical expenses and long-term care needs creates serious problems for women," Ms. Hounsell said.
Women increasingly report being the C.F.O. of the household, yet running out of money in retirement and managing the rising costs of health insurance remain the top worries for women, according to a new study, "Women, Money and Power," from the Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America.
And they are right to worry. The projected cost of health care is particularly striking. When it comes to saving for health care costs in retirement, women need to set aside much more (almost 20 percent more than men, on average) to cover their medical bills in the final years of their lives, according to a report, "The High Cost of Living Longer: Women & Retirement Health Care," from HealthView Services, a company in Danvers, Mass., that provides retirement health care data and tools to financial advisers.
The reason for the gap is simple: longevity. The report found that a healthy 65-year-old woman who retired in 2016 and will live to age 89 will have expected health care outlays of more than $300,000 on Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs for hearing, dental and vision care. For men, the projected cost is about $260,000. (These projections do not take into account the cost of medical care for those with annual incomes exceeding $85,000 for singles or $170,000 for couples, who can expect to pay surcharges on premiums for Medicare Parts B and D. The figure also does not include projections for any nursing or long-term care costs.)
For Cindy Jordan, 66, a resident of Brooklyn Park, Minn., the future cost of health care is unnerving. She is still on the job, at least for now. Last year, Ms. Jordan retired from her position as an executive administrative assistant at G & K Services, a uniform-rental company based in Minnetonka, Minn. But when her replacement quit, her boss called to see if she would be willing to come back full time, at least temporarily.
She agreed, but not for the money. She and her husband, who is already retired, are comfortable with their combination of employer-provided pensions, 401(k) plans and Social Security checks.
Even so, she is troubled. "I'm concerned about the health piece of it in case something would happen to myself or my husband, who is 14 years older than me," she said. "I worry that all I have built up will get eaten up by health costs." She added, "It takes a second for something to happen."
Driven by health care inflation, which is expected to rise an average of 6 percent a year, costs in the last years of life will be the most expensive, according to the HealthView Services report. These expenses could come at a time when savings have been whittled away by end-of-life care bills for a spouse.
Ramping up financial security is one way women can turn the tide. The Allianz study found that many women reported uncertainty about their financial decisions. Sixty-one percent of women wished they had more confidence in their financial decision making, and 63 percent wished they knew more about financial planning and investing.
Women are 14 percent more likely than men to participate in their workplace savings plan and, once enrolled, save at higher rates than men at all income levels, according to a report by the Vanguard Group, a mutual fund company. Despite a frequently held view that women are more risk-averse than men, the findings showed that equity allocations for women and men were similar in their plan accounts.
Yet a Wells Fargo survey of over 1,000 millennials ages 22 to 35 found that the majority of women (61 percent) said their finances were "stretched too thin to save for retirement." In fact, about 54 percent of women said they were living from paycheck to paycheck. Those saving for retirement are only putting aside an average of 5.7 percent of their salary, as compared with 7.3 percent for their male counterparts.
For older women, the good news in terms of financial well-being is that a large fraction of women are working in full-time jobs past their 60s and even into their 70s, according to a study, "Women Working Longer: Facts and Some Explanations," by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, Harvard University economists. In fact, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by the end of this decade, about 20 percent of women over 65 will be in the labor force.
Working longer makes it possible to add to retirement accounts and to avoid tapping into them for living expenses. It also frequently comes with employer-based health insurance. It can also deliver a substantial financial benefit in Social Security.
The extra years of earnings at these ages replace earlier years of low or zero earnings in the retirement benefit computation formula, according to research by Nicole Maestas, a Harvard economist who is an expert in the study of aging.

Full text: Since the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Gallup polling organization has asked Americans an open-ended question: "What do you think is the most important problem facing this country today?" Donald J. Trump delivered his first major address to the nation on Tuesday. He is confronted with a unique set of issues to tackle, but there is not one singular issue that is dominating the American consciousness. Donald J. Trump February 2017
With the economy humming along and United States troops withdrawn from major wars, Americans cited a variety of domestic problems as the most important. The top response was dissatisfaction with government, a sentiment Mr. Trump harnessed during his populist campaign.
"For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth." -- Donald J. Trump in his inaugural address on Jan. 20, 2017
Barack Obama February 2009
Mr. Obama entered his first term during the heart of the Great Recession. In his first major speech before Congress, he promoted the just-passed stimulus package and the need for the government to further intervene in the financial system.
"But while the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade." -- Barack Obama in his first address to Congress on Feb. 24, 2009
George W. Bush January 2001
Like the start of Mr. Trump's presidency, the beginning of Mr. Bush's first term lacked a major war or economic crisis, and Americans cited a variety of important problems. At the top of the list was moral decline in society, which had increasingly become a concern during the scandals of the presidency of Bill Clinton.
"Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency, which give direction to our freedom." -- George W. Bush in his first inaugural address on Jan. 20, 2001
Bill Clinton January 1993
Mr. Clinton came into office in 1993 in the midst of a recession, with the unemployment rate above 7 percent. But a financial boom soon followed, and by the end of his presidency, very few people still listed the economy as the key problem. "Our immediate priority must be to create jobs, create jobs now. Some people say, 'Well, we're in a recovery, and we don't have to do that.' Well, we all hope we're in a recovery, but we're sure not creating new jobs." -- Bill Clinton in his first address to Congress on Feb. 17, 1993
George H.W. Bush May 1989
In his first address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush described his plans to wage a war on drugs "on all fronts." Drugs were cited in more than a quarter of responses in May of 1989 and then in two-thirds of responses later that year. "The scourge of drugs must be stopped. And I am asking tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget outlays to escalate the war against drugs." -- George Bush in his first address to Congress on Feb. 9, 1989
Ronald Reagan January 1981
Mr. Reagan began his first term in office in the midst of a recession, with the inflation rate at a whopping 11.4 percent (it had come down slightly from 13.6 percent in June of 1979) and unemployment at 7.5 percent. "We don't have an option of living with inflation and its attendant tragedy, millions of productive people willing and able to work but unable to find a buyer for their work in the job market. We have an alternative, and that is the program for economic recovery." -- Ronald Reagan in his first address to Congress on Feb. 18, 1981
Jimmy Carter March 1977
Concerns about energy -- high prices and depletion of resources -- bubbled up several times during Jimmy Carter's presidency. About a third of responses cited the problem during the oil crisis of 1979. "We simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources. By acting now, we can control our future instead of letting the future control us." -- Jimmy Carter in a speech proposing a new energy policy on April 18, 1977
CHARTS (Source: Gallup data via the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Gallup conducted its surveys using in-person interviews until the late 1980s, when it transitioned to telephone surveys. More recent polls are based on a mix of cellphone and landline interviews. In some cases, respondents have been allowed multiple answers. In its early days, Gallup used "quota sampling" to ensure that it surveyed respondents who were representative of the population as a whole, according to an interview with Alec Gallup, a former chairman of the poll. Today the organization uses random sampling and weights the data based on United States demographics.)

Full text: Here are steps to get your financial situation in shape, whether you are closing in on retirement or just starting out. 20s and 30s
Learn the money basics Two books to consider: "How to Think About Money," by Jonathan Clements, and "Heads I Win, Tails I Win: Why Smart Investors Fail and How to Tilt the Odds in Your Favor," by Spencer Jakab.
The Investor Protection Institute's site, iInvest.org, offers free guides that explain stocks, bonds and mutual funds. You might also consider taking a personal finance course at a community college or checking the online offerings on sites like Coursera.org.
Sketch out your monthly budget Add up the fundamentals (your rent, utilities, groceries, transportation, student loans and car loans) and subtract from your monthly after-tax pay. Websites like Mint.com and YouNeedABudget.com offer free software to track spending and set up budgets.
Avoid credit card debt Debt can haunt you for years, affecting your ability to get a mortgage or even a job, because employers are known to check potential employees' credit reports.
Start saving and investing Take advantage of your employer's 401(k) or similar retirement plan. Workers under age 50 can contribute up to $18,000 to their employer-provided 401(k) in 2017. Contributions are tax deductible, and investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawals in retirement.
Invest enough in your 401(k) to qualify for the full match (the amount your employer puts in as a result of your contributions). Most employers require workers to save from 4 percent to 6 percent of pay to get the maximum match. Begin by saving at least 5 percent of your salary and increase the amount by one percentage point every year until you reach 20 percent. Some plans allow participants to schedule automatic increases each year.
Diversify investments Aim for a portfolio of stocks or stock mutual funds. Equities outperform fixed-income investments over time. Investors more than 15 years away from retirement should consider an aggressive portfolio with more than 80 percent allocated to stocks.
Invest in a diverse mix of low-cost index funds. You might select a trio of funds: a broad United States stock market index fund, an international stock market index fund with exposure to both developed and emerging markets, and an index fund that owns the overall United States bond market.
Another option: Target-date funds, or T.D.F.s, which automatically adjust the balance of their stock and fixed-income investments based on your age.
If you earn enough to save on top of your retirement plan but not so much that you are capped by I.R.S. income limitations, contribute to a Roth I.R.A. The adjusted gross income phaseout range for Roth I.R.A. contributions in 2017 is $186,000 to $196,000 for married couples filing jointly and $118,000 to $133,000 for singles and heads of households.
Review your credit report The three credit bureaus -- Experian, TransUnion and Equifax -- provide one free report annually. Request one at AnnualCreditReport.com, and check it every year to avoid problems when you need access to credit.
Do not skip health insurance Currently, you can be insured as a dependent on your parent's health insurance plan until age 26 -- unless you can get insurance through your job. If you cannot piggyback on your parent's plan and you do not have a job with health insurance, you may need to buy a policy through a health insurance marketplace.
Start an emergency fund Set aside money to cover unexpected life events and expenses like unreimbursed medical bills and auto or home repairs. Try to save a year's worth of expenses.
40s
Build a relationship with a financial adviser Look for a fee-only financial planner designated as a Certified Financial Planner by the nonprofit Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. The Board of Standards, the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors and the Financial Planning Association all offer searchable databases with the contact information of certified financial planners.
Rebalance your retirement account regularly Financial advisers typically suggest rebalancing your portfolio whenever the mix of equities and fixed-income investments is more than 7 percent to 10 percent from your original asset allocation.
Make a personal retirement plan projection A good place to start is an online calculator called the Ballpark E$timate, on the Employee Benefit Research Institute's site at choosetosave.org. Many major mutual fund companies also have retirement calculators on their sites.
Insure yourself If you have children or other dependents, consider a term life insurance policy that provides hundreds of thousands of dollars of coverage for minimum premiums over terms of 20 or 30 years, but has no cash value.
Set up a self-employed retirement plan If you are starting a business, or moving to a nonprofit or a small firm without an employee retirement plan, keep setting aside money in tax-friendly accounts like a SEP-I.R.A., a solo 401(k) or a SIMPLE I.R.A. One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make is not planning adequately -- or at all -- for their retirement.
50s
Pay down debts If possible, pay off outstanding high-interest credit card debts, college loans and auto loans.
Make your catch-up contributions In 2017, workers 50 and older can contribute $6,000 in "catch-up" contributions to their 401(k) or other employer-provided retirement plans.
Review your Social Security and pension benefit options You can get an estimate of your future Social Security benefits and a record of your lifetime earnings history at socialsecurity.gov. The AARP also has a retirement and a Social Security benefits calculator. These days, many people claim Social Security as soon as they turn 62, the earliest possible age. If you delay claiming Social Security until age 70, you will increase benefits by about 8 percent a year.
Start planning your next act If you want to start an encore career, keep in mind that money is the biggest stumbling block. That is because starting over in a new field, particularly a philanthropic one, or going the self-employment route, usually comes with a price tag, at least initially. Start planning a few years ahead by saving, adding new skills and downsizing.
Make a move Investigate the upside of moving to a smaller home, townhouse or condo. Depending on your real estate market, refinancing your mortgage can also lighten your debt load. Figure out how much you can save over time with an online refinancing calculator. Check HSH.com or Bankrate.com for the latest rates and then shop around.
Protect the wealth you have Review disability, life, personal liability and umbrella insurance. Evaluate long-term care insurance coverage (generally not appropriate before or after mid-50s). Premiums get much larger as you age, and health issues may disqualify you. Update your will and estate planning documents. Watch out for high mutual fund and management fees, which can whittle away at your savings.
60s and Beyond
Get a grip on your retirement income sources Carefully review your anticipated income (Social Security benefits, pensions, distributions from personal investments and savings) and expenses (weekly, monthly and yearly budgets) at least a year before you stop working.
Take control of fixed monthly costs Downsize. Consider selling your home and moving to an area with a lower cost of living or to a rental property. This will allow you to save on property taxes, maintenance and insurance costs. Some people who live in high cost-of-living areas might look at relocating to an area with lower taxes and cheaper real estate costs.
Consider working beyond your official retirement age The longer you work, the longer you can contribute to a defined contribution plan like a 401(k). Working longer might give you access to a health plan, or help you pay for another one until you are eligible for Medicare at 65.
Shift your investments to a more conservative asset mix You may want to keep about 40 percent of your investments in stocks or stock funds well into retirement.
Plan your withdrawal rates A conservative annual drawdown of retirement savings may be to take 3 percent the first year, and to adjust for inflation after that. If you have saved $1 million, for example, plan to withdraw $30,000 in the first year and to increase that amount by the rate of inflation in the second year and beyond.

Full text: Five days a week, Kim Moske makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and brown-bags it to work. "I've been doing that for 30 years and saving what I would have spent eating my lunch out someplace," she said. "That's added up to a lot of money, and truthfully, I don't care what I eat for lunch." That is a small gesture, but it is indicative of the advantages of making daily choices to help save for a financially secure retirement.
Ms. Moske, 56, lives in Delaware, Ohio, and is a project manager for a small manufacturing firm. She expects to retire in six years. But it has not been all about homemade sandwiches: She started to save and invest in her late 20s.
That foresight and discipline have made it possible for her to envision a fairly traditional retirement -- one that will allow her time to pursue hobbies like gardening, hiking in Hocking Hills State Park or biking along the Olentangy River near her home, and traveling.
"I'm not one of these who has to go to Paris, but it would be fun to finish seeing all the 50 states," she said. "I've visited 30 of them."
Ms. Moske grew up in a family "where we were always getting utilities shut off," she said. "We lived in fear that our car would be repossessed, and we frequently ran out of milk. I was raised by two people who were very good at wasting money and very poor at managing it. They were a financial disaster."
"My father worked very hard his entire life and made a good income, yet he died penniless at age 78," she said. "I'm frugal to a fault. Therefore my retirement is in pretty good shape."
Ms. Moske is proof that it is never too early to start working on your retirement plan. Fewer workers today have traditional pensions than in the past, life expectancies are generally longer and, with unknowns like health care costs and inflation in the coming decades, planning is more important than ever.
When Ms. Moske was 26 and working full time to pay her way through college, she signed up for a class on finance and investing. "I didn't know a stock from a cornstalk, but I realized that I needed to take control," she said. "My husband and I immediately started living on less than what we needed, saving and investing."
Money was tight during the dozen years that she stayed home to raise the couple's two children, now 20 and 22. She also missed out on those years of employer-provided retirement savings.
Then, six years ago, her husband died from injuries sustained in a fall. That caused a seismic shift not only emotionally, but also financially, as she had to live on one income. But she paid off her home, now valued at around $300,000, with a portion of the money she received from her husband's life insurance policy.
"I will be fine," she said. "But I don't go it alone: I meet with a financial planner once a year to make sure I am on track, and I check retirement calculators all the time."
In many ways, she is an anomaly.
'Work More, Save More or Both'
Unlike Ms. Moske, many Americans are not ready for retirement. "Nearly half of families have no retirement-account savings at all," says a report by the Economic Policy Institute, an independent nonprofit think tank that researches the impact of economic trends and policies on working people in the United States. The median retirement savings figure among all working-age families in the United States is just $5,000; the median among families with savings is $60,000.
According to the Fidelity Investments Retirement Savings Assessment, 55 percent of American households risk not being able to cover essential expenses like housing, health care and food in retirement.
Fred Blanton, a business and marketing consultant in Houston, does not have "a big golden nest egg," he said. "I'm going to be 65 in a few months, but I need an income. I have enough money if I live another 15 years, but am I going to die at 80?"
Mr. Blanton's fear of outliving his savings is heartbreakingly real. "We are now living longer and have to recognize that we either have to work more, save more or both," said Don Blandin, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Investor Protection Trust, which worked with Detroit Public Television to produce the documentary "When I'm 65: Rethinking Retirement in America."
"The 65 retirement age for Social Security was put in place in 1933 when retirement lasted eight to 10 years," Mr. Blandin said. "In the old pension system, people didn't have to make decisions on how much to contribute to a retirement account, which investments to grow their nest egg, how big of a nest egg they would need, what to do with the nest egg when changing jobs and how much to withdraw on an annual basis in retirement."
A Plan for the Self-Employed
It is essential to get a "snapshot of your financial picture ASAP," Mr. Blandin said. For example, how much have you already saved for retirement? How much are you saving annually as a percentage of your income? Can you bump it up? How is it invested? Have you used a retirement calculator to run the numbers? Have you worked with a financial planner to help you create a blueprint?
Even people who save conscientiously, he said, are not necessarily paying close attention to the details of the financial products they purchase, investment fees, planning for health care in retirement, inflation and other factors that will affect their future.
Moreover, the 15 million self-employed workers in this country face another set of retirement challenges. For many of them, working longer is their retirement plan, according to a recent report by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies in collaboration with the Aegon Center for Longevity and Retirement. They found that more than half of self-employed workers expected to retire either after age 65 or never.
"Saving and planning for retirement among the self-employed requires a do-it-yourself approach," said Catherine Collinson, president of the Transamerica Center and executive director of the Aegon Center. "Because they don't have an employer, they typically lack access to the employer-sponsored retirement benefits that so many workers enjoy."
"They also often encounter fluctuations in income," she said, "which makes it that much more challenging to save on a consistent basis."
About one-third of self-employed workers always make sure they are saving for retirement, according to the report. Less than a quarter say they save for retirement on an occasional basis, or that they have saved for retirement in the past but are not currently doing so.
For many retirees, part-time work is a pillar of their retirement strategy, along with Social Security, retirement savings plans and other savings. "The line between work and retirement has blurred," said Maddy Dychtwald, an author and a founder of Age Wave, a think tank and consultancy. "Seven in 10 pre-retirees say they plan to work in retirement, and the fastest-growing segment of the total American work force is those 55-plus."
Some people have always worked a variety of jobs in retirement, but for a growing number of retirees, it is now a necessity. "With my clients, I'm having retirement discussions about transitioning their lifestyle gradually," said Lazetta Rainey Braxton, a financial planner and founder of Financial Fountains in Baltimore. "We talk about ways that their skill set allows them to be a part of the gig economy, and if they need to add any new skills to stay relevant in the work force and how to budget for that cost."
Even for those who have saved enough to retire comfortably, working for pay in retirement can help provide a safety net and peace of mind. It helps people put off dipping into retirement accounts and may even allow some to continue contributing to their retirement savings.
The pay can also help provide a cushion to allow someone to delay tapping into Social Security until age 70, which increases annual Social Security income by nearly 8 percent compared with retiring at the full retirement age. The income can also help with medical bills not covered by Medicare.
Making It Work
For Michael L. Stark, 66, chief operating officer at American Financial Network in Calabasas, Calif., the decision to stay on the job is straightforward. He loves what he does and believes that he is still on a learning curve. He has flexibility in his hours and a short commute to work, leaving him time to spend with his three grandchildren and on leisure activities like skiing and hiking.
"I am not wealthy by any means, but my wife and I have done O.K. saving," he said. "I could have retired a couple of years ago, but I am not mentally or physically ready to retire right now."
The benefits of working in retirement, of course, go well beyond finances. In fact, a recent study by Age Wave and Merrill Lynch found that the top three benefits of continuing to work in retirement were mental stimulation, physical activity and social connections.
Retirement is about a lot more than just hitting financial targets. "It's about taking a more holistic approach to our longer lives," Ms. Dychtwald said. "Despite the challenges, retirees are generally adaptable. They are willing to make a wide array of course corrections, trade-offs and adjustments -- from continuing some form of work, to downsizing or relocating their home, to renting out a spare bedroom or living with a roommate -- which offer the chance to create more financial security."
As for Ms. Moske, when she retires she plans to buy a small condo in Florida where she can go for the winter months. Thinking of her brown-bag habits, she laughed and said, "I'll name it PB&J."

Abstract: China said Saturday that its military budget would rise by about 7 percent this year, apparently the lowest increase in seven years, signaling that its leaders do not plan to engage the United States in an arms race even as President Trump seeks to bolster the Pentagon's spending. Wang Xiangsui, a retired senior colonel in China's Air Force who is now director of the Research Center of Strategic Issues at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said Mr. Trump's plans to increase military spending were unlikely to prod China into following suit. China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, who visited Washington this week and met briefly with Mr. Trump at the White House, probably had the military budget on his mind as he tried to judge the mood of the new administration, said Dennis J. Blasko, an American expert on the Chinese military.

Full text: BEIJING -- China said Saturday that its military budget would rise by about 7 percent this year, apparently the lowest increase in seven years, signaling that its leaders do not plan to engage the United States in an arms race even as President Trump seeks to bolster the Pentagon's spending. Addressing reporters before the start of the annual National People's Congress, Fu Ying, a spokeswoman for the legislature, said the increase would be "about" 7 percent. She said defense spending would amount to roughly 1.3 percent of China's gross domestic product.
Last year's proposed increase was 7.6 percent, though China has yet to release final figures indicating how much was actually spent. Those figures, and the exact number of this year's projected increase, will be revealed in a budget that the government releases on Sunday, when the national legislature starts its annual full session.
Before 2016, the military budget had received double-digit increases for six years, a reflection of China's then-roaring economy.
Chinese experts said the new budget would keep military spending roughly in line with the government's usual formula of G.D.P. growth plus inflation.
As China's economy continues to slow, annual growth in the gross domestic product is expected to be about 6.5 percent. Inflation hovers around 2 percent. And the government must also find more money for health care, education and other increasingly expensive social needs.
Chinese and Western military analysts said it was notable that Mr. Trump's recent pledge to raise American defense spending by $54 billion had not spurred China to elevate its own spending further.
Ms. Fu said that China wanted good relations with the Trump administration but would respond to any challenges.
"President Xi Jinping and President Trump have had two direct phone calls, and the message was very clear, which is that there must be more cooperation between China and the United States so we become good partners," Ms. Fu said. But she added that China would watch the effects of Mr. Trump's global policy changes.
"Of course, everyone hopes that their impact will be positive, but if there are challenges, China will respond calmly," Ms. Fu said.
The U.S. military is vastly more powerful than China's, as Ms. Fu noted. "Fundamentally, this is about the United States worrying that China could catch up and surpass the U.S. in its ability," she said. "But in fact there is a still a huge gap in ability between the U.S. and China, which is still a developing country."
To emphasize his intent to strengthen the American military, Mr. Trump visited the country's new aircraft carrier this week. The Gerald R. Ford is a nuclear-powered, 100,000-ton floating fortress due to be commissioned this year and is the first in a new generation of supercarriers.
The United States has 10 Nimitz-class supercarriers. In contrast, China is building its first aircraft carrier, a diesel-propelled vessel, and has one refurbished carrier from Ukraine.
Wang Xiangsui, a retired senior colonel in China's Air Force who is now director of the Research Center of Strategic Issues at the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said Mr. Trump's plans to increase military spending were unlikely to prod China into following suit. "I don't think China will be oversensitive about this," he said.
"Despite all the aggressive talk, no one wants a war," Mr. Wang said. While the $54 billion increase sounds like a lot, he added, "the Americans didn't achieve anything after spending six trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan."
China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, who visited Washington this week and met briefly with Mr. Trump at the White House, probably had the military budget on his mind as he tried to judge the mood of the new administration, said Dennis J. Blasko, an American expert on the Chinese military.
"I'm guessing Yang Jiechi was tasked to make an assessment of the state of the bilateral relationship to see if there may need to be a last-minute adjustment in reaction to the requested increase for the U.S. defense budget," said Mr. Blasko, a retired army lieutenant colonel and the author of "The Chinese Army Today."
Mr. Yang probably found the relationship to be on a sound enough footing, Mr. Blasko said. "I don't think they want to get into a military budget fight with us, not even a rhetorical one."
Ni Lexiong, a naval expert in Shanghai, said that if China really felt the need to spend more heavily on the military, it would not hesitate to do so.
"If China felt threatened, I don't think slower economic growth would stop them from spending more on the military," Mr. Ni said. "You have seen how the Chinese were willing to starve to build an atomic bomb. We do not worry about poverty when we think a larger military is necessary."
He said the new budget would allow China to keep modernizing its navy and air force, the two services currently getting the most attention. The navy launched 22 warships in 2016 to replace old ones, and the budget would let it keep up that pace this year, he said.
"A chunk of the expenditure will go towards developing and manufacturing the latest weapons for a stronger air force and navy," he said. "I believe this speed of replacement will continue, because it has been one of China's long-term growth goals to build a military stronger than America's one day, in either quality or quantity."
While China's future aircraft carriers are likely to be nuclear powered, the Chinese Navy will probably be focused on other, more important areas, said Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor at the China Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island.
"Chinese submarine development and the building of destroyers and frigates are likely more expensive and more consequential for the overall military balance," he said.
If Mr. Trump were to win his proposed increase of $54 billion, the American defense budget would be $603 billion, about 3 percent higher than under former President Barack Obama's last budget plan.
The People's Liberation Army's official budget was about $146 billion in 2016. Western groups that study the Chinese military say that actual spending is roughly 1.2 to 1.5 times greater than the announced figures.
Using a rough estimate that assumes an average G.D.P. growth in China of 6.5 percent and a U.S. growth rate of 3 percent, China's military spending would be expected to surpass America's around 2040, said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Among the issues that Chinese military planners must deal with is how to handle the retrenchment of 300,000 personnel announced by President Xi Jinping in 2015, part of an effort to streamline the P.L.A. into a modern fighting force. Although most of those leaving the army are mid- to low-level officers and soldiers, the severance costs are expected to be substantial, retired Chinese officers said.

Full text: A late wave of buying helped nudge stock indexes slightly higher on Friday after a day of mostly listless trading. Banks and health care stocks climbed the most as investors priced in an increasing likelihood that interest rates would rise.
The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, helped stoke those expectations in a speech on Friday in which she said an improving job market and rising inflation would probably prompt the central bank to increase borrowing costs.
"The real takeaway here is if the Fed is willing to start moving, they see the economy as not only doing better but likely to do better going forward," said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. "The Fed is notorious for waiting until the evidence of growth is absolutely undeniable."
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.74 points, or 0.01 percent, to 21,005.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.20 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,383.12. The Nasdaq composite index added 9.53 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,870.75.
Speaking in Chicago, Ms. Yellen said the Fed would probably resume raising interest rates later this month to reflect a strengthening job market and inflation edging toward the central bank's 2 percent target rate.
She added that the central bank expected steady economic improvement to justify additional rate increases. While not specifying how many rate changes could occur this year, Ms. Yellen reiterated that Fed officials in December had estimated that there would be three this year.
Investors' expectations of a rate increase this month had been building in recent days as remarks by other Fed officials signaled the central bank is ready to resume raising rates as soon as its next two-day meeting on March 14-15.
Still, the increased likelihood of higher interest rates gave several stocks a modest lift, including banks, which stand to make healthier profits from lending as rates rise.
Real estate, utilities and phone company stocks tend to lose favor among yield-seeking investors when interest rates rise.
"If yields are going up you don't need to buy those stocks to get your yield, you just buy 10-Year Treasury notes," said John Canally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial.
Bond prices were little changed after pulling back from an early climb. The 10-year Treasury yield held steady at 2.48 percent.
Energy futures rose. Benchmark crude gained 72 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $53.33 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oil, added 82 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $55.90 a barrel in London.
Gold fell $6.40 to $1,225.50 an ounce. Silver slipped a penny to $17.70 an ounce. Copper rose a penny to $2.69 a pound.
Wall Street's slight gains on Friday left the stock market hovering near its latest record highs set on Wednesday.
Airlines were among the stocks that notched solid gains Friday.
American Airlines Group rose $1.10, or 2.4 percent, to $46.82, while Alaska Air Group added $2.58, or 2.7 percent, to $98.94. United Continental picked up $2.31, or 3.2 percent, to $75.59.
Disappointing company earnings and outlooks pulled down several stocks.
Costco fell $7.72, or 4.3 percent, to $170.26. The firearms manufacturer American Outdoor Brands, formerly called Smith & Wesson, declined 55 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $18.83.
Macy's also fell sharply, one of several retailers that closed lower Friday. The department store chain declined the most among stocks in the S.&P. 500, dropping $1.45, or 4.4 percent, to $31.77.

Set to Lift Rate, Fed Adopts Hope Felt by Investors

Abstract: The Federal Reserve is poised to raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-March, significantly sooner than investors had expected, as it moves to keep pace with a wave of economic optimism that started with the election of President Trump. Ms. Yellen added that the Fed still expected to raise rates twice more later in the year, which she said would bring the benchmark rate close to a level that the Fed regards as neutral, with low rates no longer providing an inducement for borrowing and risk-taking. The impending rate increase could heighten tensions with the White House, which wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, reducing regulation and increasing defense and infrastructure spending. Some Fed officials appear particularly focused on the rise of the stock market. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who described markets as "very buoyant" on Tuesday, has said in the past that if markets did not respond to rate increases, the Fed might need to act more forcefully to tighten financial conditions. Markets are wary of the Fed's flirtations with interest rate increases, as the central bank in recent years has often found reasons for last-minute postponements.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. The Federal Reserve is poised to raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-March, significantly sooner than investors had expected, as it moves to keep pace with a wave of economic optimism that started with the election of President Trump.
In an unusually clear statement about a pending decision, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Friday in Chicago that the central bank was likely to act at its next policy-making meeting -- barring any unpleasant economic surprises.
Ms. Yellen added that the Fed still expected to raise rates twice more later in the year, which she said would bring the benchmark rate close to a level that the Fed regards as neutral, with low rates no longer providing an inducement for borrowing and risk-taking. That outlook signals that an end is finally in sight for the Fed's economic stimulus campaign, devised during the depths of the financial crisis more than eight years ago.
Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, delivered the same message at the same time at a conference in New York. "We've seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time," Mr. Fischer said of the postelection shift in economic conditions. "There is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months."
Asked whether Fed officials were delivering a coordinated message, Mr. Fischer responded wryly, "If there has been a conscious effort, I'm about to join it."
The impending rate increase could heighten tensions with the White House, which wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, reducing regulation and increasing defense and infrastructure spending. Fed officials have concluded the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth should be offset by faster rate increases.
Financial markets, however, are taking the prospect of higher rates in stride. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is up more than 11 percent since Election Day, ended trading on Friday mostly flat.
The prospective Fed move has modest short-term implications for consumers. Interest rates on car loans and some kinds of credit card debt will tick upward, but remain at low levels by historical standards. Rates on 30-year mortgages are up by about half a percentage point over the past year.
The broader consequences depend on the Fed's ability to raise interest rates without slowing economic growth. The Fed's goal is to return rates to a level that neither encourages nor impedes economic activity. Over the past century, however, most of the central bank's attempts to strike that balance have ended in economic recessions.
The American economy is in the midst of one of the longest expansions in the nation's history, but it is also one of the weakest. The economy expanded by 1.6 percent in 2016, compared with 2.6 percent in 2015, according to the government's most recent estimate.
Fed officials have concluded, however, that monetary policy cannot deliver faster growth. The Fed's job is to minimize unemployment and moderate inflation. The unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and prices rose 1.9 percent in the 12 months ending in January, the closest the Fed has come since 2012 to hitting its target of 2 percent annual inflation.
In December, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since the financial crisis, to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, and predicted three increases in 2017.
At the beginning of the week, however, Wall Street analysts and investors did not expect the Fed to raise rates again any earlier than June. The Fed issued a measured statement after its policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency.
Now, after a week of discussions, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely.
Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as "remarkably swift and decisive." Investors put the chances at almost 80 percent in trading on Friday, according to an analysis of asset prices by CME Group.
Some Fed officials appear particularly focused on the rise of the stock market. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who described markets as "very buoyant" on Tuesday, has said in the past that if markets did not respond to rate increases, the Fed might need to act more forcefully to tighten financial conditions.
It is also getting harder to dismiss the market's reaction to Mr. Trump's victory as a bout of temporary euphoria. Mr. Fischer noted on Friday that the stock market boom was creating wealth that people would begin to spend.
Ms. Yellen pointed to an improvement in the global context. "The prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," she said.
The shift in the Fed's language over the last week also may reflect a recognition that market expectations were not keeping pace with the Fed's evolving view of the economy. Ms. Yellen, in a February appearance before Congress, hinted that the Fed might be providing a little too much stimulus, describing the Fed's policy as "accommodative." But at the start of this week, investors still put a low probability on a March increase.
Markets are wary of the Fed's flirtations with interest rate increases, as the central bank in recent years has often found reasons for last-minute postponements.
This time, the Fed chose to overwhelm any lingering doubts.
On Tuesday, Mr. Dudley told CNBC that the case for a rate increase "has become a lot more compelling."
On Wednesday, Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been one of the most consistent supporters of raising interest rates slowly, suggested that she too was ready to act.
"We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time," Ms. Brainard said at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path."
Fed officials often bury their latest views on monetary policy at the end of their speeches. Ms. Brainard's remarks came at the beginning, so that no one missed the point.
On Thursday, another Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, issued a similarly blunt notice of intent in an interview with CNBC. "I think the case for a rate increase for March has come together, and I think it's on the table for discussion," he said.
Then came Friday, the last day on which Fed rules allowed officials to comment on monetary policy before the March meeting, and Ms. Yellen delivered the last word.
"At our meeting later this month," she said, "the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate."
The committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on March 14 and 15.

Correction: March 7, 2017, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A subheading on Saturday with an article about the Federal Reserve's plans to increase interest rates misstated the cause of prospective tensions between the Fed and President Trump. As the article correctly noted, it is the Fed's efforts to curb inflation -- not inflation and joblessness -- that may frustrate Mr. Trump.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. S√ÉO PAULO, Brazil -- Brazil's sickly economy is hemorrhaging thousands of jobs a day, states are scrambling to pay police officers and teachers, and money for subsidized meals is in such short supply that one legislator suggested that the poor could "eat every other day."
Still, not everyone is suffering. Civil servants in the judicial branch are enjoying a 41 percent raise. Legislators here in S√£o Paulo, Brazil's largest city, voted to increase their own salaries by more than 26 percent. And Congress, which is preparing to cut pension benefits around the country, is now allowing its members to retire with lifelong pensions after just two years in office.
Brazil is struggling to pull out of its worst economic crisis in decades, and President Michel Temer says the country needs to curb public spending to do so.
Yet it did not help his dismal approval ratings when he hosted a lavish taxpayer-funded banquet to persuade members of Congress to support his budget cuts, with 300 guests eating shrimp and filet mignon.
Outside such rarefied circles, Mr. Temer's austerity measures are igniting a fierce debate over how the richest and most powerful Brazilians are protecting their wealth and privileges at a time when much of the country is enduring a harrowing economic decline.
"This government talks about austerity for everyone, but of course forces the costs on society's most vulnerable people," said Giovana Santos Pereira, 25, a schoolteacher. "It's ridiculous to the point of being tragic."
Much of the ire revolves around the centerpiece of Mr. Temer's austerity drive: his success in persuading the scandal-ridden Congress to impose a cap on federal spending for the next 20 years.
Mr. Temer, who rose to power last year after supporting the impeachment of his predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, says the cap, which would limit the growth in spending to the rate of inflation, is needed to scale back ballooning budget deficits.
Investors have applauded the measure as a turning point for Latin America's largest economy. But critics are lashing out at the spending cap, saying it could harm the poor for decades to come, especially in areas like education. Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said the spending cap placed Brazil "in a socially retrogressive category all of its own."
The debate is all the more caustic because Mr. Temer's government is resisting calls to raise taxes on wealthy Brazilians, who still enjoy what some economists describe as one of the most generous tax systems for the rich among major economies.
For instance, Brazilians remain exempt from paying any taxes at all on dividends from stock holdings, and they can easily use loopholes to significantly lower taxes on other sources of income.
Economists at the government's Institute of Applied Economic Research said in a 2016 study that a 15 percent tax on dividends could generate nearly $17 billion in revenue a year, but such proposals have failed to gain traction in a government that has shifted to the right.
"The system is engineered to perpetuate inequality, and Temer is doubling down on bets that Brazil needs Greek-style austerity," said Pedro Paulo Zahluth Bastos, an economist at the University of Campinas, drawing parallels between Brazil's multiyear slowdown and Greece's seemingly interminable economic crisis.
Mr. Temer has not been a popular president, and his approval ratings stand at just 10 percent. But his supporters point out that his leftist predecessor, Ms. Rousseff, sought her own austerity measures before her ouster last year, and that his government has promised to maintain some widely popular antipoverty programs expanded by her party years ago.
Mr. Temer's government says it is reversing the free-spending ways of previous governments. Brazil's economy shrank about 4 percent in 2016, when its political class was consumed by infighting over the impeachment. But last month, the finance minister, Henrique Meirelles, claimed that "the recession has ended."
Some promising signs of a recovery may be emerging. Foreign investment has increased and, after performing poorly, Brazil's stock market was one of the best performing in the world in 2016, creating a windfall for the relatively prosperous Brazilians who put money into equities. Mr. Temer is especially bullish, predicting that the economy will grow 3 percent next year.
But the conditions on the streets of cities around Brazil tell a different story, reflecting devilishly complex structural challenges as millions of Brazilians fall into poverty.
States are facing crippling strikes by public employees over unpaid or inadequate salaries. In the state of Esp√≠rito Santo, in southeast Brazil, a police strike last month produced an anarchic week marked by looting and a surge in homicides.
Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympics in August, showcases the complex issues Brazil's states face. In desperate efforts to slash deficits, the authorities in Rio are shutting down restaurants that provide subsidized meals to the poor, raising taxes on residential electricity service and eliminating welfare programs for the state's poorest residents.
Yet Rio's governor, like his counterparts in other Brazilian states, enjoys the use of a private jet for jaunts around the country. And Rio's judges, already well paid, were pressing ahead with plans to spend millions of dollars hiring new servants for their chambers -- until the public got wind of the plan. The ensuing outrage forced the judges to shelve the idea.
At the same time, the state is having trouble finding money to pay for food for the poor. The cost -- about 65 cents a meal -- was straining the state enough that one state legislator, Pedro Fernandes, suggested taking meals "every other day."
"I don't know if what I'm saying is absurd, but it's something to ponder," he said.
The ability of elected officials and elite public employees to secure what Brazilians call "super salaries" and outsize benefits for themselves has long been a contentious feature of the country's political system.
But while Brazilians fume over the issue at a time of national belt-tightening, some officials say they are entitled to special treatment. Brazilian judges, who can easily make about $200,000 a year, have been especially outspoken in demanding raises in a country where roughly half the population scrapes by on a minimum wage of about $4,000.
"There's no shame whatsoever in this," Ricardo Lewandowski, a Supreme Court justice, recently told a conference of judges to a round of applause. "Building maintenance fees go up, real estate taxes go up, gasoline goes up, food goes up, and the judge's salary can't go up?"
As many poor and middle-class Brazilians absorb the brunt of austerity policies, the protracted economic slowdown and a dizzying array of graft scandals involving the nation's political leaders are fueling anti-establishment sentiment ahead of presidential elections in 2018, paving the way for figures outside the mainstream to gain momentum.
Alarming some politicians, Jair Bolsonaro, an ultranationalist congressman who excoriates immigrants and defends the torture of drug traffickers, is polling well ahead of traditional contenders like A√©cio Neves, a senator from the Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
According to a survey last month by MDA, a Brazilian polling company, just 1 percent of respondents said they would vote for Mr. Temer, reflecting his dismal nationwide standing. It may not even matter, since Mr. Temer's conviction for violating campaign finance limits could make him ineligible to run. His popularity sustained another blow in recent days after his government spent thousands of dollars to upgrade the president's luxurious residence, only for Mr. Temer to move his family back to another government-owned palace in the capital, Bras√≠lia.
The poll was conducted from Feb. 8 to 11 through interviews with 2,002 people, with a margin of sampling error or plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. It also showed a former president, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, as a potential front-runner.
But Mr. da Silva, a leftist who has been condemning Mr. Temer's austerity measures, could also find himself ineligible to run if he is convicted of graft charges in connection with his ties to construction companies that profited from public contracts.
Given the volatile political landscape and the weak economy, a sense of hopelessness afflicts many Brazilians.
Ana Cristina Silva, 49, lost her job in December at a company in the southern city of Porto Alegre that assembles furniture.
"They just think about themselves," she said about Mr. Temer's government, expressing indignation about the pay increases granted to some public employees while much of the country is still reeling. "It's absurd. Those who don't need it get a raise."

The federal budget deficit in fiscal 2016 was $587 billion, while the "tax gap" -- the gulf between taxes owed and taxes paid -- averaged $458 billion from 2008 from 2010, according to an analysis conducted by the I.R.S. last year.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump has a rocky history with the Internal Revenue Service, which he has complained audits him with unfair ferocity. Now he wants to significantly cut the tax agency's funding at a time when it has already been bleeding staff and struggling to keep up with a flood of returns ahead of Tax Day. The plans, revealed this week in documents associated with the White House budget outline, put Mr. Trump at odds with his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who has argued that the I.R.S. needs more money and a larger staff.
Another round of cuts, tax experts say, could put one of the few federal departments that pay for themselves on life support.
"This is an agency that has had every last drop squeezed out of it," said Dennis J. Ventry Jr., a member of the I.R.S. advisory council and a law professor at the University of California, Davis. "I don't know how it's going to sustain itself."
The White House budget office has proposed a 14.1 percent cut to the I.R.S. for the fiscal year that begins in October, reducing the agency's budget to $9.65 billion; six years ago, it stood at $12.1 billion ($13.6 billion when adjusted for inflation).
If approved, the cuts would happen when the number of audits is down and customer service complaints are up as a result of the drop in funding.
Mr. Mnuchin surprised some Republicans at his Senate confirmation hearing in January when he said that one of his priorities as Treasury secretary would be to rebuild the I.R.S.'s staff.
Promising to modernize a Treasury unit that many conservatives have threatened to abolish, Mr. Mnuchin said he was certain that Mr. Trump understood the concept of "we add people, we make money." Investing in the I.R.S., Mr. Mnuchin suggested, was a smart move because the agency's work ultimately paid for itself through the revenue that it brought in.
The White House, it seems, has other ideas.
The potential reduction in I.R.S. funding is the latest example of potential division within the Trump administration's economic team, which has wrestled with how to cut taxes, invest in the military and lower the debt at the same time.
New internal data released by the agency this week underscored the pressure it is under. The number of individual tax return audits fell last year to its lowest level since 2004, and enforcement staffing levels were down by nearly 30 percent from 2010, to just below 16,000. Criminal investigations related to tax-related identity theft, money laundering, public corruption, cybercrime and terrorist financing also are on the decline, and I.R.S. officials cited budget constraints as the reason.
"This is only going to continue that trend," Roberton C. Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, says of the potential cuts the agency is facing. "Audits are really a necessary function in the sense that it maintains the integrity of the system."
There is the issue of unpaid taxes, an enormous cost to America's finances. The federal budget deficit in fiscal 2016 was $587 billion, while the "tax gap" -- the gulf between taxes owed and taxes paid -- averaged $458 billion from 2008 from 2010, according to an analysis conducted by the I.R.S. last year. Collecting even half that sum could make up a significant chunk of the government's budget shortfall, without increasing taxes or cutting spending.
Handicapping the agency with additional budget cuts will make matters worse, experts say, emboldening scofflaws to take their chances against an increasingly toothless tax collector. And as funding continues to fall, honest taxpayers are suffering from a lack of attention.
The I.R.S. Taxpayer Advocate's most recent annual report to Congress detailed how stretched the agency had become, citing the closing of dozens of walk-in assistance centers and longer waits to speak to customer service agents on the telephone.
In 2004, a taxpayer with a problem could speak to someone in less than three minutes, according to the report. Last year, it took nearly 20 minutes to navigate a maze of automation and hold times to reach someone.
Security is also a worry, with cyber-threats on the rise around the world. In 2015, the I.R.S. computer systems were hacked. As a result, personal data connected to more than 700,000 taxpayer accounts was stolen. With hackers showing increased skill and even a willingness to meddle in American elections, the agency is under pressure to keep its defenses on high alert to prevent further breaches.
But help does not appear to be on the way.
Republicans have been at odds with the I.R.S. over accusations that the agency unfairly targeted conservative groups. John Koskinen, who was appointed commissioner in 2013 to help stabilize the agency in the aftermath of those accusations, has instead emerged as a boogeyman to its critics. He still faces calls for his impeachment over claims that he covered up information about the I.R.S.'s handling of conservative groups.
The agency's fate was a hot topic in last year's presidential campaign. The Republican candidate Ted Cruz, senator of Texas, suggested that the I.R.S. should be abolished altogether. Mr. Cruz proposed dispatching its remaining staff members to police the country's southern border.
Mr. Trump has his own fraught history with the I.R.S., accusing it of unfairly auditing him year after year and citing a pending audit as a reason he would not publicly release his tax returns. While the president praised Mr. Koskinen in 2014 as "a very good man," Mr. Trump also fights hard, he has said, to keep his tax bill as low as possible.
Mr. Koskinen, who declined to be interviewed, has argued forcefully that those who would cut the I.R.S. budget in the name of fiscal conservatism misunderstood the agency's value. At hearings around Washington, he regularly reminds members of Congress that every dollar of investment in the I.R.S. yields $4 in revenue.
That revenue will have added importance as congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump embark on plans to cut taxes while increasing military spending and investing more in the nation's crumbling infrastructure.
Still, I.R.S. critics are unlikely to lavish money on an agency whose mission many of them loathe, even as its workload shows no signs of letting up.
"The confluence of a 14 percent reduction, on top of a string of reductions of $900 million over the last eight years, with a promise of major tax reform later this year is a recipe for disaster at the country's most significant revenue-producing agency," said Lawrence B. Gibbs, a former I.R.S. commissioner.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Will Oscar take "Moonlight" to the bank? When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named "Moonlight" best picture on Sunday, the organization made cultural history, and not just for the bonkers way the victory was announced. For the first time, Hollywood backed a gay-themed film -- one with an all-black cast -- as its finest cinematic work.
Now the pressure is on A24, the relatively new studio behind "Moonlight," to use that achievement to fill theater seats.
A24 said on Tuesday that it had booked "Moonlight" into at least 1,500 theaters in the United States for the coming weekend. That would be the film's widest release by far. While "Moonlight" has been chugging along in theaters for 20 weeks now -- a feat unto itself that speaks to A24's nurturing -- it has so far played in a maximum of 1,104 locations, a relatively small footprint. By comparison, "La La Land" played 3,236 theaters at its widest point.
The question is whether the best picture designation and the enormous media attention generated by the Oscars ceremony will convince mainstream ticket buyers who have not yet supported "Moonlight" to take a gander. Despite its long run, "Moonlight," which also won Oscars for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali's acting, has taken in only $22.1 million at domestic theaters, held back by its subject matter, lack of star power and novelistic structure.
Ticket sales so far for "Moonlight" are the second lowest on record for a best picture winner, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. "The Hurt Locker," which took in $17 million in 2009, or $19 million after adjusting for inflation, is the lowest. ("Moonlight" only cost $1.5 million to make. "The Hurt Locker" cost $15 million.)
A24 declined to comment for this article.
The so-called Oscar Bump at the box office varies widely. Some films have already concluded their theatrical runs and receive nothing. In other instances, the effect can be substantial. According to comScore, the previous three best-picture winners -- "Spotlight," "Birdman," "12 Years a Slave" -- each generated 10 percent or more of their total domestic grosses after their victories.
For winners that are seen as especially arty, the boost can be even bigger. "The Artist," a black-and-white, largely silent film that was named best picture in 2012, collected 29 percent of its total gross after that year's Oscar ceremony.
A24, which was founded in 2012 and focuses on high-quality, hard-to-market movies, has gained a reputation as one of the savvier specialty film distributors in Hollywood. In the case of "Moonlight," directed and co-written by Barry Jenkins, A24 first released the film in mid-October in only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to begin building word of mouth.
The company then began testing demand in theaters in cities like Atlanta and Washington that drew a cross-section of mainstream and specialty film ticket buyers, many of them African-American. In the film's 13th weekend -- using the Golden Globes as a peg -- A24 pushed "Moonlight" from 135 theaters to 582. But demand was soft in spots: In most areas of the country, the multiplex crowd was not yet on board.
Only after the Oscar nominations ("Moonlight" received eight) did the film manage to cross the 1,000-theater mark. (It was released on DVD on Tuesday.)
"A24 has done a fantastic job of nurturing and protecting this film," said Daniel Loria, editorial director of Box Office Media. "To pay sustained attention to single-screen runs over the course of months, that takes real commitment."

Full text: The stock market reached yet another new high on Wednesday, the latest development to make a mockery of what savvy economic commentators thought they knew about the world. Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos.
Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter's lows; financial markets are shrugging off -- or even rallying at the possibility of -- imminent Fed rate increases; and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump's presidency.
An economy that seemed locked in some form of "secular stagnation" or "new normal" is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an "old normal." The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn't looking quite as scary and may even be ending.
There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations. Long-term interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren't fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth.
But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span. Ten-year Treasury bonds now yield 2.45 percent, up from 1.85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago.
Much of the buoyant optimism on Wall Street is driven by investors' expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation under the Trump administration. But there is also some real improvement in the economic data underneath the shifts, reflecting economic forces that have been underway for years. And this resetting of expectations is evident in market data beyond the always erratic stock market.
On Wednesday, that took the form of a new survey of manufacturing supply managers that showed the factory sector is expanding at a breakneck pace. As recently as August, that same index from the Institute for Supply Management was contracting. Those numbers followed positive readings on retail sales, industrial production and the job market.
For years, a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of "secular stagnation" had gained hold -- the idea that low economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle.
There's hardly enough evidence to toss that theory aside, but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up.
For example, bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2.03 percent a year over the coming decade -- consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for. It only recently reached that level, however, after being as low as 1.2 percent in February 2016. And it's not just the United States. Similar measures of inflation expectations have risen in Germany, Britain and other advanced economies.
For a window into the changing mind-set of investors, consider some news around the Fed this week. Tuesday afternoon, William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said in an interview that it would be fair to assume that the central bank would raise interest rates sooner rather than later, given the improving economy.
"There's no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election," Mr. Dudley told CNN.
Fed watchers interpreted that to mean that an interest-rate increase could be on the way in mid-March, just three months after the last increase in December. Yet that did nothing to slow the 1.4 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 on Wednesday, and may even have contributed to it, as a sign of the Fed's confidence in the economy.
A year ago, hints that the Fed would move quickly with rates would have sent markets into a tailspin. As 2016 began, Fed leaders were expecting to raise rates four times in that year, plans that helped send the stock market plummeting and measures of economic pessimism soaring. Then they backed off and only raised rates once.
Since a stock market rally began on Election Day, there has been plenty of discussion about a Trump effect. And no doubt a big part of the improvement has resulted from expectations that the new president's policies will help corporate bottom lines (and that some of the risks of his trade agenda won't materialize).
But it's worth keeping in mind that a so-called Trump bump arrives as the economy is closing in on its full productive capacity. It is getting to the point where a cycle of rising wages and higher inflation necessitates higher interest rates. That, in turn, reflects policies from the Obama administration and the Fed that long predate Mr. Trump's election.
Conventional economic theory predicts that if a government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, the results will be some mix of higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment.
So if tax cuts, more military spending and other Trumpian policies add to deficits at a time the economy is already running at full blast, rising prices and rising rates are exactly what we would expect to see.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Will Oscar take "Moonlight" to the bank? When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named "Moonlight" best picture on Sunday, the organization made cultural history, and not just for the bonkers way the victory was announced. For the first time, Hollywood backed a gay-themed film -- one with an all-black cast -- as its finest cinematic work.
Now the pressure is on A24, the relatively new studio behind "Moonlight," to use that achievement to fill theater seats.
A24 said on Tuesday that it had booked "Moonlight" into at least 1,500 theaters in the United States for the coming weekend. That would be the film's widest release by far. While "Moonlight" has been chugging along in theaters for 20 weeks now -- a feat unto itself that speaks to A24's nurturing -- it has so far played in a maximum of 1,104 locations, a relatively small footprint. By comparison, "La La Land" played 3,236 theaters at its widest point.
The question is whether the best picture designation and the enormous media attention generated by the Oscars ceremony will convince mainstream ticket buyers who have not yet supported "Moonlight" to take a gander. Despite its long run, "Moonlight," which also won Oscars for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali's acting, has taken in only $22.1 million at domestic theaters, held back by its subject matter, lack of star power and novelistic structure.
Ticket sales so far for "Moonlight" are the second lowest on record for a best picture winner, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. "The Hurt Locker," which took in $17 million in 2009, or $19 million after adjusting for inflation, is the lowest. ("Moonlight" only cost $1.5 million to make. "The Hurt Locker" cost $15 million.)
A24 declined to comment for this article.
The so-called Oscar Bump at the box office varies widely. Some films have already concluded their theatrical runs and receive nothing. In other instances, the effect can be substantial. According to comScore, the previous three best-picture winners -- "Spotlight," "Birdman," "12 Years a Slave" -- each generated 10 percent or more of their total domestic grosses after their victories.
For winners that are seen as especially arty, the boost can be even bigger. "The Artist," a black-and-white, largely silent film that was named best picture in 2012, collected 29 percent of its total gross after that year's Oscar ceremony.
A24, which was founded in 2012 and focuses on high-quality, hard-to-market movies, has gained a reputation as one of the savvier specialty film distributors in Hollywood. In the case of "Moonlight," directed and co-written by Barry Jenkins, A24 first released the film in mid-October in only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to begin building word of mouth.
The company then began testing demand in theaters in cities like Atlanta and Washington that drew a cross-section of mainstream and specialty film ticket buyers, many of them African-American. In the film's 13th weekend -- using the Golden Globes as a peg -- A24 pushed "Moonlight" from 135 theaters to 582. But demand was soft in spots: In most areas of the country, the multiplex crowd was not yet on board.
Only after the Oscar nominations ("Moonlight" received eight) did the film manage to cross the 1,000-theater mark. (It was released on DVD on Tuesday.)
"A24 has done a fantastic job of nurturing and protecting this film," said Daniel Loria, editorial director of Box Office Media. "To pay sustained attention to single-screen runs over the course of months, that takes real commitment."

Full text: COPENHAGEN -- When Peter Enevoldsen won a lucrative order for the precision tractor parts that his company, Sjorring Maskinfabrik, makes in northern Denmark, his eyes lit up. The contract was worth more than half a million euros -- a boon for his profits. There was just one hitch: He did not have enough employees for the job.
Delivery was delayed, by one month, then two, then three, as he searched for skilled welders to speed the work at the sprawling factory. But in Denmark's fast-recovering economy, they were hard to come by.
As Europe rebounds from its economic malaise, Denmark is one of a few countries that can boast of nearing a golden era of full employment, meaning almost everyone who is able and willing to work has a job. But instead of being cheered, it is posing new challenges to the country's recovery.
More than a third of companies in this industrial and technically advanced nation can no longer recruit enough skilled workers to fill posts. Vacancies abound for I.T. specialists, computer scientists, engineers and mechanics, as well as for electricians and carpenters. The wages needed to lure them are creeping up. Affected firms are scaling back production, turning down contracts and postponing expansion plans.
"We need more skilled workers, but we can't get them," said Mr. Enevoldsen, who recently joined other companies in a nationwide advertising campaign to lure talent. "If the labor shortage continues, it could sharply impact our growth, and growth in general."
Europe's recovery is gaining traction fastest in the north, where Britain, Germany and Denmark's Nordic neighbors also pushing toward full employment. The unemployment rate has fallen in the United States as well, and some economists have expressed optimism the country may be headed in that direction.
But the experience in Denmark shows what can happen with too much of a good thing.
This country of just under six million people produces a diverse range of goods, from drugs to industrial machinery. To bolster its tech sector, the government recently named a "technology ambassador" to conduct relations with Google and other digital giants.
After a painful recession, unemployment is now at 4.3 percent, which is about as low as it can go without provoking inflation. During an economic boom a decade ago, joblessness fell as low as 2.4 percent, igniting an unsustainable spiral of higher wages and prices that the government desperately wants to avoid today.
Growth is still relatively modest -- the economy expanded an annualized 1.2 percent last year despite the hiring frenzy. But in many sectors, the demand for workers has risen so fast that economists are warning that the recovery may hit a wall.
"It's hard to see higher growth because we don't have the labor needed for that," said Steen Nielsen, the director of labor market policy at the Confederation of Danish Industry, the country's main business lobby group. "We may have to be happy with low growth rates in the future unless we can stimulate labor supply."
The government has helped ease the strain by linking the retirement age to life expectancy, allowing seniors to work longer, and encouraging more employment of European Union nationals, who do not need employment visas to work in Denmark.
Some employers have also looked to refugees to fill jobs, but few of the newcomers are readily employable in high-skilled work, and the government tightened policies recently to discourage more asylum seekers from coming in.
Germany, which faces a shortage of engineers, nurses and other skilled workers, has taken the opposite tack, setting up training programs for refugees in an attempt to bridge the gap.
In Denmark, some companies have resorted to creating jobs abroad.
Clio Online, a technology-based education company in downtown Copenhagen that digitizes learning materials for national education systems, opened a satellite office in Ukraine, hiring around 20 programmers.
"We wanted to hire in our own country but it was impossible," said Janus Benn Sorensen, one of the company's three founders. "We still have vacant positions here, and we can't find anyone to take them."
At Sjorring, Mr. Enevoldsen tried for more than a year to add skilled welders and industrial designers to the 275-person work force. The company, which has won business from Volvo and Caterpillar, has a 20-acre factory in Denmark's forested north that runs a partly automated assembly line.
He offered a salary bump of more than 2 percent, but raising wages further would crimp his margins. Though he managed to recruit some Eastern European workers, he still lacks manpower.
Last year's delayed order for the European client, worth 600,000 euros, or $637,000, was eventually completed. But he worried that the labor shortage could keep Sjorring from reaching the next level.
"We could have grown even more if we had the right people, that's indisputable," said Mr. Enevoldsen, the company's chief financial officer, who has turned to a headhunter to find eight welders and machine programmers.
Others are having similar problems. Teccon Form, which makes tools for injection molding and employs around 20 designers and mechanical engineers, had to turn away potential customers last year because it couldn't expand staffing.
"There's just not that many people out there who aren't in a job," said Michael Nederby, the company's managing director. He is now searching in Germany, Poland and Portugal for workers. "The problem will get worse in coming years."
Denmark's central bank is watching to make sure the labor shortages do not bring adverse side effects, like declining productivity if people start to job-hop more, or wage spikes that could stoke inflation. Wages in Denmark are largely set through negotiations between unions, employers associations and the government, but tech and industrial companies in particular have been raising salaries to lure workers, and expect to do so even more.
And not everyone who could be working is doing so: Around 92,000 Danes are collecting jobless benefits, and companies say many of them could be employed.
The government is testing measures to encourage early retirees, students and recipients of disability pensions to work. Businesses are also lobbying lawmakers to intensify the teaching of technology and vocational skills in schools to churn out more young Danes prepared for a high-tech world.
Even big companies feel the pinch. Microsoft's Denmark operation had trouble recruiting I.T. workers, then struggled to get marketing and sales representatives, said Marianne Dahl Steensen, the company's general manager in the country. Because of its scale, Microsoft is able to lure skilled foreign workers to Copenhagen, but keeping them is a top priority.
"We make sure to have a very modern, flexible workplace," Ms. Steensen said. The company emphasizes gender and ethnic diversity, and works with refugees and the long-term unemployed to cultivate talent.
For smaller Danish companies, solutions cannot come fast enough.
Clio Online started with three employees and now has 90 in its crowded Copenhagen office, creating content for teachers and students, including real-time course materials about President Trump or the Women's March on Washington.
The company quickly became Denmark's market leader. But ambitions to expand, thanks to orders from nearby Sweden or further afield in Saudi Arabia, whose government is digitizing libraries and educational texts, hit a ceiling.
It opened its Ukraine office three years ago, but cultural differences slowed efficiency. For instance, employees would not proceed with a work request from the Danish team until they vetted it with higher-ups in Ukraine.
The company's chief marketing officer, Thomas Overholt Hansen, estimates it lost up to [euro]1.5 million in potential revenue last year as the labor shortage limited its ability to serve new clients.
"We're losing money every day," he said.

Abstract: The carrots would include a large wage subsidy and a large per-child tax credit and a substantial corporate tax cut and an employer-side payroll tax holiday to encourage hiring. The sticks would include cuts to disability and unemployment benefits and tighter Medicaid eligibility rules for the able-bodied -- not as "pay fors," but simply to make sustained worklessness less pleasant. [...]the risks of inflation and the drag of deficits on growth would be accepted as necessary costs of the experiment, on the theory that a generation of worklessness and below-replacement fertility will do more damage, economic and otherwise, than adding another couple of trillion dollars to the national debt.

Full text: IN the years before Donald Trump, various conservatives tried to come up with new ideas for a movement that seemed exhausted and unready for new challenges. Whether we called ourselves "reform conservatives" or something else, we shared -- or so we thought -- a realistic assessment of what was possible within Republican politics, within the broader two-party system, within a stagnant but basically stable Western order. Maybe that self-conscious realism was a trap. The Trump campaign (and the Bernie Sanders campaign across the aisle) suggests that there is a public appetite for ideas that are well outside the ideological boxes of post-Cold War conservatism and liberalism. The evidence now emerging -- read Nicholas Eberstadt's big, depressing essay in the latest Commentary for a synthesis -- suggests that the slow-burning social crisis in American life is much worse than even those of us who wrote a lot about it thought. And the chaos in the Middle East and widening fissures in European politics suggest the times might require a more substantial rethinking of American foreign policy than most Washingtonians have contemplated.
This week, I read the debut issue of American Affairs, a new right-of-center policy journal for the age of Trump. Its proclaimed purpose is to advance "the discussion of new policies that are outside of the conventional dogmas," with the strong implication being that recent efforts to propose such new policies have been too timid and constrained, and that the times demand something more adventurous and ideologically unbound.
I accept the critique. But if I may venture one in return, I found the journal's inaugural issue not quite as daring as I had hoped.
There are interesting proposals on trade policy, and various persuasive critiques of elite institutions and assumptions. But often the newest attempt at a new right offers a rhetoric of nationalism that cashes out in policies not obviously bolder than what reform conservatism offered.
So as an experiment, I thought I'd write a few columns (an intermittent series, as events permit) floating genuinely radical visions of how policy makers might respond to our order's slippage toward something worse than stagnation. These will not be ideas that I find entirely convincing, they will not be fully fleshed-out, and I will disavow responsibility if they're ever put into disastrous practice. But since I strongly suspect that the Trump era will feature far less policy making than Trump's radical campaign promised, this seems like a good time to take the policy conversation up, up into the bright blue sky.
Let's start this week with what one might call an emergency response to the social crisis. That crisis is apparent in the data that Eberstadt and many others have collected, showing wage stagnation in an era of unprecedented wealth, a culture of male worklessness in which older men take disability and young men live with their parents and play video games, an epidemic of opioid abuse, a historically low birthrate, a withdrawal from marriage and civic engagement and religious practice, a decline in life expectancy and a rise in suicide, and so on through a depressing litany.
From liberal technocrats talking up education to Trumpian nationalists promising better trade deals, everyone has an incrementalist approach to these problems.
But incremental ideas work slowly while the crisis compounds itself and spreads. So an emergency response would set a more ambitious goal: a swift boost in work force participation and family formation, using a few sticks and a lot of very expensive carrots.
The carrots would include a large wage subsidy and a large per-child tax credit and a substantial corporate tax cut and an employer-side payroll tax holiday to encourage hiring. They would also include an infrastructure bill written to include a certain amount of make-work spending, and an increase in government hiring in traditionally-male fields -- more military spending earmarked for recruitment, more federal cash for hiring cops.
The sticks would include cuts to disability and unemployment benefits and tighter Medicaid eligibility rules for the able-bodied -- not as "pay fors," but simply to make sustained worklessness less pleasant.
The goal would be to see whether over some period -- call it a "five-year plan," because why not? -- trying very directly to pull and push people back to work could make a sustained difference in employment and family formation both.
And as for how all this would be paid for, the answer is that it wouldn't be. Instead, the risks of inflation and the drag of deficits on growth would be accepted as necessary costs of the experiment, on the theory that a generation of worklessness and below-replacement fertility will do more damage, economic and otherwise, than adding another couple of trillion dollars to the national debt.
The scale of spending means this proposal gores more conservative oxen than liberal ones. But that's only because I'm saving a related proposal to ban pornography and video games for a later installment in this series -- which I promise will only grow more outlandish as it grows.

Abstract: If the economy grows just 2.5 percent this year, gross domestic product will reach the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the nation's economic potential by the end of the year. If there is a lot of slack, then the Trump administration's ambitious growth targets look more plausible, and the Fed should move slowly on raising interest rates so as not to choke off the expansion just as it's getting going. The Federal Reserve watches the industrial sector by measuring what is called factory capacity utilization.

"Vacancy has fallen, but there are still some large blocks of space out there," said John Ferguson, president of the Southeast division of the commercial real estate firm CBRE. The unemployment rate is the most common measure of slack in the labor market, and it suggests that full employment has very nearly arrived: Perhaps the best argument for policy makers to be cautious about putting the brakes on economic growth with rapid Fed interest rate increases is how much we don't know about why growth has been so disappointing over the past several years.

Full text: The most important issue for the United States economy in 2017 and beyond is whether it's near its speed limit. It has taken eight years of glacial expansion, but the nation is closing in on what economists believe to be its full productive capacity. It's nearing that level of activity in which nearly everybody who wants a job has one, and factories and offices are cranking at full speed.
If the economy grows just 2.5 percent this year, gross domestic product will reach the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of the nation's economic potential by the end of the year. If the Trump administration succeeds at achieving the 4 percent growth the president has said he seeks, we'll be there by the Fourth of July.
If there is in fact more room to grow beyond the budget office's estimate of "potential G.D.P.," an economic boom remains possible. If there isn't, higher growth will translate into inflation, not higher output and incomes. The question for the Trump administration, the Federal Reserve and every American who wants a higher paycheck is how much slack there really is in the economy.
Economic slack takes the form of empty warehouses and office parks; of machines that run eight hours a day when they were built to run for 12; and, most important, millions of Americans who might be coaxed to work in a booming economy but who aren't even looking for a job now.
If there is a lot of slack, then the Trump administration's ambitious growth targets look more plausible, and the Fed should move slowly on raising interest rates so as not to choke off the expansion just as it's getting going. If there's not very much -- if this is about the best the nation can expect to do -- then either the Fed will raise rates more quickly to choke off growth or inflation will burst higher, or both.
Slack on Factory Floors
Astronomers can't observe a black hole directly; they can determine where one is only by measuring how it affects nearby matter. Potential output is similar. For all the apparent precision of reports from government agencies, potential G.D.P. isn't something that can be directly measured. It's a judgment based on other evidence.
How big is the population of prime working-age people, and how many of them would be expected to seek work? How low in the past has unemployment gone before inflation became a problem? What is the recent record of productivity growth?
In assessing how close we are (or aren't) to full capacity, it helps to look at America's industrial parks and office complexes. The Federal Reserve watches the industrial sector by measuring what is called factory capacity utilization. American companies were operating factories at 75.7 percent of their potential in January. That's roughly the rate they've been at for the last five years.
Experience suggests it could go higher. In the spring of 2007, the rate was 79.5 percent. It was above 80 percent for the better part of the 1990s.
In other words, the manufacturing sector would seem to have room to produce more stuff even without expanding factory floors or adding equipment. At Caterpillar, the giant maker of heavy equipment based in Peoria, Ill., Jim Umpleby, the chief executive, told analysts last month that, even as it closely managed costs, "we're also preserving capacity for a potential increase in business whenever that comes."
Economic slack is trickier to measure in the service sector; good luck judging whether, say, an insurance company is operating below or at its full potential. But one window into it is the office vacancy rate.
Nationwide, 15.8 percent of office space was vacant in the final months of 2016, according to the real estate information firm Reis. That was down from a recent high of 17.6 percent in 2011 -- but could still have room to fall. In the last expansion, it fell as low as 12.5 percent, implying that millions of square feet of offices are sitting idle, ready for white-collar workers to fill them.
"Vacancy has fallen, but there are still some large blocks of space out there," said John Ferguson, president of the Southeast division of the commercial real estate firm CBRE. "A tenant can typically find a short-term solution if they need to, even if it's not perfect for the long term."
One thing to keep an eye on: Development of new office space has been relatively depressed since the 2008 recession, which raises the possibility that the remaining vacant space could be filled up quickly with little new supply arriving to fulfill the demand. Mr. Ferguson sees it in Atlanta, where he is based, and in other Southern cities like Nashville and Charlotte, N.C.
"In the last cycle 10 years ago, there were six new office towers added in Buckhead," Mr. Ferguson said, referring to an affluent Atlanta neighborhood. "In this cycle, there's one."
How Many Are Really 'Missing'?
The biggest factor that will determine how much room the United States economy has to grow is the supply of workers.
The unemployment rate is the most common measure of slack in the labor market, and it suggests that full employment has very nearly arrived: The 4.8 percent unemployment rate is roughly what Fed officials believe is the long-term rate that won't provoke inflation, and not far from the 4.4 percent low in the last expansion.
But there are important wrinkles. Millions of Americans left the labor force entirely in the aftermath of the last recession. And there are "missing" workers, people who do not count as unemployed because they are not looking for a job but might be available to work -- and contribute to G.D.P. -- if things were rosier.
To people who work on employment issues, there is both good news and bad. "A third to a half of the people on the sidelines, it wouldn't take much to employ tomorrow," said Stefani Pashman, chief executive of Partner4Work, a work force development group in the Pittsburgh area. "The other half are much tougher to employ," often facing challenges from drug use, criminal records and transience.
That would seem to support the idea that there are meaningful numbers of would-be workers out there -- but not an unlimited number. The Economic Policy Institute calculates that there are 1.85 million missing workers.
Breaking a Cycle, With Risk
In all these areas, the evidence points to an economy not being quite on the verge of overheating, but also not offering huge potential for growth.
Perhaps the best argument for policy makers to be cautious about putting the brakes on economic growth with rapid Fed interest rate increases is how much we don't know about why growth has been so disappointing over the past several years.
Here's a weighty fact: In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office published long-term projections of potential G.D.P. that assumed the United States would grow around 2.7 percent a year for the ensuing decade. It didn't. Growth in both the labor force and worker productivity underperformed those projections. So the reality we're living in underperforms that theoretical potential by $2.2 trillion, or 14 percent.
One possibility of what went wrong is that the damage of the deep 2008 recession had lasting effects, both pulling some Americans out of the work force and causing businesses to underinvest in innovations. Weak demand for goods and services damaged the capacity of the economy, producing a vicious cycle.
If officials at the Fed and in the Trump administration try to run the economy a little hot -- to keep pursuing faster growth even as the economy gets close to or above potential G.D.P. -- it would be a chance to do the reverse, to create a virtuous cycle.
Trying it carries risks of its own -- of inflation, and perhaps new financial bubbles. The alternative is to take the low-growth world we've been living in as an immutable fact of life, and get used to it.

Abstract: A few weeks ago, Tom Cotton and David Perdue, Republican senators from Arkansas and Georgia, introduced an immigration bill that would cut the number of legal immigrants to this country each year in half, from about a million to about 500,000. If we can reduce the number of low-skill immigrants coming into the country, that will reduce the pool of labor, put upward pressure on wages and bring more Americans back into the labor force. Let's illustrate the point by looking at one portion of the labor market. Nationwide, there are now about 200,000 unfilled construction jobs, according to the National Association of Home Builders. An exhaustive U.S. study by the National Academy of Sciences found that immigration didn't drive down most wages, but it had a "very small" and temporary effect on native-born workers without a high school degree.

Full text: A few weeks ago, Tom Cotton and David Perdue, Republican senators from Arkansas and Georgia, introduced an immigration bill that would cut the number of legal immigrants to this country each year in half, from about a million to about 500,000. In a press conference, Cotton offered a rationale for his bill. "There's no denying this generation-long surge in low-skilled immigration has hurt blue-collar wages," he said. If we can reduce the number of low-skill immigrants coming into the country, that will reduce the pool of labor, put upward pressure on wages and bring more Americans back into the labor force.
It seems like a plausible argument. That is, until you actually get out in the real world.
Cotton and Perdue's position, which is now the mainstream Republican position, is based on the unconscious supposition that American society is like a lake, with a relatively fixed boundary. If you cut the supply of fish coming from outside, there will be more food for the ones born here.
The problem is that American society is actually more like a river. Sometimes the river is running high, with a lot of volume and flow, with lots of good stuff for everybody, and sometimes it's running low.
Let's illustrate the point by looking at one portion of the labor market. Right now construction is booming in many cities. This has created high demand for workers and pervasive labor shortages.
Nationwide, there are now about 200,000 unfilled construction jobs, according to the National Association of Home Builders. If America were as simple as a lake, builders would just raise wages, incomes would rise and the problem would be over.
But that hasn't happened. Builders have gone recruiting in high schools and elsewhere, looking for people willing to learn building skills, but they're not having much luck.
Construction is hard, many families demean physical labor and construction is highly cyclical. Hundreds of thousands of people lost construction jobs during the financial crisis and don't want to come back. They want steadier work even at a lower salary.
Employers have apparently decided raising wages won't work. Adjusting for inflation, wages are roughly where they were, at about $27 an hour on average in a place like Colorado. Instead, employers have had to cut back on output. One builder told Reuters that he could take on 10 percent more projects per year if he could find the crews.
In other words, the labor shortage hasn't led to higher wages; it's reduced and distorted the flow of the economic river. There's less home buying, less furniture buying, less economic activity. People devote a larger share of their income to housing and less to everything else. When builders do have workers, they focus on high-end luxury homes, leaving affordable housing high and dry.
The essential point is that immigrants don't take native jobs on any sort of one-to-one basis. They drive economic activity all the way down the river, creating new jobs in some areas and then pushing native workers into more complicated jobs in others. A comprehensive study of non-European Union immigrants into Denmark between 1991 and 2008 found that immigrants did not push down wages, but rather freed natives to do more pleasant work.
An exhaustive U.S. study by the National Academy of Sciences found that immigration didn't drive down most wages, but it had a "very small" and temporary effect on native-born workers without a high school degree.
The way to help working families is not to cut immigration. It's to help everybody flow to the job he or she wants to take.
The last time we cut immigration, in the 1920s, we were in the middle of a baby boom. Today, fertility rates have plummeted. If the Cotton-Perdue bill became law, the working-age population would shrink, the nation would age and America would decline.
For the life of me, I can't figure out why so many Republicans prefer a dying white America to a place like, say, Houston.
Houston has very light zoning regulations, and as a result it has affordable housing and a culture that welcomes immigrants. This has made it incredibly diverse, with 145 languages spoken in the city's homes, and incredibly dynamic -- the fastest-growing big city in America recently. (Personally, I wish it would do a bit more zoning -- it's pretty ugly.)
The large immigrant population has paradoxically given the city a very strong, very patriotic and cohesive culture, built around being welcoming to newcomers and embracing the future. As the Houston urban analyst Tory Gattis points out, the Houston Rodeo has so many volunteers it has recently limited their special privileges. In 2015 it had the healthiest philanthropic sector in the nation. The city is coming together to solve its pension problems better than just about any other big place.
Cotton and Perdue are the second coming of those static mind-set/slow-growth/zero-sum liberals one used to meet in the 1970s. They'll dry up the river. I wish they had a little more faith in freedom, dynamism and human ingenuity.

Abstract: The American economy appears to be avoiding the kind of winter swoon that has become an annual event in recent years, a turn for the better that could encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising its benchmark interest rate sooner. Fed officials at the meeting discussed whether improving conditions warranted faster movement, but "participants generally characterized their economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the December meeting," the minutes said. Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and one of the voters this year, said in a speech Tuesday that his outlook had not changed. "Given the state of the economy -- more or less back to normal -- I continue to see three modest rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track," Mr. Harker said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The American economy appears to be avoiding the kind of winter swoon that has become an annual event in recent years, a turn for the better that could encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising its benchmark interest rate sooner. At the Fed's most recent meeting, on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, "many participants" wanted to increase the benchmark rate "fairly soon" if the economy continued to grow, according to minutes published Wednesday.
But the minutes stopped short of suggesting a rate increase was likely at the Fed's next meeting, in mid-March. They said that a core group of Fed officials remained cautious about the economic outlook, seeing balanced risks of faster and slower economic growth.
"The committee has been quite patient, and I believe that has served us well," Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, said in separate remarks on Wednesday. But now, the risks seem more in balance, he said, and "I see it as appropriate to gradually tighten policy as long as the economy continues to behave roughly as expected."
The minutes of the Fed meeting, published after a standard three-week delay, portrayed an economy that appears to be gaining strength, although it is still far from booming. The unemployment rate was little changed in the last year, standing at 4.8 percent in January, even as the economy added an average of 190,000 jobs a month in the second half of 2016, indicating that more people were returning to work.
The minutes also cited "a high level of optimism" among business executives, which was attributed to "the expectation that firms would benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policy." For the most part, however, companies were still waiting for Washington. Although a few companies had reported increased capital spending, the minutes said that most, "while optimistic, intended to wait for more clarity about federal policy initiatives before adjusting their capital spending and hiring."
Financial markets also remained calm. Things were so quiet that some Fed officials had turned to fretting about the lack of excitement. By some measures, financial conditions are easier now than before the Fed raised its benchmark rate in December.
Some officials worried, the minutes said, that "the low level of implied volatility in equity markets appeared inconsistent with the considerable uncertainty attending the outlook."
The Fed left rates unchanged in February after raising its benchmark rate in December to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent and predicting three rate hikes in 2017. Fed officials at the meeting discussed whether improving conditions warranted faster movement, but "participants generally characterized their economic forecasts and their judgments about monetary policy as little changed since the December meeting," the minutes said.
In recent weeks, investors have assessed the Fed as more likely to raise rates in the first half of the year, although the chances that it will do so at its next meeting, in March, remain low.
"It's not obvious that 'fairly soon' means March," said Samuel D. Coffin, an economist at UBS. He said that the Fed was "growing gradually more confident in its economic expectations" but that there was little sign of urgency in the account of the meeting.
The minutes portrayed some of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks as increasingly ready to move faster on rates. But the minutes also indicated that the voting members -- five governors and five of the presidents -- felt less urgency. That core group appeared to remain committed to "gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy."
Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and one of the voters this year, said in a speech Tuesday that his outlook had not changed.
"Given the state of the economy -- more or less back to normal -- I continue to see three modest rate hikes of 25 basis points each as appropriate for 2017, assuming things stay on track," Mr. Harker said. He added, however, that a March increase remained possible.
One major question is whether the labor force will continue to grow. Some officials see room for stronger economic growth to continue pulling people into the work force: The share of American adults between 25 and 54 who are working or seeking work remains low by historical standards. But other Fed officials contend that the Fed's stimulus campaign has reached its limit. They worry that maintaining low interest rates could drive unemployment down to an unsustainable level and lead to more inflation.
The minutes said the Trump administration's economic plans had injected "considerable uncertainty" into the business of forecasting economic growth. But Fed officials have emphasized that they will wait to see what happens before adjusting their plans.
The Fed also announced a few housekeeping changes, primarily of interest to its close watchers. Fed officials are now prohibited from speaking about monetary policy for 10 days before a policy-making meeting, rather than one week. The Fed also said it would expand the information provided with its quarterly economic forecasts to include an illustration of the uncertainty surrounding the projections.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street slipped on Wednesday after their recent record-setting run. Energy companies stumbled, but makers of basic materials rose as investors expressed hope that two large deals would win regulatory approval. While energy stocks fell with the price of oil, most other sectors did not make big moves. Technology companies made a small gain. They have risen every day this month to reach their highest level since 2000. DuPont and Dow Chemical also rose after Reuters reported that European officials might soon approve their merger.
The Dow Jones industrial average registered its ninth straight gain, rising 32.60 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,775.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 2.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,362.82. The Nasdaq composite index shed 5.32 points, or 0.1 percent,
to 5,860.63. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slid 6.49 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,403.86. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange.
DuPont climbed $2.66, or 3.5 percent, to $79.80, and Dow Chemical gained $2.45, or 4 percent, to $63.67. Reuters reported that regulators in the European Union were close to approving the companies' $62 billion combination. The deal remains subject to the approval of antitrust officials in the United States and elsewhere.
Investors appeared to grow more optimistic about a second deal in the chemical industry that is also awaiting regulatory approval: the combination of Monsanto and Bayer. Monsanto, which has accepted a $57 billion offer from Bayer, rose 84 cents to $111.38.
The minutes from a recent meeting the Federal Reserve Board showed that officials had discussed the importance of raising the primary interest rate soon, especially if the economy stays strong. Some Fed officials expressed concern that if interest rates remained too low, the expanding economy could cause inflation to rise too quickly.
Although investors do not generally expect the Fed to raise interest rates at its next meeting in March, bond prices changed course, rising. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.42 percent from 2.43 percent late Tuesday.
Energy companies traded lower as benchmark United States crude lost 74 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $53.59 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, fell 54 cents to $56.12 a barrel, in London.
The oil and gas company Concho Resources slid $9.65, or 6.8 percent, to $131.70 after a weak fourth-quarter report, and Newfield Exploration declined $3.42, or 8 percent, to $39.07 as analysts expressed concerns about its forecasts for the current year.
Technology companies wavered but finished with a small gain thanks to Facebook, which jumped $2.40, or 1.8 percent, to $136.12. The S.&P. 500's technology index, which has gained ground every trading day in February and is up 10 percent this year, reached its highest level since July 2000, four months after the dot-com boom peaked.
The dollar slipped to 113.06 yen from 113.61 yen. The euro rose to $1.0564 from $1.0543.
Gold slipped $5.50 to $1,232 an ounce. Silver lost 5 cents to $18.02 an ounce. Copper fell 1 cent to $2.73 a pound.
Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.4 percent, and Germany's DAX added 0.3 percent. In France, the CAC 40 picked up 0.2 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 finished essentially unchanged, while South Korea's Kospi added 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong jumped 1 percent.

Abstract: With his reputation tarnished by his support for the Iraq war, former Prime Minister Tony Blair is a diminished figure these days in Britain, the country he led for a decade. Though the unelected House of Lords has yet to vote on the matter, Britain now seems set on a path to a "hard Brexit" -- a clean, if turbulent, break -- with Mrs. May arguing that Britain should leave the European single market, a free-trade zone in goods and some services, as well as the customs union, which eliminates tariffs and customs checks. Almost two decades after Mr. Blair swept to power in a landslide electoral victory, his delivery on Friday was fluent and familiar, calling on pro-Europeans to try to change the terms of the debate by creating an understanding of the costs, "as the facts of Brexit become clear." Mrs. May has leaned toward a clean break, reflecting her desire to prioritize the right to control immigration from Continental Europe and to remove Britain from the orbit of the European Court of Justice, two points that make membership in the single market impossible.

Full text: LONDON -- With his reputation tarnished by his support for the Iraq war, former Prime Minister Tony Blair is a diminished figure these days in Britain, the country he led for a decade. So when Mr. Blair forcefully urged opponents of a British withdrawal from the European Union on Friday to "rise up" and persuade others to rethink their decision to leave the bloc, he left allies and adversaries alike wondering if his intervention would help, or hinder, the European cause.
In a speech in London, Mr. Blair castigated the government of Prime Minister Theresa May, which he said was "obsessed" with a withdrawal from the 28-nation bloc, a process known as Brexit. He said ideologues were driving the process, and he warned of the "possibility of the breakup" of Britain amid strong support in Scotland for independence. A majority of Scottish voters supported remaining in the European Union.
Before the referendum, a majority of lawmakers from both major parties had opposed a departure, as had Mrs. May and Mr. Blair.
But after British voters decided in a June referendum to leave the bloc, leading Prime Minister David Cameron to step down, going against the outcome of the referendum seemed politically toxic. Mrs. May committed to honoring the result and to making the departure happen.
Deciding how to extricate Britain from a process of integration that began in 1973 has been anything but easy, however. With the support of the opposition Labour Party, which Mr. Blair once led, the House of Commons voted this month to give Mrs. May the power to start negotiations to leave the bloc.
Though the unelected House of Lords has yet to vote on the matter, Britain now seems set on a path to a "hard Brexit" -- a clean, if turbulent, break -- with Mrs. May arguing that Britain should leave the European single market, a free-trade zone in goods and some services, as well as the customs union, which eliminates tariffs and customs checks.
Mr. Blair's many critics on the left and right were swift to respond to his plea on Friday. They accused him of ignoring the outcome of a democratic referendum, in which 52 percent of those who voted opted to leave and 48 percent to remain.
The former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused Mr. Blair of "arrogance," while Kate Hoey, a Labour lawmaker who had argued for withdrawal, described Mr. Blair's speech as "patronizing."
The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, one of the leading proponents of a British exit, mocked Mr. Blair. "Rise up and turn off the TV the next time Tony Blair is on," he said.
Almost two decades after Mr. Blair swept to power in a landslide electoral victory, his delivery on Friday was fluent and familiar, calling on pro-Europeans to try to change the terms of the debate by creating an understanding of the costs, "as the facts of Brexit become clear."
The government's objective is to pursue "Brexit at any cost," he said. "Our challenge is to expose relentlessly what that cost is," he continued, and to find "a way out from the present rush over the cliff's edge."
Mr. Blair argued that Britons had voted to leave the bloc without knowing what would replace membership, and, taking questions after his speech, he likened the decision to agreeing to swap homes without seeing the other house.
"Now they are going to see it," he said, adding that he suspected people might "scratch their heads and start changing their minds."
Opponents will, he suggested, discover that there will be "misery," yet no effect on the type of immigration about which they were most concerned -- from outside the European Union, which he said the government already controls but has failed to curb.
Mr. Blair said he intended to set up an institute to make the case against a "Brexit at any cost," but he denied planning to establish a centrist political party, as some have speculated.
Nevertheless, while fiercely critical of the government, Mr. Blair was equally hard on the Labour Party, which, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, is badly trailing Mrs. May's Conservatives in opinion polls. "The debilitation of the Labour Party is the facilitator of Brexit," he asserted.
Many voters who normally support Labour ignored their advice on the referendum and supported a British departure from the bloc, provoking a deep crisis of confidence in the party. So far, there is little sign that these voters, or the population in general, have changed their minds in significant numbers.
Like Mrs. May, almost all of the Conservative Party has embraced a British exit from the European Union since the referendum.
Mrs. May has leaned toward a clean break, reflecting her desire to prioritize the right to control immigration from Continental Europe and to remove Britain from the orbit of the European Court of Justice, two points that make membership in the single market impossible. Her hope that Britain can strike trade deals with non-European countries suggests that she is also likely to remove Britain from the customs union.
Mr. Blair is disliked by many activists in the Labour Party because of the Iraq war and because of his financial dealings since leaving power. But his allies estimate that he has more support among the general population, and they point out that he won three elections, the last of which was in 2005, after the United States-led invasion of Iraq.
His speech was welcomed by the Liberal Democrats, a centrist and pro-European party that has called for the specific terms of Brexit negotiations to be put to voters in another referendum.
Yet even some pro-Europeans say it was too soon for Mr. Blair to make this type of argument. So far, Britain's economy has not suffered the downturn the "Remain" campaign had predicted. While there are signs that inflation is rising, because of the fall in the value of the pound, there are few indications that voters have begun to feel the effects.
Britain has not even started negotiations, let alone left the bloc, and Mrs. May's critics say that as the reality of a British exit nears, the economy will suffer -- particularly if negotiations with the European Union go badly, as appears likely.
Mr. Blair's argument was, in effect, a call to prepare for that possibility, though he conceded that his own intervention was likely to prompt "a volley of abuse."
Asked if he was the best person to advance the pro-European argument, he said that voters could "like the messenger or not like the messenger."
"I have the right to speak," he said, "and you have the right to listen -- or not."

Trump's Push to Meddle With the Fed Is Part of a Global Trend

Full text: President Trump has asked his financial regulators to subject their financial regulations to "more rigorous regulatory impact analysis" and to "restore public accountability within federal financial regulatory agencies" in one of his executive orders. That sounds pretty unobjectionable. But for the Federal Reserve, the most important American financial regulator, the traditional response would have been: Leave us alone.
The Fed, the nation's central bank, has long prized its independence. It has thought that it should decide for itself the best way to regulate American financial institutions, unfettered by unsophisticated, and potentially venal, political oversight.
But political leaders around the world are not at all shy about interfering with what the central banks do.
Mr. Trump's executive order reflects a global mood. Politicians in Britain and elsewhere in Europe have also started to publicly lament the conduct of their central banks.
During her testimony to Congress this week, Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, was criticized for both the Fed's monetary policy and its regulation of banks.
Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky, suggested that the slow growth in the wake of the Fed's quantitative easing program underscored "the failure of unconventional policies to deliver the expected results." Other legislators chimed in with similar criticism.
Legislators also blamed the Fed for the sort of overregulation that the president's executive order is designed to address. The House Financial Services Committee chairman, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, criticized "a failed regulatory state" for impeding growth, with the implication being that the Fed was part of the problem.
Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, argued that the Fed was incorrectly concluding that the "prospect for growth is not at all changed by the prospect of tax reform and regulatory reform."
If anything, the political caviling is even more pointed abroad.
The German finance minister said last year that the European Central Bank's current low interest rates were causing "extraordinary problems." That complaint was characterized by his boss, Chancellor Angela Merkel, as "legitimate." During the financial crisis, the French president told the central bank to raise rates, and he was hardly the only European politician to do so.
The European practice of political criticism of central bank policies has spread to Britain, where the prime minister has criticized the Bank of England's low interest rates.
"A change has got to come" on those rates, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.
This sort of political input does not line up with the laws on the books in either Britain or on the Continent. The British government gave the central bank operational independence in 1997. European treaties isolate the European Central Bank from political oversight.
The Fed has some statutory independence, and the power to cover its budget without seeking appropriations from Congress certainly helps. Most important of all, however, the Fed has benefited from a culture of political noninterference.
But if the recent experiences of Europe are any guide, cultural independence can be fleeting. Central banks find it very difficult to operate as pure technocracies, operated by experts for the benefit of an uninterested citizenry. Citizens do, it turns out, care about their central banks, and these days, politicians across the globe have been willing to attack them for political ends.
Most academics would defend central bank independence from political oversight. Central banks that manage the currency without political interference generally bring inflation under control. That in turn makes it easier for investors to plan.
In a recent survey of economists, 94.7 percent said they thought that independent central banks perform better than banks controlled by government ministries.
There is, accordingly, good reason to worry about efforts to get the central bank to operate on the same page as the president. There are three vacancies on the Fed's seven-seat board, and the bank's general counsel has just resigned. Politicians will, through the confirmation process, be able to significantly affect what the central bank does next.
A place for politics in central banking is not wholly inappropriate. The financial crisis has taught us that central banks like the Fed can be political actors, willing to lobby the politicians in the executive and legislative branches, and to work closely with them on policy objectives.
But it will also be instructive to see how far politicians try to push the Fed. Inveighing against insulated technocrats has some appeal -- that might be one reason to insulate them.
But if the president and Congress realize that they have the potential to directly affect interest rates, they may find that central bank independence is not such a bad thing after all.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest health insurers, is accused in a scheme that allowed its subsidiaries and other insurers to improperly overcharge Medicare by "hundreds of millions -- and likely billions -- of dollars," according to a lawsuit made public on Thursday at the Justice Department's request.
The accusations center on Medicare Advantage, a program through which people 65 or older agree to join private health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.s, whose costs the government reimburses.
The program was created in 2003 after UnitedHealth and other insurers said that managed care could help contain the overall cost of Medicare, which has strained the federal budget by rising faster than the rate of inflation.
Instead of slowing Medicare costs, UnitedHealth may have improperly added excess costs in the billions of dollars over more than a decade, according to the lawsuit, which was unsealed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles.
A spokesman for UnitedHealth disputed that assertion, saying it was based on faulty interpretations of Medicare rules.
"We reject these more than five-year-old claims and will contest them vigorously," said the spokesman, Matthew A. Burns. He said the company served millions of Medicare Advantage members and was "proud of the access to quality health care we provided, and confident we complied with the program rules."
Insurers and the federal government have been at odds for years over how private plans bill Medicare. A number of UnitedHealth companies sued the Health and Human Services Department last year, challenging proposed rules for how companies should handle overpayments by Medicare.
At the same time, whistle-blowers have filed lawsuits against insurers, claiming they overcharged the programs, and government audits have uncovered a widespread problem with private plans overcharging Medicare over a number of years.
The Justice Department's court notice that it was joining the case involving UnitedHeath was filed by Chad Readler, a lawyer who joined the agency's civil division as part of the Trump administration. It is intervening in the whistle-blower's claims about erroneous coding and inflated billing but is not taking part in other claims. The government has 90 days to file its own complaint.
The newly public accusations were first made in 2011, when a former UnitedHealth executive, Benjamin Poehling, filed a complaint under the False Claims Act, a federal law that allows private citizens to take legal action when they believe a government program has been defrauded.
Such cases are typically filed under seal to give federal or state investigators time to follow up and decide whether to join the litigation. In successful False Claims Act cases, where the government ultimately recovers money, the original whistle-blower receives a portion.
Mr. Poehling's complaint, which was among the documents unsealed on Thursday, named 15 companies as defendants. Of those, the Justice Department told the court it wanted to intervene in the cases involving two, UnitedHealth and WellMed Medical Management, which UnitedHealth acquired in 2011.
The Justice Department asked the court to grant access to all documents produced while Mr. Poehling's case against the other defendants proceeds, and it reserved the right to join those cases later.
Mr. Poehling was finance director for UnitedHealthcare Medicare and Retirement, a subsidiary that works with the Medicare Advantage program. His complaint describes "a corporate culture that demands and rewards financial success from its employees," including initiatives to increase a billing practice known as "risk adjustment."
The federal government has allowed people to receive Medicare benefits through private H.M.O.s for decades as an alternative to conventional fee-for-service Medicare.
Medicare initially paid the H.M.O.s a fixed rate per member, no matter what chronic conditions members had. That made the H.M.O.s avoid signing up unhealthy people, because they required more care, reducing the companies' profits.
The approach changed in 2003, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services added a "risk adjustment factor" to its reimbursement schedules for managed care. That made H.M.O.s more willing to sign up unhealthy people, but it also gave them a new incentive: to make people appear sicker than they were. UnitedHealth had a unit that helped its subsidiaries and other insurance companies perform risk adjustment calculations.
Mr. Poehling said that he and other employees were given "risk adjustment" targets and their performance was evaluated based on how well they achieved them. In a 2008 performance review, for example, he was judged on whether he had increased risk scores by 3 percent.
"There were no similar performance goals for the overall accuracy of risk adjustment submissions," he wrote in his complaint. "Nor was there any accountability assigned for reducing the number of false claims" submitted to the Medicare program for reimbursement.
Attached to his complaint was an email message from his division's chief financial officer, Jerry Knutson, urging staff members "to really go after the potential risk scoring that you have consistently indicated is out there."
"Let's turn on the gas!" Mr. Knutson wrote. "What can we do to make sure we are being reimbursed fairly for the members and risk we take on more than what we are currently doing.
"When we meet next on our steering committee, I'd like to see what it would take to add another $1OOM to our 2008 revenue from where we are. What would be doable? What resources would you need? What technology would you need?"
Medicare Advantage's rules require that for patient care to qualify for risk adjustment factors, a patient's condition must be verified in person on a regular basis by a qualified professional.
But Mr. Poehling said that coding specialists would instead mine patient records, looking for hints of a possible long-term condition. When they found one, they would request the higher payment without going through the required in-person evaluation.
The realization that medical records could be mined for extra money appears to have given rise to a cottage industry of consulting firms offering to screen patient histories and look for indications of long-term health problems that could be used to increase Medicare reimbursements.
Federal audits of the Medicare Advantage program have suggested that H.M.O.s have driven Medicare costs higher, but a federal effort to issue tighter rules in 2014 was unsuccessful. The proposed rules were withdrawn, and UnitedHealth subsequently sued.
Correction: February 23, 2017, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the Justice Department's joining a whistle-blower lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group misstated the given name of the chief financial officer for a division of UnitedHealth. He is Jerry Knutson, not Jeffrey.

Full text: You could be forgiven for not noticing it, but the United States economy is gaining momentum. It may not be as dramatic as the torrent of political news out of Washington; an improving economy, after all, announces itself through a series of data releases that are just a little bit better than people were expecting. But that's exactly what has happened. In consumer spending, the job market and manufacturing, the economy seems to be enjoying consistent, broad-based growth to start the year.
There could always be a setback, of course, but the momentum is almost uniformly positive as the Trump era gets underway.
Some of the factors at work may turn out to be temporary. Energy prices were near recent lows a year ago, and their recovery since has meant oil exploration and related fields are recovering. Similarly, the effects of a steep run-up in the value of the dollar from 2014 to early 2015 have now worked their way through the economy and aren't holding back manufacturing the way they once were.
An unusually warm winter is probably a factor in some of the good numbers, as people who in a normal year would have hunkered down amid snowstorms instead went shopping. But the positive tenor of the latest data has been building for months, and includes some data sets that shouldn't be too affected by the weather.
Think of the numbers released Wednesday as the latest strong signals, not in isolation. Retail sales rose 0.4 percent in January, the Commerce Department said, and a booming 0.8 percent when volatile auto sales are excluded. American consumers are powering ahead in the eighth year of the expansion.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent, the Labor Department said; even excluding volatile food and energy, it was up 0.3 percent. The index is now up 2.3 percent over the last year excluding food and energy, suggesting that inflation is now in the ballpark of the 2 percent mark that the Federal Reserve aims for (the Fed focuses on a different inflation number that still shows readings below 2 percent).
And while overall industrial production fell 0.3 percent in January, according to new Fed data, that was only because the warm winter depressed energy demand and thus output by utilities. Manufacturing output rose 0.5 percent. To cap off a day of good data pointing to an economic surge, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its survey of business activity soared to its highest level in two years.
This all continues a recent theme. The economy added 227,000 jobs in January despite an unemployment rate that is already low. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits each week keeps hitting lows not seen since the 1970s.
The improving data -- and particularly the uptick in inflation -- does create a puzzle for the Federal Reserve. In testimony this week, the Fed's chairwoman, Janet Yellen, made clear that an interest rate increase was on the way, though she left ambiguity on whether it would happen at the Fed's March meeting or later in the spring or summer.
If the Fed indeed raises interest rates this spring in an effort to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from taking off, it will be the third rise since December 2015 -- but would signal that a faster pace of rate increases was on tap.
On one hand, the Fed's policies work with a lag, so it must act with an eye toward where the economy is going, not where it has been. On the other, after years of trying to slog out of a deep recession, Ms. Yellen and her colleagues don't want to act prematurely and stop the expansion in its tracks.
"Waiting too long" to raise rates, Ms. Yellen told Congress this week, would be unwise because it might require the Fed "to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession."
The stock market has reached new highs in recent days based on a mix of positive economic data and optimism that the Trump administration will bring business tax cuts and profit-friendly deregulation. Granted, a trade war or other disruptions could be damaging, and markets could turn quickly if some of the anticipated goodies don't materialize from Washington.
But the steady flow of improving economic data is a reminder that things are looking pretty good for 2017 if President Trump and Ms. Yellen can avoid messing it up.

Bank Shares Gain as Indexes Again Rise to Records

Full text: Bank stocks jumped Tuesday on hopes for bigger profits, and Wall Street indexes again pushed to record highs. Stocks had been mostly lower when trading began, but indexes reversed course after Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told a Senate committee that the central bank could raise interest rates next month. Bond yields jumped immediately and caused bank shares to rise. Banks can benefit from higher rates by charging more for loans.
The Standard & Poor's 500 share index rose 9.33 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,337.58 for its sixth straight day of gains. Earlier on Tuesday, it was down as much as 0.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.25 points, or 0.5 percent, to 20,504.41. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.62, or 0.3 percent, to 5,782.57.
Ms. Yellen's testimony on Capitol Hill was much anticipated, but she said little to alter most investors' expectations. The Fed raised interest rates in December for the second time in a decade, and Ms. Yellen said the strengthening job market and a modest gain in inflation should warrant continued, gradual increases in interest rates.
Waiting too long to raise rates "would be unwise" and could eventually force the Fed to raise rates rapidly to catch up, Ms. Yellen said. But she also repeated the word "gradual" to describe expectations for increases.
Stocks have had a strong run, driven by expectations that Washington will be more helpful to businesses, an improving economy and unexpectedly strong corporate earnings. The S.&P. 500 is up 9.3 percent since Election Day.
A demonstration of how much optimism is feeding into markets: Small-business owners say they have not felt so encouraged in 12 years, according to a monthly survey released by the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday. Optimism rose sharply after the election, and more small businesses say they plan to hire.
Ms. Yellen's testimony helped the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rise to 2.47 percent from 2.44 percent late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury rose to 1.24 percent from 1.21 percent, and the 30-year Treasury yield climbed to 3.06 percent from 3.03 percent.
While higher bond yields can help banks, they can also mean less demand for stocks that pay big dividends. Utility stocks in the S.&P. 500, which are some of the market's highest yielders, fell 0.7 percent. It was the largest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Real estate investment trusts, which have relatively big dividend yields, were also weak.
General Motors jumped $1.72, or 4.8 percent, to $37.24 for one of the biggest gains in the S.&P. 500 after news that France's PSA Group, maker of Peugeot and Citroen cars, was exploring a deal to buy Opel, GM's money-losing European business.
Stocks were relatively steady worldwide. In Europe, the German DAX index was virtually flat, while the French CAC 40 rose 0.2 percent and the British FTSE 100 edged down 0.1 percent. In Asia, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong was nearly flat, while the South Korean Kospi index dipped 0.2 percent and the Japanese Nikkei 225 index fell 1.1 percent.
Benchmark United States crude oil rose 27 cents to settle at $53.20 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 38 cents to $55.97 a gallon in London.
Gold fell 40 cents to settle at $1,225.40 an ounce.
The dollar rose to 114.22 Japanese yen from 113.62 late Monday. The euro declined to $1.0572 from $1.0600, and the British pound fell to $1.2465 from $1.2529.

Abstract: Wall Street indexes again hit new highs on Monday, joining global stock markets in an upward march. Stronger-than-expected profit reports from companies, continued improvement in the United States economy and expectations for business-friendly policies from Washington have helped propel the market.

Full text: Wall Street indexes again hit new highs on Monday, joining global stock markets in an upward march. Strong gains for Citigroup and other financial stocks helped the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rise 12.15 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,328.25. It was the third straight day the index had set a record. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 142.79, or 0.7 percent, to 20,412.16. The Nasdaq composite climbed 29.83, or 0.5 percent, to 5,763.96.
Earlier in the day, markets rose across Europe and Asia.
Stocks have resumed their rally in recent days after stalling for a couple of weeks. Stronger-than-expected profit reports from companies, continued improvement in the United States economy and expectations for business-friendly policies from Washington have helped propel the market.
The S.&P. 500 has climbed for five straight days and is up 8.8 percent since the election of Donald J. Trump in November.
Companies whose profits are most dependent on the strength of the economy were some of Monday's biggest gainers. Financial stocks in the S.&P. 500 rose 1.1 percent, the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the index. Industrials rose 1 percent.
The biggest stock in the S.&P. 500, Apple, was also at a record closing high: $133.29, after it rose $1.17, or 0.9 percent. Apple's performance carries extra weight for many 401(k) accounts because of its status as the biggest publicly traded company in the world.
The chemical company Chemours jumped $4.01, or 14.3 percent, to $32.14 after it announced an agreement with DuPont to jointly pay $670.7 million to settle roughly 3,500 personal-injury claims related to the release of perfluorooctanoic acid from a West Virginia plant. DuPont rose 99 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $77.82.
The only category in the S.&P. 500 to fall on Monday was the telecommunications sector, which sank on worries that more pricing wars could be on the way.
Verizon unveiled an unlimited-data plan for its customers, and its stock dropped 43 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $48.55. Its competitors fell more: AT&T lost 75 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $40.65, and Sprint fell 12 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $8.84.
Several things could shift the market's momentum. Janet Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will offer testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and Wednesday to update the Senate and the House of Representatives on monetary policy. The government will also give updates on the state of inflation, on both the consumer and the wholesale levels.
Treasury yields have been on an upward trend since Election Day, in part because of expectations for higher inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.44 percent on Monday, from 2.41 percent late Friday. Two-year and 30-year Treasury yields also notched higher.
Stocks climbed in other markets around the world. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.4 percent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 0.6 percent and South Korea's Kospi index added 0.2 percent. In Europe, the French CAC 40 index jumped 1.2 percent, Germany's DAX climbed 0.9 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.3 percent.
Benchmark United States crude oil fell 93 cents, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $52.93 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell $1.11, or 2 percent, to $55.59 a barrel.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. ECONOMY
Keystone oil pipeline and trade are likely topics.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada will head down on Monday for his first meeting with President Trump. While the two men are polar opposites politically and in style, the economic importance of the United States to Canada has meant that Mr. Trudeau has studiously refrained from directly criticizing the new president or his policies. Their meeting follows a parade of Canadian cabinet minsters last week to Washington. Mr. Trump's protectionist stance on trade is a particular worry to Canada, which counts on exports to the United States for about a quarter of its gross domestic product. While Chrystia Freeland, Mr. Trudeau's foreign minister, warned the Trump administration not to impose a border tax during her visit to Washington, Canada has said it would welcome reopening the North American Free Trade Agreement to make some changes. The two leaders may also discuss Mr. Trump's decision to conditionally approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline project form Alberta's oil sands, a project blocked by the Obama administration. Ian Austen
OIL INDUSTRY
A look at OPEC's first output figures since cuts.
On Monday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is expected to publish members' oil output numbers for January, the first month of cuts in oil production that producers agreed to late last year. The cuts were aimed at propping up petroleum prices. Analysts expect the report to show that OPEC members are making most of the agreed trims. On Friday, the International Energy Agency, the monitoring group based in Paris, said compliance was about 90 percent. The agreement by OPEC, Russia and other large exporters to restrain output has helped lift prices of Brent crude to about $57 a barrel from around $45 a barrel in late November. Stanley Reed
ECONOMY
Fed chief will go before House and Senate committees.
Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, will testify before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday for the first time during the Trump administration. Some congressional Republicans, emboldened by the new president, are likely to see an opportunity to sharpen their long-running attacks on the Fed's performance as a financial regulator. Both Democrats and Republicans will also probably seek Ms. Yellen's blessing for their views on fiscal policy. But the formal reason for her visit is to deliver to Congress a biannual report on the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. Ms. Yellen will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. Binyamin Appelbaum
BANKING
Credit Suisse's fourth-quarter earnings are coming.
Earnings will again be in focus as Europe's largest banks continue to report their annual results. Credit Suisse will be the latest lender to update investors on its performance, announcing its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday. The Swiss bank had previously said it would take a pretax charge of $2 billion in the fourth quarter after it agreed in December to pay $5.3 billion to settle an investigation by the United States authorities into the packaging and sale of mortgages ahead of the global financial crisis. Chad Bray
MEDIA
Time Warner shareholders will vote on the AT&T merger.
Time Warner shareholders will meet Wednesday to vote on the company's proposed $85.4 billion merger with AT&T. A "yes" vote is expected. The tie-up brings together two industry titans and, if approved by federal regulators, is expected to reshape the media and telecommunications industries. President Trump said in October that his administration would block the deal, stating that it would result in "too much concentration of power." Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said on a conference call last week that he was confident the deal would be approved this year. Emily Steel
ECONOMY
Energy prices are expected to raise Consumer Price Index.
On Wednesday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release the Consumer Price Index for January. The index rose by 0.3 percent in December, pushing the year-over-year increase in up to 2.1 percent from 1.7 percent. The core rate -- which excludes food and energy prices because they are believed to be more volatile -- increased by 0.2 percent, bumping the 12-month increase up a notch to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent. A continuing rise in energy prices should further raise the index, analysts say, by another 0.3 percent in January. They expect the core rate to rise by 0.2 percent, as consumer goods import prices have declined. Patricia Cohen
European lawmakers are expected to approve a trade deal with Canada.
Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, is scheduled to address the European Parliament on Thursday, a day after lawmakers meeting in Strasbourg, France, are expected to ratify a landmark trade deal with Canada. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement took years of tortuous negotiations and would cut many tariffs on industrial goods and on farm and food items, as well as open up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, maritime services and finance to European firms. The deal was nearly derailed last year by Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, which used its veto to temporarily withhold Belgium's approval of the deal. Yet the Walloon protest also reflected how globalization has fallen out of favor with many citizens in the West, and there could be further hurdles ahead for the deal as it still must be ratified by national and some regional parliaments across the European Union to go fully into force.

Full text: EDITORS' NOTE APPENDEDThe hotly competitive returns of college endowment performance are out, and the results have again shaken the higher education elite down to their Ivy League roots: The smallest endowments -- those with total assets under $25 million -- outperformed their billion-dollar-plus rivals for the second year.
The National Association of College and University Business Officers, known as Nacubo, and the Commonfund Institute last week released the latest results, which are, for most schools, far more important than whether they advance to the N.C.A.A. Final Four.
The 2016 fiscal year, which ended June 30, wasn't an especially good year for anybody. But the smallest endowments outperformed the billion-plus group, losing 1 percent, on average, compared with a 1.9 percent decline for the biggest endowments.
Results were even worse for endowments of $500 million to $1 billion, which lost on average 2.2 percent.
Falling behind by nearly a full percentage point has a huge impact on giant endowments like Harvard's, which stood at $35.7 billion at the end of the fiscal year. Harvard said its investments declined by 2 percent, and its endowment total dropped by $2 billion because of the investment losses and spending. Harvard is now shaking up its endowment management.
Yale did much better than many of its peers, gaining 3.4 percent. But that still lagged the 4 percent return over the same period for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and wasn't enough to offset spending. Yale's total endowment dropped by $200 million, to $25.4 billion.
Compare the results with those of Houghton College, a liberal arts institution affiliated with the Wesleyan Church in the Genesee Valley in western New York. Houghton has just over a thousand students and an endowment of $46.4 million.
Houghton emerged in the top quartile of all endowments, according to Nacubo, with a return of 11.85 percent for the year ended Sept. 30. (Houghton uses a different fiscal year.) For the calendar year, the results were also impressive, at 7.45 percent. Houghton has been able to lower its spending rate -- the amount it withdraws each year to fund operations -- to an enviable 4.5 percent, and may be able to lower it further, to 4 percent.
How did tiny Houghton do it?
The answer is pretty simple: Houghton got out of hedge funds and all alternative investments a year and a half ago, and moved the entire portfolio to a mix of low-cost index funds and mutual funds at the fund giant Vanguard.
Houghton's endowment is now invested in a simple mix of 76 percent in stocks, evenly divided between United States and foreign, and 24 percent in fixed income, according to Vincent Morris, who joined Houghton last year as its vice president for finance after a stint in risk management at the insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher. Roughly half the endowment is in low-cost index funds, and the rest is in actively managed mutual funds.
Houghton's investment committee met this week, and is likely to move even further from active management, Mr. Morris said. "I went to the University of Chicago, where I sat in a lot of investment classes," he told me. He learned how difficult it was for active managers to outperform market averages, "especially year after year," he said, adding, "I'm a big believer in passive investment."
As for hedge funds and other high-cost alternatives, "the whole two-and-20 model" -- in which investors typically pay 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of any gains -- "is ridiculous," Mr. Morris said. "The cost structure is outrageous. As they say on Wall Street, 'Where are the customers' yachts?' I'm not going to play that game."
Houghton's experience with hedge funds predates Mr. Morris's arrival on campus, but their performance was "mediocre at best," he said, adding, "The investment committee and I are on the same page about moving to less active management and lower costs."
As Houghton's experience suggests, the past year's disparity in results between the large and small endowments can almost entirely be explained by the differing allocations to alternative investments, especially hedge funds.
According to the association's survey, endowments larger than $1 billion had 58 percent of their assets in alternative strategies on average, with 20 percent in hedge funds and 12 percent in private equity.
The smallest endowments -- those of less than $25 million -- had just 10 percent in alternatives, with 6 percent in hedge funds and a mere 1 percent in private equity.
Stung by overexposure to the troubled pharmaceutical company Valeant International, and taken by surprise by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, hedge funds, on average, lagged far behind both the S.&P. 500 and fixed-income returns in fiscal 2016.
As a result, the performance of a simple low-cost mix of stocks and bonds, much like the portfolio Houghton assembled, has streaked past the more complex portfolios laden with hedge funds and other alternative investments.
Vanguard said a simple mix of index funds with 70 percent in equities and 30 percent in fixed-income assets delivered an annualized return of 7.1 percent over the past five years, and 6.1 percent over the past 10. For a mix of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, the returns were 6.7 percent for five years and 6.1 percent for 10.
By comparison, the annualized returns for the billion-plus endowments were 6.1 percent for five years and 5.7 percent for 10.
Hedge funds, however, have successfully marketed themselves as offering higher risk-adjusted rates of return, in part because they supposedly minimize losses in down years. But according to Vanguard's calculations, its simple, low-cost model portfolios have provided higher returns even after adjusting for risk in eight of the past 11 years.
Most investors "would have been much better off in a low-cost, broadly diversified portfolio than in these other complex vehicles," Christopher Philips, head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services, said.
Harvard reported its hedge fund portfolio lost 1.2 percent for the 2016 fiscal year. The university said it had 14 percent of its assets in "absolute return" strategies -- meant to ensure that the return is always positive, rather than pegged to a benchmark -- a category that includes hedge funds.
Nonetheless, in a report written by the previous chief executive of Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university's endowment, Harvard said that "we continue to believe that partnering with best-in-class managers will lead to attractive risk-adjusted returns."
Why Harvard would harbor such a belief after years of hedge fund underperformance remains a mystery to some.
"Supposedly the big endowments have access to better managers," Mr. Morris said. "I may be more cynical, but I'm not sure I buy that. How do you know who the better managers are? I'm not convinced that any manager can outperform" over the long-term horizons of most endowments.
Mr. Philips of Vanguard agreed. "The ultimate challenge is picking the hedge fund managers," he said. "There are so many, you end up seeing the same distribution of returns that you see in mutual funds except there are twice as many hedge funds."
No major college endowment has publicly turned its back on hedge funds, as the California Public Employees' Retirement System did in the world of pension funds in 2014. But endowment managers are closely watching to see if Harvard changes its approach now that it has brought in a new chief executive, N. P. Narvekar, who had a successful run managing Columbia University's $9 billion endowment.
Mr. Narvekar has already shaken up the endowment's management, saying Harvard will lay off roughly half its 230 employees by the end of the next fiscal year, including all of its internal hedge fund managers. He promised to outsource more of the endowment's investment decisions.
Even so, no one expects Harvard -- or any other major endowment -- to ditch hedge funds anytime soon. Hope springs eternal, and the allure of potentially higher returns is paradoxically more potent the lower the actual returns are.
"If I put myself in the shoes of an endowment manager, I can sympathize," Mr. Philips said. "You have to keep ahead of inflation and contribute to the operating budget at a time when return expectations are muted. So you feel compelled to reach for hedge funds or private equity in the hope you'll outperform."
While Vanguard hasn't seen any stampede out of hedge funds and other alternatives among college endowments, "those hopes are starting to come up against reality," Mr. Philips said.
Editors' Note: April 4, 2017, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Common Sense column on Feb. 10 discussed the investing success of endowments at small colleges compared with those at larger institutions. The column cited Houghton College, in western New York, which reported an investment return of 11.85 percent for the year ended Sept. 30. Because that period was different from the one reported by other colleges, however, the column did not give a clear picture of Houghton's relative performance. In a more comparable period -- from August 2015 (when Houghton changed investment managers) to June 2016 (the end of year reported by most other colleges) -- its return for 10 ¬Ω months was 2.98 percent. The column also misstated, using information from the college, the return for the calendar year. It was 7.45 percent, not 7.54 percent.

Full text: Seth A. Klarman isn't known as "The Oracle of Boston" for nothing. His Baupost Group manages about $30 billion, he has lost money in only three of the past 34 years, and he is one of the few hedge fund managers Warren Buffett -- the "Oracle of Omaha" -- has praised.
So it is unsurprising that Mr. Klarman's private letter about investing in the age of Trump has become sought-after reading material.
In it, he argues that investors have focused on pro-growth policies, while ignoring protectionism and trade barriers.
He also worries that President Trump's stimulus efforts could stoke inflation and that swelling national debt could undermine the economy's growth.
Travel Ban
A United States appeals court has scheduled an hourlong oral argument for Tuesday over Mr. Trump's targeted travel ban.
The Justice Department had urged it to reinstate the ban, saying that immediate action was needed to ensure the nation's safety.
The suit, filed by an attorney general on behalf of Washington State, shows how Democratic attorneys general have emerged as a check on the Trump administration.
They would probably rely heavily on the Constitution's civil rights protections in the way that Republicans leaned on constitutional limits on federal economic power, said Chris Jankowski, a Republican strategist and lawyer.
Quotation of the Day
"If you go around making a lot of statements about your exalted role in society, at some point your employees might just make you follow through."
-- Ken Shotts, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Technology employees are pushing their companies to take a more proactive stance over issues like the travel ban.
Gorsuch Nomination
If Judge Neil M. Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court were approved, he could take up a call, made by Justice Antonin Scalia, to scrutinize prosecutions based on administrative regulations as a means to cut back on the power of the federal bureaucracy.
What does that mean?
Well, violations of administrative regulations, which have been used as the basis for criminal charges, could be substantially changed.
This would make it more difficult to use the threat of prosecutions to coerce settlements from corporations.
Insider trading, which is based almost entirely on judicial and administrative interpretations, could be examined, too, if Judge Gorsuch chooses to take a view on the power of agencies to create and interpret the law.
Coming Up
The Commerce Department publishes its estimate of the trade balance. Economists expect the net deficit to have narrowed

Full text: The confrontation over President Trump's ban on refugees and visitors from several predominantly Muslim countries reached the courts at the weekend, foreshadowing the years of legal battles that could lie ahead for the administration. The ban was blocked at a Federal District Court in Seattle and an appeals court in California refused to reinstate it. The government was instead ordered to file a brief defending Mr. Trump's order.
That is not the only immigration issue that is in the headlines.
Debate over the use of H-1B visas has also been simmering as employers prepare for Mr. Trump to sign an executive order to overhaul the program.
H-1B visas are intended to bring in foreign professionals with college degrees and specialized skills to fill jobs when qualified Americans cannot be found. There could be as many as a million H-1B visa holders residing in the United States, accounting for up to 13 percent of jobs in the technology sector alone.
A draft on an executive order leaked last week showed that options for modifying the program would be considered to "ensure that the beneficiaries of the program are the best and the brightest."
Critics say that American companies are gaming the system to snap up visas so that they can replace American workers with cheaper, temporary staff members. But proponents of the H-1B say it is an important way to attract top talent to the country.
The status of the immigrants protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is also a source of concern.
Many of these people are worried that they will lose the protections that allowed hundreds of thousands of people taken to the United States as children to obtain jobs, pursue college degrees and live openly in the country where they were raised.
They already face difficulties in completing their education. One of these people, Mitzie Perez, is trying to challenge policies that make it difficult for undocumented students to finance higher education with a lawsuit seeking class-action status.
The subject of immigration even featured at the Super Bowl:
Airbnb's advertisement said, "We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept."
Coca-Cola revived an ad from the 2014 Super Bowl, which featured people singing a multilingual version of "America the Beautiful."
At the same time, the unwinding of government regulations put in place during the Obama administration continues apace.
Ajit Pai, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, stopped nine companies from providing high-speed interest service at a discount to low-income individuals. He also withdrew an effort to keep prison phone rates down and scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market, as part of a flurry of actions last week, many of which were not publicly announced.
Consumer advocacy groups and telecoms analysts were stunned. The message was: the F.C.C., an independent agency, will mirror the Trump administration's rollback of government regulations.
Modest Gains for Diversity
The proportion of women and minorities on the board seats of Fortune 500 companies has increased (a little), but most of the positions are still held by white men, according to the Alliance for Board Diversity and Deloitte.
Why aren't more women and minorities on these boards?
Companies still turn to people with chief executive experience and these tend to be men. There is also little turnover in board seats, so change is unlikely to come quickly.
One possible bright spot: many board members are in their 70s and likely to step down in the coming years, opening up seats to more diverse members.
Coming Up
The International Monetary Fund will hold a board meeting to discuss whether it will participate in Greece's current bailout program. It must reach an agreement with Greece's European creditors over debt calculations and austerity conditions by Feb. 20, when European finance ministers meet in Brussels to review the program.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will speak to members of the European Parliament. He is expected to face questions about what the Trump presidency means for the eurozone and whether rising inflation rates will prompt the central bank to begin withdrawing its economic stimulus measures.

Somalia's 'Milestone' Election, Fueled by Bribes and Coercion

Full text: MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Politicians have been peeling off wads of hundred dollar bills to buy votes. Others have shown up for parliamentary races standing next to a political nobody who was bribed or coerced into running against them, to make the race look fair. In one case, the mysterious candidate was the politician's maid. This week, Somalia, which has languished without a functioning central government for more than 25 years and has been propped up by billions of dollars of American aid, is holding an innovative, closely watched presidential election that United Nations officials have billed as a "milestone."
But several analysts, investigators and some Western diplomats say the election has turned out to be a milestone of corruption, one of the most fraudulent political events in Somalia's history -- and that's saying something, given that the country is already ranked by Transparency International, a global anticorruption organization, as the most corrupt on earth.
Somali investigators estimate that at least $20 million has feverishly changed hands during parliamentary elections that will culminate in the selection of the president on Wednesday.
Outside forces like Turkey, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are widely believed to have been buying off presidential candidates to land juicy business deals, spread a harsh version of Islam or spy on American forces.
The entire process has been so bad, several analysts said, that the Shabab militant group, one of the deadliest Islamist organizations in the world, isn't even trying to derail the vote because the corruption free-for-all almost makes the militants look upstanding by comparison.
"This election has been awesome for the Shabab," said Mohamed Mubarak, who runs a Somali anti-corruption organization, Marqaati, which means "witness." "The government loses even more legitimacy and the Shabab has a chance to buy a seat!"
For decades, the world has poured more blood and treasure into Somalia than practically anywhere else outside of Iraq or Afghanistan. Somalia's political dysfunction has caused epic suffering and death, and its problems tend not to respect its borders.
The United States recently beefed up its military presence here, seeing Somalia as a grave security threat. Warlords starve their own people, driving hundreds of thousands of Somalis into neighboring countries and overseas. The Shabab has slaughtered hundreds of innocents, including Westerners, across East Africa. And who can forget Somalia's 21st-century pirates, who hijacked global trade with a bunch of scruffy skiffs?
But American, European and African military officers say that firepower alone won't solve these problems. The only answer, they say, is for Somalia's government to get its act together and provide an alternative to chaos.
Even before this election was marred by staggering corruption, patience was wearing thin. Now, with President Trump pushing an "America First" message, many aid workers and diplomats who have spent years trying to help fix Somalia worry that it could be in Mr. Trump's cross hairs.
He has already made Somalia one of the seven countries under his travel ban, and some fear that he could slash aid. Many Somali experts believe that would only destabilize the country further, fueling the chaos that has made Somalia a global terrorism threat. And aid workers say this would be an especially difficult time to cut funds for Somalia because the country could be headed into another famine.
'A Fake State'
Somalia has lurched from crisis to crisis since 1991, when the central government disintegrated, clan-based warlords tore the country apart and a famine broke out.
Since then, various combinations of warlords, technocrats and Islamists have been recognized as the official government despite not ruling much territory, delivering any services or keeping the country safe.
The Shabab continues to be an unstoppable menace. In late January, in the span of three days, Shabab fighters detonated two large bombs in Mogadishu and killed dozens of Kenyan peacekeepers several hundred miles away.
"The Somali government has no authority, no popular support, no monopoly on violence," said Abdirahman Abdishakur Warsame, a former minister of planning now running for president. "It's a fake state."
A few years ago, Somalia's major backers -- the United States, Britain, the European Union, Sweden and Italy -- considered a plan to hold one-person, one-vote elections. Several Western diplomats said they felt pressure from home governments to show that after so much money had been invested, Somalia was making progress.
But the Shabab threat made it difficult to hold popular elections in many parts of the country, so the Western backers supported a more-limited voting process based on Somalia's traditional clans.
While nearly all Somalis share the same language, culture and ethnicity, Somali society is split into a dizzying number of lineage-based clans, sub-clans, sub-sub-clans and sub-sub-sub-clans. Those clan divisions have become officially recognized political units, almost like congressional districts.
Corrupt clan-based elections are nothing new here. According to several researchers, when President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was selected in 2012, many of the clan elders were given a $5,000 bribe to choose the clan's representative in Parliament.
But this time, instead of clan elders' picking all the representatives, Western diplomats pushed for a wider, more inclusive process in which the 275 members of the lower house of Parliament would be selected by clan caucuses of 51 delegates per caucus.
Western diplomats said they thought that having 51 votes instead of one for each seat would make bribery harder.
They now say they were wrong.
Hand-to-Hand
The new election system spawned "corruption inflation," said Abdirazak Fartaag, a former Somali government official. He said that every stage was crooked and that some Parliament seats had gone for more than $1 million each.
"The international community was determined to have an election at all costs, and that's what this has become," he said. "It's really pathetic."
In the last four months, the clans have finished their caucuses. Both the lower house and a new senate, whose representatives were selected somewhat differently, have been sworn in.
But more than 10 Somali elders said in interviews that they had paid or received bribes. They said they could be killed for revealing how the process really worked.
One elder in Kismayo, a forlorn port town in southern Somalia, said that the night before his clan was to select a Parliament member, one of the candidates stopped by the hotel where the delegates were staying and started handing out stacks of hundred dollar bills. The candidate told the delegates they would each get $3,000 for their votes and the money was widely believed to have come from a presidential candidate who had made a secret deal with the parliamentary candidate that if he won his race then he would vote for the presidential aspirant at the final stage of the election process.
The cash, the elder said, was passed hand-to-hand.
"Everybody knows this is wrong," the elder said. "But you can't refuse. If you do, the clan won't trust you, and then maybe you have problem."
When asked what kind of problem, he said, "Personal security problem."
Another elder said that in a tight race for a Parliament seat in Mogadishu, the 51-member delegation was split, 25 to 25, with one swing vote undecided. The elder admitted to offering $10,000 to the holdout.
He explained how important it is to have political protection in a place like Mogadishu. He said that if you have a real estate dispute or one of your relatives is arbitrarily arrested -- both happen all the time in this city -- it helps immensely to be able to call on a friendly member of Parliament to intervene.
Several elders seemed amused by the advent of what they call "bride" candidates -- because they follow the other candidates around so that they appear to have an opponent. In one race in southern Somalia, elders said, the clan representatives were so fed up with the leading candidate, who had been trying to buy his way into office, that the neophyte follower actually won the race.
'The President's a Hyena'
More than 20 presidential hopefuls are running. Analysts contend that President Mohamud has a good chance of keeping his office because he has received millions of dollars from Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to buy enough votes from the Parliament members who will vote for a new president. Turkey, the analysts said, has invested millions in Mogadishu's port and airport. Mr. Mohamud declined to comment.
It might seem strange that Somalia, one of the poorest, most neglected countries in the world, would be such a hotbed of geopolitics.
But according to diplomats, the Emirates and Qatar are backing different candidates here in a rivalry over the Muslim Brotherhood, while Egypt and Ethiopia are supporting different candidates because of their duel over the Nile. And Sudan is supporting certain political figures to keep its access to Somali intelligence services, which also work with the C.I.A. That way, analysts said, Sudan could spy on what the Americans in Somalia were doing.
Michael Keating, the head of the United Nations' mission to Somalia, argues that maybe Somalia's election, which was mostly funded by Western donors, shouldn't be judged by the same standards as an election in a stable nation.
He said that although corruption was "clearly a big problem," this election process was more legitimate than previous ones, producing more female representatives and some clan reconciliation.
Still, he added: "We're not going around saying it was fantastic. It wasn't."
In the bowels of the city, people agree. The slogans on the election billboards -- "Justice," "Peace," "Development," "We Are All Brothers" -- make them laugh.
"The president's a hyena," said Mohamed Said Mohamed, a fish seller by the crumbled seashore. "These guys are taking bribes of $100,000 when most of us can't afford a plate of spaghetti."
Food is a big worry right now. Somalia is headed into a drought, which could lead to a famine this spring.
Western diplomats said they had designed a kind of airport security check that all the Parliament members would have to go through on their way to vote. The important focus now was to make sure that no one could bring mobile phones into the voting booth.
The suspicion is that if the lawmakers can sneak a photograph of their vote, they can sell it for even more money.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED. He is the most successful and influential investor you have probably never heard of. His writings are so coveted and followed by Wall Street that a used copy of a book he wrote several decades ago about investing starts at $795 on Amazon, and a new copy sells for as much as $3,500.
Perhaps that's why a private letter he wrote to his investors a little over two weeks ago about investing during the age of President Trump -- and offering his thoughts on the current state of the hedge fund industry -- has quietly become the most sought-after reading material on Wall Street.
He is Seth A. Klarman, the 59-year-old value investor who runs Baupost Group, which manages some $30 billion.
While Mr. Klarman has long kept a low public profile, he is considered a giant within investment circles. He is often compared to Warren Buffett, and The Economist magazine once described him as "The Oracle of Boston," where Baupost is based. For good measure, he is one of the very few hedge managers Mr. Buffett has publicly praised.
In his letter, Mr. Klarman sets forth a countervailing view to the euphoria that has buoyed the stock market since Mr. Trump took office, describing "perilously high valuations."
"Exuberant investors have focused on the potential benefits of stimulative tax cuts, while mostly ignoring the risks from America-first protectionism and the erection of new trade barriers," he wrote.
"President Trump may be able to temporarily hold off the sweep of automation and globalization by cajoling companies to keep jobs at home, but bolstering inefficient and uncompetitive enterprises is likely to only temporarily stave off market forces," he continued. "While they might be popular, the reason the U.S. long ago abandoned protectionist trade policies is because they not only don't work, they actually leave society worse off."
In particular, Mr. Klarman appears to believe that investors have become hypnotized by all the talk of pro-growth policies, without considering the full ramifications. He worries, for example, that Mr. Trump's stimulus efforts "could prove quite inflationary, which would likely shock investors."
And he appears deeply concerned about a swelling national debt that he suggests could undermine the economy's growth over the long term.
"The Trump tax cuts could drive government deficits considerably higher," Mr. Klarman wrote. "The large 2001 Bush tax cuts, for example, fueled income inequality while triggering huge federal budget deficits. Rising interest rates alone would balloon the federal deficit, because interest payments on the massive outstanding government debt would skyrocket from today's artificially low levels."
Much of Mr. Klarman's anxiety seems to emanate from Mr. Trump's leadership style. He described it this way: "The erratic tendencies and overconfidence in his own wisdom and judgment that Donald Trump has demonstrated to date are inconsistent with strong leadership and sound decision-making."
He also linked this point -- which is a fair one -- to what "Trump style" means for Mr. Klarman's constituency and others.
"The big picture for investors is this: Trump is high volatility, and investors generally abhor volatility and shun uncertainty," he wrote. "Not only is Trump shockingly unpredictable, he's apparently deliberately so; he says it's part of his plan."
While Mr. Klarman clearly is hoping for the best, he warned, "If things go wrong, we could find ourselves at the beginning of a lengthy decline in dollar hegemony, a rapid rise in interest rates and inflation, and global angst."
Mr. Klarman is a registered independent and has given money to politicians from both parties. He has donated to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, John McCain and Rudolph W. Giuliani as well as Hillary Clinton, Cory Booker and Mark Warner.
While he has remained largely outside the public eye, Mr. Klarman surprised some of his friends and peers over the summer when he issued a statement after Mr. Trump criticized a judge over his Mexican heritage, saying he planned to support Mrs. Clinton: "His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald Trump could become our president."
In his recent letter, he explained for the first time his decision to say something publicly. "Despite my preference to stay out of the media," he wrote, "I've taken the view that each of us can be bystanders, or we can be upstanders. I choose upstander."
From the letter, it is hard to divine exactly how Mr. Klarman is investing his fund's money. His office declined to comment on the letter, which I obtained from a source. His fund currently has more than 30 percent of its funds in cash. He has lost money in only three of the past 34 years.
What investors say publicly and what they do in the markets can be different things. Mr. Buffett campaigned publicly against Mr. Trump, but he has nevertheless invested in the market since his election -- about $12 billion, according to a recent disclosure. George Soros, who also actively campaigned against Mr. Trump, bet -- wrongly so far -- that the stock market would fall; he lost about $1 billion.
Most hedge funds have found themselves on the losing side of trades over the past several years, a point Mr. Klarman addressed in his letter. Noting that hedge fund returns have underperformed the indexes -- he mentioned that hedge funds had returned only 23 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared with 108 percent for the Standard & Poor's index -- he blamed the influx of money into the industry.
"With any asset class, when substantial new money flows in, the returns go down," Mr. Klarman wrote. "No surprise, then, that as money poured into hedge funds, overall returns have soured."
He continued, "To many, hedge funds have come to seem like a failed product."
The lousy performance among hedge funds and the potential for them to go out of business or consolidate, he suggests, may become an opportunity.
Perhaps the most distinctive point he makes -- at least that finance geeks will appreciate -- is what he says is the irony that investors now "have gotten excited about market-hugging index funds and exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) that mimic various market or sector indices."
He says he sees big trouble ahead in this area -- or at least the potential for investors in individual stocks to profit.
"One of the perverse effects of increased indexing and E.T.F. activity is that it will tend to 'lock in' today's relative valuations between securities," Mr. Klarman wrote.
"When money flows into an index fund or index-related E.T.F., the manager generally buys into the securities in an index in proportion to their current market capitalization (often to the capitalization of only their public float, which interestingly adds a layer of distortion, disfavoring companies with large insider, strategic, or state ownership)," he wrote. "Thus today's high-multiple companies are likely to also be tomorrow's, regardless of merit, with less capital in the hands of active managers to potentially correct any mispricings."
To Mr. Klarman, "stocks outside the indices may be cast adrift, no longer attached to the valuation grid but increasingly off of it."
"This should give long-term value investors a distinct advantage," he wrote. "The inherent irony of the efficient market theory is that the more people believe in it and correspondingly shun active management, the more inefficient the market is likely to become."
How Mr. Klarman wants investors to behave in the age of Trump remains an open question. But here's a hint: At the top of his letter, he included three quotations. One was attributed to Thomas Jefferson: "In matters of style, swim with the current; in matters of principle, stand like a rock."
Correction: February 11, 2017, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The DealBook column on Tuesday, about the investor Seth A. Klarman, referred incorrectly in some copies to a statement he issued criticizing Donald J. Trump last year. It was related to Mr. Trump's criticism of a judge's Mexican heritage, not a recording in which Mr. Trump talked about groping women.

Full text: Coca-Cola and Airbnb were seen as making political statements on Sunday with ads that touched on immigration and diversity. People were searching Google for ads from Budweiser and 84 Lumber and those starring Justin Timberlake and Justin Bieber.
Fox and the N.F.L. have been trying to avoid overtly political ads, with Fox deeming one commercial "too controversial" last month for featuring a border wall -- but that's tough to do in today's environment.
Read highlights and analysis from the Super Bowl , plus a live conversation with Times reporters and editors in Houston.
Coca-Cola, Airbnb and Budweiser ads are seen as statements
Today millions cheer together, because together is beautiful. #AmericaIsBeautiful pic.twitter.com/z65LimssjD -- Coca-Cola (@CocaCola) February 5, 2017
Coca-Cola revived one of its ads from the 2014 Super Bowl, featuring people singing a multilingual version of "America the Beautiful." While the commercial was not new, it struck an entirely different chord with viewers given the national conversation around immigration and diversity.
"I thought it was great for Coke to air an old ad, because today it feels even more relevant than it did in 2014 when they first aired it," said Lynn Power, chief executive of J. Walter Thompson New York.
Airbnb bought a last-minute spot that came together in a matter of days showing people of different backgrounds, set to music, with text that read: "We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept." A hashtag at the end read #WeAccept, which went viral by halftime.
[Video: We Accept | Airbnb Watch on YouTube.]
Brian Chesky, a co-founder of the company and its chief executive, wrote on Twitter that the company would seek to "provide short term housing over the next five years for 100,000 people in need."
"If there's anything that's screaming out here, it's diversity," said Rob Schwartz, chief executive of TBWA\Chiat\Day New York, in an interview before halftime.
"People are saying, 'Is this trolling Trump?"' he said. "I don't think it's trolling. It's a big smack in the face of, 'Dude, this is America."'
Bieber, Timberlake and Carell appear in ads
Here goes... #BaiBaiBai. With the one and only #ChristopherWalken. @DrinkBai #SB51 pic.twitter.com/wFD7fkL0EG -- Justin Timberlake (@jtimberlake) February 6, 2017
Celebrities and Super Bowl ads go together like guacamole and chips. Shortly after halftime, some of the top searches on Google were related to Justin Bieber, who appeared in an ad for T-Mobile, and Justin Timberlake, who was in an ad for Bai, the beverage company. In the Bai ad, Christopher Walken spoke the lyrics to the 'N Sync song "Bye Bye Bye" as a fireplace roared in the background. After one verse, the camera zoomed out to reveal Mr. Timberlake next to Mr. Walken on a couch, thoughtfully observing the performance.
Steve Carell and Tina Fey were among the celebrities who appeared in an ad from Honda called "Yearbooks," which was narrated by animated yearbook photos of the actors. It was a favorite of Ted Royer, chief creative officer of the ad agency Droga5, who said it "used a lot of celebrities, but in a very fresh way."
"The animation was done just well enough to make it come to life nicely," he added.
#BoycottBudweiser trends
[Video: Budweiser 2017 Super Bowl Commercial | "Born The Hard Way" Watch on YouTube.]
The hashtag #BoycottBudweiser trended earlier in the evening over an ad showing the label's co-founder immigrating to America from Germany in the 1800s, which the company said was not a political statement. The hashtag was apparently started by people who disliked the ad, but then used by others to defend Budweiser and mock boycotters.
"Waiting for a Lyft to take me to Starbucks and then liquor store to get me some Budweiser," one user wrote on Twitter, referring to other politically motivated boycotts involving Uber and Lyft and Starbucks in recent weeks. Another wrote, "If you #BoycottBudweiser because the founder was an immigrant... Don't forget to boycott your ancestors too."
As for the famous Clydesdales, they were visible through a live camera on Budweiser's Facebook page.
Sexy Mr. Clean Provokes Litany of Emotions
Mr. Clean caused a stir this year as he took a turn as something of a sex symbol. Many people online were entertained by the newly attractive reincarnation of the character, while others were perplexed and even disturbed.
"Am I ... sexually attracted to Mr. Clean?" one person wrote on Twitter. Another wrote: "What. Did. They. Do. To. Mr. Clean." One thing was clear: the ad left people with a lot of feelings.
*texts wife*"We're not buying Mr. Clean anymore." -- OrdioMongo (@OrdioMongo) February 6, 2017
Fox and N.F.L. aim to avoid politics
84 Lumber, a supplier of building materials in Pennsylvania, ran its first Super Bowl ad before the halftime show. The company said it had been forced to change its plans for a commercial after Fox deemed its depiction of a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico to be "too controversial." It aired an edited version without a wall, directing viewers to watch the whole spot on a website, Journey84.com.
[Video: 84 Lumber Super Bowl Commercial - The Journey Begins Watch on YouTube.]
Fox and the N.F.L. maintain the right to approve any ad. Fox declined to comment, but the network's advertising guidelines online say that, in general, it will not sell commercial time "for viewpoint or advocacy of controversial issues" and that advertisers cannot use the airtime to address such topics.
Audi ad about equal pay goes viral before the game
[Video: Audi #DriveProgress Big Game Commercial -- "Daughter" Watch on YouTube.]
Audi's ad advocating equal pay for women passed 5.9 million views on YouTube as of Sunday. It is narrated by a father asking questions about what to tell his young daughter one day as she competes in a cart race, such as: "Do I tell her that despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets?"
As she wins the race, he remarks that maybe he will be able to "tell her something different." The commercial ends with text including a line saying that Audi of America is "committed to equal pay for equal work."
While many lauded the company, others criticized it for running the ad while lacking women in leadership roles. Some were dismayed that the ad was followed by a commercial for Mr. Clean, showing him as a sex symbol to women at home.
Brands shell out for airtime
I see your #UnlimitedMoves. Keep em coming and I'll post my favorite https://t.co/J3YYPkR9nw pic.twitter.com/1se1BXiYai -- Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) February 6, 2017
The average cost of a 30-second ad in the Super Bowl rose to $5 million this year, from $4.8 million last year and $2.4 million in 2007, according to figures from Kantar Media that were not adjusted for inflation. Add in the cost of producing a spot along with promoting it online, and it rises even higher.

Full text: Here's a look at what's coming up this week. ECONOMY
Fund faces a deadline for a deal with Greece's creditors.
The International Monetary Fund will hold a crucial board meeting on Monday to discuss whether it will participate in Greece's current bailout program, the country's third in seven years. The I.M.F. has been squaring off with Greece's European creditors over debt calculations and austerity conditions that Greece must meet to receive badly needed loan payments. If both sides don't reach an agreement by Feb. 20, when European finance ministers are to meet in Brussels to review the program, the bailout could be thrown off course, pushing Greece into another potentially disastrous situation. Liz Alderman
A bank leader will discuss Trump's effect on the eurozone.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will speak to members of the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday and will probably face questions about what President Trump means for monetary policy and political unity in the eurozone. So far, Mr. Draghi has avoided commenting on Mr. Trump, but he may become more outspoken after Mr. Trump's tumultuous first days in office. Mr. Draghi may also face questions about whether rising inflation in the eurozone will prompt the central bank to begin withdrawing its economic stimulus measures. Jack Ewing
December trade balance estimates are coming.
On Tuesday at 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department will release its estimate of the trade balance for December. Economists expect to see a net deficit of $45 billion, slightly narrower than the $45.2 billion gap in November. The strengthening of the dollar in recent months could eventually hurt exports by making them more costly overseas, while bolstering imports as they become cheaper for American buyers. While economists don't expect much change in the trade balance from the preceding month, they will be watching closely for any sign of the dollar's impact. Nelson D. Schwartz
BANKING INDUSTRY
Several European lenders will report their 2016 results.
Investors will again have their eyes on European banks this week as several of the region's largest lenders report their results for 2016. BNP Paribas and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale of France and Unicredit of Italy are among the banks expected to update investors on their fourth-quarter and full-year results. Unicredit has already warned that it would post a loss of 11.8 billion euros, or about $12.7 billion, for 2016, with the bank taking [euro]12.2 billion in charges in the fourth quarter as it seeks to clean up its balance sheet. Chad Bray
ECONOMY
Mexican banking leaders will meet as the peso weakens.
Mexico's central bank board will meet on Thursday amid expectations that it will announce a rate increase to address rising inflation. A weakening peso and the government's decision to deregulate gasoline prices at the beginning of the year led to the sharpest spike in inflation in almost two decades. Now the fuel shock is beginning to spread as prices of basic goods are rising and analysts forecast that inflation could surpass 5 percent. The peso has recovered some ground after hitting a historic low two weeks ago in the face of uncertainty about relations with the United States, which buys almost 80 percent of Mexican exports. That uncertainty puts more strain on the Mexican economy, as companies may delay investment plans while waiting to see what comes of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.

Twitter will announce its 2016 earnings.
Twitter will report its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full year on Thursday. Wall Street expects the beleaguered social media company to announce revenue of $736 million for the fourth quarter. As always, analysts will closely watch the company's user growth figures, a point of difficulty for Twitter since its initial public offering in 2013. Mike Isaac
ECONOMY
Trump and Japan's prime minister are poised to meet.
President Trump is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on Friday, with trade and currency issues high on the agenda. Mr. Abe's goal is to defuse accusations by Mr. Trump that Japan benefits unfairly from trade with the United States, partly by keeping the yen artificially cheap. He may offer to channel Japanese investment into American industries in hopes of forestalling protectionism. Much is at stake: The United States is Japan's most important overseas market, and the meeting could set the course for future bilateral trade negotiations. That is especially crucial, now that Mr. Trump has said Washington will no longer participate in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, negotiated by the Obama administration. Jonathan Soble
Consumer sentiment estimates are on the way.
On Friday at 10 a.m., the University of Michigan will release its initial estimate of consumer sentiment for February. The University of Michigan's index hit a 13-year high last month, 98.5, and economists expect a slight decrease to 97.7. That is still a healthy reading, as income gains, steady hiring and a surging stock market have improved consumers' outlook. Nelson D. Schwartz

Full text: If you're an economic technocrat staring at a dashboard of official indicators of how the United States is doing, these look like pretty good times. The unemployment rate is low. Gross domestic product is growing. Wages are rising a good bit faster than inflation, which is very modest. These may not be all-out boom times, but as far as economic policy goes, it looks like a job well done.
Your countrymen, it is amply clear, do not agree.
In polls, nearly twice as many Americans viewed the nation as being on the wrong track as the right one, and as recently as early November many more people saw the economy as getting worse than getting better. Those economic assessments have flipped since the election, driven by Republicans apparently feeling better about things, mainly because President Trump has promised to change the country's direction.
Let's consider Mr. Trump's rise, the anti-establishment energy behind the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, and parallels in the politics of Britain and other advanced nations. It takes no grand leap of logic to conclude that something is rotten in many people's economic lives that hasn't been picked up by the headline data that government statistical agencies publish every month.
But what exactly has gone so wrong?
One set of answers boils down to this: The economy has become too volatile and uncertain. Perhaps the dissatisfaction is driven by globalization, automation and the decline of employers' implicit promises to offer workers jobs through thick and thin. These factors have made it harder for people to get good-paying jobs and to hold onto them for decades. High levels of inequality mean many of the benefits of growth don't accrue for people at the middle and bottom of the pay scale.
All of this has hammered people without an advanced education and left them feeling unmoored and without opportunity, even if by narrow measurements jobs are plentiful and compensation is rising.
Robert Johnson, the president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, argues that the cumulative impact of rapid technological change and shifts in work can have downsides that economists should try to account for more rigorously.
"When firms invest in technical change that disrupts employment structures," Mr. Johnson said, "their decisions focus solely on private profit and neglect the costly side effects that society must bear. When one small firm adopts a new technology displacing workers, this may not be a societal crisis. When many firms do this at the same time, the changes in the nature of production and employment across the nation become a profound social problem."
Economists speak of "negative externalities" -- what happens, for example, when a firm pollutes the air, making everyone else worse off. In this argument, rapid change, when it takes place across many industries at once, is a negative externality that we need to try to account for, particularly "when the economic insecurity leads to a desperate and extreme politics," Mr. Johnson said.
In short, one could summarize this set of complaints as the economy's having become too dynamic for its own good.
But a different line of research offers an alternate theory.
A new report from the Economic Innovation Group, a research outfit funded largely by technology executives, suggests that the real problem isn't too much dynamism but too little. The authors describe trends that have blocked the formation of new businesses and jobs and that are having a stultifying effect on the economy.
They cite federal data showing that in 1977, more than 16 percent of firms in the United States were less than a year old, a figure that had fallen to half that by 2014. New businesses have similarly done less to power new jobs than they once did, while the biggest, oldest firms account for a rising share of economic activity. Market concentration increased for two-thirds of industries between 1997 and 2012, the report found. That coincided with a steady rise in corporate profits as a share of gross domestic product, and in a decline in the share going to workers' wages.
The job market has become less fluid. The proportion of workers who change jobs in a given year has fallen from 12 percent in 2000 to 7 percent in 2015. Workers are also less likely to migrate within the country. In the 1970s, more than 3 percent of the population moved across state lines in a given year; since 2006, the number has hovered around 1.5 percent.
Most startlingly, the creation of new companies has been concentrated in a small number of metropolitan areas: Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. From 2010 to 2014, those five regions created as many net new businesses as the rest of the country combined. If you didn't live in them, or were unwilling to move to them, you were out of luck.
"The debate is so thoroughly dominated by the idea that there is too much change, too much churn, too much disruption," said John Lettieri, a co-founder of the innovation group. "And it may feel that way to many people. But we think that what they're really feeling is a lack of creation of new businesses and new jobs."
>
Old industries have always faced pressure from various forces. The rise of computers obliterated countless jobs for clerks from the 1960s through the 1990s. New steel-making technology rendered old plants obsolete in the 1980s.
But in those earlier eras, new industries and new jobs were emerging quickly to take their place. Now, that entrepreneurial ferment, except for in a few megacities, isn't happening as rapidly.
Both the "too much dynamism" and the "too little dynamism" narratives for what ails American workers have different potential remedies, which cut across ideological lines.
If you believe that increased market concentration is a central problem, you might consider tougher antitrust enforcement, a favorite of liberals, but also explore conservative arguments that complex regulation creates an unfair advantage for big companies that can employ scores of lawyers.
If you look at globalization as the main problem, you might see some Trumpian renegotiation of trade deals and arm-twisting to get companies to keep jobs at home as being in order. But you could also argue for a more generous social safety net and government funding for retraining.
Of course, the too much versus too little dynamism diagnoses aren't mutually exclusive; there are probably elements of truth in both. Maybe the economy really isn't working for many Americans because globalization, automation and changing labor practices have thrown them to the wolves. But maybe there are also deep-seated structural shifts preventing communities and individuals from tapping the great opportunities the modern economy offers.
Regardless, as the seismic political events of 2016 make clear, the data alone may not tell you much about how the economy looks to millions of people or what might be done to make life better for them.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street finished little changed on Wednesday, despite a survey showing strong hiring in January and the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Shares of Apple soared, though, after it said iPhone sales had improved in its latest quarter.
Stocks initially jumped in morning trading after ADP, a payroll provider, said hiring by private employers grew stronger last month. Bond prices also climbed. But the market's gains thinned, partly because, as bond yields rose, investors sold shares of companies that pay big dividends.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had risen 26.85 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,890.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 inched up 0.68 of a point, to 2,279.55. The Nasdaq composite, which has a high concentration of technology companies, gained 27.86 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,642.65. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks dipped 0.60 of a point, to 1,361.23. Most stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell.
The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged, just as investors expected. The central bank noted that the job market was getting stronger and inflation was gradually rising but said it wanted more time to monitor the economy.
Apple made its biggest one-day jump in six months after reporting first-quarter profit and sales that were better than analysts expected. The company said consumers had snapped up its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models, ending the first-ever slump in iPhone sales.
Apple stock rose $7.44, or 6.1 percent, to $128.79. Apple was single-handedly responsible for the Dow gain, and it helped take technology stocks higher.
The chip maker Advanced Micro Devices reported a profit when analysts expected a loss, and its sales were greater than expected. Its stock climbed $1.69, or 16.3 percent, to $12.06.
The ADP jobs survey was better than expected, and the construction, manufacturing, health care and shipping industries all added jobs at a solid pace. The United States government will release its own monthly jobs report Friday.
Stocks that pay large dividends traded lower as bond yields rose. Dominion Resources dropped $4.43, or 5.8 percent, to $71.85. Dominion also released a weak quarterly report.
Oil prices stayed within a small range. United States crude added $1.07, or 2 percent, to close at $53.88 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, gained $1.22, or 2.2 percent, to $56.80 a barrel in London. United States oil has stayed from around $52 to $55 a barrel for the last two months.
The lightweight aluminum products maker Arconic surged after its largest shareholder said the company needed new leadership. Since Arconic split from Alcoa on Nov. 1, Arconic stock had been almost flat, and Alcoa has jumped almost 70 percent. But on Wednesday, Arconic gained $2.55, or 11.2 percent, to $25.28.
The dollar rose to 113.09 yen, from 112.76 yen. The euro fell to $1.0744, from $1.0803.
The price of gold slipped $3.10, to $1,208.30 an ounce. Silver lost 9 cents, to $17.45 an ounce. Copper fell 2 cents, to $2.71 a pound.
Stocks in Europe got a boost from the hiring survey and a report that said manufacturing in China grew at its fastest pace in two years in January. Heavy government spending and more lending by banks helped keep the economy steady. Germany's DAX added 1.1 percent while the CAC 40 of France rose 1 percent. The FTSE 100 index in Britain picked up 0.1 percent.
Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.6 percent after a skid on Tuesday. The Kospi in South Korea jumped 0.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is waiting for more information about the Trump administration's economic plans, just like everyone else. After its first policy making meeting of the year, the Fed said on Wednesday that its economic outlook remained essentially unchanged since its previous meeting in December. The nation's slow-and-steady economic expansion has continued, with little sign in the latest data that it is flagging or accelerating.
And as expected, the Federal Open Market Committee, which makes monetary policy, left the Fed's benchmark interest rate unchanged.
The question is what comes next.
Fed officials said in the weeks before the meeting Wednesday that their uncertainty about the outlook had increased. President Trump has proposed significant shifts in economic policy -- including changes in taxation, regulation and trade -- that could affect growth.
"The statement is written such that the F.O.M.C. will be able to adjust monetary policy as needed in response to the fiscal and trade policies of the administration," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.
At its December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for just the second time since the financial crisis. After the increase of a quarter point, the rate now ranges from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, still very low by historical standards. Low rates encourage borrowing and risk-taking, contributing to faster economic growth.
By raising rates, the Fed is gradually reducing the force of that stimulus.
Fed officials predicted in December that they would raise the benchmark rate three times this year. But they have cautioned that changes in fiscal policy could alter those plans. If Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans seek to increase growth, for example by cutting taxes or spending a lot on infrastructure and the military, the Fed could raise rates more quickly.
If Mr. Trump's policies weigh on growth, the Fed could move more slowly.
The only hint of those pressures in the Fed's latest statement was a mention of increased public optimism about the outlook for the nation's economy.
"Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late," it said.
Fed officials are watching fiscal policy makers closely because the Fed has concluded that the American economy is growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning that, in the Fed's view, faster growth would probably lead to higher inflation.
Changes in fiscal policy are most likely to have a gradual impact, however, so the tension between the Fed and fiscal policy makers may play out mostly in coming years.
"The committee is probably still in a wait-and-see mode as far as fiscal policy is concerned," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC.
The Fed's assessment of economic conditions remained upbeat. The latest data showed "the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace," the statement said. "Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low."
Fed officials spoke in similarly optimistic tones in the weeks before the meeting.
"All in all, things are looking good," Patrick T. Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in mid-January. "We're starting 2017 off on a good foot."
But seven years of tepid growth have not restored the economy to full health.
The unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent in December, a level most Fed officials regard as nearly normal. Other labor market measures, however, remain weak. Wage growth is tepid, and the employment to population ratio for people 25 to 54 was 78.2 percent in December. The Fed's preferred measure of price inflation, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' index of personal consumption expenditures, rose by 1.6 percent in 2016, the strongest performance in more than two years. But inflation remains below the Fed's goal of a 2 percent annual pace -- a goal the Fed has not achieved since 2011.
The vote to leave rates unchanged was unanimous, the Fed said. And the tempered language of the statement led investors to mark down the modest chance of a rate increase at the Fed's next meeting, in March, from about 20 percent before the February statement to about 18 percent afterward, CME Group said.
Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Fed, will have a chance to elaborate on the central bank's economic outlook and policy plans when she delivers a semiannual report on monetary policy to Senate and House committees on Feb. 14 and 15.
In the meantime, the Fed is the rare corner of official Washington where nothing is happening. Contrasting a lively week at the White House and on Capitol Hill with the Fed's announcement, Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, declared the Fed's headquarters "the most boring spot in Washington."

U.S. Allies Gird for a Trade War

Abstract: In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world. The swift reassessment of trade relations -- a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II -- only amplifies the potential for a shake-up of the broader geopolitical framework. [...]on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the job-creating magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative. Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. "In 31 years, I've been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased," he said.

Full text: LONDON -- America's traditional allies are on the lookout for new friends. They have heard the mantra "America First" from the new president, divining a Trump doctrine: global cooperation last. Europeans have taken note of Mr. Trump's denigration of the European Union and his apparent esteem for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. In Asia and Latin America, leaders have absorbed the deepening possibility that Mr. Trump will deliver on threats to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, provoking a trade war that will damage economic growth and eliminate jobs around the world.
Some allies are shifting focus to other potential partners for new sources of trade and investment, relationships that could influence political, diplomatic and military ties. Many are looking to China, which has adroitly capitalized on a leadership vacuum in world affairs by offering itself -- ironies notwithstanding -- as a champion for global engagement.
"We've always said that America is our best friend," Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup -- comprising finance ministers from countries sharing the euro currency -- said in an interview with The New York Times on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this month. "If that's no longer the case, if that's what we need to understand from Donald Trump, then of course Europe will look for new friends."
"China is a very strong candidate for that," he added. "The Chinese involvement in Europe in terms of investment is already very high and expanding. If you push away your friends, you mustn't be surprised if the friends start looking for new friends."
On Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany spoke by telephone with Premier Li Keqiang of China. "The two spoke in favor of free trade and a stable world trade order," a German government spokesman later said in a written statement.
The swift reassessment of trade relations -- a realm in which Mr. Trump is directly threatening the order that has prevailed since the end of World War II -- only amplifies the potential for a shake-up of the broader geopolitical framework.
Mr. Trump has already criticized NATO as obsolete while demanding that member states pay more, calling into question the alliance that has maintained security across much of Europe for more than six decades. He has provoked fears of a clash with China beyond issues of commerce by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of its territory. In shutting American borders to people from predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Trump risks inflaming tensions with Middle Eastern nations while widening a void with democratic allies over basic values.
Through the fractious campaign, weary sophisticates dismissed the extreme talk from the Trump camp as political bluster. Even if he won, he would never follow through on his threats, particularly in trade where his business sensibilities would prevail.
But that conventional wisdom looks to be crumbling. First, Mr. Trump delivered on a promise to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China's growing influence.
Then, on Thursday, his administration appeared to embrace a Republican proposal to impose a 20 percent tax on all imported goods while asserting the proceeds would pay for a wall along the Mexican border. Word of the tax emerged as President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to Washington to protest the promised wall -- resonating as the potential first salvo in a trade war.
"I'm incredibly concerned that the Trump people mean what they say," said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "One would hope that they are using this as a negotiating tactic. But even if you are, that's an extraordinarily dangerous game to play, because, right now, the communication to the world is not flowing clearly."
The communication on Thursday came through Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, who during the administration of George W. Bush, promoted the job-creating magic of free trade as a spokesman for the United States Trade Representative.
Pressed to explain how Mr. Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall, Mr. Spicer said an import tax would do the trick. He soon clarified the tax was merely one option on a crowded buffet table.
At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump reported having had "a very good call" with the Mexican president. But he did not sound conciliatory. Mexico "has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders," he said. "I'm not going to let that happen."
Within the business world, the prospect of substantial tariffs seems so damaging that many assume it will never happen.
Three decades ago, Alan Russell, a former commercial airline pilot, set up the Tecma Group of Companies, which runs factory operations for multinationals in Mexico. Today, the company employs some 7,000 Mexican laborers, most of them in factories clustered around Ciudad Ju√°rez. They make components for the automotive, electronics, aerospace and medical device industries.
Mr. Trump's words have provoked fear among the members of Mr. Russell's work force. "They hear the administration is going to shut down Nafta and deport everyone, and it scares them," he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But in the end, he said, business will carry on.
"In 31 years, I've been through rapid inflation, devaluations, three major recessions, the violence period and multiple presidential administrations, and every year trade has increased," he said. "We've been through worse. Trade is like life itself. It will figure a way."
Most experts have similarly assumed the responsibilities of governance would temper Mr. Trump's trade posture. Given that nearly one-third of all American trade is conducted with China and Mexico, a rupture risks severe economic damage.
The three countries are intertwined in the global supply chain. China makes components that go into auto parts manufactured in the United States. Those parts are delivered to factories in Mexico that produce finished vehicles sold to Americans. Calling such vehicles Mexican imports misses that much of the value is produced in the United States, employing American labor.
"The idea of trade wars these days, what politicians have in mind is really a 19th-century or early 20th-century conception of trade," said Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano, a trade economist at the London School of Economics. "You don't even know who you're going to hurt with these kind of things. You're probably going to destroy American jobs in the end."
Mr. Trump owes his office in no small measure to factory workers who have come to view global trade as a mortal threat to their livelihoods. But their sentiments are grounded not in ideology, but in a desire for jobs at decent wages. If Mr. Trump impedes imports, he could put some of these voters out of work.
Beyond the economic effects, Mr. Trump's refashioning of trade has already altered global alignments.
In emphasizing "America First," Mr. Trump has generated a widespread sense that the country is surrendering its global leadership position. Britain's abandonment of the European Union has enhanced the view that a period of international integration has devolved to a new era in which nationalist concerns are paramount.
On Friday, as Mr. Trump hosted British Prime Minister Theresa May, he only increased the sense that he disdains Europe.
"Brexit's going to be a wonderful thing for your country," he told Ms. May at a news conference, before recounting his frustrations with the union's bureaucracy. "Getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough."
With both countries pursuing nationalist aspirations and multilateral institutions seemingly endangered, the world suddenly seems short of responsible supervision.
China is working to assume the mantle. President Xi Jinping of China last week used an address in Davos, to submit his nation's bid as a reliable champion of expanded trade.
China does not have free elections. China jails labor organizers, while lavishing credit on state-owned enterprises. All of this makes Mr. Xi an ironic choice as an icon for free trade. Yet Mr. Xi's speech was so successful that it won the embrace of business people and world leaders alike.
At a lunch in Davos two days after Mr. Xi's address, a Berlin-based private equity fund manager, Andr√© Loesekrug-Pietri, stood in a dining room full of more than 100 people and predicted the dawning of a new era.
"We heard a Chinese president becoming the leader of the free world," he said.

Full text: A number of Republican health care policy proposals that seemed out of favor in the Obama era are now being given new life. One of these involves Medicare, the government health insurance program primarily for older Americans, and is known as premium support. Right now, the federal government subsidizes Medicare premiums -- those of the traditional program, as well as private plan alternatives that participate in Medicare Advantage. The subsidies are established so that they grow at the rate of overall per enrollee Medicare spending. No matter what Medicare costs, older Americans can be sure that the government will cover a certain percentage of it. That's the main thing that panics fiscal conservatives, because that costs the government more each year.
Premium support could quiet that fear. Subsidies would be calculated so they don't grow as quickly, thus protecting the federal government (that is, taxpayers) from runaway spending. There are lots of variants, but there are really two principal ideas.
The first is to set the subsidy to a level established by the market, as opposed to one established by the government, as it is now.
One way to do that is to tie the subsidy to the average premium of all Medicare plans, including that of traditional Medicare. This is how the Medicare drug program, Part D, already works. For Part D, Medicare collects bids from all plans that reflect their costs of providing the required, minimum level of drug coverage. Then it sets the subsidy at 74.5 percent of the average bid.
Beneficiaries pay the difference, which will be higher for more costly plans that may offer more generous benefits, and lower for cheaper plans. The system also includes additional subsidies for low-income beneficiaries.
The thinking is that the market drives the subsidy. Because insurance companies want to attract more enrollees, they are motivated to drive their bids downward, driving subsidies downward as well and saving taxpayers money.
If this sounds somewhat similar to how the subsidies for the Affordable Care Act marketplace plans work, it's because it is similar. Obamacare ties the premium subsidy to the second-lowest premium instead of the average. If an enrollee wants a plan with more benefits but at a higher premium, he or she would pay the difference, not the government.
But even though the approach is similar to Part D -- which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by a Republican president -- and the A.C.A. marketplaces -- established with only Democratic support -- it does not have bipartisan endorsement.
That's just one more example of how congressional actions and attitudes on health care reform are inconsistent. Republicans think subsidies based on bids is an excellent way to reform Medicare, but they don't laud the Affordable Care Act for adopting the same approach. When it comes to the A.C.A., of course, Democrats supported this mechanism, but they've opposed it when it comes to Medicare reform.
Obamacare's creation of the insurance exchanges and subsidies to expand coverage was a move leftward, supported by Democrats and opposed by Republicans. Anything that relies more heavily on private Medicare options would be a move rightward, and it would probably be opposed by Democrats and supported by Republicans. Such is Washington.
It's worth noting that progressives are also concerned that this plan might erode traditional Medicare. It could do that because, for a variety of reasons, private plans are likely to bid lower than traditional Medicare. If people have to pay more for traditional Medicare, relative to private plans, they're likely to leave it, weakening that arm of the program.
The second main idea included in some premium support plans is to further protect the government from rapidly growing expenditures by explicitly capping the growth in subsidies. This could be layered on top of the bidding approach. It would work like this: Plans bid, and the government picks the average or second lowest. Then the government makes sure it doesn't pay a predetermined amount more than last year -- a growth cap.
This kind of cap on subsidy growth is an even more contentious issue. As anyone who follows health care spending knows, it has grown significantly faster than inflation for the past several decades. Putting a more restrictive cap on growth will make budget projections look better. The problem is that such action assumes that there are ways we haven't previously figured out to reduce Medicare spending without reducing benefits, reducing reimbursement or increasing cost-sharing.
Progressives fear that, given our inability to control health care spending in other ways, this would most likely wind up transferring more and more of the cost of health care onto older Americans themselves. Many would be unable to afford care. The same problems we're seeing with underinsurance and cost-related access barriers in the private insurance market could become more prevalent.
The entire point of premium support is to rely on the market to innovate and come up with more efficient ways of providing health care and health insurance for it. As such, one cannot say in advance how it would keep costs below a growth cap.
Some people deride this as "market magic," and it's easy to see where they're coming from. It's not crazy, however, to think that care could be better managed to produce good outcomes more efficiently, at least to some extent. This, in fact, is the theory underlying some of the Affordable Care Act's reforms, like accountable care organizations.
But the bottom line is this: With premium support, no one can be certain how things will work out. As we consider any premium support approach, we will need to acknowledge that one of the easiest ways to cut premiums is to shift more health care costs to older Americans.

Abstract: The willingness of companies to pay record prices for Super Bowl ads while simultaneously spending more to promote them shows how coveted consumer attention has become in the age of smartphones and social media. More brands are choosing a "drumbeat" approach over one big moment, said Tara Walpert Levy, the vice president of agency and media solutions at YouTube, which has seen more companies prerelease and promote Super Bowl ads over the past few years. (YouTube is celebrating the 10th year of its AdBlitz competition, which encourages viewers to vote for their favorite Super Bowl ads, almost all of which are released and seen widely before the game.) Social media is also far more far more developed as an industry than it was several years ago, making it harder for agencies to maneuver their way into online buzz without buying a spot, as Old Spice did in 2010. The platforms "have caught on and have monetized all the extensions around the Super Bowl," said Lawrence Teherani-Ami, the media director for North America at the ad agency Wieden & Kennedy. Starting in January, public relations firms and executives at large brands offered the news media previews or exclusive peeks at their...

Full text: This month, Anheuser-Busch InBev hosted a dozen or so reporters at its airy New York office to discuss its advertising plans for the Super Bowl. Company-branded folders labeled "Media Briefing" were distributed. A news release detailed the four beer labels that would be featured in commercials during the game, on Feb. 5, with instructions to keep the information under wraps until the next morning. Also included: a brochure outlining "fun facts" for each brand -- Bud Light, Michelob Ultra, Budweiser and Busch -- and a business card with a website and email address for "all of your A-B Super Bowl needs."
Absent from the event, which included an hourlong presentation from the company's United States marketing head: the commercials themselves. Three of the four, the company said, were slated for online release in the lead-up to the big game.
The briefing illustrates the effort companies put forth each year to market the most expensive commercial space on TV. The average cost of a 30-second ad for the Super Bowl crept up to $5 million this year, according to ad buyers, from an estimated $4.8 million last year. Brands, eager to get their money's worth, may spend anywhere from 25 percent of that cost to the same amount on marketing tied to the ads themselves, said Mary Scott, a president at UEG, a sports and entertainment marketing agency.
"Even though the spots have incredible viewership -- as much as the game itself -- you never know," Ms. Scott said, adding that she recommends clients spend an amount equal to at least 25 percent of the cost on promotions related to their Super Bowl ad. "There's become more of a game around the game in terms of ensuring that really pays off in a big way."
The willingness of companies to pay record prices for Super Bowl ads while simultaneously spending more to promote them shows how coveted consumer attention has become in the age of smartphones and social media. It can also be a mind-bending thought experiment, given that the ads are attempts to sell consumers on a product or brand.
As recently as 2011, it was relatively novel for companies like Volkswagen to share teasers and full versions of their ads before the Super Bowl. Now, the main question for companies seems to be how early to start. More brands are choosing a "drumbeat" approach over one big moment, said Tara Walpert Levy, the vice president of agency and media solutions at YouTube, which has seen more companies prerelease and promote Super Bowl ads over the past few years. (YouTube is celebrating the 10th year of its AdBlitz competition, which encourages viewers to vote for their favorite Super Bowl ads, almost all of which are released and seen widely before the game.)
Social media is also far more far more developed as an industry than it was several years ago, making it harder for agencies to maneuver their way into online buzz without buying a spot, as Old Spice did in 2010. The platforms "have caught on and have monetized all the extensions around the Super Bowl," said Lawrence Teherani-Ami, the media director for North America at the ad agency Wieden & Kennedy.
"Whether it's Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube, they all have different types of buys you can make," he said. "The Super Bowl has created a cottage industry for other media companies to take advantage of it as well."
Starting in January, public relations firms and executives at large brands offered the news media previews or exclusive peeks at their commercials, as long as they agreed not to publish the ads or information about them until a specific time -- say, Jan. 26 at 6 p.m. for Mercedes-Benz, or Jan. 31 at 8 p.m. for Buick. Often, the ads were just one part of a broader brand campaign, bolstered by celebrities or new products, with executives ready for interviews.
Bud Light, for example, announced a new tagline, "Famous Among Friends," as part of its event this month. Lexus issued a news release about its Super Bowl ad on Jan. 23, which features music from Sia, noting that it would be the brand's "first official use" of a new global tagline, "Experience Amazing."
The hope is that articles about the ads will drive a flurry of "earned media," industry parlance for morning show segments, articles, blog posts and social media chatter. Often, companies will supplement that with "paid media," like promotions on YouTube or Twitter, search keywords or display ads.
Buick waited until the game last year to debut its first Super Bowl ad. This year, the company is releasing the ad early, and spending twice as much as it did last year on social media promotions. Buick would share information about the commercial only if outlets agreed to keep it private until the company posted the ad online. In exchange for agreeing to its terms, Buick said it could send over a GIF showing how it planned to use Instagram Stories during the game.
Releasing the ad early "gives us a longer time span to engage consumers, and I believe it's a better return on our investment," said Molly Peck, Buick's director of marketing, adding that the company wanted to match the interest it generated last year for being a first-time advertiser. The Super Bowl is still a rare opportunity for companies to reach more than 100 million viewers on a day that "people really want to see the ads, they're not skipping over them, they're watching them in real time and engaged," she said.
Susan Credle, the global chief creative officer of FCB, noted that marketers walk a fine line as they balance the demand for "extras" with the ad itself. "There are very few places where we experience things together for the first time, and I think we underestimate the power of that," she said, referring to the Super Bowl's huge audience.
Roughly 80 national commercial slots were available for purchase this year. The average price of a 30-second in-game Super Bowl ad was $2.4 million in 2007, according to figures from Kantar Media that were not adjusted for inflation. The firm estimated that in-game advertising generated $2.6 billion in sales to networks between 2007 and 2016.
"As advertisers more and more look to tell their narrative and tell content stories, this is a tremendous opportunity to do it, but like any story, you can't just tell it once," said Randy Freer, the chief operating officer of Fox Networks Group. "You have to get out and spread it around and elevate that."
Snickers is aiming to do that this year with the Super Bowl's first live commercial, which will star Adam Driver from the HBO series "Girls." The concept, which its public relations firm was pitching to news outlets as far back as December, will be accompanied by a 36-hour live stream, highlights posted to Facebook and behind-the-scenes footage from two social influencers. The extra effort will cost "several" hundred thousand dollars, the company said.
"It's more and more difficult for people to talk about the ad and see our ad and get noticed, so that's why we are taking an approach that is more about creating a platform." said Berta De Pablos-Barbier, vice president of marketing for Mars Chocolate. "Television advertising continues to be an important part, but on its own it's not enough anymore."

Howls Over Import Tax Complicate Republican Plans to Overhaul Code

Abstract: Slash income tax rates for people and companies, threaten to punish American firms that seek cheaper foreign labor with a tax on the goods they import from offshore factories, and pay for it with surging economic growth. While Mr. Trump's views on a tax code overhaul appear to still be evolving, his economic advisers have been tripped up over the virtues of the taxation of imports and a contentious provision in the House Republican tax plan that would effectively slap a 20 percent tax on imports to generate revenue and encourage domestic production and exports. "The proposed border tax adjustment will distort the market, increase consumer prices and create an uneven playing field for companies and consumers alike," said Philip Ellender, president of government and public affairs for Koch Companies Public Sector, the Koch lobbying arm.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As a candidate, Donald J. Trump made a broad rewrite of the tax code sound simple: Slash income tax rates for people and companies, threaten to punish American firms that seek cheaper foreign labor with a tax on the goods they import from offshore factories, and pay for it with surging economic growth. But President Trump is finding that enacting the first overhaul of the tax code in 30 years will not happen like the raft of executive orders he signed for the television cameras during his first week in office. The contortions that his administration went through over a single part of the tax puzzle -- the tax treatment of imports -- demonstrated how politically fraught the issue will be, even with Republicans controlling all the levers of power in Washington.
While Mr. Trump's views on a tax code overhaul appear to still be evolving, his economic advisers have been tripped up over the virtues of the taxation of imports and a contentious provision in the House Republican tax plan that would effectively slap a 20 percent tax on imports to generate revenue and encourage domestic production and exports.
But there is a broader lesson in that single dispute: Any rewrite of the tax code -- especially if it seeks to raise roughly the same amount of revenue that the current code brings in -- will leave winners and losers. And the losers tend to make far more noise than the winners. If the president is spooked by those howls, a major tax measure that both the president and Congress have promised may never happen.
"This absolutely could be as controversial as the Affordable Care Act because it will create losers," said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "We're seeing just the beginning of this debate."
The debate over the so-called border adjustment has already illustrated the point. This month, Larry Kudlow, the economic commentator who counseled Mr. Trump during the campaign, expressed some of the same concerns that Mr. Trump has shared about the complexity of the plan and warned that it was a form of government meddling that could doom tax reform.
"To renegotiate this into some kind of border adjustment, which will penalize imports and subsidize exports, that is an exercise in government planning and complexity that I believe is doomed to fail," Mr. Kudlow said on CNBC.
On the other hand, Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who helped develop Mr. Trump's tax plan during the campaign, has been supportive. Mr. Trump has wavered on the import tax in the face of opposition from American retailers and oil companies, Mr. Moore said, but he expects the president to come around.
"I think he saw there was a kind of backlash against it and said we're not going to do that," Mr. Moore said. "I don't think it's ever been fully explained to him that this is a way of leveling the playing field."
While American manufacturers would surely benefit, fierce resistance is mounting in corners of corporate America that rely on imports. Some are already musing that Mr. Trump's ambitions may get the best of him and suggesting that a rewriting of the tax code without bipartisan input could turn the legislation into Mr. Trump's Obamacare: a political anvil that his political opponents use to rally against him.
Potential losers made their voices heard last week over the border adjustment tax, an arcane but sweeping change. Similar to the value-added tax used in many countries, border adjustability would help offset the deep cuts that Republicans want to make to the corporate tax rate while preventing the deficit from swelling further. It would subject the money that companies use to import products and parts to income taxation, but exclude from taxation the revenues reaped from exports.
The next steps could be politically perilous for Republicans. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet this week with Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to hash out their differences on a tax overhaul amid confusion about where the president actually stands.
Mr. Trump expressed opposition to border adjustments this month, before backtracking and saying that he remained open to the idea. Then on Thursday his press secretary, Sean Spicer, added to the haziness by suggesting that such a tax was part of Mr. Trump's broader reform vision -- and a way to pay for a wall along the border with Mexico. He then played it down as just one of many options.
Academic economists theorize that the proposal would lead to a rise in the value of the dollar, making imports more affordable in spite of the new tax. But businesses that rely on imports are not buying it, and they are already lobbying to kill it. Even traditional Republican allies have been speaking out -- especially oil and gas interests like Koch Industries, which import much of their products.
"The proposed border tax adjustment will distort the market, increase consumer prices and create an uneven playing field for companies and consumers alike," said Philip Ellender, president of government and public affairs for Koch Companies Public Sector, the Koch lobbying arm. "Our tax system should encourage, not destroy, free exchange and trade resulting in robust commerce and lower, not higher, prices for consumers."
The resistance was also on display last week as Mr. Brady, who has been the driving force behind the House Republican tax effort, made the rounds at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Financial Services Roundtable, Wall Street's lobby, to sell the plan and assuage concerns.
"We know we are throwing bold changes at the business community," Mr. Brady told a businessman who represents hundreds of gasoline stations and is worried about inflation. "We don't expect these models to change on a dime."
Wherever the White House comes down, the Senate will also have to weigh in. Talk of a border tax has rankled senators from both parties, with Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, accusing Republicans of making middle-class Americans pay for the border wall and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, panning any import tax that would increase the cost of Mexican products.
"Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea," Mr. Graham wrote in a post on Twitter. "Mucho Sad."
The border adjustment tax is likely the first of many battles that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans will face as they pursue a comprehensive rewrite of the tax code. Changes to provisions such as mortgage deductions, the deductibility of employer-sponsored health plans and charitable deductions for individual income taxes would lead to far wider protests.
The injection of the politically charged border wall into the tax reform discussion has only served to make the debates more rancorous.
"The politics of it gets super messy once you start saying that a particular piece of broader tax policy is already going to be dedicated to paying for a certain infrastructure project," said Tammy Frisby, a tax policy expert at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, explaining her disappointment that the Trump administration has already been talking about assigning tax revenue. "My optimism for tax reform has plummeted."

Full text: CAIRO -- Egypt's future lies at the end of a brand-new asphalt road that arcs through the Eastern Desert, a grand project wrapped in a few pieces of ragged tarpaulin and framed by an enormous sky. The landscape is part sci-fi dystopia, part Wild West; the silhouettes of oversize wheels and pile drivers grind slowly against the horizon, while strange pods and skeletal boxes rise from the sand. "Our aim is to build a new Egypt," Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the military general turned dictator, told the United Nations soon after his rise to formal power in 2014. At the heart of this new Egypt -- as imagined by the country's leadership -- are the beginnings of a new Egyptian capital, constructed from scratch in the dunes some 30 miles east of Cairo's city center.
So far there is little to see but fragments: the outlines of a restaurant complex, the foundations of a mall, an army-owned hotel clad in wooden scaffolding. Each section is managed by a different conglomerate of companies, most of which are enmeshed with the higher echelons of the state. The only completed element appears to be the ceremonial platform from which Mr. Sisi will one day inaugurate his alternative metropolis, a stony mound thrust high into the air that overlooks a neat grid of parking spaces and helipads in the foreground, and emptiness beyond.
From some angles, the platform projects solidity and permanence; try to fit it in with its surroundings, however, and it looks like a rickety stage set that could collapse in an unexpected gust of wind. I clambered up the steps and across the plastic sheeting with an Egyptian colleague. "We are building our home in the apocalypse," he said eventually, after staring around him in silence for some time.
Six years after the start of the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak and sent the Arab world's most populous nation into turmoil, Egypt's foundations are less secure than they might first appear. True, the trappings of old-school authoritarianism are more in evidence now than ever -- from the 60,000 political prisoners believed to be languishing behind bars to the spate of forced disappearances to the government crackdown on authors, journalists, cartoonists and human rights defenders. Unauthorized protest is illegal, and a sweeping antiterrorism law gives the state the power to designate anybody it doesn't like as a militant. Tired regime survival tool kits have been sharpened with fresh intensity.
Certainly to his many Western allies, including President Trump -- who has described his Egyptian counterpart as a "fantastic guy" and accepted a congratulatory phone call from him on election night, ahead of any other foreign leader -- Mr. Sisi appears to be a recognizable face in an increasingly unrecognizable region: the Middle Eastern strongman offering a binary choice between tyranny and chaos.
The reality is different. Egypt's 2011 revolution was not an aberration that can now be buried under tons of cement, but rather the first manifestation of an extraordinary historical moment in Egypt. Its central fault line is a struggle over whether politics is to remain the preserve of elites, or whether the defenses around the existing model of power can be swept away from below. This struggle has deep roots, and it has now been out in the open for more than half a decade. It will continue, in different forms, for many years to come.
Mr. Sisi's ruling project, which justifies itself with an appeal to stability, is curiously unstable: It lurches from crisis to crisis, each revealing new cracks in the architecture of political authority, each accompanied by new levels of official violence as part futile attempts to beat the state's contradictions into submission.
The regime cultivates a chauvinistic nationalism intended to increase its legitimacy, but at the same time is dependent on financial support from regional allies. When one of those allies, Saudi Arabia, demands the settlement of a land dispute through the transfer of islands in the Red Sea, the government acquiesces -- prompting thousands of Egyptians to take to the streets in anger. The regime promises social justice but presides over an economy in which inflation is rampant, austerity is biting and living standards plummeting.
The regime insists its curtailing of democratic freedoms is necessary because of a war against radical Islamists, but security lapses continue and the perpetual need to conjure up fresh demons means that some of the most popular figures in the country -- most recently the soccer legend Mohamed Aboutrika -- end up on the terrorist watch list. The regime attempts to prove to the international community that it is open for business, but then flounders in a morass of conspiracy theories when the body of Giulio Regeni, a young Italian Ph.D. student, is found on the side of a highway, his nails and skin marked with signs of torture.
Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Sisi is reigning over the ashes of a broken political order; more so than Mr. Trump, however, he is a creature of that broken order and incapable of articulating the new. Egypt's younger generation, weaned on television images of barricades and tear gas, and veterans of their own personal battles with patriarchs in the classroom, mosque, factory floor and family dining room, do not accept the status quo as immutable.
"The future now seems very vague and foggy," a young activist named Tarek Hussein told me late last year, "but we won't abandon the fight to make it our own." Mr. Hussein's peers live out Egypt's paradoxes on a daily basis: He was incarcerated under the former Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, for allegedly opposing the government, and then again under Mr. Sisi for allegedly being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. I met him in a downtown Cairo cafe in the company of his younger brother, Mahmoud, who as a teenager spent more than 700 days imprisoned without charge for the crime of wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan "Nation without torture."
Our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of what appeared to be a police informant, listening in and occasionally muttering into a phone. Tarek and Mahmoud, used to navigating the complexities of Mr. Sisi's Egypt, deftly steered us outside so that we could continue talking elsewhere. The future they want to create is irreconcilable with the one represented by the police informant, and the system that sponsors him; the future Egyptian capital in the Eastern Desert, with its neatly demarcated segments of conventional authority and V.I.P. parking for those with private helicopters, is incompatible with the messy, contested Cairo from which the Hussein brothers have emerged.
No one knows what twists and turns will come next in Egypt's era of unrest, but it is clear that stasis is not a long-term option. "For these kids, the revolution was a new parent, something that brought them into the adult world and would make them, and which they believed they would eventually remake in turn," a friend who teaches political sociology to undergraduates at a major Egyptian university said recently. "They are the orphans of the revolution, and they will never be content with life as it stands."
The future is indeed vague and foggy, far more so than the confident proclamations of Egypt's rulers suggest. And who will shape that future remains fundamentally up for grabs. Driving back from the ceremonial platform to the main road, we passed a group of day laborers huddled around a fire. Behind them loomed pieces of a huge wall, more than 20 feet high, which is intended to eventually encircle the new city.
"This is Sisi's wall, and Sisi's capital," one of the workers grinned when I asked him about it, jerking his finger at the construction site. "Everywhere else is Egypt."

Abstract: [...]the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment. [...]the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed's plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation. What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama's second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed. The retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s. Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation's infrastructure -- an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus. Since Mr. Trump's victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of...

Full text: President Trump's target for economic growth just got a little more distant. The government reported Friday that the economy grew by only 1.6 percent last year, shy of what experts had estimated and well below the 4 percent rate that Mr. Trump has vowed to deliver -- a pledge now cited on the White House website.
There are plenty of signs of life in the economy. Consumer spending is healthy, and an index of consumer sentiment just hit a 12-year high. Stocks have been surging, and the jobless rate is near what the Federal Reserve considers full employment.
But however solid, the recovery under President Barack Obama never reached exuberance. It is the second longest recovery in American history but the first in the postwar era in which growth for a full year did not hit 3 percent.
Mr. Trump made that data point a focus of his campaign, citing factories that closed during the recession but never reopened and workers who gave up looking for jobs and dropped out of the labor force. And economists, even if they disagree with his policy prescriptions, acknowledge that many areas have been left behind.
While Friday's report will provide more support for Mr. Trump's argument, the lackluster pace of economic growth may also complicate the new administration's plans. Indeed, some of the headwinds in 2016 -- like a widening trade deficit and cautious spending by businesses -- could persist into 2017 and beyond.
In particular, lower exports and higher imports also hurt growth in the fourth quarter, which fell to an annual rate of 1.9 percent from 3.5 percent in the prior quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday.
In 2016, personal consumption -- which accounts for a majority of economic activity -- slowed from 2014 and 2015. In addition, the sharp plunge in oil prices over the same period prompted steep cuts in energy production and exploration, contributing to a drop in business investment.
All of this underscores why analysts say that Mr. Trump's growth rate target of 4 percent is audacious at best and fanciful at worst, especially given broader factors like an aging population and the growth rate of 2 percent or so that has prevailed since the recovery began in 2009.
"It would defy gravity," Diane Swonk, a veteran independent economist in Chicago, said. Four percent growth would require big gains in the size of the work force and productivity, but neither is in the offing, Ms. Swonk said, adding, "It's simple math."
At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled that it is ready to raise interest rates a few times this year, and a faster expansion would only accelerate the Fed's plan to tighten monetary policy to head off inflation.
Whatever the growth trajectory is in 2017, Fed officials will have a tricky time navigating the political and economic currents under Mr. Trump. Not only did he criticize the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, during the campaign, but his assessment of the current economy is more downbeat than the Fed's.
One week into the Trump administration, there are many other economic wild cards for policy makers and private forecasters to contemplate, including the impact of congressional efforts to reshape the corporate tax code, trade tensions with Mexico and China, and the proposed repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act.
Tax cuts could open the way for new spending and investment. But more expensive imports from Mexico could be painful for many consumers, for example, while a trade war with China would hurt American companies like Apple, General Electric and Caterpillar.
What is more, although the Commerce Department report focused on the last three full months of Mr. Obama's second term, anemic economic activity could add to the revenue shortfall the federal government will most likely face from the personal and corporate tax cuts Mr. Trump has discussed.
"It's difficult to see how we would get to 4 percent growth given the current structure of the economy, especially demographics and productivity growth," said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. "That would be true no matter who is the president."
The retirement of the baby boomers will limit the size of the labor force, he said, while productivity gains from technology are not expected to accelerate from the current level, as they did with the adoption of the internet or mobile phones in the 1990s.
Weak growth does strengthen arguments for a federal program to fortify the nation's infrastructure -- an approach Mr. Trump has advocated that could provide an economic stimulus.
Since Mr. Trump's victory in November, many economists have been raising their projected growth rates for the latter half of 2017 and for 2018.
That is not necessarily because they feel Mr. Trump's policies will prove beneficial in the long run. Instead, it is because the tax cuts and infrastructure investments he has called for could bolster the economy in the short term.
Mr. Faucher lifted his growth forecast to 2.4 percent in 2017 and 2.7 percent in 2018. Previously, he expected output to expand by 2.25 percent in each year.
"Tax cuts and infrastructure spending represent a much more expansionary fiscal policy than we've had in some time," he said.
But Mr. Faucher cautioned that increasing the federal deficit, which stood at $587 billion in 2016, by hundreds of billions more in the coming years could increase interest rates, which were already moving higher.
Rates, including mortgage rates for home buyers, are already up more than half a percentage point since the election, on expectations of more borrowing and faster growth.
But in economics, as in life, everything cuts both ways. The rise in interest rates has also strengthened the dollar relative to other currencies.
While that has been good news for American tourists, a stronger currency is bad news for American exporters, with imports becoming cheaper while the price of American-made products abroad rises.
The prospect of a stronger dollar also makes it more difficult to achieve another of Mr. Trump's economic goals: a revival of the American manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are more dependent on foreign sales than many other businesses, but a rising dollar makes their products less competitive overseas.
On Friday, the White House announced a manufacturing jobs initiative, naming chief executives like Andrew N. Liveris of Dow Chemical and Elon Musk of Tesla to the as part of the effort, along with labor leaders from the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The dollar is rising on expectations of faster growth in the United States and because of the jump in domestic interest rates, which make American financial assets like bonds more appealing to global investors than lower-yielding debt in Europe and Asia.
"Mr. Trump can't control the dollar, and that will be a big factor this year," Mr. Faucher said. "Trade is likely to be a drag on growth."

Abstract: The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. The whole idea behind the House Republicans' plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share.

Full text: Enjoy the guacamole as you watch the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Some of the ingredients might be a little more expensive next year. House Republicans and President Trump have been talking about imposing a 20 percent tax on imported goods, with a White House spokesman suggesting on Thursday that such a tax might start with goods from Mexico. With the tax, the price for some heavily imported items could go up. But other foods produced mainly in the United States might become slightly cheaper.
While many details remain unclear, here are a few indications of how the tax might work and how it would affect prices in the fruit and vegetable aisle at the supermarket.
Chances are good that the avocados you eat come from Mexico.
A third of all avocados eaten by Americans are grown in the United States and the rest are imported. More than nine of every 10 imported avocados come from Mexico, while most of the rest come from Chile, Peru and the Dominican Republic.
The average retail price of an avocado varies considerably. Prices can creep up toward $1.50 for the Super Bowl and Fourth of July, the two biggest spikes in demand. The retail price falls toward $1 apiece around Christmas, as demand falters but the trees, grown in mild, subtropical climates, keep producing. Organically grown avocados have been commanding a premium of about 30 percent lately, a premium that has widened over the last few years.
You may bear the brunt of a tax on imported avocados -- but not necessarily by how much you may think.
The tax would not end up being 20 percent of a $1 to $1.50 avocado, which would be 20 to 30 cents. That is because the import tax would only be on what is known a the dutiable value -- the wholesale price of the avocado assessed when it crosses the border.
That does not include the cost of trucking it from the border to a grocery store in the United States, the store's rent, the store's bills for air-conditioning and other utilities, or the wages for the store's staff. None of these costs would be subject to the tax, but can help determine the retail price of the avocado.
For the first 11 months of last year, the average wholesale price of avocados crossing the border was 50 cents apiece.
So a 20 percent tax on that wholesale price at the border would only add a dime to the cost of each avocado.
It takes four or five years for a newly planted avocado tree to bear fruit. If an import tax were to be imposed on foreign avocados, American farmers could not increase production quickly. That means many Americans might have to pay for taxed avocados imported from Mexico and elsewhere for a few years, or potentially do without.
Guacamole does not just consist of avocados: don't forget the onions, which may benefit from a border tax.
That is right -- a good guacamole needs onions, lime juice and a few other ingredients as well. Just look at onions.
Seven out of eight onions eaten by Americans are grown in the United States. They also tend to be grown by companies -- even the smaller-scale onion farmers tend to incorporate their farms -- so they owe corporate tax.
That is notable because various plans being circulated call for a border tax to be used to help reduce the corporate profits tax.
Right now, the corporate profits tax is 35 percent. Multinationals like Apple actually pay a lot less, in part because much of their profits are held offshore. That is harder for an onion farmer to do, although there are tax breaks for farmers.
With those qualifiers, the introduction of a border tax is expected to produce enough revenue to offset the losses from lowering the tax on corporate profits to 25 percent, 20 percent or even 15 percent, depending on the proposal. That would ultimately help cut the tax bill for onion farmers.
The whole idea behind the House Republicans' plan is that companies producing in the United States should pay lower taxes, so those companies can hire more workers. The tax burden would be shifted toward importers, but also toward people who buy imported goods.
Would America's onion farmers share their tax savings?
Companies tend to pass on the cost of taxes to consumers, while pocketing any tax savings, when there are only a few businesses in the industry and limited competition. The opposite can also be true: companies in highly competitive industries tend to pay extra taxes out of their own profits, because raising prices might result in lower market share. In those cases, they tend to pass on tax savings to consumers.
Onion farmers might also use their tax savings to hire more workers and export more. The United States imports a few more onions than it exports, but most onion farmers simply grow for the domestic market. A corporate tax cut linked to a border tax might prompt them to expand globally, which is the whole idea behind a border tax.
So how much will your guacamole cost for next year's Super Bowl?
That is tough to predict, and also depends on inflation and other factors, not just the border tax. The odds are that a border tax would drive up the cost of guacamole, because avocados, not onions, account for most of the cost of making it, and most avocados are imported. But the details of the tax, and how markets respond to it, will also make a big difference.

Will Nafta Be Attacked With Tweezers or a Hammer?

Abstract: Economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that Nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the United States toward higher-value, more productive work, raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs. Nafta may have increased overall G.D.P. and average incomes in the United States -- but at the same time contributed to the decline in well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly blue-collar men.

Full text: ¬† It was a deal that created a deeply intertwined economy stretching from the Arctic to Central America and a generation of mostly warm relations between the United States and its two neighbors.
It has also contributed to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and added to deep-seated discontent in the communities that lost them. That, in turn, helped propel a sharp critic of the deal to the White House.
So with Donald J. Trump in charge, what happens now to the North American Free Trade Agreement? It's one thing to assail it as the "worst trade deal ever" as the president did during the campaign. It's quite another to come up with an arrangement that is more advantageous to American workers and businesses.
"Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with," said Wilbur Ross, the president's nominee to be commerce secretary, in his confirmation hearing. It will be, he said, a "very, very early topic in the administration."
So what might that actually mean? What can the president actually do, what benefits might be attained for the United States and what could go wrong?
Trade experts say there really is room to make major change in the two-decade-old agreement. A renegotiation could well lead to a better deal for all three countries. But it will require the United States to make concessions that the Trump administration may be wary of offering.
If not approached carefully, revamping an agreement that has created the economic underpinning of major industries would risk American jobs as well as higher prices for consumers. And the closer the Trump administration gets to blowing up the deal, the larger those risks loom.
Before diving into what could go wrong -- and right -- as President Trump looks to rework Nafta, it's worth starting with the basics.
What is Nafta?
On Oct. 7, 1992, President George H.W. Bush stood in San Antonio flanked by the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Canada. "This meeting marks a turning point in the history of our three countries," he said. "We are creating the largest, richest and most productive market in the entire world."
Mr. Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, was the one to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through a divided Congress. By 1994, the three countries were entwined in a trade deal that, in its 22 chapters covering 309 pages, lashed their economies together.
It eliminated most tariffs on goods traded between the nations, and set in place processes to get rid of regulatory and other barriers. The idea was that over time a company in Ohio could do business with a firm in Ontario as easily as it did with one in Indiana.
What have been its results?
As the election showed, whether Nafta was a good thing for voters in the United States or a bad one continues to be argued. But there are some things most people who study these things can agree upon.
The North American economy really does work as an integrated whole. United States exports to Mexico, for example, are now 3.5 times their 1993 level when adjusted for inflation. They have risen more than twice as fast as the overall economy. Trade between the United States and Canada has been pretty well balanced over time, but the United States has had about a $60 billion per year trade deficit with Mexico, importing more than it exports.
In the auto industry, for example, supply chains crisscross North American borders, with work of different complexity done in different countries. Your Ford made in Michigan might contain a dashboard made in Juarez and a transmission made in Windsor, Ontario. This complex supply chain has helped make the U.S. auto industry competitive with manufacturers in Asia and Europe, which also contain both low-wage and higher-wage countries with different specialties.
The impact on jobs and incomes in the United States is less clear. Economists broadly supportive of free trade deals argue that Nafta essentially encouraged a shift of jobs in the United States toward higher-value, more productive work, raising wages and having negligible impact on the total number of jobs. Those more skeptical of the deal view it as having created low-wage competition across the border in Mexico that accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs. (See a more detailed explanation of the competing views here and here.)
One way to reconcile those two views: Nafta may have increased overall G.D.P. and average incomes in the United States -- but at the same time contributed to the decline in well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs that tended to be concentrated in certain cities and among certain groups of people, mostly blue-collar men.
Can President Trump kill the deal?
In theory, yes. But it would be a mess, particularly if he tried to do it right off the bat.
Article 2205 of Nafta says that a country can withdraw from the agreement six months after giving notice. But if President Trump did that, it would unleash disarray in major industries; ruin the ability to have good-faith negotiations with Canada and Mexico; and most likely cause a legal showdown with Congress (which passed Nafta all those years ago and wouldn't want it abrogated without a say).
That doesn't sound like what the Trump administration has cooked up. It's more likely to reopen the deal. "I'm optimistic that we can renegotiate the deal that's both advantageous to us and advantageous to Mexico, that's a win-win for both countries," said Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, in his confirmation hearing.
Will Canada and Mexico come to the table for a renegotiation?
Sure looks that way. The White House has announced plans to meet separately with the leaders of both countries, and all signals are that they're up for new talks. In the case of Mexico, President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto has said he wants talks to cover a wider gamut than trade alone -- implicitly threatening to become less cooperative on fighting drug trafficking and other frontiers if the Trump administration is excessively punitive in trade talks. And, of course, Mr. Trump's announcement today that he will build a wall on the border -- and that Mexico will eventually pay for it -- could cause Mexico to rethink its outlook on trade negotiations altogether.
So what is the United States going to ask for?
We don't know for sure, but some hints have emerged.
One strong possibility would be to focus on "rules of origin" governing what counts as an automobile or other finished good produced within the free trade area. For example, a steering wheel might be assembled in Mexico but include parts made in China; the rules of origin state how many of those parts can come from China while still counting as a Mexican steering wheel and thus enjoy the benefits of the free trade zone.
If the required share of North American parts were increased -- from its current 62.5 percent for many auto parts to 75 percent, for example -- it would give an advantage to manufacturers in the United States and reduce competition with the low-wage countries of Asia.
Another example of a possible United States priority: asking Canada and Mexico to be more liberal in allowing goods to be shipped into their countries with no taxes and little paperwork. (To be precise, asking them to raise the value of what would count as a "de minimus" shipment exempt from the usual customs process). That would be good news for American companies looking to sell into those countries.
The United States has long complained that the tribunals that settle trade disputes among the three countries are stacked against U.S. interests, and it could seek changes.
Those sure seem like perfectly normal things for trade deals to focus on.
They are. But there was one more goal for the United States that Trump argued for during the campaign, and it would be a bigger source of friction if his negotiators chose to pursue it.
Mr. Trump characterized the value-added tax that both Mexico and Canada have as unfair to U.S. companies. The tax is 16 percent in Mexico; when a Mexican firm exports goods to the United States, it receives a rebate for the tax it paid, and when a U.S. firm exports to Mexico, a comparable adjustment is added.
Mr. Ross, the Commerce secretary nominee, and Peter Navarro, a Trump White House trade adviser, argued in a white paper during the campaign that this amounts to an unfair export subsidy that penalizes the United States.
Canada and Mexico aren't likely to see it that way, and will resist if the United States seeks a change to the rules so that a VAT adjustment is no longer added to U.S. exports into their countries. In their view -- and that of mainstream economists -- their approach to taxing is the only way to avoid unfairly penalizing their domestic companies.
The VAT is similar to a sales tax, and to the Mexican government, the Trump position will sound like the equivalent of Massachusetts demanding that it be able to sell its goods in Connecticut without a sales tax slapped on them.
So if that issue ends up at the center of the negotiation, things could get rocky.
But a deal should get done, right?
Maybe. But keep in mind: This won't be a one-way street. Both Canada and Mexico expect concessions from the United States in return for concessions they make. And some of the things that the Mexican government most covets will rankle many Trump supporters.
For example, Mexico wants better access to a program, widely enjoyed at the Canadian border, in which shippers that pass a security review are allowed to cross the border with a less intensive customs process (this is the international trade equivalent of the "T.S.A. PreCheck" security line at the airport).
Mexico also seeks more favorable treatment for Mexican citizens with advanced skills seeking visas to work temporarily in the United States.
Needless to say, making it easier for Mexican trucks and Mexican workers to get into the United States isn't exactly what Trump campaigned on. But that's the kind of concession that may be needed to get a trade deal.
Is there a chance Nafta completely blows up?
There is -- though not necessarily in catastrophic fashion.
Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, lays out a possibility in which the Trump administration does eventually withdraw from Nafta, but in a context in which it has worked out separate deals with Mexico and Canada that maintain most of the trade arrangements codified in Nafta.
President Trump and his advisers have often spoken of a preference for bilateral deals instead of big multicountry trade deals. It is potentially a pathway for Trump to be able to proclaim that he ended a trade deal he assailed on the campaign trail, without wrecking the economy.
Even that wouldn't necessarily be painless, however.
"It would be like Humpty-Dumpty," Mr. Hufbauer said. "There will be firms and communities in the U.S. that will be adversely affected, that will close down if you disrupt these supply chains. That won't make for good newspaper coverage, and presumably the Trump team will want to avoid that."
Just how urgent is renegotiating Nafta?
Campaign promises aside, even some people who have been opposed to Nafta and other trade deals don't view this as a first-order priority. U.S. trade with Canada is reasonably well balanced, and the trade deficit with Mexico is smaller than that with some giant Asian economies.
Robert E. Scott, the director of trade and manufacturing policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, sees more to be gained by rethinking the trade relationship between the United States and China, Japan, South Korea and even Germany. "Those are accountable for 80 percent of trade-related job losses over the last 20 years," he said. "To me, Nafta is not a top priority."
"There are much bigger fish to fry," he added.

Real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks did better than the rest of the market as bond yields headed lower, making those sectors more appealing to investors seeking income.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.40 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 19,799.85. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 6.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,265.20. The Nasdaq composite index lost 2.39 points, or 0.04 percent, to 5,552.94. The Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies, gave up 4.01 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,347.84.
Investors also watched the latest batch of company earnings and deal news. They had their eye on Washington, where President Trump reaffirmed plans to loosen regulations on businesses and tax foreign goods entering the country.
Companies that issued results or outlooks that fell short of Wall Street's predictions put traders in a selling mood. McDonald's, the world's largest hamburger chain, fell 0.7 percent after it reported a fourth-quarter drop in sales at established United States locations. The decline ended a streak of five quarters of increases. Shares shed 88 cents to close at $121.38.
Halliburton slid 2.9 percent after the provider of oil and gas drilling services warned of weaker demand in markets outside North America. Shares were also weighed down because the company's revenue missed forecasts. The stock shed $1.65 to close at $54.80.
Corporate deal-related news also moved some stocks.
Kate Spade & Company climbed 3.6 percent after Bloomberg News reported that the handbag maker had drawn interest from potential buyers like Coach and Michael Kors. Kate Spade rose 64 cents to finish up at $18.40.
Sprint gained 2.8 percent after news that the mobile phone carrier would buy a 33 percent stake in Tidal, the music streaming service owned by artists including Jay Z. The stock added 25 cents to close at $9.18. Aetna fell 2.7 percent after a federal judge rejected the health insurer's plan to buy rival Humana for about $34 billion. Aetna said it was reviewing the opinion and would consider an appeal. Aetna's stock dropped $3.33 to end regular trading at $119.20.
Qualcomm fell 12.7 percent on news that Apple was suing it for $1 billion in a patent fight. Qualcomm, one of Apple's major suppliers, was the biggest decliner among companies in the S. &P., sliding $8 to close at $54.88.
The fall in crude prices dragged on the energy sector, which fell 1.1 percent. The oil and gas rig operator Transocean declined 55 cents, or 3.6 percent, to close at $14.76. Benchmark United States crude fell 47 cents, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $52.75 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $55.23 per barrel in London.
Major global stock markets mostly fell because of concerns that the Trump administration would pursue trade protectionism policies. The DAX in Germany slid 0.7 percent, and the CAC-40 in France fell 0.6 percent. The FTSE 100 in London gave up 0.7 percent.
In Asia, a report showed that China's economic growth edged up in the final quarter of 2016, but its full-year expansion was the weakest in three decades. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong was unchanged. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 1.3 percent.
The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 2.40 percent from 2.47 percent late Friday. Yields had generally been climbing since Election Day on expectations that a Trump administration would spur more inflation and economic growth.
In currency markets, the dollar declined to 113.1 yen from 114.47 yen on Friday. The euro rose to $1.0741 from $1.0693. Among metals, the price of gold gained $10.70, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $1,215.00 an ounce.

Full text: ¬† There's a broad consensus that the world is falling apart, with every headline reminding us that life is getting worse.
Except that it isn't. In fact, by some important metrics, 2016 was the best year in the history of humanity. And 2017 will probably be better still.
How can this be? I'm as appalled as anyone by the election of Donald Trump, the bloodshed in Syria, and so on. But while I fear what Trump will do to America and the world, and I applaud those standing up to him, the Trump administration isn't the most important thing going on. Here, take my quiz:
On any given day, the number of people worldwide living in extreme poverty:
A.) Rises by 5,000, because of climate change, food shortages and endemic corruption.
B.) Stays about the same.
C.) Drops by 250,000.
Polls show that about 9 out of 10 Americans believe that global poverty has worsened or stayed the same. But in fact, the correct answer is C. Every day, an average of about a quarter-million people worldwide graduate from extreme poverty, according to World Bank figures.
Or if you need more of a blast of good news, consider this: Just since 1990, more than 100 million children's lives have been saved through vaccinations, breast-feeding promotion, diarrhea treatment and more. If just about the worst thing that can happen is for a parent to lose a child, that's only half as likely today as in 1990.
When I began writing about global poverty in the early 1980s, more than 40 percent of all humans were living in extreme poverty. Now fewer than 10 percent are. By 2030 it looks as if just 3 or 4 percent will be. (Extreme poverty is defined as less than $1.90 per person per day, adjusted for inflation.)
For nearly all of human history, extreme poverty has been the default condition of our species, and now, on our watch, we are pretty much wiping it out. That's a stunning transformation that I believe is the most important thing happening in the world today -- whatever the news from Washington.
There will, of course, be continued poverty of a less extreme kind, smaller numbers of children will continue to die unnecessarily, and inequality remains immense. Oxfam calculated this month that just eight rich men own as much wealth as the poorest half of humanity.
Yet global income inequality is actually declining. While income inequality has increased within the U.S., it has declined on a global level because China and India have lifted hundreds of millions from poverty.
All this may seem distant or irrelevant at a time when many Americans are traumatized by Trump's inauguration. But let me try to reassure you, along with myself.
On a recent trip to Madagascar to report on climate change, I was struck that several mothers I interviewed had never heard of Trump, or of Barack Obama, or even of the United States. Their obsession was more desperate: keeping their children alive. And the astonishing thing was that those children, despite severe malnutrition, were all alive, because of improvements in aid and health care -- reflecting trends that are grander than any one man.
Some of the most remarkable progress has been over diseases that -- thank God! -- Americans very rarely encounter. Elephantiasis is a horrible, disfiguring, humiliating disease usually caused by a parasite, leading a person's legs to expand hugely until they resemble an elephant's. In men, the disease can make the scrotum swell to grotesque proportions, so that when they walk they must carry their scrotum on a homemade wheelbarrow.
Yet some 40 countries are now on track to eliminate elephantiasis. When you've seen the anguish caused by elephantiasis -- or leprosy, or Guinea worm, or polio, or river blindness, or blinding trachoma -- it's impossible not to feel giddy at the gains registered against all of them.
There's similar progress in empowering women and in reducing illiteracy. Until the 1960s, a majority of humans had always been illiterate; now, 85 percent of adults are literate. And almost nothing makes more difference in a society than being able to read and write.
Michael Elliott, who died last year after leading the One Campaign, which battles poverty, used to say that we are living in an "age of miracles." He was right, yet the progress is still too slow, and a basic question is whether President Trump will continue bipartisan U.S. efforts to fight global poverty. A four-page questionnaire from the Trump team to the State Department seems to suggest doubts about the value of humanitarian aid.
One reason for the Trump team's skepticism may be the belief that global poverty is hopeless, that nothing makes a difference. So let's keep perspective. Yes, Trump may cause enormous damage to America and the world in the coming years, and by all means we should challenge him at every turn. But when the headlines make me sick, I soothe myself with the reflection that there are forces in the world that are larger than Trump, and that in the long history of humanity, this still will likely be the very best year yet.
Remember: The most important thing happening is not a Trump tweet. What's infinitely more important is that today some 18,000 children who in the past would have died of simple diseases will survive, about 300,000 people will gain electricity and a cool 250,000 will graduate from extreme poverty.

Full text: ¬† BEIJING -- China's economy firmly hit its growth target last year and even accelerated a bit at the end. In most countries, that would be seen as unequivocally good news.
But this is China, where figures are sometimes doubted and where economists look for signs of strain underneath the numbers. Indeed, Chinese officials who released the economic data on Friday faced questions about the country's mounting debt. And in an unusual move, its central bank on Friday took an extra step to inject more money into the economy over the next month.
China's economy grew 6.7 percent last year after accelerating slightly to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the government's statistics bureau announced on Friday morning.
The strong economic growth in 2016 came after a weak start last year, when China's currency and stock market were tumbling and many foreign investors fretted that the country's three decades of robust economic expansion might be ending.
The Chinese government appears to have delayed an economic reckoning, but at a high cost. The central bank and state-owned banks shoveled trillions of renminbi into a surge of credit, putting aside longstanding worries about a deeply indebted corporate sector and signs of a real estate bubble. The government borrowed and spent heavily, continuing oversize projects like the construction of world-class highways and high-speed rail lines to cities that are increasingly remote from the main hubs of economic activity near the coast.
But Ning Jizhe, the commissioner of the National Bureau of Statistics, dismissed concerns about rising debt.
"I don't think this worry is necessary," he said at a news conference.
Hours after the data release, the central bank said on its official Weibo microblog account that it was providing temporary help to "several large commercial banks" that have been distributing large sums of cash ahead of China's Lunar New Year celebrations, which begin at the end of next week.
Consumers Keep Spending
Chinese and foreign economists generally agree that the best hope for the country's long-term economic health is for the current emphasis on debt and investment to give way to greater consumer spending. Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending climbed 9.6 percent last year, led by blistering growth in online retail sales of 26.2 percent. But as in other countries, including the United States, much of that growth has come at the expense of brick-and-mortar stores and malls.
Real Estate Prices Surge
When Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China's central bank, said at a news conference in Shanghai last February that the answer to China's immediate economic troubles lay in more mortgages, few paid close attention. Chinese officials previously expressed concern that real estate prices were already too high, hurting affordability and exposing the economy to significant risks if prices tumbled.
But after Mr. Zhou's remarks, state-owned banks were instructed to step up mortgage lending, and the results were spectacular. Sales of commercial buildings rose 34.8 percent, and residential sales climbed 36 percent as prices leapt higher and higher. The steel, cement and glass industries -- all suffering from overcapacity in recent years -- benefited as they supplied builders, and electricity production to power those factories rose. Municipal governments in Shanghai and elsewhere began imposing administrative controls this winter to limit further real estate price increases.
Debt Piles Up
More mortgages were part of a big expansion in the overall credit moving through the Chinese economy. To achieve its 6.7 percent growth last year, the Chinese government allowed total credit to rise at nearly two and half times that pace, according to a calculation by Louis Kuijs, an economist at Oxford Economics. Credit used to grow at the same pace as the economy, but debt has been accumulating faster than the economy's output since the global financial crisis.
The central bank, the People's Bank of China, said on Friday afternoon that it was providing liquidity assistance for 28 days to several large commercial banks. It did not identify the banks. The central bank also did not provide details except to say that it was using a market mechanism to make sure the extra money entered the country's financial system.
The People's Bank of China did not respond to requests for clarification. Stock markets were up on Friday in China, and short-term interest rates were only slightly higher -- two signs that while money may be fairly tight in China ahead of the holidays, any difficulty has not yet become severe enough to alarm investors.
What's in a Number?
Many concerns have been raised about the quality of Chinese economic data. Western economists have suggested that Chinese government statisticians underestimate growth in boom years and overestimate growth during busts to present a smoother overall picture of the Chinese economy. Worries about data quality increased after the state-run People's Daily quoted Chen Qiufa, the governor of the northeastern province of Liaoning, as saying on Tuesday that local governments had inflated growth data from 2011 to 2014.
But many economists say last year's growth appears to have been real -- although bringing additional debt that could burden the economy for years to come. Mr. Ning insisted on Friday morning that national economic data was reliable, and he added that if local officials were caught fabricating data, "we will show no leniency."

Abstract: Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings on Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades.

Full text: ¬† Wall Street stocks moved modestly higher on Friday, recouping much of the market's loss from a day earlier and snapping a five-day losing streak for the Dow Jones industrial average.
Another crop of encouraging company earnings news helped lift the market, but investors were mostly focused on events in Washington as Donald J. Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.
The Dow rose 94.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,827.25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,271.31. The Nasdaq composite index added 15.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,555.33.
The major stock indexes pulled back slightly as Mr. Trump delivered remarks after taking the oath of office. Among topics of particular interest to Wall Street, the speech touched on trade and the Trump administration's intention to protect the United States from "the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs."
"The market is still embracing the Trump agenda, based on the market's reaction to the speech," said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Now the question the market has is, specifically, what does all of that mean in terms of trade?"
Despite the gains on Friday, the three major stock indexes ended the week lower.
Stocks have slowed in 2017 after surging for several weeks following Election Day on investor optimism that a Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress would usher in business-friendly policies. But the possibility of increased tariffs or trade restrictions has also loomed as a potential drag in profits for big companies.
"Historically, the market has performed best in the November-April time frame," said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. "The Trump victory added a tailwind to this traditional seasonal factor."
Beyond the presidential transition in Washington, investors pored over the latest batch of corporate earnings on Friday, bidding up shares in companies that reported results that beat Wall Street's expectations.
Skyworks Solutions jumped 13 percent, the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. The stock climbed $10.21 to $88.67. Citizens Financial Group gained $1.09, or 3.1 percent, to $35.82.
Traders also drove up shares in Procter & Gamble after the consumer goods maker released a strong growth forecast. The stock added $2.75, or 3.2 percent, to $87.45.
Strong subscriber numbers helped lift AT&T, providing a lift to phone company stocks over all. AT&T added 45 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $41.45.
Some companies' earnings failed to impress the market.
General Electric slid 2.2 percent after the conglomerate reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of analysts' forecasts. The stock gave up 68 cents to $30.53.
Major stock indexes overseas were mixed Friday.
Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. France's CAC 40 added 0.2 percent. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 0.7 percent after the Chinese government said the economy grew at a 6.8 percent annual rate in the last quarter, even as full-year growth increased 6.7 percent, the weakest in three decades. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.3 percent.
Benchmark crude rose $1.05, or 2 percent, to close at $52.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added $1.33, or 2.5 percent, to close at $55.49 a barrel in London.
Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.47 percent. Yields have been rising as investors expect inflation to increase.
In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.31 yen from Thursday's 114.80 yen. The euro rose to $1.0707 from $1.0659. The British pound edged up to $1.2378 from $1.2337.
Gold dropped $3.40 to settle at $1,204.30 an ounce.

Abstract: A special commission of the African Union concluded in October 2015 that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed, by the government of South Sudan "pursuant to or in furtherance of a state policy," and by opposition forces, too. In the summer of 2015, mediators from the East African organization known as IGAD imposed a peace settlement, with support from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union.

Over the past three years, more than three million South Sudanese civilians have been displaced inside the country or have fled abroad because of fighting and atrocities -- including more than 340,000 just to Uganda over the past six months.
A special commission of the African Union concluded in October 2015 that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed, by the government of South Sudan "pursuant to or in furtherance of a state policy," and by opposition forces, too. Famine is spreading. The state is effectively bankrupt, and the economy is collapsing. The inflation rate reaches triple digits.
South Sudan formally seceded from Sudan in July 2011 after more than two decades of a civil war that killed over two million people, a peace agreement and a referendum. By December 2013, fighting had broken out again in Juba, the capital of South Sudan, between rival militias supporting President Salva Kiir and the recently dismissed vice president, Riek Machar. (Mr. Kiir alleged that Mr. Machar was plotting a coup, but no credible evidence of that has surfaced.) The political struggle between Mr. Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and Mr. Machar, an ethnic Nuer, soon took on tribal overtones, causing tens of thousands of deaths in communal fighting.
In the summer of 2015, mediators from the East African organization known as IGAD imposed a peace settlement, with support from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. I say "imposed" because Mr. Kiir's faction only signed it under the threat of individual financial sanctions and an arms embargo. The agreement divvied up positions in the government of South Sudan among the recalcitrant leaders of the main groups, who balked at sharing power with the very people they had just fought. Many smaller groups were left out.
The deal promptly collapsed. Hatred and distrust were too deep-seated. No institution was given authority or adequate leverage over the parties to enforce the extraordinarily complex peace agreement or resolve any related disputes. The parties committed flagrant violations of the cease-fires to which they were ostensibly bound. In July 2016, fighting erupted again in Juba between the forces of Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar. Mr. Machar fled abroad after being hunted down by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (S.P.L.A.). The conflict has since taken on even more ethnic and tribal dimensions, and caused more mass atrocities, most recently in Equatoria, a southern province.
There can be no military solution to the conflict today: Neither the government nor any other group has enough power to impose one. The army is trying to hold the country together by brute force, but is failing, because it is fracturing itself and its combat strength is deteriorating.
The multitribal coalition that won the civil war against Sudan is dead. Between the late stages of the conflict between north and south, in the late 1990s, and South Sudan's independence in 2011, the S.P.L.A. attracted young men from most southern tribes. By now, it has devolved into a militia of Dinka soldiers from the southwestern province of Bahr el-Ghazal, the home region of Mr. Kiir and the S.P.L.A. chief of staff. Troops from most other tribes have regrouped to form their own militias. The army is balkanizing. The only effective weapons it still has are helicopter gunships and fixed-wing bombers, which can cause much destruction but cannot win a war.
Any solution to the current crisis must be political. Yet the bloodletting since December 2013 has been so terrible, the atrocities so horrific, that current leaders on all sides have lost too much credibility to form a new government, or even usefully participate in negotiations over a political settlement. They are lightning rods for the grievances of other tribes and groups. And the 2015 agreement's failure is evidence that settlements imposed by outsiders without broad local support ultimately fail.
The only way forward, in other words, is for new local actors to broker a new political settlement, with outsiders acting as only supporting cast during the negotiations but guaranteeing its enforcement after it is signed. A similar model was used successfully during the 2002-4 negotiations between north and south, leading to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which ended the war. (I was involved as the U.S. government's special humanitarian assistance coordinator for Sudan and the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development.)
Current leaders on all sides would have to be offered a graceful exit toward a foreign country and guarantees that they would not face criminal prosecution. An interim national government comprising leaders not involved in the crisis would have to be formed to allow for a cooling-off period.
Negotiations for the creation of this interim government should include church leaders, civil-society leaders, traditional tribal chiefs and younger political leaders from all the tribes and factions. The church may be the only institution in South Sudan that still has credibility with the population and does not have blood on its hands.
The African Union's mantra that African problems call for African solutions has failed to resolve this crisis, or others. With the 2015 deal, IGAD negotiators basically moved around the deck chairs on a sinking ship by giving senior positions to the people who had triggered the conflict, and failed to impose penalties on anyone who violated the agreement.
And enough with all the useless African Union and United Nations resolutions. By my count, the U.N. Security Council has passed at least 27 resolutions on Darfur since 2004, appointing study committee after study committee, and repeatedly warning the Sudanese government in Khartoum to stop committing atrocities. Yet President Omar al-Bashir, for one, has flouted them, and fighting and abuses continue in Sudan.
The new U.S. administration should promptly appoint a high-profile public figure as special envoy for South Sudan -- perhaps a former governor or member of Congress -- whose role would partly be to deliver a tough message: A zero-tolerance policy for atrocities committed by any side. The U.S. government should back that warning by threatening to confiscate ill-gotten wealth held abroad by South Sudanese leaders; negotiating a way for leaders involved in the current crisis to leave the country; jamming hate speech broadcasts on the radio; shutting down cellphone towers used to encourage ethnic cleansing and monitoring military activities via spy satellites.
The chances of success are slim, but the alternatives are even less promising and the current situation will surely deteriorate. If the violence worsens, or simply continues, refugees will keep pouring out of South Sudan and destabilize the region. The word in diplomatic circles is that some neighboring states are already devising plans for occupying parts of South Sudan if the chaos spreads.
The world's youngest country must not be allowed to go from independence and great promise just a few years ago to war and famine today, and occupation and collapse tomorrow.

Abstract: Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape the economy -- appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external shocks -- the relationship between presidential action and economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove.

Full text: ¬† Presidential reputations rise or fall with gross domestic product. The state of the economy can determine if presidents are re-elected, and it shapes historical memory of their success or failure.
In the news media, we often use the handover of power as the time for assessing the economic record of the departing president. (I've done it myself recently.) Some economists have predicted that the Trump administration could create the next recession or financial crisis. And scholars have studied the relative economic conditions generated by Republicans and Democrats for predictive meaning (Democrats have done better since World War II, they found).
But the reality is that presidents have far less control over the economy than you might imagine. Presidential economic records are highly dependent on the dumb luck of where the nation is in the economic cycle. And the White House has no control over the demographic and technological forces that influence the economy.
Even in areas where the president really does have power to shape the economy -- appointing Federal Reserve governors, steering fiscal and regulatory policy, responding to crises and external shocks -- the relationship between presidential action and economic outcome is often uncertain and hard to prove.
It's this quirk in how we think that unfairly enhances the reputation of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton while unfairly diminishing the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and both George Bushes.
And if you think of the financial markets as the hyperactive cousin of the economy itself, this mental framework can cost you money.
We all have a tendency to think that a president whose policies we disagree with will be bad for the economy and the stock market. But looking at markets in such starkly political terms can lead to bad decisions. Ask a conservative who refused to invest in stocks while they notched a 182 percent gain during the Obama presidency -- or a liberal who shorted stocks after Donald J. Trump won in November.
So what tools does a president actually have to shape economic outcomes? Fewer than you might think. Let's walk through the factors that determine economic results -- from those that are more purely luck to those that do reflect a president's skill at overseeing the economy.
Timing the business cycle
When George H.W. Bush took office in January 1989, the unemployment rate was 5.4 percent and the roaring 1980s expansion was near its peak. When Bill Clinton succeeded him in January 1993, the unemployment rate was 7.3 percent and falling, as the United States was finally shaking off the damage of a recession.
That bit of timing alone -- taking office at the trough of the business cycle versus the peak -- can help explain much of how we perceive a president. Mr. Bush, of course, was a one-term president, while Mr. Clinton was handily re-elected.
President Obama's luck on this front was somewhere between those extremes; he took office in the middle of a steep downturn. But some simple math shows just how much the timing of the 2008-9 recession relative to Inauguration Day mattered. Mr. Obama is set to leave office with cumulative job growth of 8.4 percent over his eight years in office.
But if he had taken office 13 months earlier in December 2007, he would have presided over a putrid 3.4 percent growth. If he had taken office in February 2010, when employment hit rock bottom, he would be on track to see blockbuster 14 percent job growth in eight years (assuming 2017 job creation turns out to be equivalent to 2016).
Put simply, when you take office at the bottom of a recession and with unemployment high, you can "achieve" a lot of growth just from the natural healing of the economy. When you take office at the top, there is nowhere to go but down. This may presage bad news for Mr. Trump, given that the jobless rate was a relatively low 4.7 percent in December.
Demographic and economic destiny
Consider one of the big economic forces of the post-World War II economy: women entering the labor force on a mass scale. In 1948, only 33 percent of American women between 25 and 54 worked or sought work. By the time George W. Bush took office in January 2001, that had risen to about 77 percent.
That means that throughout the second half of the 20th century, the economy had a huge tailwind, as millions of women joined the work force and stated contributing to G.D.P. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton didn't create that trend; broader social forces did. But the fact that it happened made their economic records look better.
Expand the idea to other elements of demographics: the baby boom generation entering the labor force from the 1960s through the 1980s and now retiring; the large millennial generation coming into the work force. You see that a big part of the economic growth that might take place during a given presidency is determined by forces not under any politician's control.
It's worth noting that these forces are part of the story behind slow growth during the Obama administration and will -- unless something surprising changes -- continue in the Trump administration. The labor force has grown an average of 0.4 percent a year during the last eight years, and the Congressional Budget Office projects an average of 0.5 percent a year during the coming four.
By contrast, the labor force grew by an average of 1.2 percent a year during the 1990s, the last period of blockbuster growth.
The president doesn't set monetary policy
Now we're getting to areas where the president really does have some control over the economic cycle. Too bad it's so indirect.
The Federal Reserve raises and lowers interest rates in an effort to prevent recessions and maintain low inflation. The president appoints its seven-member board of governors, including the chair.
The president can select appointees who align in terms of philosophy and instincts, and may select Fed governors who are more competent -- or less. But the Fed system is designed to maintain independence from the administration once the appointments are made.
Beyond that, terms are staggered such that a president won't necessarily get to appoint a majority of Fed leaders, especially right off the bat (Fed governors' terms are 14 years, though lately few have served that long; the Fed chair has a four-year term).
So when a president appoints Fed officials who are effective stewards of monetary policy, achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices and financial stability, it helps a president's odds of having an impressive economic record. It just isn't a very direct exertion of power.
For fiscal policy, talk to Congress
This is often what we think of when we talk about a president's economic policy. The occupants of the Oval Office can steer policy around taxing and spending priorities. But they can't do it alone.
It's certainly true that tax and spending policy carries a president's imprint. President Obama's election victories enabled him to enact a major fiscal stimulus in 2009 and increase taxes on the wealthy starting in 2013. President Reagan's election brought a sharp cut in tax rates. Different election results would have made for different fiscal policy.
But Congress has, if anything, greater power than the president over how the government taxes and spends. It's almost a punch line that when a president issues a proposed budget each winter, congressional opponents call it "dead on arrival."
And while Mr. Obama had fiscal policy wins, he also met stiff resistance. The spending cuts known as "sequestration" happened because Republicans took control of Congress in 2010.
So to the degree that taxes and spending shape the course of the economy -- and there's no doubt they do -- presidents can set direction, but not steer the ship themselves. It is a lesson Mr. Trump will soon learn.
Everything else affects the economy -- slowly
There's a broad range of other areas in which presidential action affects the economic future. Name a field, and the president exerts power over it: health care, energy, technology innovation, financial regulation, labor policies, trade, transportation infrastructure, agricultural policy. The list is endless. Even foreign policy matters; stable geopolitics is generally good for business.
The problem is that all of these big policy areas affect the nation's economic prospects over the long run. The downsides of regulating banks poorly might show up as a crisis a decade down the road. The benefits of better infrastructure will tend to show up over many years. The payoffs of well-designed education policies come to fruition as young people enter the labor market with better skills years later.
Likewise, from a more conservative vantage point, the cost of environmental restrictions limiting energy production may not show up in the price of fuel for years. Burdensome, outdated regulations tend to show up as a modest drag on business year after year, not as an acute, clear crisis.
For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Affordable Care Act would reduce the labor supply by 2.3 million because more people would choose not to work. (The thinking being that they were working mainly so they could have employee-sponsored health insurance.) It said this would happen not immediately, but by 2021, a full 11 years after the law was passed and four years after the president who signed it would be out of office.
And that's a case where independent economists manage to create an estimate of economic consequences. Often these economic impacts are so slow-building, diffuse and subject to partisan interpretation that it's hard to estimate them with any precision. We all want to assume that it is our preferred policies that make the economy rev more strongly, even if it's hard to prove definitively.
None of this means that presidents can't do a lot to make the United States economy more dynamic and productive. It's just that doing so could take a great while. It's hard to prove that this or that policy was the source of the good times.
In the short run, all those other factors have a more direct, measurable effect in shaping whether a moment in political history produces an economy we remember fondly.

Full text: ¬† FRANKFURT -- Plenty is happening in the world of monetary policy, so while the European Central Bank did not announce any major changes at its meeting on Thursday, there was no shortage of issues for members of its Governing Council to argue about.
The official inflation rate is rising, emboldening conservatives who want the bank to print less money. Britain will soon open divorce proceedings with the European Union. The American president-elect, Donald J. Trump, who predicted this week that more countries would defect from the bloc -- undercutting the central bank's raison d'√™tre -- will take office on Friday.
The European Central Bank has been a bastion of stability in the eurozone, equipped with powerful financial weapons and less susceptible to the political infighting that often paralyzes decision making at European Union headquarters in Brussels.
But holding the 19-nation currency bloc together may be trickier than ever in the months to come. Here are some of the issues facing the bank and the eurozone:
Inflation
"There are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation."
-- Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.
It has been said that the European Central Bank focuses on three things: inflation, inflation and inflation. That differs from the Federal Reserve in the United States, which also pays close attention to employment.
So a jump in the official eurozone inflation rate to 1.1 percent in December, the first time since 2013 that the Consumer Price Index has exceeded 1 percent, was a big deal in monetary policy circles.
The increase, from 0.6 percent in November, could have bolstered the argument by several members of the Governing Council that the central bank should begin backing away from the de facto money printing it has undertaken since 2015.
Mr. Draghi said, though, that members of the Governing Council were not yet convinced that the rise in prices would continue in months to come. "The council decided to look through it," Mr. Draghi said of the inflation data -- central bank jargon meaning that the members would not pay attention to the monthly number until they believed it signaled a trend.
He said there had been no discussion on Thursday about so-called tapering, or winding down the central bank's purchases of government bonds and other assets using new money. Those purchases have been used in an effort to strengthen economic growth.
Mr. Draghi portrayed a harmonious meeting in which council members were unanimous in their belief that central bank policy was doing its job. "There was a sense of satisfaction toward the monetary policy stance we have been pursuing since 2015," he said.
European Unity
"Keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think."
-- Mr. Trump on the euro, in an interview with reporters from the German newspaper Bild and The Times of London.
Britain moved a step closer to leaving the European Union this week after Theresa May, the country's prime minister, gave a speech outlining her terms of separation. European leaders fear that Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front has an outside shot at winning presidential elections in France this year, throwing the membership of one of the bloc's core members into doubt just as another departs.
And Mr. Trump did not offer a ringing endorsement of the wavering European project when, speaking to two journalists this week, he complained about the Brussels bureaucracy he encountered while building a golf course in Ireland.
The European Central Bank is supposed to be aloof from politics. But the strains on European unity make it even more difficult than usual to develop a monetary policy.
Mr. Draghi refused to respond to Mr. Trump's lack of faith in the common currency. "It's very early for us to comment on President Trump's statements," Mr. Draghi said.
Diverging Paths
"While Trump introduces higher uncertainty, this is better than the near certainty of the continuation of a mediocre status quo."
-- David Folkerts-Landau, chief economist of Deutsche Bank.
Some economists have expressed optimism that Mr. Trump could pursue policies that would increase growth in the United States, which would be good for the rest of the world and particularly Europe. The United States is the European Union's biggest trading partner.
On the other hand, Mr. Trump also promised this week to slap 35 percent tariffs on BMW cars imported from a new factory in Mexico. Faster economic growth in the United States would be a mixed blessing for Germany and other European countries if it comes with restrictions on trade.
Mr. Trump's policies could also increase inflation in the United States, leading to higher market interest rates. That would probably spread to European bonds and other assets, making it more expensive for regional governments and companies to borrow.
While refusing to respond to anything Mr. Trump has said, Mr. Draghi gave a relatively upbeat assessment of the eurozone economy. He pointed out that unemployment was falling, surveys of business and consumer confidence were at their highest levels in years, and he said it had become easier for businesses and consumers to get loans.
"The recovery is resilient," Mr. Draghi said.

Abstract: The Fed steadily raises rates, to the degree that employment and inflation data cooperate with their forecasts, with faster rate increases the higher growth rises. Economists believe a key element of a corporate income tax overhaul advanced by House Republicans, known as a border adjustment tax, would have the effect of creating a huge rally in the value of the dollar compared with other major currencies, perhaps 20 percent or more.

Full text: ¬† Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, made it clear Wednesday that she believes that the American economy is pretty much back on track.
And that, in turn, sets the stage for a potential conflict with the incoming Trump administration in the months and years ahead.
Congress assigns the Fed two goals: seek maximum employment and maintain stable prices. Ms. Yellen, in a speech in San Francisco, rather explicitly made clear that the nation isn't far from attaining those goals.
"Now, it's fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment, and inflation is moving toward our goal," she said. The unemployment rate, 4.7 percent, is back near where it was before the 2008 recession. And "although inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year."
It is Ms. Yellen's clearest indication to date that the era of extraordinary efforts by the central bank to get the economy back in shape is nearing its end. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates in each of the last two Decembers, and it is looking likely that there will be more than one rate increase this year. She said in her speech that she and her colleagues were expecting to increase the federal funds rate "a few times a year."
As central bankers are wont to do, Ms. Yellen emphasized that those plans were contingent on the economy's behaving as the Fed expected. If inflation starts to slip again, or improvements in the job market recede, the Fed will presumably hold off. But she spoke clearly of the risks of moving too slowly toward the so-called neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy.
"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road," she said. "Either too much inflation, financial instability or both."
But if things go as planned, there is a clear risk that the Fed's goals could be on a collision course with the Trump administration's goals.
The president-elect and his advisers have often spoken of seeking stronger economic growth than the United States has experienced the last several years, perhaps seeking 3.5 percent to 4 percent instead of the sub-2 percent growth that has been the standard since 2009. A white paper by advisers to Mr. Trump released in the fall assessed the view that this lower growth rate reflected demographics and that it amounted to a "new normal," and declared it "incomplete -- and unnecessarily defeatist."
That view is at odds with both Ms. Yellen's comments Wednesday and longer-term economic projects that Fed officials have released. For example, the median Fed policy maker viewed the economy's long-term rate of G.D.P. growth as only 1.8 percent a year, very much in the ballpark that Trump advisers would view as unnecessarily defeatist.
So here's one way things could go: The Fed steadily raises rates, to the degree that employment and inflation data cooperate with their forecasts, with faster rate increases the higher growth rises. It's possible that what people in Mr. Trump's orbit view as a desirable boom will look to Ms. Yellen and her colleagues as overheating, and prompt equal and opposite interest rate increases.
There are a couple of potential twists in this story. The first would involve potential Trump appointments to the Fed; the second could involve big moves in the dollar.
Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman expires in about a year. Mr. Trump could appoint a new leader to the Fed who is more hospitable to his view (though she would have the option of continuing her time as a Fed governor, one of seven policy makers who are appointed to 14-year terms).
There are two governor vacancies available now, so Mr. Trump could quickly influence the direction of the Fed with new appointees.
But it's not clear whether any new Trump appointees would steer the bank toward higher interest rates and greater concern about inflation or let a potential Trump boom advance unconstrained.
Big fluctuations in the dollar could also shape a potential tension between Trumponomics and Fed policy. Economists believe a key element of a corporate income tax overhaul advanced by House Republicans, known as a border adjustment tax, would have the effect of creating a huge rally in the value of the dollar compared with other major currencies, perhaps 20 percent or more.
The Fed has been more focused than ever in the last few years on how its decisions ripple through the global economy. It held off on rate increases in 2015 and early 2016 in significant part because a rally in the dollar seemed to be destabilizing many emerging markets and fueling risks of a global slowdown.
A stronger dollar also reduces inflation in the United States, which in turn makes the Fed more inclined toward caution on rate increases.
Mr. Trump has sent mixed messages on his views of a border adjustment tax, seeming to slap down the idea in a Wall Street Journal interview published this week. But if it looks as if policies on Capitol Hill are going to push the dollar up significantly.
Of course, that too could cut in the other direction. A stronger dollar doesn't help with Mr. Trump's goals of reducing the trade deficit, and just this week he has seemed to try to talk the dollar down.
Add up a week of new signals from incoming Trump administration officials and now Ms. Yellen's speech, and it is looking like a distinct possibility that Ms. Yellen could wake up one morning in the year ahead to early-morning tweets directed her way, originating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Full text: ¬† Last week, President-elect Donald J. Trump called Obamacare "a complete and total disaster," and pushed for a swift repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement within weeks. But at the moment, there is no workable replacement. So what happens to the individual insurance market -- whose problems did not start with the Affordable Care Act and will not be easily solved -- when it is destabilized so dramatically?
From my point of view as a former health insurance company chief executive, "total disaster" would also describe any Republican repeal-and-delay plan. Although my former colleagues in the insurance industry are too cowed by the president-elect to say so, Republican insistence on repeal without having a meaningful replacement at the same time will drive most insurers out of the individual market and leave the 10 percent of Americans now covered by some aspect of the A.C.A. without coverage -- especially if Medicaid expansion is rolled back as well.
The proportion of uninsured Americans, which has dropped to less than 9 percent, the lowest on record, will at least double. By April, when filings from insurance company plans and premiums for 2018 are due, there will be a sizable exit -- of insurers running away from the greatly increased and unpredictable risk and of individuals not able to afford insurance without the subsidies.
Of course, the A.C.A. has a number of flaws, and repair is critical. But delay is not an option if the replacers really want to use private insurers to meet society's goals of access, affordability and quality in health care. All known Republican alternatives envision heavy reliance on the same insurers that are now ready to bolt and leave a total mess rather than a defective but repairable market.
After they leave, the damage will spread to doctors and hospitals, whose bad debt will skyrocket when patients miss copays and drop coverage while providers and hospitals still must continue care.
This is not speculation but based on my experience in the industry and as a member of the board of a public hospital that stands to lose substantial Medicaid payments if the state expansions are rolled back.
Let's go back for a moment to pre-Obamacare days. Why did insurers refuse to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions, cancel policies if customers used them too much, set high premiums for women and old people, and so forth? These tools were the only way to limit risk when insurers didn't have a ready-made pool of sufficient size to balance the sick and well as employer-sponsored plans do.
Refusing coverage and the like was good business, but it did not serve small businesses, the self-employed or other people unable to get the insurance they wanted. The Obamacare exchanges tried to fix this by requiring everyone to join the pool, providing premium and cost-sharing subsidies geared to income (the "affordable" in the law's name) and limiting risk to insurers to entice them to offer policies.
It's a tricky business to fine-tune a market and encourage buyers and sellers to do the right thing -- both providing access to individuals in need and encouraging enough insurers to join to make competition work. But George W. Bush, with some bipartisan support, did it not so long ago with the Medicare drug plans.
But unfortunately, the A.C.A. law created by Democrats in Congress had several big flaws. Pricing restrictions -- which essentially mandated that insurers overcharge younger customers relative to older ones -- created the wrong incentives, and so too many older, sicker individuals joined, and younger, healthy people were discouraged.
This was compounded by a Republican Congress that reneged on its promise to help insurers in the first years of the program by limiting risk. Congress allowed only 12 percent of the backup that was promised to companies when they set their premiums on the Obamacare exchanges. This ramped up their risk dramatically.
If you're wondering why insurers substantially increased premiums for this year, even far beyond the underlying health care inflation rate -- now at around 4 percent -- this shell game with risk is your answer.
Ultimately, if the risk is too high, exit is inevitable. That is what my top-rated plan, Qualchoice, did in Ohio in the late 1990s to stem multimillion-dollar losses from its participation in the Medicaid Advantage managed care program. It's also what United Healthcare did and most others will do this spring when faced with the uncertainty of delay.
Finally, none of the participants, in government or business, want to recognize that in many parts of the country, only one insurer or a highly consolidated health system dominates, which eliminates meaningful competition and choice.
Since 2010, Republicans have made political hay by demonizing the mandate to buy insurance, subsidies to make it affordable and taxes on employers, suppliers, insurers and especially the wealthy to finance it. But now they own the problem and must fix it or do something better.
Obamacare, or any plan that replaces it that is reliant on private insurers and individual enrollment, will succeed only under the following conditions: a meaningful incentive to purchase insurance (the individual mandate or equivalent); help to make it affordable; risk reduction for insurers to stabilize premiums; and enough funding to pay for it all.
If any replacement plan doesn't include these elements, private insurance will revert to the chaos of the pre-A.C.A. market. In business, managing risk is important; in insurance, it is everything. Whoever plays games with it -- knowingly or inadvertently -- is playing with fire.
If we manage this risk badly through repeal and delay, the damage to insurers, individuals, hospitals and professionals will be profound.

Full text: ¬† Here's a look at what's coming up this week.
WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM
Davos Gathering to Convene, With Trump on the Agenda
Heads of state, business leaders and entrepreneurs will meet in the Swiss resort town of Davos on Tuesday for the world's most elite networking event, the annual World Economic Forum. Among the most anticipated guests this year will be President Xi Jinping of China, marking the first time that a Chinese head of state has attended the gathering. Participants will discuss topics like climate change, social inclusion and responsible leadership, against a backdrop of rising populism in Europe and the United States. President-elect Donald J. Trump is likely to be a major topic of discussion in the many sessions this week. Alexandra Stevenson
EARNINGS
Bellwether Reports From Banks Are on the Way
Details of banks' performance in the fourth quarter will continue to emerge this week, starting on Tuesday with a report from Morgan Stanley. During a period when industry trading results appear to have been strong, investors will see whether Morgan Stanley, which has gravitated toward more stable businesses like wealth management in recent years, has benefited. On Wednesday, investors will hear from Goldman Sachs, considered by many to be an industry bellwether. Goldman, which has historically made outsize profits from helping hedge funds and corporations trade and transact, recently introduced an online-lending apparatus, Marcus, to serve typical consumers. The report this quarter may offer a window into its promise. Kate Kelly
CANADIAN ECONOMY
Bank of Canada to Announce Benchmark Lending Rate
When the Bank of Canada announces its benchmark lending rate on Wednesday, few observers anticipate that it will follow the lead of its American counterpart and post an increase. Stephen S. Poloz, the Bank of Canada governor, said last month that compared with the United States, Canada's economy was further from reaching its full capacity, leading to the widespread assumption that the bank's overnight rate will stay at 0.5 percent. It will be the first rate announcement by Canada's central bank since the election of Mr. Trump. Some of Mr. Trump's election promises, notably a conditional vow to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, could help Canada's economy. But if he imposes a border tax on manufactured goods from Canada, the effect would be a significant drag on its export-dependent economy. Any such tax would be particularly problematic for the auto industry. Canada's car manufacturing and car parts businesses have been closely integrated with the United States since 1965, when the two countries agreed to free trade in the sector. Ian Austen
U.S. ECONOMY
Gas Prices Expected to Boost Consumer Price Index
On Wednesday morning, the Labor Department will release its latest reading on the Consumer Price Index. After a 0.2 percent increase in November's index, analysts are expecting a 0.3 percent rise for December, primarily because of rising gasoline prices. The core C.P.I., which strips out the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.2 percent, the same gain as the previous month. While the overall index inched up for a total 1.7 percent over the previous 12 months, the year-over-year rate for the core measure ticked down to 2.1 percent. Consumer confidence has continued to surge since the election. Patricia Cohen
EUROPEAN ECONOMY
E.C.B. Body to Debate Continuing Stimulus Measures
The European Central Bank's Governing Council will meet on Thursday and is likely to debate whether to begin weaning the eurozone from stimulus measures. No big moves in monetary policy are expected, but minutes from the last Governing Council meeting indicate that some members have begun arguing that the bank should begin easing off on its large purchases of government and corporate bonds. Those arguments gained traction in December, when inflation in the eurozone rose above 1 percent for the first time since 2013, bringing the rate closer to the official target of 2 percent. Jack Ewing
OIL INDUSTRY
Oil-Producing Countries to Discuss Price Controls
Ministers from OPEC countries are scheduled to join their counterparts from Russia and Oman in Vienna over the weekend to discuss whether oil producers are complying with the agreement reached last year to cut production to prop up prices, now $56 per barrel for Brent crude. The meeting of the ministerial monitoring committee is part of an effort to convince skeptical markets that the oil exporters are serious about cuts. Saudi Arabia, which is expected to attend the meeting along with fellow OPEC members Algeria, Kuwait and Venezuela, has already said it has cut production below 10 million barrels per day for the first time in nearly two years.

Full text: ¬† As if Donald J. Trump's victory wasn't surprising enough, the economic reaction has been even more stunning. Despite forecasts of a stock market meltdown if he won, the market registered one of its strongest postelection rallies in more than a century. Now the euphoria is spilling into the wider economy, with business confidence skyrocketing and consumer confidence hitting a 15-year high. Much of this excitement is inspired by a growing consensus that Mr. Trump could be the most-business friendly president since Ronald Reagan.
Indeed Mr. Trump's advisers say that over the next decade, their plans for tax cuts and deregulation could push the average annual growth rate back up to 3.5 percent -- the same as during the Reagan presidency. Mr. Trump says the country can grow even faster. His backers dismiss skeptics as defeatists and have insisted there is "no law of nature or economics" that would prevent the United States from reviving the boom of the 1980s.
Only there is such a law. The forces that underlie economic growth have weakened significantly since the Reagan years, worldwide. No nation, no matter how exceptional, can try to grow faster than economic forces allow without the risk of provoking a volatile boom-bust cycle.
The potential growth rate of an economy is roughly determined -- and limited -- by the sum of two factors: population and productivity. An economy can grow steadily only by adding more workers, or by increasing output per worker. During the Reagan years, both population and productivity were growing at around 1.7 percent a year, so the potential United States growth rate was close to 3.5 percent. In short, Reagan did not push the nation's economic engine to run faster than it could handle.
When Mr. Trump and his advisers promise to make America great again, they are in effect envisioning Reagan 2.0, while overlooking how much has changed. In recent years, America's population and productivity growth have fallen to around .75 percent each, generously measured, so potential economic growth is roughly 1.5 percent, less than half the rate of the Reagan era. Any policy package that aims to push an economy beyond its potential could easily backfire -- in the form of higher deficits and inflation.
The population and productivity formula is well known and undisputed -- yet widely ignored amid the current euphoria.
In the last 1,000 years, no economy has ever broken free of the limits imposed by population growth. Before the late 19th century, global population growth did not exceed half a percent, and global economic growth did not exceed 1 percent for any sustained period. Before World War II, population growth increased to 1 percent, and economic growth accelerated to about 2 percent. After the war, the baby boom pushed population growth toward 2 percent, and economic growth rose to nearly 4 percent for the first and only time in world history.
Now, as families around the world have fewer children, global population growth has fallen to about 1 percent. The baby boom has gone bust, and the best any nation can do is contain the economic damage. With the United States population growth rate falling -- last year to the slowest rate recorded since the 1930s -- it is extremely unlikely that any president could juice the economy to grow at a steady 3.5 percent or more over the next decade.
Slow population growth undermines the economy by delivering fewer young people into the work force. Nations can partly compensate by raising the retirement age or admitting more immigrant workers. Mr. Trump, however, has no such plans. His advisers focus instead on bringing back the many American workers who have given up on finding jobs and dropped out of the labor force. But this strategy can have only limited effect. The main reason fewer workers participate in the nation's labor force is not that they are discouraged, but that they are over 55, the age when many people stop working or work less.
In general, commentators who believe the United States can go back to the 1980s focus not on population but on productivity. They argue that Reagan-style tax cuts and deregulation can increase investment in new plants and equipment, and substantially raise output per worker. But productivity is much harder to measure and forecast than population.
Rather than enter that foggy debate, then, let's assume Mr. Trump's team can more than double United States productivity growth to the rate achieved in the Reagan era, 1.7 percent. Given the irreversible fact of slowing population growth, that productivity miracle would still raise the potential growth rate of the domestic economy to only around 2.5 percent. If that doesn't sound so different from 3.5 percent, consider that every percentage point of growth in the domestic economy is worth more than $100 billion -- the difference between feeling pretty good and Great Again.
The nub of the problem here is nostalgia for a bygone era. The postwar world grew accustomed to the rapid growth made possible by the baby boom. Not every country with rapid population growth enjoyed a steady economic boom, but few economies boomed without it. And for most countries, the era of population growth is now over.
The pressure of falling population growth means that every class of countries needs to adopt a new math of economic success, and bring its definition of strong growth down by a full point or more. For developed nations like the United States, with average incomes over $25,000, any rate above 1.5 percent should be seen as relatively good.
Comparing United States growth unfavorably to China's, as Mr. Trump has, makes little sense because poorer countries always tend to grow faster. If your starting income is lower, it's much easier to double it. But slowing population growth is also weighing on countries in China's income class, and for them the baseline for economic success should also be revised downward, to around 4 percent.
The risks of excessive ambition are real. In recent years the actual growth rate of the United States economy has been about 2 percent, which is disappointing in comparison with the 1980s, but far from horrible, given its diminished potential. Often, if a country pushes the economy to grow much faster than its potential, it will start to suffer from rising debts and deficits. Inflation will rise, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates aggressively, which can prompt a recession. This risk is particularly high at a time, like the present, when the United States is already running the largest deficit ever recorded at this stage of an economic expansion.
It will be difficult to persuade people to accept the reality of slower growth. Voters in many countries are already turning to populists who are promising miracles and attempting nationalist economic experiments. The coming era is likely to bring more such experimentation and diversion, but the new math of slower growth will remain.

Full text: ¬† Losing one referendum crucial to the future of Europe may be regarded as misfortune, but, as Oscar Wilde might say, losing two looks like carelessness. Europe's leaders are looking careless after forcing votes in Britain and Italy that went the wrong way, from their perspective, within less than six months.
But you would barely realize that any of that happened, judging by the performance of European markets.
Stocks plunged after the British vote in June to leave the European Union, and had a more muted decline, based on futures prices, after the Italian referendum last month, which strengthened the hand of politicians who want to take Italy out of the euro. Despite those short-term moves, the average fund that invests in European stocks ended 2016 not far from where it started, down 2.4 percent, according to the investment research firm Morningstar, mostly because of a decline in the euro.
Popular exchange-traded funds, like Vanguard FTSE Europe and iShares Europe, lost 3.9 percent and 3.2 percent on the year, although dividend payments meant that shareholders just about broke even.
European government bond yields have soared since the so-called Brexit vote, but they were still down for all of 2016, which means that bond prices, which move in the opposite direction, rose.
The markets are taking political developments in stride, but that may not last. For while the people have spoken, they are not about to pipe down soon; national elections are scheduled this year in the two most important European Union states: Germany and France.
There are populist parties on the ballot in each that could achieve enough support to ruffle the markets. Many Europeans are frustrated with decades of economic stagnation exacerbated by a failure by leaders to confront barriers to prosperity like high taxes and rigid labor markets. With so much at stake, investment advisers warn, it would be foolish to downplay the dangers.
Europe is suffering from "the rise of populist backlash against the establishment," said Paul O'Connor, head of multiasset for Henderson Global Investors, a British company that manages $12.5 billion in assets in American mutual funds. "It feels as if it's in its infancy, and it's going to overshadow the next few years quite significantly."
Populist governments often spend lots of money on infrastructure projects and other programs intended to curry favor with the public, market strategists say. That enhances growth in the short run, and it may provide a notable boost for Europe by accelerating a nascent trend away from the austerity that many governments imposed during the debt crisis a few years ago.
But the spending programs are often financed with borrowed money, something that Europe owes plenty of already, and the damage from the added debt usually outweighs and outlasts the benefits from the growth. Stock buyers lately seem to be focusing on the positive growth factors, while bond sellers are looking further ahead.
"Typically, when a populist government gets elected, one of the first things it does is fiscal expansion" to promote job growth and voter confidence, said Markus Stadlmann, chief investment officer of Lloyds Private Bank. "What happens in the next phase of fiscal expansion is that it's financed by government borrowing." President-elect Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain have proposed programs of one sort or another that would serve this purpose, Mr. Stadlmann said.
When the bill comes due, it is often in the form of higher interest rates or higher inflation. At that stage, he warned, "government is less in control, the deficit deteriorates, government spending is unsustainable, wages fall in real terms and there are capital outflows. That's one of the reasons the bond rout has been really intense."
Another populist impulse that should worry investors is protectionism through tariffs or other curbs on foreign goods. The aim is to protect jobs, but most economists say that constraining trade limits competition and leads to higher consumer prices.
One concern about Brexit is that Britain will lose access to the free-trade zone within Europe. Not only might British merchandise be hit with tariffs, but British companies might also have to pay more for European goods used in manufacturing.
Mr. Stadlmann called the potential for trade disruptions "a big risk."
A potentially (if, at the moment, unlikely) catastrophic economic event that investment advisers say is not accounted for in asset prices is the departure from the European Union, or at least the euro, of the one indispensable member: Germany.
If Germans wanted to leave the union -- say, because of disenchantment with the influx of migrants or the assistance provided to weaker member states -- it could do so. Germany has a more robust economy than its neighbors, and it runs a large current-account surplus with the world outside Europe (more money comes in than goes out), so it could replace the euro with a stronger currency, reducing the country's debt burden, whereas a weaker country that left the eurozone might risk default.
If Germany left, "the E.U. would be severely wounded, at best," said William Porter, global credit strategist for Credit Suisse, adding, "Politics in the periphery is not what's going to drive" developments in Europe. "It's the core."
Mr. Stadlmann expressed similar thoughts, saying, "It's not Spain and Italy that are different in the E.U., it's Germany." He added that he is "not very negative on the E.U. holding together at the moment."
What investment advisers are very negative on when they consider the impact of rising populism is European bonds.
"The re-pricing in government bonds is incomplete," said Mr. O'Connor at Henderson, adding, "It's plausible the bull market in fixed-income has come to an end."
Mr. Stadlmann likewise noted that the reversal of bond yields is "continuing and gaining speed." As for other assets, he encourages being "very, very selective." In particular, he favors stocks of German retailers and real estate companies.
John Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core Equity Fund, is more optimistic on European stocks, especially on multinational companies that are cheaper than rivals based elsewhere and that are comparatively immune to politics.
"If something goes wrong, it doesn't mean Procter & Gamble is going to do better than Unilever selling detergent in Italy," he said.
Unilever is one portfolio holding that illustrates his point. Others are the energy company Total, British American Tobacco, the health care concern Smith & Nephew and Reckitt Benckiser, which makes household goods.
Mr. O'Connor of Henderson prefers market segments that do well when inflation rises, including financial services and economically cyclical sectors like natural resources and consumer discretionary. Among the 10 largest holdings in the Henderson International Opportunities fund on Nov. 30, the last date for which holdings had been disclosed, were the French carmaker Renault, the British insurance company Standard Life and the German tire manufacturer Continental.
But Mr. O'Connor's support for European stocks in general is lukewarm, and with the penchant that European voters have shown for making surprising decisions with ramifications that will remain hard to gauge, taking big investment risks may start to look like carelessness.
"Equities are the place to be, but I think it's going to be a bumpy ride," he said. While he finds that "momentum is gradually improving," the inability to find lasting solutions to what does not work in Europe ensures that there will be "no very powerful bull script."
"There is a more plausible path to growth" in Europe, Mr. O'Connor said, "but it's not enough to dispel some of the political things that are flaring up."

Full text: ¬† Trees don't watch the stock market. Forests keep growing -- and potentially increasing their value -- even when inflation surges or the market swoons.
Big investors, like university endowments and insurance companies, have long allocated money to timberland in places like Oregon's fir-and-spruce forests, Georgia's pine plantations and Appalachia's hardwood groves.
Until a few years ago, retail investors were mostly shut out of this market. The deals were too big, involving thousands of acres and tens of millions of dollars.
That changed over the last 15 years with the introduction of two timber-focused E.T.F.s -- the iShares Global Timber & Forestry E.T.F. and the Guggenheim MSCI Global Timber E.T.F. -- and the evolution of big forest-products companies like Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier. Today, the big timber companies are organized as real estate investment trusts (R.E.I.T.s) focused on managing forestlands, having sold off many other operations.
Ordinary investors can now put money into timber without venturing into the woods. Buying shares of an E.T.F. or a R.E.I.T. won't replicate the benefits of directly owning vast timberlands, but it does enable one to bet on timber.
And there's an old-fashioned option: buying a little woodlot of one's own. That's more akin to a part-time job than a passive investment, but it can yield financial gains.
"If you look at the statistics from the U.S. South, close to two-thirds of the timber harvest is coming from small landowners," said Robert G. Flynn, director, international timber, for RISI, a forest-products research firm.
The E.T.F.s are more diversified than their names suggest. They do own timber companies: Both of them count Weyerhaeuser, Rayonier and Potlatch, the leading R.E.I.T.s, among their holdings. But they also invest in International Paper, packaging-maker WestRock and (in Guggenheim's case) Sealed Air, which is perhaps best known for plastic Bubble Wrap.
"Investors should always buy an E.T.F. with their eyes open and understand that some things that come with the package may not be what they had in mind," said Todd L. Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA, an investment research company.
In terms of returns, the E.T.F.s have looked more like spindly saplings than strong sequoias. The Guggenheim fund failed to match the S.&P. 500's return in the last three calendar years, and the iShares fund failed to do so in 2014 and 2015. Last year, the Guggenheim fund returned 5.7 percent while the iShares fund returned 10.8 percent, compared with 12 percent for the S.&P., including dividends.
William H. Belden III, head of E.T.F. business development for Guggenheim Investments, said his company's timber E.T.F. targeted a subsector. "Timber is a proxy for the economy and how it's doing, especially construction and home building," he said. Some investors want to emphasize timber in their portfolios, and a focused E.T.F. lets them do that, Mr. Belden said.
Owning shares of timber R.E.I.T.s is a more direct, if riskier, way to wager on the woods. These companies own forests across the United States. Weyerhaeuser's roughly 13 million acres approximate the combined area of New Hampshire and Vermont. Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier also have land abroad, the former operating in Uruguay and the latter in New Zealand. Potlatch owns only domestic timberlands.
Daniel P. Rohr, an analyst Morningstar, called the R.E.I.T.s a "pretty good substitute" for timberland ownership "because the assets are the same." In both cases, cash flows from the forest, either through the harvest of logs or the sale of land. He cautioned that whenever people buy shares in a single R.E.I.T. or any individual stock, they're taking on company-specific investment risks, like potential bankruptcy. "If I'm owning a timberland R.E.I.T., it's because I'm bullish on U.S. housing, not because I want to add diversification to my portfolio," Mr. Rohr said.
Campbell R. Harvey, an economist at Duke University, likewise warned that timber doesn't improve a portfolio's likely return or dampen its risk. Commodities, like timber, can help protect investments against "an unexpected burst of inflation," he said. But timber should be part of a broader commodities fund or E.T.F. that may also invest in oil, natural gas, metals and other agricultural products. "It's unwise to think timber alone fills the bucket for commodities," he said. "That's analogous to holding 100 shares of I.B.M. and calling that your equity portfolio."
If investing in a timber E.T.F. or R.E.I.T. can be risky, buying a woodlot is more so. A fire, windstorm or insect infestation can fell your trees (and your investment) in short order. And while timber has produced gains for institutional investors -- the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciary's Timberland Index has returned an annualized average of about 12 percent since 1986 -- small buyers shouldn't expect that.
"I'd say it's not until you get into a $1 million-plus range that you'd start getting into properties that are mostly driven by their investment return," said Jim W. Hourdequin, managing director of Lyme Timber, in Hanover, N.H.
Yet owning a 100- or 200-acre woodlot can make sense for someone who enjoys the land for reasons beyond its financial return, said Tom D. Martin, president of the American Forest Foundation.
Mr. Martin and his sister have 200 acres in northern Wisconsin, and they harvest some of their hardwoods, mainly sugar maples and red oaks, every dozen years or so. The income covers taxes, insurance and road-maintenance costs. In the meantime, their families bunk in the cabin on the property. "The memories and the wildlife are the richest return," he said.
When a novice decides to buy timberland, the first step is hiring a forester, who can help select a plot, said Keith A. Argow, president of the National Woodland Owners Association in Vienna, Va. The forester will evaluate the trees and their quality, the soils and other growing conditions, and even the proximity to potential customers like sawmills, he said. Assuming you find the right property for a good price, you then must manage it. A forester will also help devise a plan for that, including when to harvest and how much.
A management plan can help owners tap into other sources of cash, like leasing hunting rights or participating in state programs that provide tax abatements for, say, improving wildlife habitat or water quality, said Raymond A. Lamberton, president of New England Forestry Consultants. In the Northeast, someone with sugar maples might sell maple syrup. But all of those income streams probably won't add up to big return. "Where you'll make the money on is reselling the land," Mr. Lamberton said.
Daniel E. Crocker, an educational administrator in Bangor, Me., didn't acquire his woodland, in nearby Exeter, Me., to harvest timber. He and his wife, Chris, bought their first 40 acres, in 2002, because they wanted a place to cross-country ski, cut Christmas trees and watch wildlife with their two children.
A few years later, they bought two adjacent parcels, bringing their total holdings to 96 acres and total cost to about $75,000. The land hadn't been logged in 25 or 30 years, and they realized that selling timber could bring in cash, Mr. Crocker said. They've since harvested twice, netting about $15,000, he said. The proceeds have been reinvested in the property, in the form of a trout pond, a road and improvements to the wildlife habitat.
"You're not going to fund your kid's education or retire at 55 this way," he said. "But you can supplement your income."
Though the Crockers are generating cash, the biggest return has been physical and emotional, Mr. Crocker said. Right now, the softwood market, mostly firs and spruce in Maine, he said, "has gone belly up, but I'll still be cross-country skiing on our property on Saturday morning, and we can still make maple syrup there."

Full text: ¬† So close! The Dow Jones industrial average missed the 20,000 mark by a fraction of a point on Friday as Wall Street's stock indexes rose after the government said wages jumped in December. Two other major indexes set records.
Stocks wavered between gains and losses in the morning after the December jobs report, which showed less hiring than analysts hoped to see. Bond yields rose sharply, as the continued job gains should encourage the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates.
Indexes turned higher as investors concluded that the rising wages would lead to more spending on technology and consumer goods. Industrial companies rose as investors hoped for greater economic growth.
At about 12:40 p.m. the Dow peaked at 19,999.63, but later lost steam. It finished up 64.51 points, or 0.3 percent, at 19,963.80. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.98 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,276.98. The Nasdaq composite jumped 33.12 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,521.06.
The small-cap Russell 2000 index slid 4.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,367.28.
Sam Stovall, a United States equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ, said the jobs report had good news for most industries. But he said the report would not push the Fed to raise rates quickly to stave off inflation.
"Consumers are earning a bit more and as a result can spend more," Mr. Stovall said, adding, "people are not too worried the Fed will have to slam on the brakes."
The S.&P. 500 climbed 1.7 percent for the week. That was a marked change from last year, when the index lost 6 percent as the market had its worst opening week in history.
The biggest gains on Friday went to companies that stand to benefit from higher wages and greater spending by consumers. Among technology companies, Facebook rose $2.74, or 2.3 percent, to $123.41 and Apple gained $1.30, or 1.1 percent, to $117.91. Amazon had its second big gain in a row and added $15.54, or 2 percent, to $795.99 while travel website TripAdvisor picked up $1.57, or 3.2 percent, to $50.77.
Industrial companies, which have climbed since the presidential election, also fared well. Machinery and equipment maker Honeywell rose $1.74, or 1.5 percent, to $118.53.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.42 percent from 2.35 percent.
Companies that pay large dividends, including phone companies and real estate investment trusts, lagged as bond yields rose. AT&T gave up 84 cents, or 2 percent, to $41.32 and Crown Castle International fell $1.76, or 2 percent, to $85.50.
Amgen climbed and Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell after a federal court moved to block sales of Sanofi and Regeneron's cholesterol drug Praluent. A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes on two patents that belong to Amgen. Both are costly biotech drugs designed to be injected once or twice a month. Sanofi and Regeneron said they will appeal the ruling.
Amgen stock gained $3.80, or 2.5 percent, to $156.78 while Regeneron slid $22.24, or 5.8 percent, to $358.68 and Sanofi lost $1.18, or 2.8 percent, to $40.32.
The dollar rose to 117.02 yen from 115.56. The euro slipped to $1.0533 from $1.0596.
United States benchmark crude oil rose 23 cents to close at $53.99 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, added 21 cents to close at $57.10 a barrel in London.

Abstract: According to Hiroshige Seko, Japan's minister of economy, trade and industry, Japanese carmakers manufactured about 3.86 million cars in the United States in 2015, up from 1.5 million in the 1990s, and employ about 1.5 million people.

Full text: ¬† TOKYO -- Donald J. Trump sent shivers across the Japanese auto industry on Friday after warning Toyota on Twitter that he would impose a "big border tax" on the company if it built a new plant in Mexico.
It appeared to be the first time he had taken on a foreign company for plans that did not directly involve the United States. The effects were immediate: Shares in Toyota and other carmakers fell in trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday. And Japanese government officials hustled to respond to the rhetoric with soothing reminders of the jobs that the country's auto manufacturers had created in the United States.
"Toyota itself has tried to be a good corporate citizen in the U.S. to date," said Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Daily Gendai, one of Japan's leading tabloid newspapers, declared in a front-page headline that "Trump tries to smash Toyota," and another tabloid, Evening Fuji, hinted at a coming battle with its headline, "Trump vs. Toyota."
Throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would punish American companies that moved manufacturing plants offshore. Soon after his election, he claimed credit for persuading Carrier, the air-conditioner company, to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana that it had previously planned to move to Mexico. And he thanked Ford Motor on Twitter this week for abandoning plans to build a small-car assembly plant in Mexico that Mr. Trump had repeatedly criticized.
Mr. Trump's Twitter post was not entirely accurate. He said Toyota would build a new Corolla factory in Baja, but the company is actually planning to build a new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico. (It already has a factory in Baja.) More significant, Toyota's new plant in Mexico will not replace any of its 10 factories in the United States, where the company employs 136,000 people. The company said it had invested about $21.9 billion in the United States.
"I think being fair is not really in the playbook of the president-elect," said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors.
Toyota builds Corollas in Cambridge, Ontario, as well as in Blue Springs, Miss. No workers in either of those plants will lose jobs, and when Toyota opens the new facility in Mexico, the company plans to shift the Canadian workers to making small RAV4 sport utility vehicles.
According to Hiroshige Seko, Japan's minister of economy, trade and industry, Japanese carmakers manufactured about 3.86 million cars in the United States in 2015, up from 1.5 million in the 1990s, and employ about 1.5 million people.
In response to a question about Mr. Trump's post at a meeting of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, said the company would not change its manufacturing plans in Mexico.
"I don't know yet exactly how, but, regardless of who becomes president, our business is about being good corporate citizens," Mr. Toyoda said, according to a report in Japan Today. "And by becoming good corporate citizens, we are facing the same goal of making America strong. And so we will continue to do our best."
Even though there are only two weeks left to the inauguration, some analysts suggested Mr. Trump might still be in campaign-promise mode.
"At the moment, it's quite unclear whether Mr. Trump actually will push this policy after assuming office," said Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry research firm. "Right now we don't know if he is just bluffing or serious."
But others said some of Mr. Trump's words could spur changes on their own.
"I think the threat alone can actually force companies to behave in a more Trump way," Mr. Okubo said. "So I think regardless of whether the border tax would actually be implemented, I think he will continue to use the threat to pressure companies."
While Mr. Trump singled out Toyota on Thursday, analysts said that his views on trade clearly extended beyond a single company.
"The U.S. is no longer a champion of free trade as a nation," wrote Genki Fujii, visiting professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo, in a column in Evening Fuji.
In comments to the Japanese broadcaster NHK, Takao Shindo, president of Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation, expressed concerns that Mr. Trump would repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement, which affects Japanese manufacturers with plants in Mexico shipping to the United States. These companies "will face a tough situation," Mr. Shindo said.
Some analysts said that once Mr. Trump understood what Toyota was doing with its plants, he might back down.
"Toyota still is expanding local U.S. production in the long term," said Takaki Nakanishi, an independent auto industry analyst in Tokyo. "Not at this point in time, because the U.S. market is near saturation, but over the long term I think there is more capacity to expand the Mississippi plant."
"Job growth is coming in the long term" in the United States, he added. "That's why I think Donald is misunderstanding Toyota's intention."
But Mr. Nakanishi, who was on his way to the annual North American International Auto Show in Detroit, said he was not surprised by Mr. Trump's rhetoric.
"He wants to protect jobs for the United States," he said. "So regardless of the origin of the company, he is just trying to do his job."
Japan has already been rattled by Mr. Trump's election given his campaign criticism of Japanese trade barriers and the cost of United States military support. Prime Minister Abe was the first world leader to land a meeting with the president-elect, and he is seeking a follow-up meeting shortly after the inauguration. His advisers have also been meeting with members of Congress and Mr. Trump's transition team .
Some economists fear that Mr. Trump could return to the trade wars of the 1980s with his policies. Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research, said economic conditions were starting to resemble those of the United States in the 1980s, when the dollar was stronger and the country had a large trade deficit with Japan.
"That was the background for the trade friction between Japan and the United States," Mr. Saito said. Japan's trade surplus with the United States -- about 7.2 trillion yen, or about $62 billion, in 2015 -- is smaller than China's, but it could nevertheless draw Mr. Trump's ire. "I think we have to be very careful. We can't be too optimistic."
Mr. Okubo of Japan Macro Advisors said Mr. Trump might also accuse the Bank of Japan of currency manipulation, given that in inflation-adjusted terms, the yen is at a 40-year low.
"I think this could be just the beginning," Mr. Okubo said. "I think the Japanese government has to be really careful not to act in a way that could be interpreted as manipulating the exchange rate."

Full text: ¬† Last year was one of unusually big surprises for markets -- none more so than the election of Donald Trump. Not only were many money managers and experts dead wrong about his chances, but they were doubly wrong in betting on a big market sell-off in the event he won.
Mr. Trump's victory kicked off a continuing stock rally that left the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up nearly 10 percent by the end of the year, a gain few anticipated a year ago.
But there were other major moves in markets last year. After interest rates hit what some have called a 5,000-year low (but who's counting?) -- and moved into the through-the-looking-glass realm of negative returns in some parts of Europe -- they suddenly reversed course in the United States, rising abruptly toward the end of the year as expectations for growth and inflation soared.
Even more striking was the abrupt turn in oil and commodity prices, which rippled through the economy and markets. A year ago they were in free fall, with no end in sight. But after hitting a 13-year low of less than $27 a barrel on Feb. 11, they ended the year above $53.
A year ago, investors were treating oil and commodity companies like Freeport McMoRan (a stock I highlighted last year) as all but dead. By the end of the year, its stock had more than doubled -- a reminder that contrarian bets, when they prove right, can deliver huge returns.
Again this year, I turned to some prominent investors and market experts who successfully maneuvered through what turned into a treacherous year, asking them for insights into how they did it and what they expect in 2017.
The Contrarian
"I was ridiculed," Anthony Scaramucci told me this week, referring to his early and vocal support for Donald Trump. Unlike many on Wall Street, the outspoken Mr. Scaramucci -- the founder of SkyBridge Capital, host of a revived "Wall Street Week" television show on the Fox Business Channel and author of several books on business and investing -- went all in for Mr. Trump after initially backing Jeb Bush.
Nor did the so-called Trump rally come as a surprise to him. "To put it simply, if you get a 35 percent corporate rate reduced to 15 percent or even 20 percent, you're looking at a 30 percent earnings increase for most companies," he told me as he took a short break from the Trump transition team.
SkyBridge focuses mostly on hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments, but also offers a high-yielding stock mutual fund, the SkyBridge Dividend Value Fund. The fund gained over 15 percent last year, handily outpacing the S.&P. 500.
As a long-only fund -- one that invests in securities for their potential gains and doesn't short stocks, or bet on potential declines -- "we benefited enormously from the Trump win," Mr. Scaramucci said. "It's true that contrarians often get things wrong. But when they get it right, there's a tidal wave. Trump is an example. The conventional wisdom was that he couldn't win. Assets were priced relative to the conventional wisdom. So when he did win, there was huge upside."
Mr. Scaramucci attributes his contrarian view of Mr. Trump in part to the fact he lives on Long island, a stone's throw from his working-class parents, and not among the Manhattan elite, even though he's an alumnus of Harvard Law School and Goldman Sachs. "Everyone in the local bar, from the bluest- to the whitest-collar workers, was voting for Trump," he said.
But Mr. Scaramucci isn't blindly contrarian. He did initially bet wrong on Mr. Bush. "I pivoted," he said. "Everyone makes mistakes. The question is, How do you adapt? All entrepreneurs have to do that."
Now Mr. Scaramucci is in the Trump inner sanctum as a member of the transition team, in a position not only to predict the future, but also to help shape it.
Not surprisingly, he's bullish on the economy and stock market for 2017. He expects the kind of high-dividend, value-oriented stocks his fund invests in (some of its biggest holdings last year were Best Buy, Caterpillar and Boeing) to do well unless "we get to hyper-growth, in which case there will be a rotation to growth stocks."
He said fears of a Trump-induced trade war were overblown. "No one wants a trade war," he said. "All we're calling for are fairer free-trade arrangements around the world."
He added: "We're not coming at this from a position of ideological purity. There are a lot of practical business people in the room. We're not asking if something is right or left, but whether it's right or wrong."
The Socially Responsible Investor
Jerome L. Dodson is the founder and president of Parnassus Investments, and lead portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor Fund. He champions the notion of doing well by doing good. "Certain social and environmental values are really important to us," he told me this week.
His fund doesn't invest in fossil fuels. He seeks out companies that treat their employees well and where turnover is low.
In a highly competitive world where cutthroat capitalists scoff at such values, he's also emerged on top: His Parnassus Endeavor Fund is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods -- a remarkable feat.
Mr. Dodson follows a highly disciplined approach that considers only companies trading at less than two-thirds of their intrinsic value -- a subjective assessment of the actual value of a company, without regard to its market price -- which makes him as much a value investor as a growth investor.
He doesn't worry much about typical macro events or predictions, like the outcomes of presidential elections, the direction of interest rates, or oil prices. He doesn't claim to be much of a forecaster, and said he was surprised that two of his fund's positions -- John Deere, the farm equipment icon, and Cummins, the engine maker -- ended up doing so well last year. "All you can do is look for good companies that are undervalued," he said. "There is no way to know when they're going to go up."
A typical investment for his fund was the chip maker Micron Technology, whose shares had been battered by declining revenue and a global chip glut. Mr. Dodson calculated that Micron shares were trading at just one-third of their intrinsic value when he bought them for an average of $10.80 a share. Equally important, Micron "is a great place to work, with good employee benefits and relatively low turnover," he said. Last year it was the Endeavor Fund's largest holding.
This week it was trading above $22, more than double the fund's average cost. "We are holding onto the stock but wouldn't buy a lot more today," Mr. Dodson said.
Indeed, with the market so high, it's getting hard for Mr. Dodson to find stocks that meet his intrinsic value criteria. Ideally, he'd like to have about 40 stocks in the fund. Currently he has just 25.
"It's fair to say I'm cautious about the coming year," he said. "That's because valuations are so high."
Still, "if Trump can deliver some of what he's talking about, which is tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and the economy starts growing at 3 percent, then earnings will increase, causing the price-to-earnings ratio to come down," he said. "That would make me more positive about 2017."
The Oil Expert
Will resurgent oil prices continue to drive markets?
In all likelihood, yes, said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research for the Goldman Sachs's global investment research commodities team. Mr. Courvalin makes a rare return appearance this year, after pretty much nailing it in his forecast for 2016. Last year he predicted further weakness in oil prices, followed by a recovery by the year's end -- which is just what happened.
This year Mr. Courvalin and his team are predicting $59 a barrel for Brent crude over the next three to six months, with prices stabilizing in the longer term at $55 to $60.
That's because a price much above $60 is likely to cause a supply surge, especially from United States shale producers.
But Mr. Courvalin said investors should focus less on price than on inventory. When high current inventories drive down spot prices, high-cost producers are at a disadvantage, but can still sell forward futures contracts at a premium. More normalized inventories lower or eliminate that incentive and reduce price volatility, which is a benefit to low-cost producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Because of that shift in the forward futures curve, there is upside potential for oil and commodities investors even if price gains in the spot market are modest. "You want to see demand levels that are strong, and we're getting there," he said.
This has little to do with Mr. Trump or his policies. While the president-elect is seen as likely to encourage higher United States energy production, a higher supply will be offset by stronger demand and a stronger dollar. In any event, it's likely to take years for any Trump policies to affect market supply and demand.
"We expect oil demand to be good next year," Mr. Courvalin said. "We're at a point in the business cycle where you can expect to see much better returns from commodities than from equities, based on historical patterns."

Full text: ¬† WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials expect Donald J. Trump's election to result in somewhat faster economic growth over the next several years, but they see little chance of the boom Mr. Trump has promised, according to an account of the Fed's most recent meeting in mid-December.
That is in part because the Fed plans to raise interest rates more quickly if growth accelerates.
For now, however, Fed officials plan to wait and see what happens next, the account said.
"While the Fed signaled that it would likely respond to expansionary fiscal policies with a faster pace of rate hikes, the Fed believes it is too early to embed this into its baseline," Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, wrote on Wednesday following the release of the minutes. "Any real shift in the stance of monetary policy will require more clarity on the stance of fiscal policy."
At the December meeting, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since 2008, citing the continued expansion of the economy and the steady decline of unemployment. The Fed debated and delayed that increase for most of last year, but the account published on Wednesday -- after a standard three-week delay -- described the final decision as uncontroversial.
Officials instead spent the meeting talking about what comes next. Mr. Trump has promised a bevy of major changes in economic policy, including tax cuts and spending increases, reductions in regulation, and restrictions on trade and immigration. As a result, the account said, Fed officials regard both faster growth and slower growth as more likely than before the election, when the economy seemed locked into its longstanding pattern of slow and steady growth.
"The job of conducting U.S. monetary policy has not become any easier over recent months," said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank, referring to the increased uncertainty.
The Fed, led by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman, predicted in December that it would raise rates three times this year. The account said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. Trump and Congress.
"Participants emphasized their uncertainty about the timing, size and composition of any future fiscal and other economic policy initiatives as well as about how those policies might affect aggregate demand and supply," the minutes said. The Fed's policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, has 17 members, 10 of whom cast votes on monetary policy.
The Fed's caution amounts to a bias in favor of growth. The economy is expanding at roughly the pace Fed officials regard as sustainable. The work force is growing slowly as more baby boomers retire, and productivity is rising slowly. Two percent growth may be about as good as it gets.
Ms. Yellen has warned that fiscal stimulus, like a tax cut or a spending increase, could increase economic growth to an unsustainable pace in the near term, resulting in increased inflation. The Fed quite likely would seek to offset such policies by raising interest rates more quickly.
Instead of acting pre-emptively, the Fed is choosing to wait for more information.
But the minutes said officials were concerned about the challenge of communicating their increased uncertainty. They want to be clear that the Fed's prediction about the pace of rate increases depends on its prediction about economic growth. Faster growth will mean faster increases.
The account said Fed officials were confident in their ability to raise rates quickly enough to prevent overheating, seeing "only a modest risk" of a "sharp acceleration in prices."
By holding rates at low levels, the Fed has sought to increase economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking; higher rates reduce the stimulative effect. The benchmark rate now sits in a range from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, still very low by historical standards.
"Consumers have no reason to panic about the rate hike last month, or even about additional rate increases in 2017," said Alan MacEachin, chief corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. He noted that the last rate hike would add $1 to the monthly payment on a $5,000 credit card balance.
The economic forecast prepared by the Fed's staff for the December meeting anticipated that Mr. Trump's election would result in "slightly higher" growth over the next several years. It said a likely increase in fiscal stimulus would be "substantially counterbalanced" by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, which would reduce exports of American goods and services.
Several Fed officials reported that Mr. Trump's election had increased optimism among business executives in their districts. "Some contacts thought that their businesses could benefit from possible changes in federal spending, tax and regulatory policies," the minutes said.
The minutes also noted, however, that some executives were concerned about the negative impact of proposed policy changes. In a recent interview, John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said many executives in his district, which encompasses the western United States, worried about the potential impact of restrictions on immigration and on foreign trade, both of which have been important drivers of regional growth.
Businesses across the country also reported increased difficulty in hiring qualified workers, the minutes said. The unemployment rate fell to just 4.6 percent in November. The lack of readily available workers could further limit the benefits of a fiscal stimulus.

U.S. Trade Deficit Is Up; Jobless Claims Are Down

Full text: ¬† A drop in United States exports last month pushed the country's trade deficit in goods higher, while the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week in a positive sign for the labor market.
The two reports were released on Thursday and suggested that when Donald J. Trump becomes president next month, the labor market will probably be at roughly full strength and international trade could weigh on the economy.
In an initial estimate that did not include trade in services, the Commerce Department said the United States exported $1.2 billion less in November than in October. Imports rose by $2.2 billion during the month. The full trade report for November is due on Jan. 6.
Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays in New York, said it appeared that "net trade will again be a drag" on fourth-quarter economic growth.
The report also showed an increase in retail and wholesale inventories in November, which could temporarily bolster economic growth.
Mr. Trump campaigned on promises to reduce America's trade deficit and bring back jobs that had moved abroad to countries with lower manufacturing costs. Working against him could be a stronger United States dollar weighing on American exporters. The trade deficit for goods widened by $3.4 billion in November to $65.3 billion.
The dollar has surged about 5 percent since Mr. Trump won the Nov. 8 presidential election, as investors bet that wider budget deficits under his presidency could cause higher inflation and more interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve. On Thursday, the dollar eased.
Separately, initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended Dec. 24, the Labor Department said. It was the 95th straight week claims were below 300,000, a threshold associated with a healthy labor market. That is the longest stretch since 1970, when the labor market was much smaller.
The department said in a statement that there were no special factors affecting claims last week, although estimating the data can be more difficult around holidays.
The claims report also showed that the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 63,000 to 2.10 million in the week ended Dec. 17, the highest since September.

In a Savage Year in Venezuela, Even Crime Fighters Are Killers

Full text: ¬† CARACAS, Venezuela -- The soldiers barged into Rafael Gonz√°lez's home as his mother and girlfriend looked on. It would be a routine questioning, they assured him and others arrested that night, before hauling them off to a dark military barracks.
What happened next was anything but normal, Mr. Gonz√°lez recalled.
He was stripped naked, kicked and struck with the butt of a rifle, he said. Soldiers hung him by his arms from the ceiling with a cord, demanding to know whether he belonged to one of the gangs that had terrorized his neighborhood in Venezuela's rural area of Barlovento with robberies and kidnappings.
"They told me: 'We are going to play a game, Little Rafael. It is called electrocution,"' said Mr. Gonz√°lez, who is 17. "They shocked me on the abdomen, the neck, the penis, the butt, the back, my hands -- everywhere. I felt like my eardrums would explode."
On Oct. 21, five days after he was arrested, Mr. Gonz√°lez, bruised and terrified, was released, he said.
He would soon realize that he was among the lucky ones. Weeks later, the bodies of 13 others arrested in similar raids were found, most at the bottom of a mass grave. Many had been tortured, according to the authorities.
"Imagine how I felt as a mother," said Petra P√©rez, whose 18-year-old son, Anthony Vargas, was found dead, his body partly decomposed. "I'd had a little hope that my son was still alive, that my son was not in that lot."
The killings at Barlovento, which government investigators have condemned as a massacre of innocents, have pointed to a troubling culprit in the country's rising violence: its own security forces.
Venezuela has long suffered from one of the world's highest crime rates. But the nation's economic crisis, which has upended everything from its hospitals to its food supply, has deepened the misery and criminality.
Killings have risen to 28,479 this year, the highest number ever recorded in the country, according to the Venezuelan Violence Observatory, an independent group that tracks violence.
Armed gangs have established a tight grip over neighborhoods, with many Venezuelans turning to crime as inflation shrivels their wages and jobs become harder to find.
Some of these armed groups were once anchors of government support in the barrios. These so-called colectivos started as community groups and were eventually armed by members of President Hugo Ch√°vez's movement, enabling their rise as militant defenders of the government.
But after Mr. Ch√°vez died in 2013 and Venezuela's economy began to spiral downward, some of his loyal street enforcers increasingly turned to crime, breaking with the government and joining a constellation of armed groups that kidnap, steal and kill.
In a bid to restore order, the government has turned to the institution it trusts the most: the military. Throughout the country, the armed forces have become Venezuela's law keepers, engaging in commando-style raids that sometimes take on the profile of urban warfare.
"It has become more militaristic and more repressive," Margarita L√≥pez Maya, a Venezuelan political scientist, said. "Anyone can be caught."
Ms. L√≥pez said that the victims of the crackdowns were often the impoverished civilians who needed protection the most, and that the violence was a reflection of the severity of Venezuela's decline.
"We are walking on the path to a failed state," she said. "It will come to a point where no one is in control."
Tarek William Saab, a government ombudsman investigating the Barlovento case, said the victims were innocent men and women subjected to "the most unfortunate cases of cruelty and inhuman denigrations of torture."
The authorities have said 18 soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel and a captain, had been arrested in connection with the killings. All will be brought to justice in Venezuela's courts, Mr. Saab said, but he argued that the massacre was not part of a broader pattern of abuse.
Human rights groups and survivors of other raids strongly dispute that, saying the military has killed hundreds of people, many of them innocent.
Representatives of Venezuela's military and national guard did not respond to requests for interviews. But one organization, Provea, which tracks deaths in raids by monitoring official statistics and local news reports, said more than 600 people had been killed this year in episodes like the one in Barlovento, up from about 245 in 2015.
The New York Times interviewed 10 victims of raids and members of their families who detailed a similar pattern of abuse. They described arbitrary detentions, violent interrogations and killings by security forces.
Rosinis Morales, 39, recalled a raid on Oct. 6 in her barrio in the capital, Caracas, saying security forces broke into her home and ordered the men inside to go with them. She said they had shot and killed her husband, Jos√© Alberto Gordillo, 32; her brother, Heller Morales, 34; and a family friend, Johnary Cardozo, 23. The government later said nine people it described as criminals had been killed in the raid.
Asdrubal Granados, 51, said his 25-year-old son, Yanderson, had been arrested during another raid that day in a different part of Caracas. Mr. Granados said the family had tried to find the son, who had previously been convicted of a robbery, by calling police stations, to no avail. He was later found in the morgue, shot to death, Mr. Granados said.
On Aug. 17, 2015, security forces raided the home of Joel Antonio Torrealba and his son √Ångel Joel, 15, around 2 a.m. on Margarita Island on the country's central coast, according to the father. He said they had shot his son dead while he had been in bed. "He was just sleeping," Mr. Torrealba said.
Mr. Torrealba said he, his wife and his daughter, 21, had been arrested, only to be released in an abandoned lot far from their homes, with no explanation.
But none of these raids have resulted in the same kind of public accusations as in the Barlovento case, in which both victims and the authorities have cited beatings, torture and homicide.
It all began on television. On Oct. 10, N√©stor Reverol, the country's powerful interior minister, released a video in which he stood before soldiers and armored vehicles, announcing that he would send nearly 1,400 members of the security forces into six municipalities.
"It's an important deployment that will run the entire axis of Barlovento," said Mr. Reverol, a military general who is wanted in the United States on charges that he aided drug traffickers.
Barlovento, a stretch of the coastal plains east of Caracas, is a cluster of towns and villages where the capital's urban areas give way to farms cultivating cacao. But rising crime had shattered the countryside idyll. Residents said they were terrorized by armed gangs who regularly robbed farmers, carjacked vehicles and held villagers for ransom.
Few suspected there was anything to fear from the arrival of the soldiers, whom they believed had been sent to help them.
"It was the first time something like this had happened to us," Ms. P√©rez said.
Mr. Gonz√°lez, the 17-year-old who said he had been shocked with electricity, was among the first arrested on Oct. 16. He had been spending the evening burning the family's trash nearby and had just returned home when, he and his mother said, two soldiers entered the living room and forced him into a jeep.
A five-day ordeal began, he said. At the military barracks, he said, he was stripped naked and photographed. Around 10 p.m. he said, he and five others were taken to a jail where the soldiers tied his arms together, threw him on the ground and stomped on his head.
"If you scream, it will only get worse," he said one of them had warned.
They stripped him naked again and blindfolded him, he said, and then poured buckets of water onto his face, asking him if he had anything to confess.
"I knew nothing," he said. "I was just a quiet kid and didn't run around with anyone."
In another room, with his eyes covered, he was given electric shocks for about 40 minutes as the soldiers continued to press him about Barlovento's gangs, he said.
"'If you are going to kill us, do it now, but don't keep us suffering this way. Not even dogs would do this,"' he recalled pleading.
Around the same time, security forces were catching others in Barlovento.
On Oct. 15, Carlos Marchena, a 20-year-old who worked at his family's trucking company, was holding a small party when soldiers entered and forced the men to kneel, according to his widow, Mayerlin Pita. They took the men's identification cards and loaded them into trucks. It was the last time she saw her husband alive, she said.
The next day, Luis Sanz, a 30-year-old mechanic, was arrested by soldiers, members of his family said. Seven or eight soldiers in ski masks raided the house, his sister Alimirely Sanz said, pushing everyone aside except for Mr. Sanz. Luc√≠a Espinoza, his mother, said she had been thrown to the floor in the melee.
"'You mothers are the accomplices; you go about aiding and abetting,"' Ms. Espinoza said the soldiers had told her before taking her son away.
The Sanz and Marchena families, along with those of many other people who had been detained, began gathering at a military barracks known as El Caf√©, where they believed their loved ones were being held. For three days, they brought food, water and clothes, handing them to the soldiers in the hope they would pass the items along to the detainees.
But on the third day, Ms. Pita said, she realized something had happened.
The soldiers who had been accepting the food started telling relatives that they had no registry of their loved ones, or that they had been taken to a different facility, relatives said.
On Oct. 18, Mr. Reverol, the interior minister, returned to television to say the operation was a success. Security forces had dismantled what he called a dangerous criminal group called "The Anthony" and found a safe house being used for kidnappings.
"We are keeping our promise to keep advancing, to continue liberating the people," he said.
A month passed with little news. Then the bodies appeared.
On Nov. 25, the authorities said, a tip led them to two corpses buried next to a highway. Ten more were found in a mass grave near a town in the area.
The families of those who had disappeared went to the morgue immediately. The smell of death hung in the air as national guardsmen kept order, allowing families to enter, one at a time.
Ms. Sanz said she had identified her brother by pictures of his teeth and clothes, because officials told her that the body was too badly decomposed to be viewed. Ms. Pita said a DNA test had confirmed that her husband, Mr. Marchena, was also dead.
Ms. P√©rez identified her son, Mr. Vargas, through a number of tattoos, one on his chest.
"There is no doubt," she said.
The death certificates of Mr. Sanz and Mr. Vargas, reviewed by The Times, said they had been killed by stab wounds to the neck. Mr. Marchena was killed by a shot to the head, according to his family.
"They killed them like animals," Ms. P√©rez said. "That's how my son died."
Mr. Saab, the government investigator, said the events were evidence that the military should not be involved in fighting street crime.
"The army doesn't have the preparation or the professional capacity to do crime prevention," he said. "They're not trained to do it."
On Nov. 29, the remains of Mr. Vargas and Mr. Sanz were buried in their town, Capaya, along with two others. Much of the town came out for the procession, as the coffins wound past mud homes and a barracks where a dozen soldiers stood guard -- the same one where the men were originally taken.
The caravan stopped several times as mourners looked out from their homes. Several motorcycle taxi drivers drove circles around their coffins, in a sign of respect.
"Anthony, my son, stand up and dance to your music," Ms. P√©rez screamed.
Moments later, the coffins were lowered into the ground.

Full text: ¬† A measure of consumer confidence shot to its highest level in more than 15 years in December as Americans saw more strength ahead in business conditions, stock prices and the job market following the election of Donald J. Trump as president.
A separate report showed that house prices continued their steady recovery in October, although a spike in borrowing costs after Election Day could present a headwind to sustained home value gains.
The Conference Board said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 113.7 this month from an upwardly revised 109.4 in November. That topped estimates in a Reuters poll for a reading of 109.0, and was the highest since August 2001.
Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement that the gain in confidence was entirely because of rising expectations, as consumers' assessments of current conditions dipped, and was led by surging optimism among older Americans. The private economic forecasting group's Expectations Index hit its highest mark since December 2003.
The modest pullback in current conditions "still suggests that economic growth continued through the final months of 2016," Ms. Franco said. "Looking ahead to 2017, consumers' continued optimism will depend on whether or not their expectations are realized."
Mr. Trump will inherit an economy that by most assessments is on solid footing, even if growth has been subdued for much of President Obama's term. The unemployment rate recently dropped to 4.6 percent, its lowest since the Great Recession ended, and the economy has added an average of 188,000 new jobs a month over the past 12 months.
With benchmark 10-year Treasury yields around their highest in more than two years, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United States has hit its highest point since May 2014, potentially posing a risk to the recovery in housing prices, which continued apace in October.
The S.&P. CoreLogic Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 5.1 percent in October on a year-over-year basis, up from a downwardly adjusted 5 percent climb in September and matching the estimate of a 5.1 percent gain from a Reuters poll of economists.
"Home prices and the economy are both enjoying robust numbers," said David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices.
"However, mortgage interest rates rose in November and are expected to rise further as home prices continue to outpace gains in wages and personal income," he said. "Affordability trends do not suggest an immediate reversal in home price trends. Nevertheless, home prices cannot rise faster than incomes and inflation indefinitely."
Home prices in the 20 cities rose 0.6 percent in October from a revised 0.5 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis, the survey showed, outpacing expectations of a 0.5 percent increase.
The biggest year-over-year gains were recorded in the West and in Texas, including gains of more than 10 percent in the Seattle and Portland areas. Prices in the Denver and Dallas markets increased by more than 8 percent from a year earlier.
The smallest annual gain was in the New York metro area, where prices rose just 1.7 percent.

Abstract: The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec. 14 reinforced the inflation fear, and cited the strengthening labor market and inflation as it increased the federal funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to between 0.50 and 0.75 percent. [...]the recent market moves have already primed the pipeline with disinflationary forces that will greet the new administration.

Full text: ¬† As the United States economy braces itself for the presidency of Donald J. Trump, many have been quick to point out that the policies of the incoming administration may have the unintended consequence of fueling inflation.
They argue that the prospect of a large fiscal stimulus as the economy is approaching full employment may create shortages in the labor market. Additionally, substantial infrastructure spending could spark a rally in commodity prices, lifting the cost of producing manufactured goods.
The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Dec. 14 reinforced the inflation fear, and cited the strengthening labor market and inflation as it increased the federal funds target rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to between 0.50 and 0.75 percent. Of course the Fed should be alert to threats to price stability. But the current concerns could very well be overdone.
Already, markets around the world have reacted to the prospect of these policies. But the sharp rise in the exchange value of the dollar along with a marked increase in bond yields is hardly the backdrop associated with rising inflation in the United States. While many market participants point to the sharp increase in interest rates as evidence of rising inflationary expectations, that does not square with a stronger dollar and lower prices in precious metals and relatively stable energy markets. The Fed announcement of three expected rate increases in 2017 is a more aggressive stance from the central bank, which should serve to further strengthen the dollar.
Contrast that with Britain, where the pound's sharp depreciation after June's Brexit vote has revived inflation, which hit a two-year high in November.
An examination of a similar period in American history when United States policy resulted in large fiscal stimulus through military spending and tax cuts, along with lighter regulation, shows that supply side shocks are not necessarily inflationary. The Reagan revolution of the early 1980s resulted in a stronger dollar and a meaningful, if not painful, decline in precious metals and energy prices. Inflationary pressures waned in the years subsequent to the 1980 election, even as monetary policy became increasingly accommodative.
While it would be foolhardy to say history will repeat itself, I am reminded of the quip that it often rhymes.
Experience plainly shows that fiscal stimulus, especially when monetary policy is on a more restrictive path, results in higher real rates of interest and a stronger currency. Higher real rates help to tamp down inflation while a stronger dollar reduces import prices.
No one should be surprised that markets are already adjusting to reflect a stronger domestic economy, but this does not necessarily lead to higher core or headline inflation. As a matter of fact, the recent market moves have already primed the pipeline with disinflationary forces that will greet the new administration.
The incoming administration's focus on deregulation and support for domestic energy production strengthens the argument against a sudden surge in prices.
Wages will probably be a different story. As the economy approaches full employment, wage pressures are expected to mount. Tax cuts, infrastructure spending, deregulation and support for domestic energy production all point to a powerful fiscal elixir which will increase demand for labor and encourage increased consumption.
Americans and the world should welcome a surge in wage growth. Income inequality in the United States has become as pronounced as at any time since the Gilded Age. Political and social instability is challenging policy makers as populist uprisings spread from one region to another.
As wages rise, consumer prices are likely to remain restrained. The resulting increase in real earnings along with increased job availability should foster an environment which encourages public confidence in political institutions by reducing economic inequality across classes and creating more opportunities for all.
There are many who would have preferred a different path. Some of their concerns are well founded. Policies that result in trade wars or mass deportations would undermine the success of a Trump economic revolution. These policies would not only create severe headwinds to growth but could result in recession or worse. These pitfalls must be avoided.
If the Trump economic plan is successfully carried out, the Fed is likely to find itself raising rates more rapidly than the market is currently expecting, not because inflation is rising but because the natural rate of interest is rising in line with higher potential output.
As the Fed moves to adjust for faster growth, shorter-maturity Treasurys will be more vulnerable to further price declines while the risk of a sudden spike in inflation will diminish. Bond yields are not rising because of increasing inflationary expectations; they are rising because of an increase in anticipation of real growth. Given that inflationary fears are overblown, longer-term bond yields are probably close to their highs for this cycle, and the environment will remain positive for riskier assets like high-yield bonds, bank loans and stocks.

Abstract: Constraints on the expansion of foreign weapons sales are "due, in part, to the weakened state of the global economy," wrote Catherine A. Theohary, a national security policy specialist at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.

Full text: ¬† WASHINGTON -- The United States again ranked first in global weapons sales last year, signing deals for about $40 billion, or half of all agreements in the worldwide arms bazaar, and far ahead of France, the No. 2 weapons dealer with $15 billion in sales, according to a new congressional study.
Developing nations continued to be the largest buyers of arms in 2015, with Qatar signing deals for more than $17 billion in weapons last year, followed by Egypt, which agreed to buy almost $12 billion in arms, and Saudi Arabia, with over $8 billion in weapons purchases.
Although global tensions and terrorist threats have shown few signs of diminishing, the total size of the global arms trade dropped to around $80 billion in 2015 from the 2014 total of $89 billion, the study found. Developing nations bought $65 billion in weapons in 2015, substantially lower than the previous year's total of $79 billion.
The United States and France increased their overseas weapons sales in 2015, as purchases of American weapons grew by around $4 billion and France's deals increased by well over $9 billion.
The report, "Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 2008-2015," was prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress, and delivered to legislators last week. The annual review is considered the most comprehensive assessment of global arms sales available in an unclassified form. The report adjusts for inflation, so the sales totals are comparable year to year.
Constraints on the expansion of foreign weapons sales are "due, in part, to the weakened state of the global economy," wrote Catherine A. Theohary, a national security policy specialist at the Congressional Research Service and author of the study.
"Concerns over their domestic budget problems have led many purchasing nations to defer or limit the purchase of new major weapon systems," she added. "Some nations have chosen to limit their purchasing to upgrades of existing systems and to training and support services."
Russia, another dominant power in the global arms market, saw a modest decline in orders for its weapons, dropping to $11.1 billion in sales from the $11.2 billion total in 2014. Latin American nations, in particular Venezuela, have become a focus of marketing for Russian arms, the study found.
China reached $6 billion in weapons sales, up from its 2014 total of over $3 billion.
Among arms manufacturers that also are NATO allies, Germany has found success in marketing naval systems to the developing world, while Britain has done the same with warplanes, according to the report.
The most significant overseas weapons sales for the United States last year included new agreements with Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar and South Korea.
Over all, the largest buyers of weapons in the developing world in 2015 were Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Pakistan, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. After the United States, France, Russia and China, the study found that the major global arms suppliers were Sweden, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Britain and Israel.

Full text: ¬† Quinn Finds Her Next Act
In her Big City column last Sunday, Ginia Bellafante wrote about the work Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker and mayoral candidate, is doing on the homelessness issue. Readers responded on nytimes.com. Comments have been edited for length and clarity.
This is the new norm in U.S. politics. Every time a woman runs and loses, it's sexist. Ms. Quinn lost in the primary because of her political shady deal with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to allow him a third term completely contrary to the will of the people as expressed in two referendums on term limits. Then she tried to pass it off as a courageous act on her part to save the city from economic ruin. Please. Her contempt for the electorate should hopefully disqualify her from ever again holding public office.
Jeff S, Brooklyn
Christine Quinn lost the election not because she's a woman, and not because she's gay. She lost it because she struck the electorate as a dishonest, graceless automaton. A distant third placement in that election speaks for itself.
What's infuriating is Ms. Quinn's attempt to now use the currently "crazy" zeitgeist that brought us Donald Trump as the timing for her political resurrection. Things have changed with her because she's now described as "animated?" What exactly does that mean? And as for that rear-mirror view of her loss as a "preamble" to Hillary's, spare me, and everybody else still slightly sane, the pseudo sociopolitical mumbo jumbo. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, "Christine, you're no Hillary Clinton."
Jessica Burstein, New York
The reporting coming out ahead of the upcoming mayoral election, you would think that Mayor Bill de Blasio invented the homeless crisis in our city. This problem has been festering for 30 years, only now the real estate industry is out to get de Blasio because he appointed a Rent Guidelines Board that gave rent-stabilized tenants a long-deserved respite from rent increases that were far higher than the rate of inflation and our flatlined incomes since the financial crisis.
Steve725, New York
Homelessness in New York is a function of the high rents, which is a supply issue caused by the rent stabilization laws that are abused by well-to-do families. Over 50 percent of apartments are being subsidized by the rest of taxpayers, most of them occupied by people with summer homes. A ridiculous situation in the hands of corrupt politicians. And then you have the slumlords who abuse the system and become landlords on the backs of taxpayers. Ms. Quinn, a product of the system, isn't the one to fix it. We need an outsider.

Easing Dementia
On The New York Times's Facebook page, readers also responded to Andy Newman's article about the use of robotic cats to provide therapy to dementia patients:
>
My dog and I were a hospice pet therapy team for many years. I can tell you from firsthand experience, as both a cat person and a pet therapy provider, that you would never get most cats to allow this contact with a strange human. Especially a human that might be holding a little too tightly or too long. Therapy cats are rare for a reason.
Carolyn Borkowski
This is good for long-term holding. They can cuddle for hours. They can sleep with them. Real cats get impatient if you don't pet them the right way. This is great.

Full text: ¬† Donald J. Trump and his cabinet nominees have called for the elimination of several federal departments. History suggests it may not be easy.
Cabinet departments are sometimes combined or split, but rarely removed.
Over the last half-century, efforts to dismantle cabinet departments have been successful only once, when the Post Office Department was replaced with the United States Postal Service. But presidential campaigns often call for the elimination of departments. Those pledges are typically meant to signal that candidates oppose the status quo, said George C. Edwards III, a political science professor at Texas A&M University. "When people actually get in there and find out what it does," he said, "they realize there's not a reason to get rid of it."
The Education Department budget fluctuates, based partly on presidential politics.
Just a year after President Jimmy Carter made the Education Department a stand-alone agency, Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign platform included a plan to dismantle it. Once elected, President Reagan proposed moving the student loans and Pell grants to the Treasury Department and education civil rights enforcement to the Department of Justice. The idea was heavily opposed by teacher unions and received little support in Congress. Mr. Trump has said that he would like to cut the "power and reach" of the department. His nomination of Betsy DeVos, who hasn't called for its elimination, suggests a shift in mandate. She has pushed to privatize public education and could use some of the billions of dollars currently sent to school districts to support a wider range of schools, including private, religious and online schools. More than half of the current budget goes to student loans and Pell grants; Mr. Trump proposed a new income-based repayment plan for student loans during the campaign.
The Department of Energy's budget is also often in the cross hairs.
President Reagan also tried to dismantle the Department of Energy, and he reduced the staff by more than 2,000 people at the start of his term. But his plan to shrink government control of energy markets and have the Commerce and Interior Departments assume more responsibility failed in Congress. George W. Bush's first nominee for energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, had co-sponsored the Department of Energy Abolishment Act in the Senate in 1999, but during his confirmation hearing in 2001, he said that he no longer supported the bill. During his campaign for president, Rick Perry, Mr. Trump's nominee for energy secretary, said he would do away with the department. Mr. Trump also said he would eliminate all federal spending on climate change, much of which is spent on technology development at Department of Energy laboratories. The department spends about two-thirds of its budget on nuclear weapons.
The Environmental Protection Agency's goals may change, rather than its funding.
Since President Reagan slashed the E.P.A.'s budget in 1981, it has stayed relatively flat. The agency's mission is to set and enforce environmental policy (rather than distribute federal money, as the Department of Education does). So partisan disputes tend to focus on how it does that, not on its funding level. Under President Reagan, the E.P.A. reassigned lawyers from the enforcement division and referred fewer cases to the Department of Justice; during President Obama's tenure, the agency issued expansive regulations like the Clean Power Plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Trump's nominee, Scott Pruitt, may work to weaken enforcement instead of eliminating the agency. As Oklahoma's attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. several times and worked closely with the oil and gas industry to push back against federal pollution regulation.

Full text: ¬† MOSCOW -- President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said on Friday that a statement by Donald J. Trump, the American president-elect, that the United States should expand its nuclear abilities was not a surprise because he had said the same thing during the election campaign.
Asked about the American election, Mr. Putin, who has made no secret of his distaste for Hillary Clinton, said her defeat was a "humiliation" for the Democratic Party.
The Russian president, speaking at his annual marathon news conference, also said that Russia would continue to modernize its armed forces, including nuclear weapons, but he added that the level of spending would diminish somewhat in coming years.
He said Russia was not seeking a new arms race or to develop new nuclear warheads, but was instead seeking ways to improve its armaments so that they could pierce missile defenses. The deployment of NATO missile defense systems in countries near Russia has been a sore spot between Moscow and the West.
Mr. Putin said again, as he had on Thursday, that the Russian armed forces were now strong enough to repulse any attacker. He suggested that officials from the Obama administration had overreacted by pointing out that the Russian military was far weaker than that of the United States.
"Of course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case," Mr. Putin said toward the beginning of the news conference, which typically lasts four hours or more.
"As for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his election campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general," he added.
Mr. Putin said that any new Russian nuclear weapons would stay within the limits of existing treaties. Although Moscow and Washington have taken to rattling sabers more than in the past, experts said that the architecture of previous nuclear arms treaties has so far held.
In 2007, Russia spent 2.7 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, Mr. Putin said, but the figure grew to 4.7 percent in 2016. Russia spent about $52 billion on its military in 2015.
He said that the proportion would gradually decline to 2.8 percent again by 2019. "This will not have an impact on our plan to increase our defense capabilities," he said.
The budget cuts are being forced by an extended recession, though Mr. Putin tried to put a positive spin on that, as well. He said the overall economy had contracted 3.7 percent in 2015 and probably a further 0.5 to 0.6 percent in 2016, but that some sectors were expanding, like agriculture, which grew 4 percent.
He said this had happened despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis. In retaliation, Russia has banned imports of many Western dairy and other agricultural products.
Some analysts have suggested that the growth in agriculture was nothing exceptional.
Mr. Putin also noted other positive signs, including that inflation and capital outflows had slowed, but he said that there were still problems, including a drop in personal income for most Russians.
On the American election, Mr. Putin said the Democrats were trying to blame their defeat on external factors like Russia. He said his popularity among American Republicans was not personal, but a reflection of their worldview.
"It means that a significant part of the American people have the same perception about how the world should be developing," he said. "It is good that people support us in this, in terms of traditional values." He said it was a good basis for improving Russian-American relations.
Mr. Putin mocked recent statements by President Obama and others that former President Ronald Reagan would be turning in his grave over the support for Russia and for Mr. Putin among Republicans.
If anything, he said, it would be former presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt who would be turning in their graves over the losses suffered by the Democratic Party.
Mr. Roosevelt united the country, Mr. Putin said, but "the current administration divides it."
The Obama administration has accused Russia of interfering in the American election, not least by hacking the computers at the Democratic National Committee and releasing emails embarrassing to Mrs. Clinton.
Although Mr. Putin did not publicly endorse either candidate during the campaign, his administration made its preference for Mr. Trump clear. Among other reasons for disliking Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Putin has blamed her for the street demonstrations in Russia in 2011 and 2012 that greeted his return to the presidency, citing her endorsement of the protests while she was secretary of state to accuse her of fostering them.
Asked directly about statements by Mr. Obama that he had warned Mr. Putin to stop hacking in the United States, Mr. Putin said that he would not reveal the contents of a private conversation.
But he repeated statements by Mr. Trump that anyone could have done the hacking, including someone in the United States sitting on his couch. And Mr. Putin repeated his usual response to questions about the hacking, saying the main point was the contents of the emails and the light they shed on the Democrats' activities and plans.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Growth Rate Last Quarter Was Fastest in Two Years

Abstract: The gain in gross domestic product -- the economy's total output of goods and services -- came from added strength in consumer spending, business investment and the government sector, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.

Full text: ¬† WASHINGTON -- The United States economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter, its fastest pace in two years and more than the government had previously estimated. The growth spurt, however, is not expected to last, as consumers and businesses pull back.
The gain in gross domestic product -- the economy's total output of goods and services -- came from added strength in consumer spending, business investment and the government sector, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. The government had previously estimated the quarter's annual growth rate at 3.2 percent.
The G.D.P. report "paints a picture of a healthy consumer, likely fueled by ongoing gains in employment, modest increases in wages, and solid balance sheets," said Michael Gapen of Barclays.
The faster growth in the third quarter was a sharp pickup from the tepid annual growth rates of 0.8 percent in the first quarter and 1.4 percent in the second.
Still, growth is expected to slow to an annual rate of roughly 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, a reflection, in part, of reduced consumer spending and business stockpiling.
Growth for all of 2016, economists say, is likely to be around 1.5 percent. That would be a decline from 2015 and would be the weakest performance since the economy shrank 2.8 percent in 2009 at the depths of the severe economic downturn. In the current recovery, which began in mid-2009, growth has averaged just over 2 percent, the weakest expansion in the post-World War II period.
During the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump criticized the sluggish pace of growth, saying that his economic policies would accelerate annual growth to 4 percent or more. To do that, Mr. Trump said, he would eliminate many government regulations, increase spending on the nation's aging infrastructure and slash taxes.
Most economists do not believe that 4 percent growth is realistic, given a chronic slowdown in productivity and a work force that is growing slowly.
Most forecasters expect growth of around 2.5 percent next year, though they say those estimates could rise if Mr. Trump wins congressional support for much of his economic program. Stock markets have surged since Mr. Trump's victory, partly because of optimism that his proposals would help growth and corporate profits.
The report on Thursday was the government's third and final estimate of G.D.P. growth for the third quarter. The upward revision mainly reflected stronger consumer spending, which grew at a 3 percent annual rate, more than the 2.8 percent pace estimated a month ago. Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity.
The Federal Reserve last week increased a key interest rate by a quarter-point, just the second increase in the past decade. Fed officials said that they could gradually raise interest rates as they near their goals for full employment, and inflation increases by about 2 percent a year.
In public comments last week, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, made no predictions about Mr. Trump's economic program. But Fed officials forecast that they would raise rates three times in 2017, up from their previous forecast of two.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said on Thursday that orders from businesses for industrial machinery, steel and other big-ticket items rose 0.9 percent in November, after a 0.2 percent increase in October. Those gains follow a 1.5 percent drop in September.
Orders for all big-ticket factory goods fell 4.6 percent, mostly because demand for commercial aircraft, a volatile category, dropped. Excluding transportation-related goods, orders rose 0.5 percent.

Full text: ¬† LOS ANGELES -- "The Great Wall," an epic fantasy film that cost at least $150 million to make, opens with Matt Damon fleeing on horseback through red stone formations in Northwest China. A snarling swarm of razor-toothed green monsters is hot on his heels.
One fast plot twist later, he stands atop a monumental stone wall, one guarded by thousands of Chinese warriors in dazzling uniforms. Cut to generals with furrowed brows fretting in Mandarin as the monsters come tumbling over a hill.
Will their megastructure do its job?
The same question, more or less, faces "The Great Wall" as it begins its global theatrical release. The movie, filmed entirely in China, was engineered not just as escapist entertainment but also proof that the Chinese film industry can serve up global blockbusters too -- that event films can rise in the East and play in the West. The last Chinese-language film to become a breakout hit in North America was "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," which awed with its martial arts and stunt work and took in a surprising $180 million in 2000, after adjusting for inflation.
"If this doesn't work, then I don't know what will," said Stanley Rosen, a political-science professor at the University of Southern California who has studied China's efforts in recent years to emerge as a moviemaking superpower. "The film addresses a lot of the previous issues that China has faced as it's tried to internationalize its film industry, like language and the lack of internationally known stars."
"The Great Wall" passed its first test.
Released in Chinese theaters on Friday, the movie collected a strong $67 million in tickets over its first three days, according to the Beijing box office tracker Ent Group. The film's total after five days was $82 million, as much as "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" collected in China during its entire run.
"Step 1 went really, really well," said Thomas Tull, chief executive of Legendary Entertainment, which produced "The Great Wall" with Universal Pictures, China's Le Vision Pictures and China Film Group. "Given market conditions, I feel like it was a big success," Mr. Tull added, noting that the Chinese box office has lately been in a funk, with growth slowing sharply, partly because of a glut of fantasies.
Even so, "The Great Wall" remains a long way from the box office threshold Legendary ultimately hopes to hit in China -- $200 million or so for its full run -- and some analysts were underwhelmed by turnout given the marketing push the film received. Before its release, expectations for the film had become as considerable as the epochal structure for which it was named. Marketing efforts included two trailers, three music videos, 60 online video ads and stunts in 260 shopping malls owned by the Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese conglomerate that bought Legendary for $3.5 billion in January.
"It's too soon to say," Mr. Tull said, when asked whether he thought the film, which drew mixed reviews in China, would be profitable.
The crucial test lies ahead. "The Great Wall" arrives in North American multiplexes on Feb. 17. Movie executives say prospects in the United States and Canada come down to one question: Are ticket buyers ready to embrace a film that is very much Chinese, even if it does have an American star in a lead role?
"It's daunting," said Peter Loehr, a Legendary executive in Beijing and one of the film's producers. "I do hope it works, but I don't know."
The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, even weighed in on "The Great Wall" this week, publishing a commentary following what it called "lively online criticism" of the film. "Even if it is successful in overseas markets, the road on which Chinese culture goes out to the world is bound to be bumpy," the article said.
Directed by Zhang Yimou, known for films like "House of Flying Daggers" and for orchestrating the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, "The Great Wall" finds Mr. Damon in ancient China as William Garin, a bedraggled European mercenary. Garin and his partner (Pedro Pascal, known for Netflix's "Narcos") soon discover that the wall was not, as history tells it, erected to keep out invading nomads, but rather to protect against the mythical flesh-eating creatures that rush the wall every 60 years in an attack on humanity.
Garin spends much of the film learning about the Chinese culture of self-discipline and sacrifice. Meanwhile, there are astounding action sequences as the wall is defended (similar to the siege of Minas Tirith in "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"), and a subplot involving sneaky Westerners, who covet China's "black powder."
Chinese stars include Andy Lau, Jing Tian and the pop idol Lu Han. Disney-owned Industrial Light & Magic handled the visual effects. To appeal to international audiences, about 80 percent of the dialogue is in English. (Those portions were subtitled in Chinese for the Chinese run; Western audiences will get a version that is 20 percent subtitled in English.)
Mr. Zhang's extreme close-ups, pacing and use of 3-D effects that come straight at viewers are likely to stand out as a departure from Hollywood's usual cinematic language, but Ms. Jing's character may best sum up the cultural needle the movie tries to thread. Her general is at once the supreme leader (in keeping with a recent trend in Hollywood movies to depict women as every bit as tough as men) and strikingly demure when not in battle (something the filmmakers felt made her more viable to Eastern audiences).
Trying to appeal to everyone often warps the result. Movie executives, citing past experiences, say that audiences leave thinking that something was off the mark, even if they aren't quite sure what.
"The biggest challenge in the film was integrating the two cultures," Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing this month. "We knew it would not be enough to rely on the novelty of the film's Chinese elements to attract Western audiences. So we spent a lot of energy and time working on the story."
Part of the plot -- the inclusion of a white hero -- has incited controversy. Some critics, judging the film by its trailers, accused Mr. Zhang of giving Mr. Damon a part that should have gone to an Asian actor, a practice known as whitewashing. In truth, the role was written specifically as non-Asian. Mr. Damon was sought for the part because he is a proven box office star around the world, including in China.
"There are five major heroes in our story and he is one of them -- the other four are all Chinese," Mr. Zhang said in a statement when the outcry erupted online in August.
"The Great Wall" will attract additional scrutiny when it arrives in the United States because it comes as some lawmakers question China's increasingly aggressive efforts to use motion pictures to promote itself. But the movie, if successful, could foster more collaboration between Chinese and American filmmakers. It qualified under Chinese rules as an official "co-production," a coveted governmental status that entitles non-Chinese film companies to a greater share of the ticketing revenue. Co-productions receive 43 percent of after-tax ticket sales, compared with 25 percent for typical Hollywood imports.
American studios have struggled to meet the co-production requirements, which mandate the inclusion of "Chinese elements," a nebulous umbrella term that touches on everything from the film's financing to its casting, story line and shooting location.
"The Great Wall" was filmed in locations across China, including in Qingdao, the eastern port city where the real estate-turned-entertainment behemoth Dalian Wanda is building an $8 billion movie facility and tourism complex to attract American productions.
"I have a feeling that Qingdao is going to be calling a lot of us back over the next few years," Mr. Damon said in an interview. "It's pretty incredible."
But does he think "The Great Wall" will be a hit on his home turf?
"I'm not really the target audience for the movie," he said. "It's really fun and spectacular in the true meaning of the word. But, then again, I don't know how to predict what that will mean."

Full text: ¬† One of the basic themes of Donald J. Trump's election campaign was that the United States was being ripped off by foreign countries and that his administration would reduce our trade deficit.
Yet the budget policies he is now proposing would be sharply at odds with that goal. By advocating an expansive budget through tax cuts and infrastructure spending, Mr. Trump's plan would most likely lower national savings and propel the United States dollar ever higher, creating the very conditions to widen rather than to narrow the trade deficit.
Mr. Trump seems to be overlooking a matter of basic arithmetic. While a country's trade balance is the difference between a country's exports and imports, it is also the difference between the amount it saves and invests, as can be derived from rearranging the components of a country's aggregate demand equation. If a country saves more than it invests, it will run a trade surplus. Conversely, a country that saves less than it invests will run a trade deficit.
Seemingly oblivious to this basic math, Mr. Trump is proposing far-reaching and seemingly unfunded cuts in both corporate and household tax rates. Worse yet, he is simultaneously proposing large increases in both public infrastructure and military spending.
He is doing so in the unrealistic hope that these policies will cause the economy to accelerate from its present 2 percent growth rate to between 3 and 4 percent. And he is counting on such faster economic growth to generate additional tax revenue.
Should a significant pickup in economic growth not materialize, the net effect of these tax cuts and public spending policies will almost certainly lead to a significant widening of the budget deficit and to a corresponding decline in public savings. That, in turn, would in all probability lead to a significant widening of the trade deficit as the country's overall savings rate would decline.
A further basic weakness of Mr. Trump's budget proposal is that it would add stimulus to the economy at the very time that the economy is at or very close to full employment. That policy is bound to raise concerns about inflation and to push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than it is currently contemplating in order to meet its inflation target.
One of the distinguishing characteristics of the global economy right now is the divergence of monetary policy stances among the world's major central banks. The United States Federal Reserve is now embarked on a path of raising interest rates at a time when the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are still engaged in aggressive rounds of quantitative easing in an effort to kick-start their moribund economies.
Forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster pace than it is presently contemplating will only serve to widen the difference between it and the other major central banks. This would more than likely put further upward pressure on the dollar.
Since the November election, the United States dollar has already appreciated significantly, to its strongest level in the past 14 years. The last thing that the country needs if it is to reduce its trade deficit is a further dollar appreciation. Such an appreciation would make our exports across the board more expensive in foreign markets and make our imports cheaper in United States dollar terms. That would hardly seem to be the way to reduce the country's trade deficit.
A real concern is that, as the United States external deficit widens because of a reckless budget policy approach, Mr. Trump will double down on his interventionist and protectionist approach to trade matters. As we saw in his recent intervention with the Carrier Corporation, this seems to be his preferred way of dealing with trade issues.
If he does go down that path, he will risk inviting trade retaliation by our trade partners, which could lead the global economy down the road to the beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the 1930s. As surely even Mr. Trump must know, trade wars are no solution.

Full text: ¬† For years, the little-known New York hedge fund Platinum Partners stood out for double-digit investment returns that rivaled some of the biggest names in the industry.
It turned out that those returns were too good to be true, according to federal prosecutors.
Federal agents on Monday arrested Mark Nordlicht, a founder and the chief investment officer of Platinum, and six others on charges related to a $1 billion fraud that led the firm to be operated "like a Ponzi scheme," prosecutors said. It is one of the largest such fraud cases since Bernard L. Madoff's investment firm unraveled in 2008.
David Levy, the firm's co-chief investment officer, was also among those arrested in the morning by agents in Texas, Manhattan and New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City. The men were charged with securities fraud and investment adviser fraud, according to an unsealed indictment filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel civil case.
Platinum tapped prominent families and foundations within the Orthodox Jewish community in New York to fuel high-stake bets on payday lenders, oil companies and even the terminally ill. But prosecutors said these investments and the firm's performance were misrepresented by its executives. Ultimately, Platinum took in new money in order to pay longtime investors who wanted their money back, something the firm's executives called among themselves "Hail Mary time."
"As investors sought redemptions, the defendants engaged in numerous improper measures in an attempt to meet redemption requests, including taking out high-interest rate loans, commingling monies among funds and raising money from new investors through fraudulent misrepresentations," said Andrew J. Ceresney, the director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division.
Located a few blocks from Central Park, Platinum, founded in 2003, made a splash early on with some of its investments. In one bet, the firm sought to profit from the death of terminally ill patients by investing in variable insurance payouts. As part of the scheme, a rabbi in Los Angeles sought out hospice patients to get their personal details that could be used to buy insurance payouts in their names.
A company that Platinum set up to make the investments was fined by the S.E.C. in January 2015. "We definitely were exploiting a loophole, but it was fully vetted by legal counsel," Mr. Nordlicht said in an interview with Bloomberg later that year.
In other bets, Platinum misled both investors and auditors -- sometimes brazenly. In December 2012, for example, executives misrepresented to auditors the value of Black Elk Energy, an oil and gas company controlled by Platinum, valuing it at $283 million, prosecutors said. In fact, there had been an explosion on a Black Elk platform in the Gulf of Mexico the month before that had caused the deaths of three workers, injuries to other employees and an oil spill. Black Elk no longer exists.
Jeffrey Shulse, who worked at Black Elk and is named in the government's indictment, denied the charges. "Mr. Shulse's indictment is a clear case of overreaching," said F. Andino Reynal, Mr. Shulse's lawyer, adding that his client was "confident that once a jury has had a chance to hear all the facts, it will exonerate him of any wrongdoing."
Lawyers for the defendants Mr. Nordlicht, Daniel Small, Uri Landesman, Joseph Mann and Joseph San Filippo did not respond to a request for comment. Michael Sommer, a lawyer for Mr. Levy, said he looked forward to "clearing David Levy's good name."
As recently as March, Platinum had $1.7 billion of investor money, as of a March regulatory filing. For years it reported a strong performance -- with annual average returns of 17 percent.
As recent as last year, Platinum said it made gains of 8 percent, a strong performance in a year when the average hedge fund lost 0.85 percent, according to the Hedge Fund Research Composite Index, a gauge of industry performance.
Platinum began to have trouble extracting investor money when some of its obscure investments started to sour, according to prosecutors. From 2013 to 2016, the firm could not stanch the losses in certain funds and the investor requests to withdraw money, so it began to move money between funds in what Mr. Nordlicht called a "big stew," the indictment said.
Things seemed to reach a crisis point in June 2014, prosecutors said. "It can't go on like this or practically we will need to wind down....this is code red," Mr. Nordlicht wrote to Mr. Landesman, a managing director at Platinum, at the time.
Yet investors remained in the dark about the firm's precarious liquidity position. A month later, when an investor emailed to ask about the reliability of Platinum's reported performance figures, Mr. Landesman replied, "The numbers are all kosher, they have had verbal input every month."
Investors grew restless. By March 2015, the total amount they requested to withdraw from the firm exceeded $83 million. Eventually, executives decided to pay some ahead of others, prosecutors said.
"Platinum Partners purported to be a standard-bearer in the hedge fund industry," said Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York. "In reality, their returns were the result of the overvaluation of their largest assets." This inflation led to Mr. Nordlicht and others "operating Platinum like a Ponzi scheme, where they used loans and new investor funds to pay off existing investors," Mr. Capers added.
The arrests on Monday were part of an investigation among several government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Postal Inspection Service. In June, Murray Huberfeld, a former Platinum executive, was arrested. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud.
Soon after Mr. Huberfeld's arrest, agents from the F.B.I. and the Postal Inspection Service raided Platinum's New York offices. Faced with mounting pressure from federal investigators, as well as an investigation by the S.E.C., Platinum liquidated its main hedge fund.
For some at Platinum, there was already a sense late last year that government investigators were closing in on the firm. In an email exchange, Mr. Nordlicht, Mr. Landesman and an unnamed principal partner in Platinum discussed fleeing to Israel, according to prosecutors.
"Don't forget the books," the unnamed partner wrote. "Assume we are not coming back to ny."

Full text: ¬† KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo -- In a mansion along the Congo River, with a collection of expensive watches, expensive motorcycles and a chimpanzee in a cage, Joseph Kabila, the president of this vast and troubled country, should be packing up.
Instead, he is digging in.
His second term is up in a few days, the Constitution forbids him to run for a third, millions of people are threatening to mobilize against him, and still Mr. Kabila shows no signs of leaving.
The Democratic Republic of Congo is already one of the poorest, most volatile nations on earth. Countless young people are out of work, and the security forces are brutal and loosely controlled. Add to that dozens of armed groups operating in the hinterlands.
Many people here are terrified that if Mr. Kabila clings to power at all costs, as some of his counterparts across Africa recently have, Congo could explode.
But the paradox is that Mr. Kabila may not especially want to stay in power. Instead, former confidants say, he refuses to give up for a simple reason: He is afraid -- for his family, for his safety and, not insignificant, for his wealth.
"He doesn't have an exit plan," said Martin Fayulu, an opposition politician.
It is an old problem with a new twist.
According to forensic investigators, mining executives and officials in his own government, Mr. Kabila has looted millions of dollars in public assets.
Recent troves of documents shared with The New York Times -- whose authenticity has been verified by current and former Congolese officials -- reveal a string of suspicious bank transfers totaling $95.7 million, dubious mining rights sales that have generated millions more and possible money-laundering schemes involving a bank executive widely described as Mr. Kabila's adopted brother.
'Labyrinth of His Own Making'
Authoritarian leaders used to be able to steal with impunity. But today, a whistle-blower with an iPhone can be a dangerous foe. The post-Panama Papers, WikiLeaks world is an uncomfortable place for an autocrat.
In a sense, Mr. Kabila is trapped. As Jason K. Stearns, the author of a well-regarded book on Congolese politics, said, "He's in a labyrinth of his own making."
And cornered, he has begun to lash out.
Mr. Kabila's forces and their supporters have arrested journalists, jailed opposition politicians, firebombed opposition headquarters and assassinated a Catholic priest who held workshops on the Constitution and its limit of a two-term presidency. Scores of anti-Kabila protesters have already been shot dead, turning more people against Mr. Kabila each day.
Opposition leaders are now threatening to flood the streets with millions of protesters on Tuesday, the day Mr. Kabila is supposed to be out of office.
Seeing chaos on the horizon, top Western officials have shuttled in and out of the capital, Kinshasa, trying to draw the reclusive Mr. Kabila out from his riverside residence, where he lives under heavy guard. This year, Secretary of State John Kerry and other high-level American officials have met with Mr. Kabila several times.
But several people who know the president well said Mr. Kabila was increasingly isolated, moody and antisocial. They said he had been keeping irregular hours, becoming irritable with his staff members and staying up late to play Sony PlayStation 4 or race his fancy motorcycles up and down the dark boulevards of Kinshasa to blow off steam.
As Mr. Kabila plays for time, the information on corruption keeps streaming in, from many directions.
In September, an American hedge fund, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group, admitted in a federal plea agreement to participating in a bribery scheme involving mineral deals and high-ranking Congolese officials. The officials were not named in the plea agreement, but several analysts said the information published by the Justice Department made it obvious that one was an adviser who was extremely close to Mr. Kabila -- possibly one of the only men Mr. Kabila really trusted -- before he died in a plane crash in 2012.
No Exit Plan
Other investigations are in the works, and the American government is trying to delicately warn Mr. Kabila that his chances of being prosecuted for corruption would be lower if he left now.
"No one can guarantee no prosecution, but in the real world, there are priorities," said Tom Malinowski, an assistant secretary of state. "I don't think one of them would be going after the former president of Congo who did the right thing."
Still, no one has come up with an exit plan. Even the Western diplomats tasked with appealing to Mr. Kabila, pleading with him not to drive his country off a cliff, admit they are at a loss for what to offer.
Mr. Kabila is still relatively young, 45, and if he is worried about keeping his wealth and avoiding jail after he leaves office, how does one guarantee that? All he has to do is look at Charles Taylor, Liberia's former president, who agreed to leave office under intense international pressure and was soon apprehended, prosecuted and sentenced to decades in prison.
And what about his safety? Mr. Kabila has made many enemies in nearly 16 years as the leader of one of the world's most violent states. As one mining executive who used to be close to Mr. Kabila argued, it is not as if the American government is going to assign SEAL Team 6 to guard him in perpetuity, even if he asks.
Mr. Kabila is not your typical strongman. He was driving a taxicab in Tanzania not long before he was thrust into power. His father, a smuggler turned rebel leader turned president, was assassinated in 2001. The only person top advisers could agree on to lead the country, which was in the midst of a very confusing civil war, was the elder son, Joseph, at the time 29.
Unlike Isaias Afwerki, the president of Eritrea for the past 23 years, or Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (30 years), or Robert Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence (36 years), Mr. Kabila has never tried to build a cult of personality. He is shy, mild and a careful listener. Confidants say he never wanted to be president and tried to turn down the job.
Two Watches at a Time
But over the years, former aides and investigators say, he has amassed a fortune and developed a taste for the finer things. A former colleague said he sometimes wore two expensive watches at the same time -- a Rolex and a Patek Philippe -- one for each wrist.
Mr. Kabila and his family own a network of homes and huge farms across Congo, sweeping up thousands of acres, analysts and former aides said. They also said Mr. Kabila was most at peace around animals. He is an avid breeder of cows, and he kept a menagerie of chimpanzees, a dik-dik (a small antelope), birds of prey and parrots at his house in urban Kinshasa. A recent visitor said at least one chimp still lived there, screeching hoots from a cage as guests arrive.
But these days, the stress of the job seems to be eating at him. Mr. Kabila has put on weight. The few times he was spotted in public he had huge bags under his eyes.
More whistle-blowers are coming forward, which may make him even less likely to quit if he believes that he can best protect himself and his assets by intimidating or neutralizing critics with his security forces.
One Congolese government official said that on numerous occasions he had been instructed to take wheeled suitcases, stuffed with $100 bills totaling more than $7 million, to a minister's office for "state's use." The money came from a government-controlled company. The official, along with several others, said it would be too dangerous for anyone but Mr. Kabila or his family to steal that blatantly.
The Panama Papers -- leaked confidential documents from a law firm in Panama -- revealed that Mr. Kabila's twin sister, Jaynet, using a different name, owned an indirect share in the nation's largest mobile phone operator and through a company registered in Niue, in the South Pacific.
Current and former Congolese officials described very complicated and suspicious business dealings involving foreign partners, joint ventures and lucrative mining concessions. One such deal recently attracted the attention of Britain's Serious Fraud Office, which is investigating Congo's cut-rate sale of mining rights through an Israeli tycoon who is a friend of Mr. Kabila's. Because of Mr. Kabila's lack of transparency, the International Monetary Fund halted a loan program worth hundreds of millions of dollars that Congo desperately needed.
"It's clear that the Kabila family has personally profited from the exploitation of natural resources and the manipulation of banks and state-owned companies," said Sasha Lezhnev, a manager at the Enough Project, a nonprofit organization that recently reviewed thousands of pages of documents and conducted more than 100 interviews on corruption in Congo.
'Not a Robber, Not at All'
In the past two decades, Congo's wars over minerals, politics, ethnicity and land have killed millions, destabilizing a big chunk of the continent.
But its history of ill-gotten gains goes back much further. Mobutu Sese Seko, Congo's strongman during the Cold War, was one of Africa's most notorious thieves, though back then it was easier to get away with corruption.
None of the documents to emerge recently have Mr. Kabila's signature on them, though the names of top aides and companies of Mr. Kabila's associates are all over them.
Lambert Mende, the chief government spokesman, said Mr. Kabila was "not a robber, not at all."
"He has no account in Europe or the U.S.A.," Mr. Mende said. "He doesn't have a single apartment outside of Congo. This is all storytelling."
The most suspicious documents to emerge recently include a string of bank transfers to different accounts at different banks with the notation that they were "advance tax payments" from G√©camines, a struggling state-controlled mining company, for Congo's central bank. Starting late last year, the transfers reveal anomalies like instructions that $8 million be withdrawn from the teller -- in cash -- on behalf of the central bank.
"That makes no sense," said a former employee of Congo's central bank who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he could be killed if he was identified. "We don't get cash from a commercial bank. We import our own cash. We have a service in Switzerland that does that."
Analysts at the Sentry, an investigative arm of the Enough Project, said that during the time of the supposed G√©camines transfer of $95.7 million to the central bank, the central bank's foreign reserves actually dropped -- to $1.17 billion from $1.47 billion -- pushing up inflation and causing issues for Congo's economy. At the same time, Mr. Kabila's government drastically cut spending on health care and the few services it provides.
Sentry analysts said they were curious how G√©camines, a company with endless management problems, would have that much cash on hand for advance tax payments when thousands of employees had not been paid in months. Documents showed that G√©camines lost $82.9 million in 2014. Mining executives said bigger, more profitable companies always paid much less in advance taxes.
'So Difficult and Volatile'
Some of the money apparently stolen in Congo may have moved through the American financial system, Sentry analysts say, and they are calling on the United States Treasury Department to take stronger measures to combat suspicious transactions from Congo.
This past week, the Treasury Department sanctioned two Congolese officials close to Mr. Kabila, saying the officials were undermining democracy.
Across Africa, term limits established years ago when democracy's brand was stronger have been systematically dismantled, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Burundi exploded last year when its president plowed ahead with his plan to stay in office for a contentious third term.
In October, Mr. Kabila's aides struck a deal with a few second-tier opposition groups to delay the next presidential election until 2018 -- the election was supposed to be held this year -- but Congo's major opposition groups, representing tens of millions of frustrated people, rejected that. Opposition leaders said they would never accept Mr. Kabila's staying in office beyond Dec. 19.
Congo's political opposition, unlike Burundi's, is not heavily armed. Most analysts say it would be difficult to overthrow Mr. Kabila. The security forces are still loyal to him, partly because he has made sure that soldiers and intelligence officers have been relatively well paid, no matter the dire straits of the national economy.
In a recent meeting with delegates of the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Kabila remained characteristically cagey. According to a confidential United Nations report, he said that it was the "sovereign right of the Congolese people to decide in the next three or so years to amend the Constitution," implying he may be considering another run.
Mr. Stearns, one of the better-known Congo analysts, argues that Mr. Kabila does not know how to get out of the corner he has put himself into.
"That's what makes this so difficult and volatile," Mr. Stearns said.
"My best guess," he added, "is we're headed into turmoil for several years to come."
