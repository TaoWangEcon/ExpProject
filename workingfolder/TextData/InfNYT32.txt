Full text: WASHINGTON -- A weakening Chinese economy, underlined by a further slowdown disclosed on Friday in Beijing, is starting to pose a headache for United States officials and the two presidential campaigns, as Chinese companies shift toward a greater reliance on selling to the American market.
A real estate bust in China and sweeping layoffs in the country's construction sector, together with slower growth in retail sales and declining exports to Europe, have left one area that is thriving: exports to the United States.
But the result is a swelling American trade deficit with China in an election year. The bilateral deficit widened 10.2 percent in the first five months of this year compared with the gap in the period a year earlier, and preliminary data suggest that it widened further in June.
The deficit could swell even more as November approaches. The weakness of the Chinese economy is holding down its demand for American exports, even as Chinese exporters show a laserlike focus on selling to the American market.
The Obama administration has stayed silent about the Chinese export surge to the United States because it does not appear to stem from an explicit policy drafted in Beijing. The American market has become more appealing for many companies in China because of slowing demand in their home market and from Europe, as opposed to government subsidies or other policies.
But a call by China's premier, Wen Jiabao, on Tuesday for increased investment spending has stirred some concern in Washington. American officials had been pressing China to expand consumption instead of building ever more factories that could someday produce even more exports.
"I think it's worrisome because if China is going to do its tried and tested way of responding to an economic slowdown by increasing investment, it just sets the stage in the future for increased trade frictions," said an American trade official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.
Exporters like the Shenzhen Ezoneda Technology Company, a manufacturer of electrical extension cords and computer cables in southeastern China, are finding an attractive market in the United States and are becoming better able to supply it. After struggling as recently as late winter to recruit enough workers, exporters are now able to run assembly lines flat out as companies supplying the domestic Chinese market lay off workers or slow their hiring.
"It is easier to find workers now than in February, it is easier to find workers this year compared to last year," said Nick Tan, the sales manager at Shenzhen Ezoneda.
At the same time, slumping demand for steel and other commodities by construction companies and other businesses supplying the Chinese domestic economy has made it cheaper for exporters like Shenzhen Ezoneda to buy materials.
China announced on Friday that its economy grew at an annual rate of 7.6 percent in the second quarter, down from 9.5 percent in the period a year earlier. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of falling growth and the weakest officially acknowledged growth rate since the first quarter of 2009, at the bottom of the global financial crisis.
But the Chinese government also said on Friday that nationwide electricity production actually dropped 0.9 percent in June from a year earlier. That could be a sign of a much deeper slowdown. Lombard Street Research in London estimated China's annualized growth rate during the second quarter at a little less than 4 percent.
The Obama administration portrays its China policies as a success over the last three and a half years, pointing to a 7.2 percent appreciation in the renminbi against the dollar since President Obama took office. This has made Chinese exports costlier in the United States and American goods more affordable in China.
Add in faster inflation in China than in the United States over most of this period and the renminbi's real appreciation was 10.2 percent through May.
But the renminbi has slipped 1 percent against the dollar from its peak on May 2. The difference in inflation rates has also reversed in recent months, with producer prices in China down 2.1 percent in June from a year ago, even as they rose 0.1 percent in the United States.
The administration has stayed silent during the renminbi's modest retreat, not least because there is little evidence that the Chinese government has played much role in it. The renminbi has fallen less against the dollar than most emerging-market currencies in recent weeks.
Chinese companies have been slower in recent months to convert the dollar receipts from their exports back into renminbi, reducing demand for the Chinese currency. The renminbi has seemed less likely to appreciate and many companies are seeking ways to diversify their operations and investments overseas.
China's central bank has actually been restraining what would otherwise be a faster fall in the renminbi. It has done so by frequently pegging the start of each day's trading at a stronger level against the dollar than the close of the previous day's trading.
Chinese economic weakness, coupled with rising exports, poses challenges for presidential campaigns. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has portrayed China as an economic powerhouse that bends trade rules and has called for labeling China as a currency manipulator and challenging it on trade policies from his first day in office.
Asked about the latest signs of economic weakness in China, Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, responded in a statement on Friday that, "Regardless of China's economic performance, Governor Romney will insist from Day 1 that they put an end to their intellectual property theft, market restrictions and currency manipulation."
The Obama administration faces constant pressure from labor unions to take a more confrontational stance toward China on trade. But the unions, generally supportive of his re-election bid, have stayed largely quiet in recent weeks.

Full text: Producer prices for finished goods unexpectedly rose in June for the first time in four months, reflecting an increase in food costs.
The 0.1 percent gain in the producer price index came after a 1 percent decrease in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 70 economists called for a 0.4 percent fall. Excluding volatile food and energy, the so-called core measure increased 0.2 percent as projected.
Also Friday, a survey showed confidence among consumers unexpectedly declining in July to the lowest level this year as Americans grew more pessimistic about their finances.
Weak growth in the United States may also limit price pressures through the production pipeline, reinforcing Federal Reserve policy makers' projections that inflation is likely to be subdued.
"Producer prices will be pretty much contained in coming months as commodity costs have come off," Kevin Cummins, an economist at UBS Securities in Stamford, Conn., said before the report. "That's likely to persist. There are worries about global growth and demand in the U.S. is also slowing."
Economists' estimate for producer prices ranged from an increase of 0.2 percent to a decline of 1.3 percent.
Compared with the same month a year ago, companies paid 0.7 percent more for goods, matching the 12-month gain in May as the smallest since October 2009.
The core index increased 2.6 percent in the 12 months ended in June, the smallest year-to-year gain since June 2011.
The gains in the producer price index were led by a 0.5 percent increase in food, reflecting the biggest increase in meat prices since July 2011, the report showed. Energy costs dropped 0.9 percent from May, which included a record 2.1 percent drop in residential electricity.
About 70 percent of the increase in the core measure was attributed to a 1.4 percent advance in the cost of light motor trucks, the biggest in a year.
Producer prices are one of three monthly inflation gauges reported by the Labor Department. The import price index fell 2.7 percent in June, the biggest plunge since December 2008, a report showed Thursday. Prices excluding fuel fell 0.3 percent, the most in almost two years.
The cost-of-living index, the broadest of the three measures, may have been little changed last month, economists predicted ahead of the July 17 data.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment dropped to 72 this month from June's 73.2 reading. The gauge was projected to rise to 73.5, according to 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The weakest quarter of hiring by companies in two years along with stock market volatility tied to Europe's debt crisis threaten to hold back the household spending that accounts for about 70 percent of the economy.
"The labor market has been pretty slow to recover, house prices are still low and there's a lot of nervousness about what's going on in Europe" and Washington, said Michael Hanson, a senior United States economist at Bank of America. "The economy looks like it's slowing."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials agreed at a meeting in June that unemployment would remain elevated for another five to six years, but most did not regard that as reason enough to expand the Fed's efforts to stimulate growth, according to an official account published on Wednesday.
The American economy is stuck in a new kind of normal, somewhere between crisis and prosperity, and economic policy makers are struggling to define their role. The Fed, which has responded forcefully each time the economy tips back toward recession, remains divided over whether it should try with similar urgency to return the economy to prosperity.
The account of the June meeting suggested that Fed officials now viewed the risk of standing still, so clear in a crisis, as smaller and harder to measure, while the uncertain consequences of action are weighing heavily on their willingness to expand the central bank's aid campaign.
"A few" of the 12 officials who vote on Fed policy thought further measures, like bond purchases, "likely would be necessary to promote satisfactory growth," the account said. But several others were willing to consider such steps only if economic conditions deteriorated. This was more than the Fed said after its last meeting in April, but less than many investors were hoping to hear.
The Fed expected slow growth this year, but the account -- released after a standard three-week lag -- said officials were still disappointed that "a variety of indicators showed smaller gains than had been anticipated" in recent months.
Among the drags on the economy cited in the document were "slow growth or even contraction in some major foreign economies, ongoing and prospective fiscal tightening in the United States, modest growth in household income, and -- despite some recent signs of improvement -- continued weakness in the housing sector." The Fed announced after the meeting on June 19-20 that it would continue until year's end with an effort to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by rearranging its portfolio. The expected impact is modest, however. The account said it would put "some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative."
The document, a summary rather than a transcript, offered little clarity about the Fed's next steps, a point underscored by the diversity of conclusions that analysts who follow the central bank quickly drew from the text. Some saw clear evidence that action was imminent; others drew the opposite lesson.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, was among the analysts who chose a position in the middle, writing to clients that "officials are edging closer to launching a third round of large-scale asset purchases, but it won't become a reality unless the recovery loses even more momentum."
The Fed began the year on the sidelines, its officials united in the view that they had done enough. The central bank has already said that it plans to hold short-term interest rates near zero until late 2014, at least. It has amassed a vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds to further reduce long-term rates.
But growth has once again fallen short of the Fed's expectations, and the lack of public clarity is a consequence of the internal debate among the 19 officials who participate in the discussions of the Federal Open Market Committee.
The case for additional action is easy to explain. The economy is not growing fast enough to reduce unemployment, a point underscored last week by a government report that employers added only 80,000 jobs in June. Moreover, inflation has fallen below the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as healthy.
"We are falling short on both our employment and price stability mandates and I expect that we will make only very limited progress toward these goals over the next year," John C. Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said Monday.
Mr. Williams, who favored asset purchases last year before backing off earlier this year, said that it was again time to consider additional action, and that any new round of purchases should include mortgage securities.
But proponents of additional action have not yet won the support of the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who controls the decision-making process. Mr. Bernanke has not offered a clear account of his hesitations, beyond the premise that additional action should not be taken lightly.
He may clarify his views when he testifies before the Senate and House next week.
The account released Wednesday did offer some explanations, however, for the Fed officials' reluctance to take additional action.
Some officials see evidence that unemployment cannot quickly return to normal levels because many people looking for jobs lack the skills sought by companies looking for workers. And they are concerned that policies aimed at reducing unemployment would instead accelerate the pace of inflation.
There is also skepticism about the power of additional asset purchases to improve economic conditions. While previous rounds of purchases have clearly lowered interest rates, tight credit standards have prevented many borrowers from taking advantage.
And the account said some officials sought information about how far the Fed could expand its purchases without soaking up so much of the supply of Treasuries or mortgage bonds that shortages might cause "a meaningful deterioration in securities market functioning."
A result of these concerns, according to the account, is that the Fed is searching for other ways to foster growth. "Several participants," it said, "commented that it would be desirable to explore the possibility of developing new tools to promote more accommodative financial conditions and thereby support a stronger economic recovery."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
OCEAN CITY, Md. -- As state governments begin to emerge from the long downturn, many are grappling with a difficult choice: should they restore some of the services and jobs they were forced to eliminate in the recession or cut taxes in the hopes of bolstering their local economies?
The debate over the proper balance between taxing and spending has been raging in Congress, on the presidential campaign trail and in statehouses around the country, and no two states have settled it more differently this year than Maryland and Kansas, whose fiscal years began July 1.
Maryland, a state controlled by Democrats that has a pristine credit rating, raised income taxes on its top earners this year to preserve services and spending on its well-regarded schools -- leading some business groups to warn that the state might become less competitive. Kansas, controlled by Republicans, decided to try to spur its economy with an income tax cut -- which Moody's Investors Service, the ratings agency, recently warned would lead to "dramatic revenue loss" and deficits that would probably require more spending cuts in the coming years.
Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, gave an impassioned defense of his approach to mayors from across the state who gathered here at the end of June at the annual convention of the Maryland Municipal League.
"Without any anger, and without any meanness, and without any fear, let's ask one another in these critical months ahead and years ahead: how much less do we think would be good for our state?" Mr. O'Malley asked. "How much less do we think would be good for our country? How much less education would be good for our children? How many fewer college degrees would make our state or our country more competitive?
"How much less research and development would be good for the innovation economy that we have an obligation and a responsibility, a duty and an imperative, to embrace? How many fewer hungry Maryland kids can we afford to feed? Progress is a choice: we can decide whether to make the tough choices necessary to invest in our shared future and move forward together. Or we can be the first generation of Marylanders to give our children a lesser quality of life with fewer opportunities."
Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas, who sought the Republican nomination for president four years ago, said he was persuaded that his state needed to cut its income taxes and taxes on small businesses significantly when he studied data from the Internal Revenue Service that showed that Kansas was losing residents to states with lower taxes.
"My viewpoint, and the viewpoint of the majority of the Legislature, was we've got to change our tax policy to attract more people and attract more businesses," Mr. Brownback said in a telephone interview. "We're just tired of losing in our league -- I consider the surrounding states as our league -- and we want to start gaining."
Mr. Brownback said that he initially had hoped to pay for some of the lost revenues -- which are expected to reach a little over $800 million, or 13 percent of general fund revenues, next year -- by ending a number of popular tax deductions, and by phasing in the cuts slowly. But he could not find support for that, so, even as other states are beginning to add spending again, he has been looking for savings and more cuts to offset the projected loss in tax revenues. "We are going to be going through everything with a fine-tooth comb," he said.
The recession and its aftermath have been a tumultuous time for state budgets. As they grappled with the steepest and longest drop in tax collections on record, states cut hundreds of billions of dollars in spending, and many raised taxes -- some temporarily -- to tide them over. Now, though, revenue has been steadily climbing back for nine straight quarters, and a division between Republican- and Democratic-controlled states is coming into sharp focus over whether to restore the lost services and jobs or to lower taxes, which in some states could effectively lock in some of the budget cuts made during the downturn.
Several Republican-led states see holding the line on taxes, or cutting them, as paramount. Ohio, which sharply cut aid to local governments and education during the downturn, announced this week that it had ended the year with a $235 million surplus. It was deposited in the state's rainy-day fund, and Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, warned that the money should not be used to restore spending cuts.
In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, signed a budget last month that eliminated a program that provided cash assistance to the disabled as it lowered some taxes. But in Oklahoma, where the energy sector has helped the economy, Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, failed to win passage of an ambitious income tax cut despite strong Republican majorities in the Legislature.
Some Democratic-led states are increasing taxes, saying that it is more important to try to restore the services that were cut -- and some of the 657,000 state and local government jobs lost -- during the downturn. In California, where temporary tax increases imposed during the recession were allowed to phase out before the state was back on solid fiscal footing, Gov. Jerry Brown is warning that the state will need to cut another $6 billion, largely from education, if voters fail to approve a tax increase he is seeking.
The effects of state taxes are hotly debated. This spring, when the George W. Bush Institute held a conference in New York on how to promote economic growth, panelist after panelist asserted that cutting state taxes would jolt the economy; Governor Brownback told the conference that his small-business tax cuts would be "like shooting adrenaline into the heart of growing the economy."
But the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit research organization in Washington associated with Citizens for Tax Justice, which advocates a more progressive tax code, issued a report this year that found that the states with high income tax rates had outperformed those with no income tax over the past decade when it came to economic growth per capita and median family income.
The choices made by Kansas and Maryland could provide something of a real-time test of the prevailing political theories of taxing and spending -- though it could be years before the results are in.
When Governor O'Malley spoke here to mayors from across the state -- including more conservative mayors from the Eastern Shore of Maryland -- he got perhaps his warmest reception when he spoke about his desire to raise the gas tax so that he could begin to restore highway financing for municipalities, which he has reluctantly cut sharply in recent years.
"I haven't given up, and I have the scars to prove it," he said of his failed effort during the last session. "I left a lot of blood on the battlefield, but I didn't drop the flag. The truth still remains: unless we update, and unless we find ways to invest in our transportation trust fund in a way that keeps pace with inflation, then every town and every city is going to suffer."

Full text: Over the past few months, writers from Charles Murray to Timothy Noah have produced alarming work on the growing bifurcation of American society. Now the eminent Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam and his team are coming out with research that's more horrifying.
While most studies look at inequality of outcomes among adults and help us understand how America is coming apart, Putnam's group looked at inequality of opportunities among children. They help us understand what the country will look like in the decades ahead. The quick answer? More divided than ever.
Putnam's data verifies what many of us have seen anecdotally, that the children of the more affluent and less affluent are raised in starkly different ways and have different opportunities. Decades ago, college-graduate parents and high-school-graduate parents invested similarly in their children. Recently, more affluent parents have invested much more in their children's futures while less affluent parents have not.
They've invested more time. Over the past decades, college-educated parents have quadrupled the amount of time they spend reading "Goodnight Moon," talking to their kids about their day and cheering them on from the sidelines. High-school-educated parents have increased child-care time, but only slightly.
A generation ago, working-class parents spent slightly more time with their kids than college-educated parents. Now college-educated parents spend an hour more every day. This attention gap is largest in the first three years of life when it is most important.
Affluent parents also invest more money in their children. Over the last 40 years upper-income parents have increased the amount they spend on their kids' enrichment activities, like tutoring and extra curriculars, by $5,300 a year. The financially stressed lower classes have only been able to increase their investment by $480, adjusted for inflation.
As a result, behavior gaps are opening up. In 1972, kids from the bottom quartile of earners participated in roughly the same number of activities as kids from the top quartile. Today, it's a chasm.
Richer kids are roughly twice as likely to play after-school sports. They are more than twice as likely to be the captains of their sports teams. They are much more likely to do nonsporting activities, like theater, yearbook and scouting. They are much more likely to attend religious services.
It's not only that richer kids have become more active. Poorer kids have become more pessimistic and detached. Social trust has fallen among all income groups, but, between 1975 and 1995, it plummeted among the poorest third of young Americans and has remained low ever since. As Putnam writes in notes prepared for the Aspen Ideas Festival: "It's perfectly understandable that kids from working-class backgrounds have become cynical and even paranoid, for virtually all our major social institutions have failed them -- family, friends, church, school and community." As a result, poorer kids are less likely to participate in voluntary service work that might give them a sense of purpose and responsibility. Their test scores are lagging. Their opportunities are more limited.
A long series of cultural, economic and social trends have merged to create this sad state of affairs. Traditional social norms were abandoned, meaning more children are born out of wedlock. Their single parents simply have less time and resources to prepare them for a more competitive world. Working-class jobs were decimated, meaning that many parents are too stressed to have the energy, time or money to devote to their children.
Affluent, intelligent people are now more likely to marry other energetic, intelligent people. They raise energetic, intelligent kids in self-segregated, cultural ghettoes where they know little about and have less influence upon people who do not share their blessings.
The political system directs more money to health care for the elderly while spending on child welfare slides.
Equal opportunity, once core to the nation's identity, is now a tertiary concern. If America really wants to change that, if the country wants to take advantage of all its human capital rather than just the most privileged two-thirds of it, then people are going to have to make some pretty uncomfortable decisions.
Liberals are going to have to be willing to champion norms that say marriage should come before childrearing and be morally tough about it. Conservatives are going to have to be willing to accept tax increases or benefit cuts so that more can be spent on the earned-income tax credit and other programs that benefit the working class.
Political candidates will have to spend less time trying to exploit class divisions and more time trying to remedy them -- less time calling their opponents out of touch elitists, and more time coming up with agendas that comprehensively address the problem. It's politically tough to do that, but the alternative is national suicide.

Full text: Once upon a time a rich man named Romney ran for president. He could claim, with considerable justice, that his wealth was well-earned, that he had in fact done a lot to create good jobs for American workers. Nonetheless, the public understandably wanted to know both how he had grown so rich and what he had done with his wealth; he obliged by releasing extensive information about his financial history.
But that was 44 years ago. And the contrast between George Romney and his son Mitt -- a contrast both in their business careers and in their willingness to come clean about their financial affairs -- dramatically illustrates how America has changed.
Right now there's a lot of buzz about an investigative report in the magazine Vanity Fair highlighting the "gray areas" in the younger Romney's finances. More about that in a minute. First, however, let's talk about what it meant to get rich in George Romney's America, and how it compares with the situation today.
What did George Romney do for a living? The answer was straightforward: he ran an auto company, American Motors. And he ran it very well indeed: at a time when the Big Three were still fixated on big cars and ignoring the rising tide of imports, Romney shifted to a highly successful focus on compacts that restored the company's fortunes, not to mention that it saved the jobs of many American workers.
It also made him personally rich. We know this because during his run for president, he released not one, not two, but 12 years' worth of tax returns, explaining that any one year might just be a fluke. From those returns we learn that in his best year, 1960, he made more than $660,000 -- the equivalent, adjusted for inflation, of around $5 million today.
Those returns also reveal that he paid a lot of taxes -- 36 percent of his income in 1960, 37 percent over the whole period. This was in part because, as one report at the time put it, he "seldom took advantage of loopholes to escape his tax obligations." But it was also because taxes on the rich were much higher in the '50s and '60s than they are now. In fact, once you include the indirect effects of taxes on corporate profits, taxes on the very rich were about twice current levels.
Now fast-forward to Romney the Younger, who made even more money during his business career at Bain Capital. Unlike his father, however, Mr. Romney didn't get rich by producing things people wanted to buy; he made his fortune through financial engineering that seems in many cases to have left workers worse off, and in some cases driven companies into bankruptcy.
And there's another contrast: George Romney was open and forthcoming about what he did with his wealth, but Mitt Romney has largely kept his finances secret. He did, grudgingly, release one year's tax return plus an estimate for the next year, showing that he paid a startlingly low tax rate. But as the Vanity Fair report points out, we're still very much in the dark about his investments, some of which seem very mysterious.
Put it this way: Has there ever before been a major presidential candidate who had a multimillion-dollar Swiss bank account, plus tens of millions invested in the Cayman Islands, famed as a tax haven?
And then there's his Individual Retirement Account. I.R.A.'s are supposed to be a tax-advantaged vehicle for middle-class savers, with annual contributions limited to a few thousand dollars a year. Yet somehow Mr. Romney ended up with an account worth between $20 million and $101 million.
There are legitimate ways that could have happened, just as there are potentially legitimate reasons for parking large sums of money in overseas tax havens. But we don't know which if any of those legitimate reasons apply in Mr. Romney's case -- because he has refused to release any details about his finances. This refusal to come clean suggests that he and his advisers believe that voters would be less likely to support him if they knew the truth about his investments.
And that is precisely why voters have a right to know that truth. Elections are, after all, in part about the perceived character of the candidates -- and what a man does with his money is surely a major clue to his character.
One more thing: To the extent that Mr. Romney has a coherent policy agenda, it involves cutting tax rates on the very rich -- which are already, as I said, down by about half since his father's time. Surely a man advocating such policies has a special obligation to level with voters about the extent to which he would personally benefit from the policies he advocates.
Yet obviously that's something Mr. Romney doesn't want to do. And unless he does reveal the truth about his investments, we can only assume that he's hiding something seriously damaging.

Abstract: BOND funds thumped stock funds in their risk-off during the second quarter, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a bond fund manager in a celebratory mode.

Full text: BOND funds thumped stock funds in their risk-off during the second quarter, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a bond fund manager in a celebratory mode.
The BlackRock Global Allocation fund provides a window into how professional managers are sizing up bonds today. The fund has the flexibility to invest in a mix of stocks and bonds, based on the investment team's assessment of relative values. Currently, the fund has just 27 percent riding on bonds, well below its neutral target of 40 percent.
"We don't think fixed-income instruments provide yield or price value at these levels. Period. Full stop," says Dennis Stattman, a senior portfolio manager of the fund.
That's in large part a function of what has happened to Treasury rates. Growing concerns about economic slowdowns in the United States, Europe and China set off a flight-to-quality rally in Treasuries during the spring. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell from 2.25 percent in early April to a low of 1.47 percent on June 1. At the end of the quarter, the Treasury note had inched up to 1.65 percent. When yields decline, bond prices rise. Total return is a combination of earned interest and the bond-price change. In the second quarter, the average return for funds focused on long-term government bonds was 10.2 percent. That would be a solid return for two years, let alone a quarter.
While Treasuries may seem to be a haven, today's minuscule yields pack palpable risks for bond managers. Those low yields aren't even keeping pace with the 2 percent inflation rate. And when interest rates rise, Treasuries will be hit hard. The current yield payouts will provide scant cushion against the falling prices.
Bill Gross, manager of the huge Pimco Total Return bond fund, says it's becoming "harder and harder" to generate inflation-beating returns in a low-rate world, without exposing the fund to sharp price declines if rates rise.
"It's a delicate walk, like Mr. Wallenda on the wire over Niagara Falls," he said, referring to Nik Wallenda, who walked over the Niagara Gorge last month. "You have to be very careful and keep your eyes on the wire."
Despite the drop in yields, Mr. Gross says the fund is keeping about 35 percent of the portfolio invested in Treasuries -- in line with the benchmark Barclays aggregate bond index. The fund abandoned Treasuries for a while last year, but performance suffered. "They are insurance," he said. "That insurance has become more expensive now, but on a day when you need that insurance you're glad to have it."
Other fund managers aren't so sold on Treasuries. The Dodge & Cox Income fund is investing only 3 percent of assets in them, said Dana Emery, a manager of the fund. "We may underperform if Treasury yields fall even further, but given our long-term perspective, we just don't like the risk-reward," she said.
The Loomis Sayles Bond fund is designed to be a swashbuckler, less concerned about what might work in the short term and with a mandate that permits it to invest in just about any segment of the bond market. Currently the fund does not own Treasuries.
"We have positioned the portfolio to capture yield today and benefit from rising rates," said Kathleen Gaffney, co-manager of the fund. It doesn't see Treasuries as delivering on either score.
FOR the most part, managers seem to agree that it is best to limit a fund's duration, or sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The longer the duration, the more yield you get today, but with the trade-off of a bigger price decline if rates rise.
The Barclays aggregate bond index has an average effective duration of about five years. If rates were to rise one percentage point in a year, the price of the underlying bonds in the index would decline by 5 percent.
The Fidelity Total Bond fund has a duration of 4.5 years, but Ford O'Neil, its lead manager, says its Treasury stake is invested in longer-term issues maturing in more than 10 years, to wring out more yield. "That's where the value is" he says. That long-maturity Treasury stake -- about 30 percent of the portfolio -- is offset by short-term mortgage-backed securities, which comprise about 20 percent of the fund. The fund's yield as of June 30 was 2.5 percent.
For some fund managers, mortgage-backed securities have become the sector du jour. Those backed by federal agencies, including Fannie Mae, currently have yields 1.5 percentage points or so higher than Treasuries.
Mortgage-backed securities account for more than half of assets for Pimco Total Return, helping it register a 3 percent yield as of June 30. If the Federal Reserve were to step in with a third round of quantitative easing that focused on buying mortgage securities -- which would push prices up -- Mr. Gross says that would "be the cherry on the sundae."
High-yield corporate bonds, or junk bonds, have been a favorite yield generator, but some managers are cooling on the sector. Mr. O'Neil said Fidelity Total Bond had 12 percent invested in this bond segment, versus 18 percent three years ago.
The average yield of 7.4 percent for these issues is enticing, but if economic growth stalls, junk bonds could falter. Mr. Gross says he is waiting until we "get an all-clear" that another recession isn't lurking before he would move heavily into them.
Bob Persons, co-manager of the MFS Bond fund, says a sweet spot in corporate bonds are those that are rated one rung below investment grade but could soon be upgraded. Investment-grade bonds -- those rated AAA, AA, A and BBB -- typically yield 3 percent to 3.5 percent these days. Mr. Persons's favored segment, which comprises about 20 percent or so of the MFS fund, yields 5 percent to 5.5 percent.
"When the bond rating agencies catch up to us and upgrade a BB to investment grade," he says, "it suddenly becomes the highest yielder in that universe, and funds that only buy investment-grade bonds get interested." He says that this typically drives prices higher, adding 1.5 to 2 percentage points of return.
Ms. Emery says the investment team at Dodge & Cox is finding compelling bond investments in the debt of money center banks like Bank of America and Citigroup. Before the financial crisis, the banking bond sector typically yielded 70 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than Treasuries. The sector now yields about 300 basis points more.
"Many companies are in much better financial shape but their bond spreads are still wide," she says. She notes that the higher yields also provide a fatter income cushion to mitigate price declines when rates begin to rise.
Ms. Gaffney, at the Loomis Sayles Bond fund, says European sovereign debt is "getting pretty close" to looking enticing. Meanwhile, her fund is investing in European utilities and telecommunications debt.
"There are companies we believe will be able to retain their investment-grade rating through the crisis, but right now they are trading at yields that are comparable to high-yield issues," she says. "We see the risk-off environment as a buying opportunity."

Full text: HERE'S a depressing thought:
"Investors should anticipate and prepare for another 'lost decade' for stocks. In fact, we believe that the next 10 years will be even more difficult than the last 10 because of a new emerging menace -- inflation."
So argue Martin J. Pring, Joe D. Turner and Tom J. Kopas in "Investing in the Second Lost Decade" (McGraw-Hill, $30). The first "lost decade" refers to January 2000 to December 2009, which "goes down as one of the worst 10-year investment periods ever for stocks," the authors write. Over that time, the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, for example, was a negative 9 percent, even when including dividends.
As technical analysts, the three authors rely primarily on past performance to make a persuasive case that we are in for another 10 bad years.
First, they point out that, historically speaking, "lost decades tend to occur back-to-back." Second, they see nothing on the horizon that leads them to believe that the economy is going to buck the trend. The United States' national debt is so big -- and growing only bigger -- that it will be a huge drag on future growth. What's worse, they say they believe that at some point the government will start printing even more money to try to revive the economy, a move that could set off the inflation they are worried about.
So, given all this doom and gloom, how do they justify their subtitle? It says the book is "a survival guide for keeping your profits up when the market is down."
They offer two reasons. Even during long-term bear markets, they point out, there are brief periods when stocks rise. And if you can anticipate when markets are going to fall again, you can take measures to protect whatever gains you have -- and to keep your losses to a minimum.
The secret, they contend, is in understanding business cycles.
Here, however, the reading becomes dense, and charts and graphs proliferate. But the basic thought is this: Business cycles are predictable. On average, over a four- to five-year period, the economy will go from expansion to contraction and back again. If you know where we are in a cycle, you can invest accordingly.
For example, when the economy begins to contract, you buy bonds, the authors write. At the nadir of the cycle, you buy stocks, and as expansion gets under way again, you buy commodities. Because expansion is the mirror image of contraction, the moves during the upside of the cycle are the opposite of what happens during declines. You sell bonds as the economy starts to improve and you sell stocks at the peak of expansion.
All of this is clear, but there are a few rather large problems with pursuing their strategy and expecting riches to follow.
First, cycles don't always follow the prescribed pattern, as the authors note. "It is not unprecedented for markets to reverse direction out of sequence," as they put it.
Second, cycles are perfectly obvious -- in retrospect. While there is a chapter devoted to "how to identify the business cycle stages," the authors acknowledge that their suggestions are not foolproof.
For example, they are big believers in charting "moving averages" of stock, bond and commodity prices, which is another way of saying that you track average values over a certain period to see if trends are bearish or bullish.
But, as the authors say, "more often than not the market in question will already have moved before the evidence becomes conclusive," so you need to begin your asset shifting ahead of the change in sentiment you think is coming. And, of course, you could be very wrong.
Finally, this is not exactly unplowed territory. The idea of buying stocks when they are out of favor is well known. That means you will have much competition as you try to put the book's strategy into effect.
But if you believe that we can expect another 10 years of negative investment returns, alternatives to buy-and-hold are welcome.
Another new book, "The Chinese Way to Wealth and Prosperity" (McGraw-Hill, $22), by Michael Justin Lee, fits into this idea well.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is this: Of its "eight timeless strategies for achieving financial success," a majority -- five, to be exact -- deal with creating human capital. For example, Mr. Lee says, you should want to achieve true mastery of your profession or trade. And you should go wherever necessary to find opportunity, and understand the importance of having a strong personal network.
When it comes to specific financial advice -- keep debt to an absolute minimum and defer gratification -- his most interesting chapter is "Play Financial Defense,"an idea that boils down to saving a lot during good times in order to offset the bad.
"The undeniable truth is that from time immemorial, there has been only one sure way to ensure personal prosperity," writes Mr. Lee, who teaches finance at George Mason University and the University of Maryland. "This one-way ticket to prosperity has been the consistent savings of a portion of one's earnings. It's been called the American way, but lately I feel that non-Americans have learned this lesson better than we have in this country."
Save more. Invest in yourself, hope for the best, and plan for the worst. That's never bad advice, and it's where you end up after reading these two books.

Full text: PEAKS in the stock market have become a sign of spring, just like robins and daffodils. For the third year in a row, the second quarter provided the start of a swift and nerve-racking plunge.
If the pattern in prices seemed familiar, so did the economic and political backdrop: debt and politics in the United States and Europe sowed doubt among consumers, businesses and mutual fund investors.
The prospect that Greece would renege on an austerity pledge, the condition for a huge international aid program, roused fear that the euro zone would fragment. A coalition in favor of keeping the euro triumphed in the Greek election late in the quarter, but doubts about the currency's future remain.
Elections are four months away in the United States, but a grim possibility weighed heavily on the markets: that unless there is political cooperation in Washington, the economy is headed off a fiscal cliff. Yet another concern was that strength was being sapped from emerging economies, especially China.
With so many worries in so many places, the American economy suffered a marked loss of momentum. As job creation slowed and claims for unemployment benefits rose, unemployment edged up in May -- and it remained at 8.2 percent in June. Michael Spangler, president of the Nationwide Investment Management Group, attributed the sluggishness partly to attitudes in the boardroom matching those in the living room.
"Corporate earnings and balance sheets are stronger than they've ever been," Mr. Spangler said, "but corporations are acting very much like individuals: very risk-averse and short term in their thinking."
The risk fear among individuals was evident in weaker readings of retail sales and consumer confidence. On the sparsely populated bright side, the housing market showed signs of life seldom seen in the last seven years.
The preponderance of gloomy developments sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index down 10 percent in the quarter before it rebounded to narrow the three-month loss to 3.3 percent. In another sign of doubt about the global economy, the 10-year Treasury note yield fell as low as 1.44 percent, a record low.
Strategists and fund managers differ on how much of the world's woes are reflected in stock and bond prices, but there is little dispute that the trouble will continue into 2013. Still, they report a wary optimism toward stocks. Conditions have been so difficult for so long, they say, that investors are becoming used to it, as if they're bringing a chronic illness under control and beginning to thrive in spite of it. In this view, sick is the new healthy.
"The markets are basically saying, 'I'm not scared,' " said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at UBS. Investors have come to understand that "we're going to have a meaningfully prolonged period of discomfort associated with macroeconomic events," he said, "with lower-than-normal returns and 10 percent moves up and down."
After recouping most of one of those down moves, the average domestic equity fund in the database of Morningstar lost 4.2 percent in the quarter. International stock funds fared worse, falling 6.1 percent, dragged down by funds focused on Europe and emerging markets. Bond funds remained a haven, rising 1.3 percent, led by portfolios of American government issues.
James T. Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management, contends that there is less for investors to fear in the United States than in other places. Unit labor costs -- the cost to produce each dollar's worth of goods -- have declined for American manufacturers in the last decade, while they have risen almost everywhere else, especially in Europe, he said. As a result, he said, the United States is unusual among developed countries for having net economic growth since before the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
Lower labor costs have allowed the United States to create more growth and to have more momentum than other countries, Mr. Swanson said. "You want to bet that U.S. companies, when we come out of this slow patch, will show profit resilience?" he asked. "They have already shown amazing resilience. Something's going on here."
ANOTHER reason for American stocks' relative strength is that sources of danger like the federal deficit and Europe's indebtedness have been so well flagged for so long that the shock value has eroded, said William Riegel, head of global equities at TIAA-CREF.
"One thing to remember is that a lot of uncertainties are already known, so the risk-reward balance is quite good from an equity market perspective," Mr. Riegel said. "I'm not saying there's not risk, but the focus and fear of a breakup" of the euro zone "have driven valuations down dramatically. The probability is that it will hold together."
Still, when it comes to year-end fiscal issues in the United States, there are many possible outcomes. Taxation and government spending could vary greatly, depending on who wins the White House and Congress in November, Mr. Golub said. Weaker economic growth between now and then could reduce tax receipts and raise government spending, forcing new debate about the debt ceiling and related issues between the November election and early January, when the new Congress takes over.
And the problems confronting emerging economies may also be more intricate than many people realize, said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner at Kleiman International Consultants, a Washington firm specializing in developing markets. Their stocks and bonds have suffered from fear that a global recession, with its focal point in Europe, will curtail the exports on which many emerging economies depend. Weakness among European banks is a threat, too.
"Across the emerging-market universe, they're worried that European banks are not going to roll over loans anymore, they're going to take the money home," she said. "Emerging economies are going to suffer as badly as Western Europe."
Ms. Morrissey added that each of the BRIC nations -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- "is having its own domestic slowdown not necessarily attributed to global risk" aversion. Europe accounts for particularly large proportions of exports from Brazil and Russia. As for the other BRICs, India has disappointed Western investors who say it hasn't delivered economic reform, while China is cooling down from a spending boom that left it with immense excesses of real estate and infrastructure projects.
But Ms. Morrissey said smaller markets "have held up amazingly well, despite the potential contagion."
"If you're a long-term investor," she observed, "some of these markets look like fabulous bets."
But with fear of risk widespread and global growth iffy, she finds emerging-market debt denominated in hard currencies like dollars or euros more fabulous than equity. She said she most favors Mexico, which she said had been hurt by falling oil prices and concerns ahead of recent elections.
Funds that hold bonds issued in the developing world rose 0.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Morningstar, while stock funds there were down 8 percent.
MR. SPANGLER, at Nationwide, also advocates middling levels of risk. He recommends shares of "quality dividend-paying companies," as well as tech stocks, which he expects to benefit when businesses start spending their hoards of cash, and commodity-related stocks as an inflation hedge.
Funds in those sectors had a tough second quarter. Natural-resource funds fell 10.8 percent, on average, while energy funds were off 8.6 percent and tech funds were down 8.2 percent. The few winners included health, up 2.2 percent; utilities, up 2.6 percent, and consumer staples, up 1.3 percent.
Mr. Swanson also favors tech stocks and high-quality dividend payers, adding that in China, a migration from rural to urban living is fueling demand for electronic devices. He also said that tech trades at a lower valuation than the broad market -- and with less volatility.
Mr. Riegel saw several types of investments that, in his view, could benefit from a revival in economic growth and investor sentiment and were reasonably priced, if not bargains. The mix includes Japanese exporters and European multinationals with non-European businesses. He finds companies in Spain and Italy particularly cheap.
"If you're a brave person, make your purchases and close your eyes," he advised. "You could get very good returns."
Mr. Riegel would avoid government bonds after the run they have had, as would Mr. Golub. It is not their high prices that bother Mr. Golub as much as their paltry return.
"If you want to put your money in a safe harbor, you need to be really scared or really rich," Mr. Golub said. "Your chances of retiring on a 1.6 percent yield -- if you can do that, then God bless you. Ultimately equities are the only game in town for most people."
He prefers energy and European multinationals, which are "global in nature and just happen to be in Europe," he said. He finds the health sector particularly appealing.
Mr. Golub expects the S.& P. 500 to reach 1,475 this year, an 8.3 percent gain from the end of June. He alluded to another pattern in the market that could be playing out for a third consecutive year: a rally to fresh highs after springtime declines.
"Three months from now, the level of concern that investors have will be lower than today," Mr. Golub predicted. Despite evidence of "tremendous risk in sovereign markets and Greece threatening the world order," he said, investors are saying, " 'That's par for the course; I'm in.' Otherwise you're leaving after the collapse and getting in after the rebound."

Full text: Some of the nation's biggest retail chains reported on Thursday that sales growth slowed in June, as shoppers held back amid wavering consumer confidence and unemployment.
A survey by Thomson Reuters of 18 retailers showed that sales at stores open more than a year were up 2.5 percent in June, well below the 7.7 percent increase recorded in June 2011. The same-store sales results surpassed Wall Street analysts' forecasts of a 2.4 percent rise.
Retailers have seen lower spending over all by domestic customers, a drop in consumer confidence as millions of people remain out of work and fewer tourists are willing to spend amid a global economic slowdown.
Nancy Liu, a retail strategist for Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm, said that one of the reasons for the lower June results this year was that the sales numbers were being compared with a strong performance in June 2011.
"Retailers were coming out of the gate" a year ago, she said. "They would have had to outperform to beat those numbers."
Global economic issues were weighing on consumers. Ms. Liu said the euro zone crisis, the potential slowdown of growth in Asia and unemployment rates that had not recovered as quickly as people expected had prompted retailers to promote and discount heavily to get customers to buy.
In addition, because of a mild winter, retailers may have benefited from some of the summer spending earlier in the year, and inventories are being discounted and cleared to allow for back-to-school buying.
Retailers have been keen to attract cautious consumers in a recovery weighed down by constraints in employment, housing and credit as well as, until recently, high gasoline prices.
"The second quarter is proving to be a real downer for retailers and consumers alike," said Chris G. Christopher Jr., a United States economist for IHS Global Insight. "Job prospects are looking dimmer, equity markets are more volatile, the European debt crisis has reared its ugly head and consumer confidence is back into recession territory."
June was the third month of weak growth for same-store sales, he said in a research commentary. IHS Global Insight has now forecast that consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, will advance 1.5 percent for the second quarter compared with the first quarter's 2.5 percent increase.
Mr. Christopher quoted another survey released Thursday, a report by the International Council of Shopping Centers, which showed that apparel, department and discount stores and wholesale clubs posted significantly weaker gains in June than in May, while luxury stores showed stronger gains.
The three discount stores in the survey -- Costco, Target and Fred's -- together showed a 2.5 percent rise in same-store sales in June, below forecasts of 3.1 percent and far below their 9.2 percent rise in June 2011.
Companies like Ross, the clothing discounter, and TJX Companies, which operates Marshalls and T. J. Maxx, have stronger growth, Ms. Liu said.
Those companies fall into the category of apparel stores, which as a group posted the strongest same-store sales results in the survey, up 4.2 percent in June. They showed a 5 percent expansion a year ago. TJX and Ross were each up 7 percent last month, outshining the 5 percent growth in June 2011.
The high-end department store Nordstrom showed better same-store sales, growing 8.1 percent in June compared with 7.9 percent last year. Macy's showed 1.2 percent sales growth in June, compared with 6.7 percent in June 2011. The department store sector as a group grew 0.9 percent, with Kohl's and Bon-Ton down.

Service Sector Increases At Slowest Pace in 2 Years

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- The service sector in June grew at the slowest pace in nearly two and a half years, more evidence that the economy has weakened.
But those same companies increased hiring last month, supporting other data that shows job growth may have picked up last month.
The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity fell to 52.1 last month, from a May reading of 53.7.
The reading was the lowest since January 2010. Still, any reading above 50 indicates expansion. The sector has grown now for 30 straight months.
Service companies employ about 90 percent of the economy. They include retail, construction, financial services, health care and hotel businesses, among others. The service sector includes low-paying positions in retailing and restaurants but also covers higher-paying jobs in professions like information technology, accounting and financial services.
The industry has weakened at a time when the broader economy has lost vigor. Employers in the United States have scaled back on hiring. Paychecks are barely keeping pace with inflation, making consumers less confident in the economy. Consumer spending, which drives 70 percent of economic activity, did not increase from April to May.
A separate I.S.M. survey this week said manufacturing shrank in June for the first time in three years.
Still, service companies and factories are hiring. The service sector survey's employment index rose to 52.3, up from 50.8 in May. And the manufacturing survey's measure of employment was 56.6, which suggests solid job growth at factories in June.
The government reports on June job growth on Friday. Economists are predicting employers added 90,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate stayed at 8.2 percent, according to a survey by FactSet.
But many economists were slightly more optimistic Thursday after seeing the I.S.M. service sector survey and two other encouraging reports on layoffs and hiring.
Weekly unemployment benefit applications dropped by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 374,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. That's the fewest since the week of May 19.
Separately, the payroll company ADP said businesses added 176,000 jobs last month. That is better than the revised total of 136,000 jobs it reported for May.
If sustained, that would be enough to lower the unemployment rate. But the ADP survey has often deviated sharply from the government report, so economists approached the June results with some caution.
In May, the Labor Department said employers added 69,000 jobs, the fewest in a year and nearly half of ADP's estimate. The ADP report covers hiring only in the private sector and excludes government job growth.
One hopeful sign for the economy is that gasoline prices have fallen more than 60 cents a gallon, on average, since peaking in early April. Lower gas prices give consumers more money to spend elsewhere, such as on meals at restaurants, vacations and other services that drive growth.

Iran Nuclear Talks Are to Continue as Their Tone Heats Up

Abstract: The Security Council has demanded that Iran halt its uranium enrichment, which Iran has refused to do on grounds that it has the inherent legal right to enrich for peaceful purposes as a signatory of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Full text: Low-level talks between Iran and the group of big powers over the disputed Iranian nuclear program ended early Wednesday with both sides saying the deputies of their top negotiators would meet at a later date. Their announcement gave no hint of progress but nonetheless suggested that neither side was ready to declare the effort a failure.
The talks, in Istanbul, were held against a backdrop of increasingly bellicose oratory by Iran and the United States because of the nuclear impasse, which after a lull of more than three months has started to raise tensions again in the Middle East.
Iran has renewed a threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital Persian Gulf oil conduit, in response to the recently intensified American and European sanctions meant to paralyze the Iranian oil industry as a pressure tactic in the nuclear talks. Iran has also said the new sanctions will have no effect on its resolve to prevail in the nuclear dispute.
On Monday, Obama administration officials disclosed the reinforcement of American military strength in bases near the Strait of Hormuz as a signal to Iran not to try to disrupt oil-tanker traffic. At the same time, Iran began a three-day military exercise, test-firing missiles it said were capable of hitting American bases and targets in Israel.
The Iranians raised the shrill tone a notch on Wednesday, when the air force commander of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has been conducting the missile tests, said he had contingency plans to hit 35 American bases in the early minutes of any conflict.
"All these bases are within the reach of our missiles," the commander, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, was quoted as saying by Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency. He was also quoted as saying Israel had provided "good targets for us as well."
The increasingly hostile tone has mirrored pessimism over the lack of visible progress in the nuclear negotiations.
The Istanbul talks, which began on Tuesday and lasted into early Wednesday morning, were described by both sides as technical discussions involving lower-ranking experts representing Iran and the P5-plus-1 group of countries -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany.
Catherine Ashton, the European Union's top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator for the group, said in a statement that "the experts explored positions on a number of technical subjects." The statement said her deputy, Helga Schmid, would meet with the deputy of Saeed Jalili, the lead Iranian negotiator, at an unspecified future date.
Iran's official news media provided a similarly sterile appraisal of the Istanbul meeting, but added that the deputy-level meeting would be followed by a meeting between Ms. Ashton and Mr. Jalili.
Iran and the P5-plus-1 group have held three rounds of formal talks since April about the Iranian uranium enrichment program, which Western powers and Israel suspect is a cover for achieving bomb-making capability despite Iranian denials.
The Security Council has demanded that Iran halt its uranium enrichment, which Iran has refused to do on grounds that it has the inherent legal right to enrich for peaceful purposes as a signatory of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
The cumulative effects of American and European sanctions have already cut deeply into Iran's ability to export oil, industry figures show, and have contributed to severe economic disruptions and inflation in Iran.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran said Tuesday that the country would resist the sanctions regardless of their severity and instead use them as an opportunity to wean itself from dependence on oil sales, which finance 80 percent of the national budget.
In what appeared to be a possible gaffe by Iran's state-run television, its Web site reported results of an opinion poll on Tuesday that said 63 percent of respondents favored halting Iran's uranium enrichment in return for gradual removal of the sanctions -- precisely the opposite message from Mr. Ahmadinejad's.
On Wednesday, the poll had been removed, replaced by a poll about soccer, and Iran's state television accused the BBC's Persian service of hacking the Web site to doctor the results of the uranium poll. In fact, Iranian television said only 24 percent of respondents favored halting enrichment and the majority favored retaliation.

Abstract: The decision to grant greater flexibility to the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone's new bailout fund, has raised expectations among analysts that the European Central Bank will also take new measures when its governing council meets Thursday, perhaps by cutting interest rates or providing additional liquidity to the market.

Full text: ROME -- For many political observers, last week's summit meeting of European Union leaders produced a clear winner, Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy, who gained approval of measures intended to help hold down his country's burgeoning debt costs.
They say the deal weakened the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was forced to make concessions. Yet when the two leaders met Wednesday in Rome to discuss the future of the euro zone, the message -- publicly, at least -- was of unity and cooperation.
Italy and Germany are "willing to work together" to overcome the crisis afflicting the currency bloc, Ms. Merkel said Wednesday ahead of a meeting of German and Italian officials and business executives. Mr. Monti said both countries understood the need to cede some sovereignty to build a stronger Europe.
The tenor was quite different last week, when Mr. Monti and the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, pushed through an agreement that euro zone bailout funds could be channeled directly to ailing banks rather than funneled through their respective national governments. Going through the governments would have added to their national debt, sending borrowing costs higher. Interest rates for Italy and Spain this year have periodically reached levels that are considered unsustainable. The new guidelines represented a significant concession by Ms. Merkel.
The agreements reached in Brussels brought a note of cautious optimism from Standard & Poor's, which said in a report late Tuesday that the accords "could help to stabilize the euro zone" and stanch "any further weakening of sovereign creditworthiness."
The ratings agency cautioned that there were still significant risks associated with implementing the agreements, but said it believed the measures "can provide a more stable funding framework for sovereigns and banks on the periphery while their governments continue to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms and reduce their budgetary imbalances."
The decision to grant greater flexibility to the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone's new bailout fund, has raised expectations among analysts that the European Central Bank will also take new measures when its governing council meets Thursday, perhaps by cutting interest rates or providing additional liquidity to the market.
Stocks rose sharply after the deal was announced Friday and have held up fairly well since, though major European indexes ticked lower Wednesday. The Euro Stoxx 50, an index of blue-chip euro zone issues, and benchmarks in London, Paris and Frankfurt all settled less than 1 percent lower. Markets in the United States were closed Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday.
The crisis, which began in late 2009 with the revelation that Greece had been hiding the true extent of its government deficit, has already led three countries -- Greece, Ireland and Portugal -- to receive bailouts. Spain is seeking up to 100 billion, or $125.4 billion, for its financial sector and Cyprus may need 10 billion for its banks.
Many economists, particularly those with a Keynesian bent, argue that the tax increases and spending cuts that European governments have pursued since the onset of the crisis to reassure markets are precisely the wrong medicine at a time when the region's economy is ailing.
Business surveys released Wednesday indicated that all of the biggest European economies are either already in recession or close to it. The surveys suggested the euro zone's economy returned to contraction in the second quarter and the mild recession in Britain stretched into a third consecutive quarter.
Markit's composite purchasing managers index for the euro zone was revised up in June to 46.4 from a preliminary reading of 46, but a reading under 50 indicates economic contraction. The reading has been under 50 for nine of the past 10 months. Other Markit surveys this week showed that British manufacturing and construction contracted in June.
Market said the surveys were consistent with a 0.6 percent contraction for the euro zone economy in the second quarter, and 0.1 percent for Britain.
The reports stoked expectations that the E.C.B. would cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low Thursday and that the Bank of England would resume a bond-buying program intended to spur the British economy.
Despite optimism following the Brussels summit meeting, many economists remain unconvinced, saying the problems confronting the euro zone are too great to overcome. Charles Dumas, the chairman of Lombard Street Research, a London economic consulting firm, said he believed there was still a 75 percent probability that the currency union would ultimately fail.
"It's extremely simple," he said. "The Italians and the Spanish cannot grow until they're competitive, and they can't grow if they're not competitive while engaging in austerity."
Rescuing the euro would either require South European countries to accept a depression or Germany to accept 10 years of 4 percent inflation and large payments to those countries, Mr. Dumas said. "And I don't think the Germans have yet taken on board the scale of what's being asked of them."
In her appearance with Mr. Monti, the German chancellor acknowledged that it was in her country's interests to support the euro zone's weaker countries, whose economies have been especially hard hit by the three-year-old economic crisis.
"If our neighbors in Europe don't do well, in the long run we Germans won't do well, either," she said. "It's in our interest that everyone has a positive economic development, otherwise Germany won't be able to maintain its prosperity."
Mr. Monti insisted that Italy's finances were not comparable to those of Portugal, Greece and Ireland. He emphasized the structural changes his government has already undertaken to improve the country's fiscal position and economy, and those it planned to make in the coming months.
On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund -- which along with the European Union and the European Central Bank has been helping to administer and fund the bailouts -- urged Germany to bolster domestic demand through the adoption of structural changes, something it said would help the country's European partners.
The I.M.F. called for Germany to make "reforms to encourage higher investment, remove labor market bottlenecks, and increase economic efficiency and productivity" that would "be crucial to boost potential growth and aid the rebalancing process."
The fund also weighed in on Greece's efforts to revise the terms of its bailout terms. Christine Lagarde, the I.M.F.'s managing director, took a tough line Tuesday during an appearance on the financial cable television network CNBC, saying that there was no room for discussion.
"I am not in a negotiation or renegotiation mood at all," Ms. Lagarde said. "We are in a fact-finding mood."

Abstract: Enrique Pena Nieto, elected president of Mexico on Sunday, is a scion of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, which was tainted by authoritarianism, corruption and fraud during seven decades in power, before it was booted out by voters 12 years ago. About 40 percent of high school seniors admit to having taken some illegal drug in the last year -- up from 30 percent two decades ago, according to the Monitoring the Future survey, financed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
When policy makers in Washington worry about Mexico these days, they think in terms of a handful of numbers: Mexico's 19,500 hectares devoted to poppy cultivation for heroin; its 17,500 hectares growing cannabis; the 95 percent of American cocaine imports brought by Mexican cartels through Mexico and Central America.
They are thinking about the wrong numbers. If there is one number that embodies the seemingly intractable challenge imposed by the illegal drug trade on the relationship between the United States and Mexico, it is $177.26. That is the retail price, according to Drug Enforcement Administration data, of one gram of pure cocaine from your typical local pusher. That is 74 percent cheaper than it was 30 years ago.
This number contains pretty much all you need to evaluate the Mexican and American governments' "war" to eradicate illegal drugs from the streets of the United States. They would do well to heed its message. What it says is that the struggle on which they have spent billions of dollars and lost tens of thousands of lives over the last four decades has failed.
There is little reason to expect the elections this year will do much to address the challenges to the bilateral relationship. Enrique Pena Nieto, elected president of Mexico on Sunday, is a scion of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, which was tainted by authoritarianism, corruption and fraud during seven decades in power, before it was booted out by voters 12 years ago. In the United States, neither President Obama nor his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, has shown much interest in the nation's southern neighbor.
Yet the presidential elections on both sides of the border offer a unique opportunity to re-examine the central flaws of the two countries' strategy against illegal narcotics. Its threadbare victories -- a drug seizure here, a captured kingpin there -- pale against its cost in blood and treasure. And its collateral damage, measured in terms of social harm, has become too intense to ignore.
Most important, conceived to eradicate the illegal drug market, the war on drugs cannot be won. Once they understand this, the Mexican and American governments may consider refocusing their strategies to take aim at what really matters: the health and security of their citizens, communities and nations.
Prices match supply with demand. If the supply of an illicit drug were to fall, say because the Drug Enforcement Administration stopped it from reaching the nation's shores, we should expect its price to go up.
That is not what happened with cocaine. Despite billions spent on measures from spraying coca fields high in the Andes to jailing local dealers in Miami or Washington, a gram of cocaine cost about 16 percent less last year than it did in 2001. The drop is similar for heroin and methamphetamine. The only drug that has not experienced a significant fall in price is marijuana.
And it's not as if we've lost our taste for the stuff, either. About 40 percent of high school seniors admit to having taken some illegal drug in the last year -- up from 30 percent two decades ago, according to the Monitoring the Future survey, financed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
The use of hard drugs, meanwhile, has remained roughly stable over the last two decades, rising by a few percentage points in the 1990s and declining by a few percentage points over the last decade, with consumption patterns moving from one drug to another according to fashion and ease of purchase.
For instance, 2.9 percent of high school seniors admit to having tried cocaine in the last year, just slightly less than in 1992. About 15 percent of seniors said they abused a prescription drug last year. Twenty years ago, prescription drug abuse was not even consistently measured.
The only dimension along which the war on drugs might be conceived as a success is political. If you ask Americans how concerned they are about drugs, they will give you roughly the same answer they have given for years: not so much.
In a Gallup poll, only 31 percent of Americans said they thought the government was making much progress dealing with illegal drugs, the lowest share since 1997. But fewer people say they worry about drug abuse than 10 years ago. Only 29 percent of Americans think it is an extremely or very serious problem where they live, the lowest share in the last decade.
But the government has spent $20 billion to $25 billion a year on counternarcotics efforts over the last decade. That is a pretty high price tag for political cover, to stop drugs from becoming a prominent issue on voters' radar screen. It becomes unacceptably high if you add in the real costs of the drug wars. That includes more than 55,000 Mexicans and tens of thousands of Central Americans killed by drug-fueled violence since Mexico's departing president, Felipe Calderon, declared war six years ago against the traffickers ferrying drugs across the border.
And the domestic costs are enormous, too. Almost one in five inmates in state prisons and half of those in federal prisons are serving time for drug offenses. In 2010, 1.64 million people were arrested for drug violations. Four out of five arrests were for possession. Nearly half were for possession of often-tiny amounts of marijuana.
Harry Levine, a sociologist at Queens College of the City University of New York, told me that processing each of the roughly 85,000 arrests for drug misdemeanors in New York City last year cost the city $1,500 to $2,000. And that is just the cost to the budget. Hundreds of thousands of Americans, mostly black and poor, are unable to get a job, a credit card or even an apartment to rent because of the lasting stigma of a criminal record for carrying an ounce of marijuana.
Cracking down hard on drug users may sound great on the stump. But Americans who inject drugs are four times as likely to have H.I.V. as British addicts and seven times as likely as drug-injecting Swiss, mainly because the United States has been much slower in introducing needle exchanges and other measures to address the impact of drug abuse on public health.
The Obama administration acknowledges the limitations of the drug wars, and has shifted its priorities, focusing more on drug abuse prevention and treatment of addicts, and less on enforcement.
Still, many critics of the current policy believe the solution is to legalize -- to bring illegal drugs out of the shadows where they are controlled by criminal gangs, into the light of the legal market where they can be regulated and taxed by the government.
Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard who studies drug policy closely, has suggested that legalizing all illicit drugs would produce net benefits to the United States of some $65 billion a year, mostly by cutting public spending on enforcement as well as through reduced crime and corruption.
A study by analysts at the RAND Corporation, a California research organization, suggested that if marijuana were legalized in California and the drug spilled from there to other states, Mexican drug cartels would lose about a fifth of their annual income of some $6.5 billion from illegal exports to the United States.
A growing array of Latin American presidents have asked for the United States to consider legalizing some drugs, like marijuana. Even Mr. Calderon is realizing the futility of the war against the narco-syndicates. He asked President Obama and the United States Congress last month to consider "market solutions" to reduce the cash flow to criminal groups.
Legalization may carry risks, too. Peter H. Reuter, one of the authors of the RAND study, who is now a professor of public policy in the department of criminology of the University of Maryland, said he worried that legalizing drugs would vastly expand drug abuse, leading to other potential social and health costs. Supporters of the war on drugs insist that without it, consumption would have soared to the heights of the 1980s and perhaps beyond.
There are other options. The Global Commission on Drug Policy, whose membership includes former presidents of Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Poland, has called on national governments to "depenalize" if not necessarily legalize drug possession and sales.
This means stopping the arrest and imprisonment of people who use drugs but cause no harm to others, and going easy on small-scale dealers, whose arrest does nothing to dent the flow of illegal drugs. It means focusing enforcement efforts on reducing the violence of the drug trade, rather than eliminating the drug market itself. It may also entail giving drugs to the most addicted users, to get them into clinics and off the streets.
Such policies require a drastic change of approach in Mexico and the United States. Their governments could start by acknowledging that drug dependence is a complex condition that is not solved through punishment, and that numbers of addicts or dealers arrested, or tons of drugs seized, are hardly measures of success.
A war on drugs whose objective is to eradicate the drug market -- to stop drugs from arriving in the United States and stop Americans from swallowing, smoking, inhaling or injecting them -- is a war that cannot be won. What we care about is the harm that drugs, drug trafficking and drug policy do to individuals, society and even national security. Reducing this harm is a goal worth fighting for.

Correction: July 7, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A chart with the Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about the costs and failings of the United States' and Mexico's war on drugs, referred incompletely to the retail price of cocaine; the numbers referred to the price per gram. And some figures on inflation were labeled incorrectly. A corrected chart can be found at nytimes.com/economy.

Full text: BERLIN -- The spotlight in the European debt crisis has now shifted decisively toward the influential leader of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, who emerged from the recent summit meeting in Brussels with new powers and stronger backing to address the Continent's financial woes.
Political leaders took significant strides toward making the central bank more like the United States Federal Reserve, giving it authority to oversee the euro zone's largest banks and, once that new regulator is in place as soon as the end of this year, a likely role in rescuing Spanish banks with capital directly from the European rescue funds.
Many of the longer-run plans under discussion, like European deposit insurance, would mean shifting further responsibilities toward the bank, arguably giving Mr. Draghi the most influential executive powers in Europe.
"In terms of unelected people, he is by far the most powerful in the democratic world," said Franklin Allen, a professor of finance and economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "He's going to have huge influence over bank supervision and over the purchase of sovereign debt, whether he's the head of the committees in charge or not."
On Thursday, the central bank's policy meeting will serve as kind of a second act to the summit meeting, with its council probably offering a rate cut as a tacit reward to leaders for the progress they made, as well as a chance for Mr. Draghi to sketch out his version of a stronger Europe. He is the one actor in a fragmented Continent who can move swiftly and resolutely, as he did in dispensing nearly $1.3 trillion in cheap loans to banks and briefly stilling market unrest.
But his determination to remake the currency union for long-term stability has made him equally willing to withstand pressure in the past. He has the power to withhold cuts in interest rates, resist pressure to inject more money into the European monetary system, and hold off on purchases of sovereign debt from struggling countries if he determines that political leaders are not doing what is necessary to fix their economies.
"He is calm in the face of the storm," said the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who has known Mr. Draghi for more than a decade, "and he sees the world as it is, not how we'd like it to be."
It remains to be seen how the missing details from the summit meeting could undermine his discretion, how much power he would have over the bailout funds, for instance, or how an E.C.B. banking authority would relate to national bank regulators. Mr. Draghi's new powers also do not address what many analysts see as the biggest structural question facing the euro zone: how to reduce the heavy debts of many of the region's economies at a time of severe economic weakness.
One thing is certain: The financial and monetary integration in Europe continues to outpace the deepening of political and fiscal ties, risking an angry reaction from German taxpayers who could find themselves on the hook for more and more liabilities. A German constitutional court is wary of allowing too much latitude to Mr. Draghi and other European officials, threatening to strike down steps that violate Germany's Basic Law.
But for now, Mr. Draghi's already significant influence seems only to have grown. One official who works closely with Mr. Draghi said he still enjoyed the support of Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, who understood well his carrot-and-stick method.
Analysts expect the bank to cut its main interest rate to 0.75 percent on Thursday from 1 percent, the lowest ever, in a further attempt to unblock credit. As evidenced by his decision at the beginning of June to leave interest rates unchanged, despite signs that Spain was sliding toward the abyss, they, and euro-zone leaders, would be well advised not to underestimate his nerve.
His stance was widely perceived as a warning to political leaders that he was willing to play hardball to get them to adopt the policies he wanted. Mr. Draghi's years of working in the Italian Treasury as it struggled to reduce deficits in order to meet the criteria to join the euro have taught him that politically unpopular changes are never accomplished without pressure.
Policy makers and analysts alike insist that behind the pressure tactics is a man who is prepared to do whatever it takes to save the common currency and with it the central bank he leads. "He has the most essential insight of a central banker that you need in a crisis -- the recognition that there are some things only central banks can do, and if they don't do them then nothing is possible," Mr. Geithner said.
His nickname, Super Mario, does not seem to fit him. Mr. Draghi, 64, has no obvious flash or flair; an economist in a dark suit and glasses, he has just enough of a knowing smirk, a gentle irony, to avoid seeming dull, more monetary Machiavelli than video-game hero.
When Mr. Draghi took over as the European Central Bank's president in November, he immediately changed the conduct of the monetary policy meetings held high in the bank's skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt.
His predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, started each gathering by stating his own views before inviting agreement and dissent from the other 22 members of the council, most of them heads of national central banks from tiny Malta to mighty Germany. Mr. Draghi, several participants said, first solicits opinions from around the doughnut-shaped conference table, only at the very end announcing where he stands.
In some ways he has been preparing for this moment for his entire life. Mr. Draghi's father, who died when Mario was 15, once worked at the Bank of Italy. Before a long career as a banker, the elder Mr. Draghi worked for a government agency under Mussolini that had been founded to restructure financial institutions and other companies in trouble because of the Great Depression.
As director general of the Italian Treasury, Mario Draghi, the steady hand just below a revolving cast of political appointees, was in charge of selling off the Italian phone company and other state assets in the 1990s. He had a knack for locating the sweet spot where the interests of the Italian government and investors coincided.
"Mario has incredibly finely tuned antennas when it comes to speaking to different people," said Philipp M. Hildebrand, former president of the Swiss National Bank, who represented an investment company during the privatization drive and later sat on a panel led by Mr. Draghi that negotiated international banking rules. When talks were at an impasse, Mr. Hildebrand said, "I remember sitting around the table thinking, 'I have no idea how to find a solution.' He managed."
The sweet spot Mr. Draghi must negotiate now is between the monetary hawks, especially in Germany, who say he has abused his power by going far beyond his inflation-fighting mandate, and the soft-money doves who say his failure is not going far enough to rescue the euro.
Mr. Draghi in turn has urged politicians to do more, dismayed by the way they eased up on their reform drives once the flood of cheap loans to banks calmed markets for a few months. The lesson was that big injections of cash from the European Central Bank produce little more than a sugar high unless they are accompanied by fundamental reforms to the currency union's architecture, changes that would convince investors that the euro zone is built for the long haul.
"Mario Draghi is going to be damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. Damned if he does because he'll be seen in Germany as caving in to irresponsible and profligate countries in the periphery," said Philip Whyte, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in London. "If he doesn't cave in, it's difficult to see how Greece can stay inside the euro zone."

Abstract: Media Rights, which is also behind David Fincher's forthcoming "House of Cards" series for Netflix, spent about $50 million to make "Ted." "Given that long runway, and the fact that there hasn't been a strong comedy yet this summer -- both 'The Dictator' and 'That's My Boy' disappointed -- 'Ted' should be a strong performer for weeks to come," Benjamin Carlson, president of Fizziology, a company that monitors social media to advise movie studios, wrote in an e-mail.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Moviegoers cuddled up to "Ted" in an unexpectedly impressive way over the weekend, turning a drug-loving teddy bear with a filthy mouth into a likely franchise star.
"Ted," the first film from Seth MacFarlane of "Family Guy" fame, took in an estimated $54.1 million at North American theaters, about 35 percent higher than the loftiest prerelease predictions. To compare, the first "Hangover" film -- which raked in over $467.5 million worldwide and spawned a series -- took in $48 million in its first weekend in 2009, after adjusting for inflation.
Put another way, "Ted" sold more tickets in its first three days than Johnny Depp ("Dark Shadows") and Tom Cruise ("Rock of Ages") recently did, combined, in theirs.
The R-rated "Ted," co-starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, is a triumph for Mr. MacFarlane. He directed "Ted," was a writer of the screenplay and performed the titular character's voice. It is also a crucial victory for its distributor, Universal Pictures, which released "Battleship" earlier in the summer movie season to disastrous results.
But "Ted" may mean the most to its financier, a quiet firm called Media Rights Capital. With roots stretching back to 2003, this production company -- built to give directors, writers and stars more earning power and control of their projects -- was starting to look like a tepid experiment. Releases like "Bruno" and "The Adjustment Bureau" were profitable in the end, but only slimly so.
"We've had singles and doubles, but 'Ted' is our first big, fat home run," Mordecai Wiczyk, co-chairman of Media Rights, said by telephone on Saturday. "What we are trying to do has been validated, especially for partners like Universal who believed in us from the early days."
Will "Ted" become a "Hangover"-style series?
"We're still digesting this weekend," Mr. Wiczyk said. When pressed, he added, "Everyone's talking about it, and certainly we would love to do it." A spokeswoman for Mr. MacFarlane said he was traveling on Sunday and unavailable to comment.
Media Rights, which is also behind David Fincher's forthcoming "House of Cards" series for Netflix, spent about $50 million to make "Ted." The film received a few scathing reviews, but critical notices were generally positive, and ticket buyers gave it an A-minus in exit polls.
Overall ticket sales in North America totaled $202 million for the weekend, a 3 percent increase over the same period last year, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office data. Steven Soderbergh's male-stripper movie, "Magic Mike," with Channing Tatum leading an ensemble cast, finished a stronger-than-expected second, taking in about $39.2 million. Warner Brothers released "Magic Mike," which cost just $7 million to make.
"Brave" (Walt Disney) was third, selling about $34 million in tickets, for a two-week domestic total of $131.7 million. "Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection" (Lionsgate), the fifth movie in that series, placed fourth, taking in about $26.4 million, slightly above its franchise predecessor. "Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted" (Paramount) was fifth, selling about $11.8 million in tickets, for a four-week total of $180 million.
Notably, "Ted" has little comedic competition in the weeks ahead.
"Given that long runway, and the fact that there hasn't been a strong comedy yet this summer -- both 'The Dictator' and 'That's My Boy' disappointed -- 'Ted' should be a strong performer for weeks to come," Benjamin Carlson, president of Fizziology, a company that monitors social media to advise movie studios, wrote in an e-mail.
"Ted" was born in 2006, when Mr. Wiczyk asked Mr. MacFarlane if he had movie aspirations. "Seth said, 'Well, I have this idea that opens up like a sweet little Disney movie and then becomes about a teddy bear that snorts coke and chases hookers,' " Mr. Wiczyk recalled. "And I immediately closed my office door and called my business partner and said, 'We're greenlighting this right now.' "
Mr. Wiczyk was particularly excited about international potential. American comedies often fail to translate overseas, and the ones that do tend to have a single joke at their center -- say, drinking too much ("The Hangover"). "Ted" does not open in most foreign markets until August or later.
Universal was Mr. Wiczyk's first studio stop; 20th Century Fox, which produces "Family Guy," also had an opportunity to grab the film. Fox wanted "Ted" but pushed to lower the budget; Universal got the business.
Hollywood's attention now swings to two megawatt superhero franchises: Sony unveils "The Amazing Spider-Man" on Tuesday -- advance interest has been quiet in the United States, but early ticket sales overseas are promising -- and Warner finishes its Batman trilogy with "The Dark Knight Rises" on July 20.
Doug Stone, president of Box Office Analyst, estimates that "The Amazing Spider-Man" should take in nearly $325 million in its domestic run, or about 13 percent less than "Spider-Man 3" in 2007, after adjusting for inflation. "The Dark Knight Rises" has a chance to surpass $500 million in North America, on par with its 2008 predecessor.

Abstract: Economists call this the adverse-selection problem. Because of it, unregulated private markets for individual insurance cannot accommodate the least healthy -- those who most desperately need health insurance. According to census data, 65 percent of workers had employer-backed plans in 2000, but only 55 percent were covered by 2010.

Full text: INTRADE, an online betting site with an excellent record for predicting events, pegged the odds of the Supreme Court overturning President Obama's health care overhaul law at almost 80 percent.
When the court affirmed the law's constitutionality on Thursday, many forecasters were astonished. The ruling came by the slimmest of margins and was defended, in places, by deeply flawed economic reasoning. But it has paved the way for an orderly rehabilitation of America's gravely dysfunctional health care system.
It was a complicated case, in part because the reform legislation itself was seriously flawed. The law's drafters could have proposed a simpler and more efficient system -- something more like the single-payer systems that have been adopted by most industrial countries.
But that would have meant abandoning the nation's current system of employer-provided health plans. That these plans are a catastrophically bad model for providing health care was beside the point. Forcing voters to abandon a status quo that most of them say they like would have doomed more ambitious proposals from the outset.
The important point is that because health reform had to be built atop the current system, each feature of the legislation upheld by the court was an essential precondition for that system's improvement.
Nearly every economic analysis of the health care industry rests on the observation that individually purchased private insurance is not a viable business model for providing medical services. Such insurance is broadly affordable only if most policy holders are healthy most of the time.
The fundamental problem is that insurers can often identify specific people -- like those with serious pre-existing conditions -- who are likely to need expensive care. Any company that issued policies to such people at affordable rates would be driven into bankruptcy, its most profitable customers lured away by competitors offering lower rates made possible by selling only to healthy people.
Economists call this the adverse-selection problem. Because of it, unregulated private markets for individual insurance cannot accommodate the least healthy -- those who most desperately need health insurance.
Many countries solve this problem by having the government provide health insurance for all. In some, like Britain, the government employs the care providers. Others, like France, reimburse private practitioners -- as does the Medicare program for older Americans.
The United States probably would have adopted one of those models had it not been for historical accidents that led to widespread adoption of employer-provided plans in the 1940s. To control costs of World War II mobilization, regulators capped growth of private-sector wages, making it hard for employers to hire desperately needed workers.
But because many fringe benefits weren't capped, employers spied a loophole: they could offer additional benefits, like health insurance. Its cost was deductible as a business expense, and in 1943 the Internal Revenue Service ruled that its value was not taxable as employee income. By 1953, employer health plans covered 63 percent of workers, versus only 9 percent in 1940.
Eligibility for favorable tax treatment hinged on the plans being available to all employees, a feature that mitigated a serious defect. Although hiring workers with pre-existing conditions meant paying higher premiums, tight labor markets made many employers willing to bear that cost, because insurance was an effective recruiting tool.
Employer plans are thus a significant improvement over individual private insurance, but they are still deeply flawed. If you lose your job, you can lose your coverage. This problem has been cast into sharp relief by the persistent high unemployment in the wake of the financial crisis. In no other industrial country do we see communities organizing bake sales to help defray the cost of an uninsured neighbor's cancer treatments.
The decline in the number of workers covered by employer plans began long before the recent crisis. According to census data, 65 percent of workers had employer-backed plans in 2000, but only 55 percent were covered by 2010. This decline has been driven in part by rapid increases in health care costs.
Economists agree that no matter how those costs are apportioned on paper, any money spent on employer-sponsored plans ultimately comes at the expense of wages. Real wages have risen little in recent decades, and the prospect that they will keep stagnating portends further erosions in coverage. So even if we ignore the inherent failings of the employer model, it simply won't be able to deliver broad health coverage.
Modeled after proposals advanced by the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute and other conservative research organizations in the 1990s, the main provisions of the president's health care law were intended to eliminate the most salient problems associated with the current system.
One provision establishes insurance exchanges, where participating companies must offer coverage to all customers, irrespective of pre-existing conditions. Another imposes a financial penalty on those who fail to obtain coverage -- the individual mandate. And a third prescribes subsidies to make insurance more affordable for low-income families. (The Massachusetts plan engineered by Mitt Romney as governor in 2006 took an almost identical approach.)
WITHOUT each of its three main provisions, the law won't work. The individual mandate, of course, is the most debated. Critics denounce it as a violation of our liberty. Paradoxically, the slim majority on the court that affirmed the mandate's constitutionality seemed to embrace that view, likening the mandate to requiring citizens to eat broccoli for their own good. The court defended the constitutionality of the mandate by calling it a tax rather than a penalty.
But that interpretation will strike many economists as a misreading of the mandate's purpose. It isn't that people should buy health insurance because it would be good for them. Rather, failure to do so would cause significant harm to others. Society will always step in to provide care -- though in much more costly and often delayed and ineffective forms -- to the uninsured who fall ill. To claim the right not to buy health insurance is thus to assert a right to impose enormous costs on others. Many legal scholars insist that the Constitution guarantees no such right.
No one can be sure how the law will play out. But its critics would be unwise to assume that it would have been easy to draft superior legislation had the law been overturned. Any new attempt would have taken the employer-based system as a starting point.
What's important now is how the health care sector will evolve under the new framework. And here, there are grounds for optimism. While the effects of the court's Medicaid restrictions aren't entirely clear, the law will certainly extend coverage to tens of millions who now lack it. In addition, new insurance exchanges will provide a broader array of care options. Increased competition tends to hold costs in check, even while enhancing service quality, and there's no reason to expect the situation in health care to be different.
Many scholars have argued that private, nonprofit institutions like the Mayo Clinic are the most effective model of providing care, and not only because they can better coordinate across many specialties. They are also less likely than traditional fee-for-service practices to prescribe unnecessary tests and procedures. Given those advantages, such institutions, or ones that mimic them, might have spread even without health care reform. After all, employers have an interest in providing cost-effective care for their workers.
But no matter which model proves most effective, it is likely to spread faster in the competitive environment established by the insurance exchanges.
The new law will hardly be the final word on these issues. Though it takes tentative first steps on cost control, government budgets will be decimated unless we do much more to reduce inflation in medical services. And in Medicare, many tough decisions remain to be made about end-of-life interventions, and whether Medicare should become an optional form of coverage for those who aren't elderly.
The point worth celebrating is that last week's ruling will at last enable our distinctly dysfunctional health care system to evolve into something better.

Full text: Iran's ambassador to the United Nations said Friday that negotiations with the big powers over the disputed Iranian nuclear program had reached a "critical point," implicitly raising the possibility of failure, because of the new regimen of harsh economic sanctions that have just been imposed on his country by the United States and European Union.
"This by itself indicates that they are not willing to engage with us in a meaningful dialogue," the ambassador, Mohammad Khazaee, told reporters at a news conference convened by Iran's United Nations mission to present its view of the nuclear negotiations, which have made scant progress after three rounds of high-level talks since April.
A meeting of lower-level negotiators representing Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 group of nations -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany -- is set for Tuesday in Istanbul.
Mr. Khazaee rarely holds news conferences, and the timing suggested that Iranian officials were posturing to lay the groundwork for possible disappointment or worse at the meeting in Turkey.
While he expressed hope for progress, he said, "at the same time it is clear to us that some members of the 5-plus-1, for whatever reasons, obviously and mainly political reasons, are not forthcoming and serious enough for finding a solution."
"If the talks do not proceed as they should," he added, "we are going to have another standoff in the talks. Therefore, we can say that we are at a critical point in our talks with some members of the 5-plus-1."
He spoke a day after a new American law took effect that penalized countries that did business with Iran's central bank by denying their banks access to the United States market. Twenty nations that had significantly reduced their reliance on Iranian oil were exempted from the law, including China, Iran's biggest customer.
On Sunday, the European Union will invoke a potentially more damaging sanction on Iran, banning imports of Iranian oil and prohibiting Europe-based insurers from covering Iranian oil shipped anywhere. That measure has already caused havoc for Iran as well as many non-European customers because Europe dominates the maritime insurance business.
American and European diplomats have said Iran's willingness to even talk about its nuclear program is the result of pressure from the sanctions, which have already caused a plunge in Iran's exports of oil and contributed to a sharp rise in inflation there.
Mr. Khazaee restated Iran's longstanding contention that the sanctions had to be rescinded before negotiations could succeed. But he also said sanctions pressure, no matter how damaging, would do nothing to change the Iranian position in the dispute. "We have learned how to cope with these problems," he said.
The P5-plus-1 group has said Iran must abide by Security Council resolutions that demand that it halt enrichment of uranium and answer questions about activities that United Nations nuclear inspectors have raised regarding possible military applications of the Iranian nuclear program.
Iran contends that the Security Council resolutions are invalid because Iran has signed the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which entitles it to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes. Iran has also said that its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has banned nuclear weapons as un-Islamic.
Mr. Khazaee reiterated those points and criticized what he called the West's double standard of suspecting the motives of Iran but not those of Israel, which has nuclear weapons and has not signed the nonproliferation treaty. Israel has never officially acknowledged its nuclear arsenal, but it is believed to have 75 to 200 nuclear weapons, according to the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based group.

Full text: Eleven times your final working salary.
That's how much an average worker needs beyond Social Security, from sources like personal savings and employer benefits, to pay for retirement at age 65, a new analysis from the benefits consultant Aon Hewitt finds. The estimate takes into account inflation and postretirement medical costs. And it is based on the retiree's continuing the same standard of living.
Delaying retirement to age 67 reduces the amount to 9.4 times pay, while retiring earlier, at age 62, increases it to 13.5 times pay, the report said.
The analysis, which examined the projected retirement levels of about 2.2 million employees at 78 large companies in the United States, found that most employees were not on track to meet the goal of 11 times pay.
Most "full career" employees are on track to save 8.8 times their final pay, leaving a shortfall of 2.2 times pay, the analysis found. That's a bit better than the shortfall of 2.4 times pay in 2010. Full-career employees are those who have a potential career of 30 years or more with their current employer before retirement, and who are saving in a defined-contribution retirement plan, like a 401(k).

I believe a simpler formula that says you need about $1.5 million in the bank or the equivalent income from pensions and Social Security to produce earnings of not less than $60,000 per person until about age 89 is easier. It's a high bar but it is possible to do this. Working hard and saving for the last 45 years helped a bit. Oh, and having health care is critical. I wish that we had some good old-fashioned certificates of deposit that are insured and could earn 6 to 8 percent and I'd feel much more secure.

Full text: Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, have both argued correctly that the slowing global economy requires decisive action by political leaders.
Mr. Bernanke has come as close to pleading with Congress as a Fed chairman can, telling lawmakers on several occasions that the Fed alone cannot repair the economy and asking them for "help," "support" and "collaboration." That's all Fed-speak for "more federal spending, now, please."
Mr. Draghi, for his part, has sternly said, "It is not right for monetary policy to fill other institutions' lack of action," a reference to the urgent need for Europe's leaders to resolve the euro crisis.
But what if politicians refuse to act?
In the United States, legislative obstructionism is the approach of Republicans who do not want the economy to improve before Election Day. In Europe, a European Union summit meeting later this week will give leaders yet another chance to deliver on stimulus, banking reforms and political strategies to stabilize the euro zone. But the experience of the past two years suggests that they will do too little, too slowly.
Meanwhile, growth is faltering. The Fed now expects the United States economy to expand by 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent in 2012, down from its forecast of 3.5 percent a year ago. The European Central Bank's economic forecast for the euro zone this year is -0.5 percent to 0.3 percent growth. And that's being optimistic.
Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Draghi would clearly prefer to act in concert with politicians. But with the economy relapsing, more aggressive action is overdue. For the Fed, that means renewed quantitative easing, an attempt to lower long-term borrowing rates and spur demand by creating money with which to purchase bonds. To send the message that help will be provided as long as the economy remains weak, a bond-buying program or other support should be tied to specific goals for lower unemployment, higher inflation or stronger overall growth.
The European Central Bank can start with the obvious: cutting its benchmark interest rate below 1 percent, coupled with resurrecting its own moribund bond-buying program. The growth and inflation that could result from these measures would help to counteract the ills unleashed by excessive and premature fiscal austerity.
In recent Congressional testimony on growth and jobs, Mr. Bernanke again told lawmakers that the Fed could not fix the economy on its own. "I'd feel much more comfortable if Congress would take some of this burden from us and address these issues," he said. We all would. Likewise, people in Europe surely expect more from their political leaders, though such expectations have gone unmet. The European Central Bank policy setters meet next week. The Fed meets again at the end of July. It's past time for them to take stronger action.

Full text: Among economists who know their history, the mere mention of certain years evokes shivers. For example, three years ago Christina Romer, then the head of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, warned politicians not to re-enact 1937 -- the year F.D.R. shifted, far too soon, from fiscal stimulus to austerity, plunging the recovering economy back into recession. Unfortunately, this advice was ignored.
But now I'm hearing more and more about an even more fateful year. Suddenly normally calm economists are talking about 1931, the year everything fell apart.
It started with a banking crisis in a small European country (Austria). Austria tried to step in with a bank rescue -- but the spiraling cost of the rescue put the government's own solvency in doubt. Austria's troubles shouldn't have been big enough to have large effects on the world economy, but in practice they created a panic that spread around the world. Sound familiar?
The really crucial lesson of 1931, however, was about the dangers of policy abdication. Stronger European governments could have helped Austria manage its problems. Central banks, notably the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve, could have done much more to limit the damage. But nobody with the power to contain the crisis stepped up to the plate; everyone who could and should have acted declared that it was someone else's responsibility.
And it's happening again, both in Europe and in America.
Consider first how European leaders have been handling the banking crisis in Spain. (Forget about Greece, which is pretty much a lost cause; Spain is where the fate of Europe will be decided.) Like Austria in 1931, Spain has troubled banks that desperately need more capital, but the Spanish government now, like Austria's government then, faces questions about its own solvency.
So what should European leaders -- who have an overwhelming interest in containing the Spanish crisis -- do? It seems obvious that European creditor nations need, one way or another, to assume some of the financial risks facing Spanish banks. No, Germany won't like it -- but with the very survival of the euro at stake, a bit of financial risk should be a small consideration.
But no. Europe's "solution" was to lend money to the Spanish government, and tell that government to bail out its own banks. It took financial markets no time at all to figure out that this solved nothing, that it just put Spain's government more deeply in debt. And the European crisis is now deeper than ever.
Yet let's not ridicule the Europeans, since many of our own policy makers are acting just as irresponsibly. And I'm not just talking about Congressional Republicans, who often seem as if they are deliberately trying to sabotage the economy.
Let's talk instead about the Federal Reserve. The Fed has a so-called dual mandate: it's supposed to seek both price stability and full employment. And last week the Fed released its latest set of economic projections, showing that it expects to fail on both parts of its mandate, with inflation below target and unemployment far above target for years to come.
This is a terrible prospect, and the Fed knows it. Ben Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, has warned in particular about the damage being done to America by the unprecedented level of long-term unemployment.
So what does the Fed propose doing about the situation? Almost nothing. True, last week the Fed announced some actions that would supposedly boost the economy. But I think it's fair to say that everyone at all familiar with the situation regards these actions as pathetically inadequate -- the bare minimum the Fed could do to deflect accusations that it is doing nothing at all.
Why won't the Fed act? My guess is that it's intimidated by those Congressional Republicans, that it's afraid to do anything that might be seen as providing political aid to President Obama, that is, anything that might help the economy. Maybe there's some other explanation, but the fact is that the Fed, like the European Central Bank, like the U.S. Congress, like the government of Germany, has decided that avoiding economic disaster is somebody else's responsibility.
None of this should be happening. As in 1931, Western nations have the resources they need to avoid catastrophe, and indeed to restore prosperity -- and we have the added advantage of knowing much more than our great-grandparents did about how depressions happen and how to end them. But knowledge and resources do no good if those who possess them refuse to use them.
And that's what seems to be happening. The fundamentals of the world economy aren't, in themselves, all that scary; it's the almost universal abdication of responsibility that fills me, and many other economists, with a growing sense of dread.

Full text: Washington
IN a partisan country locked in a polarizing campaign, there is no shortage of much discussed divisions: religious and secular, the 99 percent and the 1 percent, red America and blue America.
But you can make a strong case that one dividing line has actually received too little attention. It's the line between young and old.
Draw it at the age of 65, 50 or 40. Wherever the line is, the people on either side of it end up looking very different, both economically and politically. The generation gap may not be a pop culture staple, as it was in the 1960s, but it is probably wider than it has been at any time since then.
Throughout the 1980s and '90s, younger and older adults voted in largely similar ways, with a majority of each supporting the winner in every presidential election. Sometime around 2004, though, older voters began moving right, while younger voters shifted left. This year, polls suggest that Mitt Romneywill win a landslide among the over-65 crowd and that President Obama will do likewise among those under 40.
Beyond political parties, the two have different views on many of the biggest questions before the country. The young not only favor gay marriage and school funding more strongly; they are also notably less religious, more positive toward immigrants, less hostile to Social Security cuts and military cuts and more optimistic about the country's future. They are both more open to change and more confident that life in the United States will remain good.
Their optimism is especially striking in the context of their economic troubles. Older Americans have obviously suffered in recent years, with many now fearing a significantly diminished retirement. But the economic slump of the last decade -- a mediocre expansion, followed by a terrible downturn -- has still taken a much higher toll on the young. Less established in their working lives, they have struggled to get hired and to hold on to jobs.
The wealth gap between households headed by someone over 65 and those headed by someone under 35 is wider than at any point since the Federal Reserve Board began keeping consistent data in 1989. The gap in homeownership is the largest since Census Bureau data began in 1982. The income gap is also at a recorded high; median inflation-adjusted income for households headed by people between 25 and 34 has dropped 11 percent in the last decade while remaining essentially unchanged for the 55-to-64 age group.
If there is a theme unifying these economic and political trends, in fact, it is that the young are generally losing out to the old. On a different subject, Warren E. Buffett, 81, has joked that there really is a class war in this country -- and that his class is winning it. He could say the same about a generational war.
Younger adults are faring worse in the private sector and, in large part because they have less political power, have a less generous safety net beneath them. Older Americans vote at higher rates and are better organized. There is no American Association of Non-Retired Persons. "Pell grants," notes the political scientist Kay Lehman Schlozman, "have never been called the third rail of American politics."
Over all, more than 50 percent of federal benefits flow to the 13 percent of the population over 65. Some of these benefits come from Social Security, which many people pay for over the course of their working lives. But a large chunk comes through Medicare, and contrary to widespread perception, most Americans do not come close to paying for their own Medicare benefits through payroll taxes. Medicare, in addition to being the largest source of the country's projected budget deficits, is a transfer program from young to old.
Meanwhile, education spending -- the area that the young say should be cut the least, polls show -- is taking deep cuts. The young also want the government to take action to slow global warming; Congress shows no signs of doing so. Even on same-sex marriage, where public opinion is moving toward youthful opinion, all 31 states that have held referendums on the matter have voted against same-sex marriage.
Over the long term, obviously, the young have a distinct advantage: they're not going away. So one of the central questions for the future of American politics is whether today's 20- and 30-year-olds will hold on to many of the opinions they have today, a pattern that would be less surprising than glib cliches about aging and conservatism suggest. Until recently, as the presidential results from the 1970s through the 1990s make clear, Americans did not grow much more conservative as they aged.
And while today's young are not down-the-line liberal -- they favor private accounts for Social Security and have reservations about government actions to protect online privacy -- they certainly lean left.
No one knows exactly why, but there are some suspects. Having grown up surrounded by diversity, they are socially liberal, almost unconsciously so. Many of them also came of age in the (ultimately unpopular) George W. Bush presidency, or the (ultimately popular) Bill Clinton presidency, and pollsters at the Pew Research Center argue that the president during a generation's formative years casts a long shadow, for better or worse. Hammered by the economic downturn, young voters say they want government to play a significant role in the economy.
These attitudes create a challenge for the Republican Party that is arguably as big as its better known struggles for the votes of Latinos. "We've got a generation of young people who are more socially liberal and more open to activist government," says Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew center, which has done some of the most extensive generational polling. "They are quite distinct."
Shortly after Mr. Bush won re-election in 2004, just when the age gap was emerging, his chief campaign strategist, Matthew Dowd, wrote a memo to other top Bush aides urging them not to assume that a new Republican majority was emerging. The exit polls, he wrote to Karl Rove and others, showed that younger voters had voted strongly Democratic, and those voters would be in the electorate for a long time to come.
"They don't think the Republican Party thinks like them," much as older voters feel alienated by what they see as today's immigrant-embracing, gay-friendly, activist-government Democratic Party, Mr. Dowd said last week. "I don't expect these younger voters to wake up all of a sudden when they're 38 years old and say, 'I was for gay marriage before, but now I'm against it.' "
Still, it would be mistake to assume that today's young are going to be Democrats for life. Many children of the 1960s, after all, grew up to be Ronald Reagan voters. The political landscape shifts over time. Frustrated by a weak economy and a government that disproportionately benefits the old, younger adults could become ever more reluctant to send tax dollars to Washington. The Republican Party could grow more libertarian and thus more in line with the social views of the young.
What seems clear is that the marketing gurus are finally right: today's young really are different. They view a boisterously diverse United States as a fact of life, and they view life as clearly better than it used to be. But they are also products of the longest economic slump in 70 years, and they would like a little help. They wish the country would devote more attention to its future, especially on education and the climate. They, of course, will have to live with that future.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
TIME may -- or may not -- be running out for one of the biggest tax breaks for wealthy Americans: the chance to give up to $5.12 million to heirs tax-free and then pay a comparatively low 35 percent rate on any gift above that. The break is scheduled to expire in six months, but no one will hazard a guess about its fate because it is just one of many tax and spending measures expiring at the same time.
When this break was agreed upon by President Obama and the Republican Congress at the end of 2010, I expected it would spur the wealthiest to give away huge amounts of their estate to take advantage of the break. (The original $5 million limit was increased this year for inflation; it is separate from the $13,000 annual exclusion gift.) But the rush that I expected was initially just a trickle. While the tax break was enticing, the fear of what lay ahead in the economy and financial markets made people cautious.
Now, some of the wealthy are faced with a choice that seems designed by a behavioral economist to test rational decision-making: Do they give their heirs the full amount of the exemption, happy that the money will help the heirs now and reduce their eventual estate tax bill? Or do they give less, or none at all, for fear that they could be left with not enough to live on?
"I've gone through this with lots of people, and based on the reactions, no one whose net worth is in the nine figures has worried about having enough," said Edward F. Koren, chairman of private wealth services at the Holland & Knight law firm. "Below that, it depends on their spending levels and their values. That's so personal to the client."
The deadline for making a decision is fast approaching because advisers say it takes at least three months to do everything that needs to be done to set up a gift of this size.
All advisers agree that every financial decision is about more than saving on taxes. But in this instance, the math on both taxes and compound interest is compelling, particularly for younger people with wealth who have decades to live.
While none of the advisers would make a prediction on what might happen, no one thought the exemption would remain this high or the tax this low in 2013. After years of a $1 million gift exemption, the advisers agreed that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Adding to the benefit of the large tax exemption is the amount the gifted money can grow. For a child who received $5 million today in a trust that was invested broadly, that gift could grow in 30 years to nearly $29 million, at a 6 percent return every year, according to calculations by Jonathan Blattmachr, a principal of Eagle River Advisors, which consults on estate planning. Meanwhile, the parents' estate would have been reduced by $29 million, cutting the tax due on the estate.
And that is why some wealthy people -- those who could run out of money in their lifetime -- have been seduced by this opportunity but are, at the same time, trying to work out how to do it. (The exemption for the estate tax is also $5.12 million until the end of the year, but, obviously, only those who die in 2012 can take advantage of it.)
Some people are also questioning the effect such a large gift will have on their heirs. Their main concern is that it will it rob their children of motivation, said Catherine McDermott, senior wealth planning strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank.
But she said that fear may be misplaced. "A lot of the education around stewardship of wealth occurs during a lifetime as you're raising children," she said. "Many of those questions parents face as they're raising children."
In other words, by the time you have made enough money to think about leaving a lot of it to your heirs, you have either set them on the right path in life or led them to believe that your money will be their cushion.
For those who do decide to make a substantial gift, there are many different ways to do it. Writing a check is the simplest way, but advisers would tell you that would leave the money unprotected against creditors. It would also waste an opportunity to use various strategies to multiply the gift.
Putting appreciated securities in a trust would seem to be a good idea, but that could lock up liquid assets that might be needed.
Another option for people worried about having enough liquid assets is to put real estate or a share in a private business into a trust.
"Transferring a home doesn't feel the same as transferring $5 million in stocks or bonds," said Diane E. Lederman, president and chief executive of the Neuberger Berman Trust Company.
She cautioned that anyone doing this should make sure that all the paperwork was perfect because the people making the gift would essentially be renting their home back from a trust in their heirs' names. "When you're giving an asset away and you're continuing to reside there, it's going to attract I.R.S. scrutiny," she said.
But those who worry that they may need the money back should understand that a gift that satisfies the Internal Revenue Service has to be irrevocable, and the person making that gift can no longer have control over the assets.
That would seem to be straightforward, but the world of tax planning is anything but. Mr. Blattmachr, who built his own wealth interpreting tax law for his clients at the law firm Milbank Tweed, where he was a partner for 35 years, has structured trusts with his wife, Betsy, that are so complex they boggle the mind. They enable the Blattmachrs to take advantage of the current exemptions and gift money today to reduce future estate taxes. But he has structured the trusts, which each hold about $4 million, in such a way that they have a built-in safety valve if something goes wrong: they can get the money back.
One risk to trusts like these is that they mirror each other and could then get disallowed by the I.R.S.
Another risk would be if the Blattmachrs divorced, but after 42 years of marriage, he said he was not worried about that. Many estate planners are wary of these trusts. "There is very little out there from the I.R.S. on this," said Paige Ben-Yaakov, a partner in the tax section at the law firm Baker Botts. "It's not as easy as taking the assets and giving them away because you know that works."
Mr. Blattmachr has put great effort into making sure his trusts will be allowed. At the beginning of 2011, he began setting up his trust, naming his children, grandchild and his wife as beneficiaries. Earlier this year, he set up a trust for his wife that named their children, grandchild and him as beneficiaries. Setting up trusts at different times is one way to counter any future allegations by the I.R.S. that the gifts were not real and the trusts were reciprocal.
But Mr. Blattmachr went further. He put their two homes in his trust -- and now lives in them as a guest of his wife -- and put securities in her trust. He made sure the trusts had different sets of trustees, giving her the right to replace hers but denying himself that ability. Her trustees can convert her trust to pay her 4 percent a year regardless of the principal; his can make distributions only for health, maintenance and support.
"The I.R.S. always wants the low-hanging fruit," Mr. Blattmachr said. "You want to get yourself way, way up in the tree."
He added, "I don't think any one can tell you that this absolutely works or this absolutely doesn't work. But what they're going to tell you is the I.R.S. will go after others before you."

Full text: San Francisco
ON June 23, 1982, in Detroit, a young man named Vincent Chin died. Four nights earlier, he had been enjoying his bachelor party with friends at a local bar when they were accosted by two white men, who blamed them for the success of Japan's auto industry. "It's because of you we're out of work," they were said to have shouted, adding a word that can't be printed here. The men bludgeoned Mr. Chin, 27, with a baseball bat until his head cracked open.
The men -- a Chrysler plant supervisor named Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz -- never denied the acts, but they insisted that the matter was simply a bar brawl that had ended badly for one of the parties. In an agreement with prosecutors, they pleaded to manslaughter (down from second-degree murder) and were sentenced to three years of probation and fined $3,000.
I was a Chinese-American teenager growing up near Detroit then. I remember the haunting photograph of a smiling, fresh-faced Mr. Chin, shown repeatedly in newspapers and on TV, and the tears of his mother, Lily Chin, who lamented that his killers had escaped justice. Mr. Chin was buried on the day he was to have been married.
The killing catalyzed political activity among Asian-Americans -- whose numbers had steadily increased since the 1965 overhaul of immigration laws but who then represented only about 1.5 percent of the population -- as never before. "Remember Vincent Chin" turned into a rallying cry; for the first time, Asian-Americans of every background angrily protested in cities across the country. For all that Asians had been through -- racial exclusion, starting with a ban on Chinese migrant labor in 1882; the unconstitutional detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II; the legacy of America's wars in the Philippines, Korea and Vietnam -- no single episode involving an individual Asian-American had ever had such an effect before. And none has since.
The circumstances of the Chin case were no accident. The early 1980s were, like now, a time of malaise. The unemployment rate was at its highest since World War II; inflation was stuck in the double digits; "Japan Inc." threatened to devour not only Detroit manufacturing but also New York real estate. White flight had emptied a great metropolis that once stood for industrial progress. Imported cars became a hated symbol of foreign encroachment.
Spurred by Asian-American activists, federal prosecutors brought civil rights charges against the two assailants in 1983. (The men denied using racial epithets, as some witnesses had reported.) The stepfather, Mr. Ebens, was convicted of violating Mr. Chin's civil rights and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but the conviction was overturned on appeal.
The Chin case showed the power of the saying "You all look the same." An assimilated son of Chinese immigrants somehow came to be identified with Japanese automakers. (That Asian-Americans made up much of the engineering force at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler seems not to have occurred to the attackers.)
"Asian-Americans" -- a term that many Asian-Americans themselves do not use -- are, of course, more a demographic category than a community arising from shared language, religion, history or culture. Yet for all our diversity, we share an experience of otherness. The fifth-generation Japanese-American from California, the Hmong refugee in Wisconsin, the Indian engineer in Texas, the Korean adoptee in Chicago and the Pakistani taxi driver in New York -- all have at times been made to feel alien, sometimes immutably so.
Thirty years after Mr. Chin's death, hate crimes seem to be a remote threat for Asian-Americans. But it is premature, if tempting, to celebrate progress.
On Tuesday, a Pew Research Center study, "The Rise of Asian-Americans," reported that Asians overtook Hispanics in 2009 as the country's fastest-growing ethnic group and now represent 5.8 percent of the population. It reported that Asian-Americans, on the whole, have higher incomes and better educations than whites, blacks or Latinos.
Though the study noted that discrimination, poverty and language barriers still confront refugees, undocumented immigrants and other vulnerable groups, Asian-American advocates for social justice winced. Despite decades of debunking by social scientists and historians, the model minority myth -- Asian-Americans as overachieving nerds -- persists. The study was based on a rigorous survey, though relying on self-reported attitudes and behaviors is not a fireproof methodology.
But the more important criticism is this: When it comes to race, nuance matters. The Pew findings encourage us to consider how positive attitudes may contribute to socioeconomic success. But history also teaches us that before Asian-Americans were seen as model minorities, we were also perpetual foreigners. Taken together, these perceptions can lead to resentment. And resentment can lead to hate.
Vincent Chin has lived longer in memory than reality. Today China, not Japan, is on the rise. Another recession has come to an uneasy close. Detroit limps along. Asian-Americans, through increasing civic participation, have asserted themselves as members of the body politic and reached some of the highest offices in government, academia and business.
Asian-Americans who have achieved success owe a debt to the agitators who followed the Chin case, often defying their own cultural backgrounds as well as the stereotype of passivity and quiescence. Everyone who cares about the promise of our increasingly diverse nation ought to see in this case the possibility of social change arising from tragic violence.

Full text: IPOJUCA, Brazil -- More than 40,000 laborers swarm the port complex here in northeast Brazil, building a refinery for the state oil company. Five thousand others toil at a shipyard, another government-led project. Real estate prices are soaring and unemployment is falling in this region along the Atlantic coast, once known for its festering poverty.
In a show of the extraordinary sway that Brazil's government wields in nearly every important area of the economy, President Dilma Rousseff is accelerating an array of stimulus projects throughout the country aimed at blunting a slowdown that has reduced Brazil's economic growth to a snail's pace.
Ms. Rousseff's assertiveness in enhancing the government's role in molding economic policy is not wholly unlike China's state-led investment, an increasingly popular model in the developing world. Brazil's stimulus spending has helped preserve jobs, keeping unemployment at a historic low of 5.8 percent, down from 13 percent a decade ago. Months into a sharp slowdown, Ms. Rousseff's approval ratings stand at more than 60 percent.
But in an echo of the debate about heavy government borrowing in the United States and Europe after the global downturn, Ms. Rouseff's moves are starting to meet resistance in Brazil. Some experts fear that Brazil is becoming too dependent on government intervention to smooth the ups and downs of an economy that remains tied to commodity cycles; others fear that the creation of state-supported champions in the business world give the government even greater power to dictate policy shifts, potentially eroding Brazil's exposure to market forces.
Economists here still have unhappy memories of the aftermath of the "Brazilian miracle" of the late 1960s and early '70s, when a state-directed boom fostered fast growth for a time, but ended in rapid inflation, low productivity and a radical restructuring of the economy.
"The government is pressing ahead with projects of pharaonic proportions, when areas like basic sanitation need urgent attention," said Sergio Lazzarini, an economist at Insper, a Sao Paulo business school, who has written widely on Brazil's state capitalism. The investment push is already showing signs of strain. So many infrastructure projects have been approved at once, including stadiums for the World Cup soccer tournament in 2014 and hydroelectric plants in the Amazon, that the government is having a hard time spending all the money allocated. For instance, just a fifth of the $7 billion budgeted for highway projects in 2012 has been spent.
In Ipojuca, contractors on state projects are luring workers from other government investment priorities, like the construction of a network of concrete canals in the Sertao, the semiarid hinterland in northeast Brazil. Delays and cost overruns, partly because of labor shortages, have plagued big stretches of that project, which is part of a $4 billion effort to divert the flow of the Sao Francisco River to villages in need of irrigation.
Ms. Rousseff vigorously defends her response to the slowdown (Brazil eked out 0.2 percent growth in the first quarter). In a speech this month, she drew a stark comparison to the austerity policies in Europe, where more than half of the young people in some countries are without jobs. "We don't have a vision which justifies an adjustment leaving 54 percent of a country's young people without work," she said. "We never thought that way; our policy is clearly in defense of employment."
Ms. Rousseff's position reflects Brazil's fiscal running room, since improvements in tax collection and the earlier surge in the economy helped bolster state finances. But her thinking is also rooted in Brazil's strong tradition of government leadership of the economy.
The officials at the helm of Brazil's state-controlled companies argue that the nation still needs such sprawling projects to consolidate the gains in reducing inequality. "It's a catalyst of job creation," Maria das Gracas Foster, the chief executive of the national oil company, Petrobras, said in an interview, referring to policies requiring Petrobras to buy Brazilian-made ships even though state-supported shipyards are mired in delays.
Brazil has a web of state-controlled energy companies, including Petrobras, and banks like Banco do Brasil, Latin America's largest lender by assets.
More subtly, but with perhaps even greater lasting impact, the authorities also wield economic influence through the National Bank for Social and Economic Development, an institution in Rio de Janeiro that has mushroomed, lending four times as much as the World Bank does around the globe.
Like the World Bank, the national development bank finances big infrastructure projects aimed at alleviating poverty and boosting development. Founded in 1952, the bank remained under state control throughout Brazil's privatization wave in the 1990s, even financing many of the government auctions of state companies.
Under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government, from 2003 to 2010, the bank aggressively expanded, acquiring minority stakes in a number of private companies. Some are huge, like JBS, the world's largest meatpacker. Others are start-ups, like Bug Agentes Biologicos, which mass-produces wasps to combat the larvae threatening soybean crops.
Altogether, the development bank, along with the pension funds of big state companies, now hold stakes in nearly 200 Brazilian companies, up from 95 a decade ago. In some cases, these holdings allow the government to oust powerful corporate leaders. They showed that capacity in 2011, forcing Roger Agnelli, chief executive of the mining giant Vale, to resign after he upset officials by firing 1,300 employees and slashing investments in Brazil.
Ms. Rousseff's government is showing its teeth to Brazil's financial elite again this year. She has seized on the economic slowdown as an opportunity to persuade Brazil's private banks to lower interest rates, which until recently were among the highest in the world, by pushing Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal, another large state bank, to cut their own rates.
Initially, the response from Brazil's powerful banking establishment was tepid. "You can take a horse to the riverbank, but you can't force it to drink water," Rubens Sardenberg, chief economist of the powerful Febraban association of banks in Sao Paulo, said in May.
The reaction from Ms. Rousseff's office was blunt. "The horse can die of thirst," said an official in her government, reflecting the president's irritation. The banking group promptly withdrew the economist's comments, and private banks started following the giant state banks in lowering rates.
Perhaps aware of such reactions, Brazil's business establishment rarely voices explicit criticism of state intervention in the economy. But while Brazil remains far more receptive to private investment than neighboring Argentina, concern is nevertheless building as growth stalls.
While bowing to her wishes, some business interests are starting to chafe under Ms. Rousseff's interventionist policies. "We urgently need to shift our course," the influential business magazine Exame said in an editorial this month, complaining about what it called Ms. Rousseff's "strong hand."
Concerns have emerged over growing consumer debt, with nine million Brazilians taking out loans in 2011 for the first time. At the same time, the valuations of some of Brazil's largest companies have declined, and the currency, the real, has tumbled against the dollar.
Ipojuca is in Pernambuco State, where both the advantages and drawbacks are on display of the heavy reliance on the government for investment decisions. On the positive side is Brazil's resilience at a time of global economic turbulence.
"Of course, we're concerned about contagion reaching our shores, but there is no sense of crisis at the moment," said Frederico da Costa Amancio, chief executive of the Port of Suape, home to the Petrobras refinery that is under construction alongside factories that produce everything from wind-power turbines to potato chips.
But in villages like Agrovila Seis in the interior, state investment has been a mixed blessing. After a windfall in 2007, when the earth-moving machines arrived and foremen started hiring workers to dig canals intended to divert the Sao Francisco River, the optimism dissipated after contractors began suspending work last year, raising fears of white elephants on the Sertao.
Ms. Rousseff personally visited the work sites in February. Later, she vowed to increase the number of workers on the project by the end of the year to 6,500 from 4,500. Still, Agrovila Seis is limping along for now, reflecting the disarray of one of Brazil's largest infrastructure projects. Empty housing for workers gives part of the village the feel of a ghost town.
"I try not to feel despondent about my debts," said Eliane da Silva, a restaurant owner in the village who took out loans to buy equipment; her clientele, made up largely of work crews, has plunged. "I try to imagine where all the money went for this project."

Full text: Anna J. Schwartz, a research economist who wrote monumental works on American financial history in collaboration with the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman while remaining largely in his shadow, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.
Her death was confirmed by her daughter Naomi Pasachoff.
Mrs. Schwartz, who earned her Ph.D. in economics at the age of 48 and dispensed policy appraisals well into her 90s, was often called the "high priestess of monetarism," upholding a school of thought that maintains that the size and turnover of the money supply largely determines the pace of inflation and economic activity.
The Friedman-Schwartz collaboration "A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960," a book of nearly 900 pages published in 1963, is considered a classic. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, called it "the leading and most persuasive explanation of the worst economic disaster in American history."
The authors concluded that policy failures by the Fed, which largely controls the money supply, were one of the root causes of the Depression.
Mr. Bernanke acknowledged as much when he spoke at a 90th birthday celebration for Mr. Friedman in 2002. "I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right, we did it," he said. "We're very sorry, but thanks to you we won't do it again."
Mrs. Schwartz was widely known in the profession as the co-author of much of the work that led to Mr. Friedman's Nobel in economic science in 1976. Her supporters thought the prize might have justly been awarded jointly.
"Anna did all of the work, and I got most of the recognition," Mr. Friedman said on one occasion.
After Mr. Friedman's death in 2006, Mrs. Schwartz "became the standard-bearer" of Friedman monetarism, said Michael D. Bordo, a professor of economics at Rutgers University and for decades a Schwartz collaborator himself.
Though "not a deep theorist," he said, Mrs. Schwartz was "probably the best woman economist of the 20th century."
During the financial collapse that began in 2008, she was one of the few economists with a firsthand recollection of the Depression. After praising early moves by Mr. Bernanke, she wrote, at age 93, a bitingly critical Op-Ed article for The New York Times in July 2009 opposing the reappointment of the Fed chairman who had been so influenced by her work.
She contended that Mr. Bernanke had erred in producing "extreme ease" in monetary policy and in failing to warn investors that new financial instruments were difficult to price.
Mrs. Schwartz also held that the government had been a bigger contributor to the crisis than had been widely realized. By her measure, the government had oversold the benefits of homeownership, pushing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage finance giants, to lend increasingly to lower-income borrowers and fostering exceptionally low mortgage rates.
A leading financial historian, Mrs. Schwartz was also an expert on the monetary and banking statistics of Britain and the United States. Besides her collaborations, she had a large body of work in her own name.
Her most visible public role was in 1981, when she agreed to be executive director of the 17-member United States Gold Commission, a Washington panel that was charged with recommending the future role of gold in the nation's monetary system.
With little interest in a return to any form of gold standard, she and most other members of the panel, consisting mostly of political appointees, limited their recommendations to urging the government to mint gold coins.
Mrs. Schwartz was born Anna Jacobson on Nov. 11, 1915, in the Bronx, the third of five children of Hillel Jacobson and the former Pauline Shainmark, Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.
She was drawn to economics while still at Walton High School in the Bronx -- "I found it more exciting than literature or foreign languages," she said -- and graduated from Barnard College at 18.
She worked for the Agriculture Department in 1936, the year she married Isaac Schwartz, whom she had met at a Hebrew summer camp. The couple raised four children. Mr. Schwartz, who was the financial officer for a Manhattan import company and had earned a master's degree in classics from Columbia, died in 1999.
Besides Ms. Pasachoff, Mrs. Schwartz is survived by another daughter, Paula Berggren; her sons, Jonathan and Joel; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
After five years at Columbia University's Social Science Research Council, Mrs. Schwartz joined the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York in 1941 and continued to work there for more than 70 years. But she maintained her ties to Columbia, earning a Ph.D. there in her middle years.
It was at the National Bureau, a private, nonpartisan research organization that has been the nation's semiofficial arbiter of business cycles, that Mrs. Schwartz met Mr. Friedman and his wife, Rose Director Friedman, who was also an economist. Rose Friedman had heard from mutual friends that the Schwartzes might have a baby carriage to lend.
Arthur F. Burns, the president of the National Bureau and a future chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that Mrs. Schwartz and Mr. Friedman work together.
The two of them -- she in New York and he at the University of Chicago -- formed a close relationship based on exchanges of drafts and ideas by mail. "I'll write something and send it to him, and he'll criticize it, and he'll do the reverse," she told a reporter for The Times in 1970 on the publication of their second major work, "Monetary Statistics of the United States: Estimates, Sources, Methods." "The wonderful thing about this relationship is that neither of us takes offense if the other says it's no good."
Mrs. Schwartz did take offense, however, when Paul Krugman, an economist and an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, attacked the Friedman legacy in an article in The New York Review of Books in 2007.
She responded angrily that Mr. Krugman had mischaracterized the work and made "inaccurate forays into economic history" by attributing the Depression to a liquidity trap, a situation in which monetary policy fails to stimulate the economy by either lowering interest rates or expanding the money supply.
"She went ballistic," Mr. Bordo said.
Even after breaking a hip in 2009 and having a stroke, Mrs. Schwartz, by then using a wheelchair, collaborated with Mr. Bordo and Owen Humpage, an economist at the Cleveland Fed, on a project tracing the history of governmental intervention in currency markets. "Anna never stopped," Mr. Bordo said.
She often spoke about her successful collaboration with Mr. Friedman on their "Monetary History of the United States," expressing elation that they had taken on an economic establishment with little regard for theories based on the importance of money.
Decades afterward, writing in The Cato Journal, a publication of the Cato Institute, the conservative public policy research organization, she quoted Wordsworth:
"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,/But to be young was very heaven!"

Full text: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- After a series of hard-line moves and statements after his re-election this spring, President Vladimir V. Putin softened his approach during a speech to foreign investors on Thursday.
Mr. Putin, speaking at the government-sponsored St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, promised to continue business-friendly overhauls begun by his predecessor, Dmitri A. Medvedev.
The appeal to investors, whom Russia will need to balance a trade and budget deficit if oil prices fall further, included a rare admission that political opposition could play a role, as long as it was expressed legally.
Mr. Putin said that "the thirst for change is a natural, driving force of progress" but dangerous when it threatened civil peace.
The speech to the audience of investors and executives -- which included Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil -- was a switch from statements by Mr. Putin and senior aides since his re-election in March.
Mr. Putin may have been trying to address signs of deterioration in relations between Russia and the United States, which pose a risk to foreign investment with potentially dire consequences for the economy.
Investors are jittery. The Russian stock market is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio that is 16 percent lower than Greece's -- a country with severe economic problems.
Investors have been pulling money out of Russia since March as oil prices slide and concerns mount that the European debt crisis will erode demand for oil and natural gas in Europe, harming Russia's balance of payments.
Even if oil prices remain high, Russia will need foreign investment to balance a projected trade deficit later this decade.
Russia has a "P.R. problem," said Todd J. Berman, head of investment banking at Troika Dialog in Moscow.
In the months after Mr. Putin's re-election, a top Russian general threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack against Poland; Russian weapons dealers have sent air defense missiles to Syria; and a Kremlin spokesman suggested that the police should "smear the livers" of protesters on the sidewalks.
On Thursday, Mr. Putin emphasized the government's commitment to domestic economic changes.
"State capitalism is not our goal," Mr. Putin said.
The Kremlin, he said, intends to improve the investor climate in Russia by making it easier to do business. The Parliament recently passed a law making insider trading illegal, he said.
He also pointed out that the Russian economy was already more robust than others in Europe, with the government projecting a 4.3 percent increase in gross domestic product this year.
The unemployment rate is just 5 percent, and the inflation rate last year fell to a post-Soviet era low of 6.1 percent.
Russia is also in healthier financial shape than many Western countries. The country's national debt is equal to 9 percent of G.D.P., compared with 104 percent in the United States.
"Investors and businesses need to feel a government is behaving responsibly," Mr. Putin said.
He contrasted Russia, with its budget surpluses and high employment, with Europe. The Continent, he said, should better coordinate its response to the sovereign debt crisis.
"Egoistic and selfish deals are not the basis for stability," he said.
Mr. Putin also introduced some new economic proposals. A portion of the national pension fund, he said, could be invested in shares of infrastructure companies to ease volatility in the stock market.

Abstract: By eliminating such payments to farmers and farmland owners the Senate bill would make the highly subsidized crop insurance program the primary safety net when crop prices drop.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The farm bill under debate in the Senate would be the nation's first major overhaul of federal agriculture programs in decades, including an end to the policy of paying farmers whether they grow crops or not.
The House has not produced its own farm bill, and any proposed legislation could face resistance from fiscal conservatives and lawmakers aligned with the Tea Party who want greater cuts in farm programs and food stamps. The House was expected to begin work on its own bill next week, but the majority whip, Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, asked the House Agriculture Committee on Wednesday to delay work on the bill until July 11.
By eliminating such payments to farmers and farmland owners the Senate bill would make the highly subsidized crop insurance program the primary safety net when crop prices drop. Currently, the government subsidizes about 62 percent of the crop insurance premiums, and the policies typically guarantee 75 to 85 percent of a farmer's revenue.
The bill creates programs to protect farmers from additional revenue losses and to cover their insurance deductibles.
The legislation also would add more money for programs for specialty crop growers, like farmers who grow fruits and vegetables. Produce growers have traditionally received few subsidies from the federal government. The proposed farm bill would expand block grants to states for research and promotion of fruits and vegetables.
"This is a strong farm bill for specialty crops," said Robert Guenther, senior vice president for public policy at the United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group of fruit and vegetable growers.
The Senate legislation also would repeal a longstanding provision in the farm bill that prevents farmers who get direct payments for growing commodity crops like wheat and corn from growing fruits and vegetables. The restrictions would be lifted because growers of commodity crops would lose their direct payments.
Farmers in the Midwest who have long complained about the planting restrictions say they are also glad to see them end.
One farmer, Jack Hedin of Rushford, Minn., was forced to pay $9,000 in fines in 2008 after planting watermelons, tomatoes and vegetables on 25 acres of land that he rented from a farmer who got direct payments.
Mr. Hedin said the ending of direct payments and the planting restrictions was long overdue.
"It's a good thing for the fruit and vegetables growers like myself who are in the Corn Belt, where everyone gets direct payments and farmers who wanted to grow produce have limited access to land because of the restrictions," he said.
The spending cuts in the Senate bill, which amounts to $23 billion, come largely from the elimination of direct payments, which cost about $5 billion a year, and cutting about $4.5 billion from the food stamp program.
A vote by the full Senate is expected Thursday afternoon, said the majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.
Southern farmers, especially peanut growers, have opposed the bill because it ends direct payments. The farmers argue that crop insurance would not provide an adequate safety net for them.
A number of budget watchdog and environment groups have also opposed the Senate legislation. A major point of contention has been the crop insurance program, which cost about $7.3 billion last year, up from $951 million in 2000, or about $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. A Congressional Budget Office report said the program could cost about $90 billion over the next 10 years.
Unlike its other farm programs, the government does not impose income caps or payment limits on crop insurance subsidies. But Wednesday evening the Senate voted 66 to 33 to cap payments in the crop insurance program for farmers reporting $750,000 or more in annual adjusted gross income. Another amendment added soil and water conservation requirements to the crop insurance program.
A recent report by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington research group, found that 26 farm operations got more than $1 million in crop insurance subsidies last year. An amendment by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, that would have restored cuts to the food stamp program by cutting subsidies to companies that sell crop insurance was defeated.
Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group, said the Senate bill failed to achieve real savings.
Mr. Ellis said that the bill plows savings from the cuts into two new programs for farmers and that despite the cuts, the new farm bill would cost 60 percent more than the last bill passed in 2008, which is expected to run more than $600 billion over 10 years.
"With farm country doing as well as it is and farm income at record highs, the Senate missed an opportunity to pass a bill with real reform," Mr. Ellis said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In a pattern that has become familiar, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that the economy was growing more slowly than it had forecast, in part because its efforts to hasten recovery had proved insufficient.
With the economy stumbling into the summer months after the false promise of a relatively strong winter, the Fed announced a modest expansion of its efforts to stimulate growth.
The Fed said its senior officials now expected growth of 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent this year, half a percentage point lower than they forecast in April. They predicted the unemployment rate would not drop below 8 percent this year, and that inflation would not climb above 1.7 percent.
Those are the vital signs of a patient who will be ill for some time. And the Fed noted that the outlook could worsen if events in Europe unnerved financial markets or if politicians in Washington failed to resolve a stalemate over fiscal policy.
The central bank pledged to buy $267 billion in long-term Treasury securities over the next six months as part of a continuing campaign to reduce borrowing costs.
It is the first time since January that the Fed has intensified its efforts to revive economic growth, and the first time since September that it has announced a new round of asset purchases. This is the fifth such announcement since 2008.
But the new program is not large enough to provide significant economic support. Instead it amounts to a placeholder, an effort to soothe markets and preserve the status quo while the Fed seeks greater clarity about the health of the economic recovery.
"We have to get further information about the state of the economy, about where things are going and about what's happening in Europe," Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said at a news conference after the release of the policy statement and projections.
His comments raised the prospect that the Fed would act again later this year.
"We are prepared to do what is necessary," he said, in a version of the pledge that has become his byword. "We are prepared to provide support for the economy."
Investors appeared to respond with disappointment. Major equity indexes fell after the Fed's policy was announced, rose for a while, and then fell throughout Mr. Bernanke's 45-minute news conference before staging a late rally to end the day little changed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.2 percent.
The Fed is already engaged in broad efforts to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. It has kept short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and is holding more than $2.5 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to hold long-term interest rates down.
But the unemployment rate, after declining rapidly during the final months of 2008, has stalled above 8 percent. More than 20 million Americans could not find full-time work last month, three years after the recession ended.
The Fed's policy-making committee said Wednesday that while it expected growth would continue at a "moderate pace," job creation and household spending both slowed in recent months. Mr. Bernanke said the housing depression, domestic fiscal policy and Europe's downturn were dragging on growth.
The Fed's economic forecast, released separately, reflected reduced prospects for 2013. Officials estimated the nation's economy would grow from 2.2 percent to 2.8 percent next year, down from its April projection of 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent. They now expect the unemployment rate to range from 7.5 to 8 percent at the end of 2013, up from an April forecast of 7.3 to 7.7 percent.
Fed officials appeared united earlier this year in the view that monetary policy had done enough to bolster growth. But the accumulation of lukewarm data has cracked that united front. Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, issued public calls for new action, and others who argued for more aggressive easing last year also seemed to be girding for a return to the barricades. The Fed's conservative wing, meanwhile, renewed its warnings about future inflation.
The committee landed between the two camps on Wednesday, reflecting the moderating influence of Mr. Bernanke, who controls the decision-making process.
The new asset purchases extend a commitment scheduled to end this month to buy $400 million in Treasuries, known as Operation Twist because the purchases are financed by sales from the Fed's holdings of short-term securities. Extending the program by six months has poetic virtues, but it also reflects the imminent exhaustion of the Fed's holdings of the short-term securities.
Studies of this first installment of Operation Twist have concluded that it reduced long-term interest rates by 0.15 to 0.20 percentage points. But its economic impact, like those of the Fed's earlier asset purchases, has been muted by the inability of many businesses and consumers to obtain loans. Economists estimate that this second installment will have an even smaller impact, commensurate with its size.
"They bought some time and some insurance to sit back and see how the situation evolved," said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC.
The decision was supported by 11 members of the committee. The only opposition came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has repeatedly dissented this year, arguing against additional action.
Republican politicians have pressed the Fed to refrain from new actions, arguing that it is more likely to set off higher inflation than lower unemployment.
Mr. Bernanke was dismissive of those criticisms on Wednesday. He noted that inflation remained firmly in check. The Fed projects that wages and prices will increase more slowly this year than the 2 percent pace it considers optimal.
He expressed confidence that asset purchases could help the economy. "I wouldn't accept the proposition that the Fed has no more ammunition," he said. "Our tools, while nonstandard, still can create more accommodative conditions, still provide support of the economy, still help us return to a more normal economic situation."
At the same time, Mr. Bernanke said that the Fed was restrained by the uncertain consequences of its actions. Efforts by central banks to hold down interest rates have sometimes contributed to speculative bubbles, for example.
And in saying that the Fed was prepared to do more if necessary, he made clear that he did not regard the current economic situation as sufficient cause."I don't think they should be launched lightly," he said of the possibility of additional asset purchases. "There should be some conviction that they're needed."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
To listen to Mitt Romney tell it, President Obama is a job-killing, free-spending, big-government liberal who made the recession worse with his policies and endangered free-market capitalism. The president has spent tax dollars "at a pace without precedent in recent history," Mr. Romney says, and "added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined."
As Mr. Obama travels the country, he offers the opposite self-portrait, that of a job-creating, tightfisted, government-shrinking pragmatist who saved the country from another Great Depression. On his watch, "government employment has gone down," he says, and federal spending has increased "at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years."
With the presidential race largely focused on the economy and the budget, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are filling speeches with facts and figures designed to enhance their case and diminish the other guy's, in the process often making assertions fundamentally at odds with one another. Along the way, both candidates are at times stretching the truth, using statistics without context, exaggerating their own records and misrepresenting their opponent's.
Each side regularly accuses the other of lying, and in any campaign there is a temptation to write both sides off, as if every misleading statement were equivalent. In reality, some are more fundamental than others, more egregious, more central to the larger argument. Mr. Romney, for example, called his 2010 book laying out the rationale for his candidacy "No Apology" -- charging, falsely in the eyes of many independent fact-checkers, that Mr. Obama had traveled the world apologizing for America.
But determining who is the worse dissembler can be a subjective exercise, even in an age when news organizations, blogs and partisan groups blitz out regular fact-checks. When PolitiFact, the Pulitzer-winning project of The Tampa Bay Times, evaluated the statements, it found that more of Mr. Romney's were misleading than Mr. Obama's. Glenn Kessler, who writes the Fact Checker column at The Washington Post, on the other hand, has awarded roughly the same average "Pinocchio scores" -- his measure of falsity -- to both men.
Sometimes the truth or dishonesty of an assertion depends on definitions or on when you start counting. When it comes to unemployment, for instance, Mr. Romney counts from the month when Mr. Obama took office and inherited an economy that was hemorrhaging jobs at historic rates. Mr. Obama prefers to count from 2010, when his policies arguably had started to take effect and the job picture had begun turning around, eschewing blame for the losses at the start of his term.
But one thing is clear: While they claim distance from typical Washington politics, both men have mastered the ancient Washington art of selective storytelling.
Job Creation
"Over 4 million jobs created in the last two years." -- Mr. Obama
"He has not created jobs." -- Mr. Romney
Nowhere is the veracity of the candidates' statements more central than on the economic issues at the heart of their contest. The question of job creation provides a quintessential case study. By counting from January 2009, Mr. Romney paints the bleak portrait of a country that despite a modest recovery still has fewer jobs than it did when Mr. Obama took office. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country has 552,000 fewer jobs now than when the president was inaugurated.
Mr. Obama starts his count in March 2010, after the money from his stimulus law was flowing and payrolls began growing again. And he generally cites private-sector employment, so that he can say 4.3 million jobs have been created. Counting government work forces, the job growth is actually lower, 3.8 million jobs, according to the bureau.
Is it reasonable to start counting in January 2009? The economy was already shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, and none of Mr. Obama's policies would take effect for some time. Starting the count just one month later would show a small net increase in jobs for the president's tenure in office. Yet if he cannot be blamed for job losses in the early months of his term, can Mr. Obama be held responsible for not replacing the lost jobs more quickly?
Federal Debt
Mr. Obama has "added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined." -- Mr. Romney
The total national debt now stands at $15.8 trillion, up from $10.6 trillion when Mr. Obama took office, an increase of nearly 50 percent. A commonly cited and more economically important subset, debt held by the public, has grown to $11 trillion from $6.3 trillion, a 75 percent increase -- closer to Mr. Romney's claim, but still $1.7 trillion short of matching the accumulated public debt of the first 43 presidents. Adjusted for inflation, the debt Mr. Obama incurred is smaller relative to the combined prior debt.
Federal Spending
"Since President Obama assumed office...federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history." -- Mr. Romney
"Since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years." -- Mr. Obama
Both men may be exaggerating in their own ways -- and once again it depends in part on when you start counting. The president based his claim on a column in Market Watch, which calculated that government spending during the Obama years has grown 1.4 percent annually, the lowest since President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
But that column started counting with the fiscal year that started on Oct. 1, 2009, more than eight months after Mr. Obama took office, on the theory that that was the first full fiscal year Mr. Obama could shape. It held Mr. Obama responsible for $140 billion in additional spending from those first eight months stemming largely from his stimulus spending program. The calculation also gave Mr. Obama credit for automatic spending cuts scheduled for the next fiscal year, which the president opposes and which may not actually take effect.
Using different ways to calculate spending, The Washington Post found that spending has been going up 5.2 percent a year under Mr. Obama, while The Associated Press put the figure at 3 percent, excluding 2009. Either way, it is neither the "lowest pace in nearly 60 years," as Mr. Obama claimed, nor "at a pace without precedent in recent history," as Mr. Romney charged.
Going back to Eisenhower, federal spending has risen on average 7 percent a year, or 2.6 percent when adjusted for inflation. After the spending burst of 2009, Mr. Obama, constrained by Congress and aided by repayments of bank and auto bailouts, increased spending just 0.5 percent a year over the next three fiscal years when adjusted for inflation; only two other three-year periods since Eisenhower had lower spending growth.
Another way to judge spending is to look at what was anticipated based on the laws and policies at the time Mr. Obama took office versus what actually happened. In January 2009, days before he was inaugurated, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast spending in the 2011 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30, at $3.323 trillion. In reality, after the policies put in place by Mr. Obama and Congress, it turned out to be $3.603 trillion, 8.4 percent higher.
Yet another way to look at spending is as a share of the overall economy. For years up to and through most of George W. Bush's presidency, federal spending generally totaled about 20 percent or less of the nation's overall economic output. In Mr. Bush's final full fiscal year in office, ending Sept. 30, 2008, it rose to 20.8 percent.
The next fiscal year, in which Mr. Bush was president for four months and Mr. Obama for eight, it shot up to 25.2 percent, then dipped to 24.1 percent for each of the next two years, the highest levels since World War II. Of course one reason spending is a larger share of the economy is because the overall economy shrunk during the recession. But even if spending rose starkly during the economic crisis under the presidencies of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, it has remained at the higher level since then under Mr. Obama.
Size of Government
"The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me." -- Mr. Obama
Again, it depends on how it is counted. Looking at the five months from Mr. Obama's inauguration to June 2009, when the recession officially ended, and including state and local governments, which are not under his direct control, government employment at all levels was virtually unchanged, from 22,576,000 in January 2009 to 22,570,000 in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Total government employment was 21,969,000 in May 2012, a reduction of about 600,000 jobs. But looking only at the federal work force under Mr. Obama's direct control, then government employment has actually gone up. He inherited a federal work force of 2,061,700, and it rose slightly through June 2009 to 2,109,700; by May of this year, it had grown further to 2,204,100, a 7 percent increase.
Mr. Obama is not correct in saying this was the "only time" government shrank during a recession. During the recession from July 1981 through November 1982, under President Ronald Reagan, and again during the recession from July 1990 through March 1991, under the elder President George Bush, government employment shrank slightly, both over all and in the federal work force specifically. The White House said he meant the recession and the 35 months after it.
Either way, while Mr. Obama has boasted of shrinking the public work force, he has advocated policies to prevent it from shrinking by helping state and local governments avoid laying off employees. In recent days, he has lamented that continuing economic troubles result in part from a decreasing public work force.
Economics
"We are only inches away from no longer being a free economy." -- Mr. Romney
In attacking Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy, Mr. Romney has engaged in hyperbole at times -- as with this claim. He has also contended that Mr. Obama made the recession "worse" and "last longer" and said that the president's health care law would increase government spending to nearly half of the American economy.
There is plenty of debate over how effective Mr. Obama's economic policies have been, especially given the painfully slow recovery, but economists do not generally claim that Mr. Obama's policies worsened the recession or made it longer.
The 18-month recession officially ended in June 2009, five months into Mr. Obama's term, as measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research. And even critics who consider the president's stimulus package a missed opportunity -- from liberals who say it was too small to conservatives who say it was wasteful and poorly targeted -- tend to acknowledge what the Congressional Budget Office has found: it did save and create jobs, lower unemployment and help the economy grow in the short term.
Despite Mr. Romney's claim, the new health care law will not drive government spending up to half of the economy, unless all health care spending in the country is reclassified as government spending. Given that the new law still relies heavily on private insurance provided by employers, it is a stretch to treat all of that as if it were government expenditures.
Experts predict the new health care law will drive up health spending, as more people will be covered, but not by a huge share of the economy. The chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that with the new law, health care spending will rise to 21 percent of the economy in 2019. Without the new law, it estimated, it would have risen to 20.8 percent of the economy.
The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated what would happen to federal spending under a number of different situations, taking the new health care law into account. The projection showing the biggest jump found that assuming that a number of current tax cuts are extended and several budget cuts currently scheduled to take effect next year are averted, federal spending will rise to 29 percent of the economy in 2030 from 24 percent in 2011. But that rise is attributable in large part to rising interest payments required by ballooning debt.
And the idea that the United States has almost ceased to be a free-market economy was labeled "ridiculously false" by PolitiFact, which cited an economic freedom index (from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, which ranks the United States the world's 10th freest economy of 179 judged.
Tax Cuts
"A record surplus was squandered on tax cuts for people who didn't need them and weren't even asking for them." -- Mr. Obama
Mr. Obama makes it sound as if the surpluses projected at the end of President Bill Clinton's tenure disappeared entirely because of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. In fact, tax cuts for the wealthy were responsible for a small fraction of the disappearing surpluses.
An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office last year showed that of $5.6 trillion in surpluses projected over 10 years when Mr. Bush took office, $1.6 trillion went to the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, or 29 percent. The rest of the anticipated surpluses vanished because of increased spending and lower-than-expected revenues stemming from economic downturns.
Mr. Obama supports keeping the tax cuts for all but the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, or roughly 18 percent of the total cost. Extrapolated, that means the tax cuts "for people who didn't need them" would have accounted for just 5 percent of the disappearing surpluses.

Full text: MOSCOW -- A tense first day of talks between Iran and six world powers broke no new ground on Monday evening, offering little hope that the negotiations would defuse the standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
Iran has signaled it may be willing to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, which is considered a technical step short of bomb-grade, but it seeks a weighty political message in return: an acknowledgment from the international community that it has the right to enrich uranium.
It is also hoping for a rollback of the tough sanctions by the European Union and the United States scheduled to take effect in the coming weeks, which will further isolate Tehran from world oil and banking markets.
Iran received no such assurances on Monday from the six world powers, which consist of the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- as well as Germany.
A spokesman for Catherine Ashton, who is the European Union's top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator with Iran for the so-called P5-plus-1 countries, described Monday's talks as "intense and tough."
In an afternoon session, Iranian negotiators picked apart a package of enticements that the six world powers first offered last month in Baghdad, which includes parts for old American civilian aircraft and fuel for an Iranian nuclear reactor, with the promise of more sanctions relief in return for specific Iranian actions to come into compliance over time.
"They responded to our package of proposals from Baghdad, but in doing so, brought up lots of questions and well-known positions, including past grievances," said Ms. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann. "We are not there. We have to have further discussions tomorrow, based upon overnight reflections."
Analysts said the six powers might be willing to relax one of the sanctions that is threatening Iran: a provision that bans insurers based in Europe from covering ships that carry Iranian oil anywhere in the world.
The measure would significantly reduce Iran's shipments to Asia, which make up most of the 2.2 million barrels it still exports daily. It met with resistance last month from Britain, a center of the marine insurance industry.
Cliff Kupchan, an Iran analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said the ban could be carried out on schedule and then eased month by month if Iran were seen to be complying with the P5-plus-1's central demands: ceasing enrichment of uranium to 20 percent and exporting its stockpile of the material.
"I can't think of anything else that they could give, or that has been discussed among people involved," Mr. Kupchan said.
Mr. Mann, Ms. Ashton's spokesman, said the six powers were not offering to delay or waive sanctions until Iran had proved its willingness to comply with international agreements.
"Sanctions policy by definition is always under review, but can only be eased in response to real changes on the ground, so there is no question that our sanctions will come into force on the first of July," he said.
The Moscow talks appeared rocky starting early in the day, when an Iranian diplomat described the atmosphere as "not positive" and said the discussions might even conclude on Monday, a day earlier than expected. Diplomats on all sides were unusually tight-lipped as they went in and out of negotiating sessions, heightening the sense of tension.
But the Iranian assessment brightened somewhat by evening: Ali Baqeri, deputy chief of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said the discussion had been "very serious and constructive" when Iran had the opportunity to detail its complaints.
Much seemed to hang on a meeting on Monday night between the head of the Iranian delegation, Saeed Jalili, and Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's National Security Council and a former head of the Federal Security Service.
A breakdown in the talks would increase the risk of a new war in the Middle East, after months of tension over whether Israel, which considers Iran a threat to its existence, will carry out a military strike against Iran's nuclear program. Iran is in violation of Security Council resolutions demanding that it suspend enrichment, and it has failed to ease concerns that its nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, an accusation Iran denies.
"We all have to remember what we are doing here," said a Western official shortly before the talks began, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks. "The international community's concern is to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. That is what it is fundamentally about."
Iranian news media portrayed the talks in Moscow in an unflattering light, with the Fars News Agency reporting that the proceedings demonstrated that Western powers were not interested in reaching a comprehensive solution. Without directly referring to the negotiations, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, released a speech castigating Iran's enemies, saying their "misplaced arrogance and grandiosity will lead to nowhere."
Iran is negotiating under duress because of the intensifying sanctions, which Ayatollah Khamenei has characterized as "economic jihad." The value of Iran's currency, the rial, has dropped by 50 percent over the past 10 months, and inflation of food products exceeds 40 percent, said Mr. Kupchan, the analyst. The West, convinced that sanctions have induced Tehran to negotiate, is threatening to squeeze Iran's economy further.
Russian experts have played down chances for a breakthrough, saying domestic politics in Iran and the United States make it difficult for either to compromise.
"We must understand that for President Barack Obama, neither a final positive or negative solution is possible because he will face criticism for either one," said Vladimir Sazhin, a top Iran expert with the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. "With Iran, the situation coincides completely with the situation in the United States. Iran doesn't need one decision or the other."

Abstract: Uribe supporters who have been imprisoned on corruption charges, or for participating in illegal recordings of Supreme Court judges, or for links with paramilitary groups, or for extrajudicial murders. According to Plutarch, ostracism -- which consisted of expulsion from the city-state for 10 years -- was not punishment but a protective measure, a way of making the eminent humble again.

Full text: Medellin, Colombia
SOMEONE once said that former presidents are like old furniture. One thinks of a chest, revered for its noble appearance but no longer in use, eaten by termites, falling apart. Ever since modern medicine made longevity the rule and not the exception, countries have been accumulating these antiques. Four ex-presidents are living in the United States: the 39th, the 41st, the 42nd and the 43rd; it's very likely that the 44th will occupy some dusty corner until nearly the middle of the 21st century.
However, Colombia's former president, Alvaro Uribe, is refusing to play this part.
For many years, Colombia's presidency followed the Mexican model: a monarchical ruler for a single term of office, with re-election prohibited by law, as a vaccine against strongmen who fell in love with power. This was a wise rule, given that Latin American leaders often prefer the Vatican's electoral system: a president who stays in office until he dies or, in rare cases, is too ill to serve. Fidel Castro is one such case, and after manipulating constitutional reforms to allow them to stand for re-election, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela (who is battling cancer) aspire to follow in his footsteps.
Colombia has moved in this direction. Thanks to his successful fight against the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and his having restored the country's faith in the future, Mr. Uribe was a very popular president. He was also very fond of power. For that reason he fostered a constitutional amendment that, in 2006, allowed him to stand for re-election and stay in office for eight years instead of four. In 2010 he pushed for a referendum that would let him run for a third term, but -- in an act of dignity rare in our region -- the proposal was declared unconstitutional by the country's highest court. Reluctantly, Mr. Uribe gave up power. The last thing he did was handpick his successor, Juan Manuel Santos, the former defense minister, who easily won the vote.
At that stage, Mr. Uribe should have retired to his cattle ranch, gone off to ride his horses and create a foundation for the defense of his political legacy. Instead, he decided to live, supposedly for reasons of security, in a police barracks in the capital, Bogota. There, he can get together with officers, among whom he has always been popular for his harsh stance against the guerrillas, and dash off criticisms of his successor.
Among Mr. Uribe's main causes of complaint are the so-called "political prisoners" -- Uribe supporters who have been imprisoned on corruption charges, or for participating in illegal recordings of Supreme Court judges, or for links with paramilitary groups, or for extrajudicial murders. Admirably, considering his connection with the former president, Mr. Santos has pursued these cases, and Mr. Uribe will not forgive him for it.
Mr. Uribe has never written much; he's not a person who enjoys developing an argument across the pages of an essay. However, he is addicted to Twitter (@AlvaroUribeVel has 1.3 million followers) and loves short phrases: slogans, more than thoughts. He spends his time, day and night, firing at (he himself uses this verb: "disparar") President Santos and his alleged acts of "treason." Mr. Santos has sold his soul to terrorists and Hugo Chavez, the tweets say, and is driving the country into chaos. Colombia's hard-won peace, according to Mr. Uribe, will crumble under a resurgence of drug-financed guerrilla violence.
His fury has led some retired military officers to go so far as to talk of the need to stage a coup d'etat against the president. A coup isn't very likely, but another constitutional reform, allowing the messianic Mr. Uribe to run again in 2014, is possible; his supporters are already pushing for it. Failing this, what we can expect is the creation of a new party on the right, with a figurehead as a presidential candidate, and Mr. Uribe as the true leader. This means that in two years we won't be moving forward, but back: the election will be a plebiscite, yet again, in favor of Mr. Uribe or against him.
The ancient Greeks had a venerable institution to defend democracy against tyranny: ostracism. According to Plutarch, ostracism -- which consisted of expulsion from the city-state for 10 years -- was not punishment but a protective measure, a way of making the eminent humble again. It's a better answer to the problem of succession than some others.
There are many of us in Colombia who would like to see our vigorous ex-president giving self-improvement lectures abroad or consulting for some foreign corporation. Unfortunately, he'd rather be a nuisance in Colombia, tweeting and sowing trouble and rejoicing every time the FARC tries to assassinate a political figure or plants a bomb. Every military defeat for Mr. Santos is a triumph for Mr. Uribe: for him, the country has been heading for the abyss ever since it's been out of his hands. But never in recent decades have the economic figures (inflation, unemployment, growth) been so good. And if the security situation continues to be difficult, the homicide rates are no higher than they were under Mr. Uribe. In fact, they're still going down.
This is why many Colombians dream of something resembling ostracism and wish that piece of old furniture called Alvaro Uribe would stop getting in everybody's way in the middle of the living room.

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO -- Global leaders, development experts, bankers, academics and activists are gathering here this week to celebrate the anniversary of the landmark Earth Summit of 1992 and to try to address the linked problems of poverty, hunger, energy shortages and environmental degradation.
But the conference -- expected to draw as many as 50,000 participants -- is in many ways overshadowed by economic and political crises around the world. While more than 100 heads of state and government are planning to attend the formal talks starting Wednesday, President Obama, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are staying away, preoccupied by domestic politics and the financial turmoil in Europe.
As a result, while diplomats feverishly negotiate a complex 80-page document spelling out the meeting's goals, there are few expectations for concrete actions or pledges of new aid to developing countries. Delegates said the constraints of the still-faltering global economy had dampened hopes and refueled the conflicts between industrialized and developing countries that have hobbled international development and environment talks for years.
Nick Robins, an analyst at HSBC, the international bank based in London, said that companies and financial institutions that support international development projects had hoped to see the conference produce an approach that would increase the flow of funds to the developing world. So far, he has been disappointed.
"What began as a mixed bag of proposals has, however, ballooned into a baggy and fractious document that mostly 'reaffirms' past commitments and 'acknowledges' problems, but marks precious little forward movement," Mr. Robins said in a research note published last week.
The conference is formally titled the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, but is more popularly known as Rio+20 because it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Earth Summit here that produced a global treaty on climate change and an agreement to protect biodiversity. The two accords have sweeping ambitions, but have yielded only modest results so far.
Representatives are trying to tackle big questions such as protecting the world's forests and fisheries, bringing electricity to the more than one billion people who lack access to it, weaning the world off fossil fuels and encouraging farming and economic growth that do not destroy the natural environment.
Todd Stern, the United States' special envoy for climate change and the lead negotiator at the talks here, said that the Rio conference brought together the critical players who could broaden the discussion beyond the rich country-poor country dialogue that had grown tedious.
"The tough economic situation globally has an impact on government budgets and the capacity of traditional donor countries to provide traditional assistance, but we shouldn't overemphasize that constraint as other powerful factors are in play now," he said in an e-mail. "Official development assistance represents only 13 percent of capital flows to developing countries today, compared to 70 percent in the 1960s, and that's because of the growing role of the private sector, trade, remittances and the like."
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, said the timing of the conference was unfortunate.
"Europe has been the great leader of environmental action," Mr. Sachs said in an interview here, "but Europe is hardly functioning right now."
For Brazil, hosting the conference creates an opportunity to project influence into different parts of the developing world. For instance, Brazil is sending Embraer jets to transport the delegations from 10 countries in Africa and the Caribbean, including Malawi, Sierra Leone, Dominica and Grenada.
The gesture speaks to Brazil's emergence as a financial powerhouse in Latin America, in stark contrast to the economic situation during the first Earth Summit, when Brazil was still struggling with galloping inflation and economic instability.
While the growth of the Brazilian economy has recently slowed, along with that of other big developing countries, like China and India, President Dilma Rousseff has found herself in the position of defending her government's development model, which involves the assertive use of state-controlled companies and banks to advance antipoverty projects.
"It's possible to have a country that develops economically, with growth and inclusion of its population, while also respecting the environment," Ms. Rousseff said in an address last week.
Brazilian diplomats have staked out an assertive role in preliminary talks, resisting proposals from rich industrialized countries that developing nations should be required to pay more to reduce environmental degradation.
William K. Reilly, who as head of the Environmental Protection Agency led the American delegation to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, said in an interview that he expected many of the delegates to the convention this year to criticize President Obama's decision not to attend, sending Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in his place. But Mr. Reilly said it was untenable for Mr. Obama to go, because he had no financial resources to offer and because he would face substantial criticism at home for seeming to be more concerned with global problems than domestic issues.
President George Bush faced similar criticism in 1992, and decided to go over the objections of his political advisers. Mr. Bush lost the election that year to Bill Clinton.
"The international community is going to have to learn never to hold a big global conference during an American presidential election year," Mr. Reilly said.

Full text: Throughout the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery, the most commonly discussed measure of misery has been unemployment. But many middle-class and working-class people who are fortunate enough to have work are struggling as well, which is why Sherry Woods, a 59-year-old van driver from Atlanta, found herself standing in line at a jobs fair this month, with her resume tucked inside a Bible.
She opened it occasionally to reread a favorite verse from Philippians: "And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ."
Ms. Woods's current job has not been meeting her needs. When she began driving a passenger van last year, she earned $9 an hour and worked 40 hours a week. Then her wage was cut to $8 an hour, and her hours were drastically scaled back. Last month she earned just $233. So Ms. Woods, who said that she had been threatened with eviction for missing rent payments and had been postponing an appointment with the eye doctor because she lacks insurance, has been looking for another, better job. It has not been easy.
"I'm looking for something else, anything else," she said. "More hours. Better pay. Actual benefits."
These are anxious days for American workers. Many, like Ms. Woods, are underemployed. Others find pay that is simply not keeping up with their expenses: adjusted for inflation, the median hourly wage was lower in 2011 than it was a decade earlier, according to data from a forthcoming book by the Economic Policy Institute, "The State of Working America, 12th Edition." Good benefits are harder to come by, and people are staying longer in jobs that they want to leave, afraid that they will not be able to find something better. Only 2.1 million people quit their jobs in March, down from the 2.9 million people who quit in December 2007, the first month of the recession.
"Unfortunately, the wage problems brought on by the recession pile on top of a three-decade stagnation of wages for low- and middle-wage workers," said Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington that studies the labor market. "In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been persistent high unemployment as households reduced debt and scaled back purchases. The consequence for wages has been substantially slower growth across the board, including white-collar and college-educated workers."
Now, with the economy shaping up as the central issue of the presidential election, both President Obama and Mitt Romney have been relentlessly trying to make the case that their policies would bring prosperity back. The unease of voters is striking: in a New York Times/CBS News poll in April, half of the respondents said they thought the next generation of Americans would be worse off, while only about a quarter said it would have a better future.
And household wealth is dropping. The Federal Reserve reported last week that the economic crisis left the median American family in 2010 with no more wealth than in the early 1990s, wiping away two decades of gains. With stocks too risky for many small investors and savings accounts paying little interest, building up a nest egg is a challenge even for those who can afford to sock away some of their money.
Expenses like putting a child through college -- where tuition has been rising faster than inflation or wages -- can be a daunting task. When Morgan Woodward, 21, began her freshman year at the University of California, Berkeley, three years ago, her parents paid about $9,000 a year in tuition and fees. Now they pay closer to $13,000, and they are bracing for the possibility of another jump next year. With their incomes flat, though, they recently borrowed money to pay for her final year, and to begin paying the tuition of their son, who plans to start college this fall.
"You know there is going to be small incremental increases in tuition, but not the 8, 10, 12 percent increase every year we've seen," said Ms. Woodward's father, Cliff Woodward, 52, who lives in Pleasanton, Calif., and is an independent sales representative for an eyeglass company. So the Woodwards, who drive cars with 150,000 and 120,000 miles on them, have cut back.
"No vacations, no big screens," Mr. Woodward said. "We've cut down on going out a little bit, but it's worth it."
People with college degrees still get jobs with better pay and benefits than those without, but many recent college graduates are finding it hard to land the kinds of jobs they had envisioned. David Thande, 27, who graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, five years ago, works part time as a clerk in an Apple Store.
"I'm not even full time, so I spend about 45 minutes every day begging people for hours, checking if someone canceled, struggling to make it work," Mr. Thande said, adding that he had fallen behind on paying back his student loans.
Garland Miller, 28, who has degrees in finance and accounting from the University of Georgia and Kennesaw State University, had hoped to land a job at a big accounting firm, and to have been able to buy a home by now. Instead he finds himself working as the lead server at a steakhouse. But he has not given up on trying to move into the field that he prepared himself for: This month, he attended a jobs fair in Duluth, a suburb of Atlanta, organized by the University of Georgia for its alumni.
"I'm not in a job where I'm using all of my skills," Mr. Miller said. He said that with many baby boomers unable to retire as early as they had hoped, there are fewer opportunities for younger workers to move up and take their places. "Instead you have everybody competing for entry-level positions," he said.
Things are much worse for people without college degrees, though. The real entry-level hourly wage for men who recently graduated from high school fell to $11.68 last year, from $15.64 in 1979, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. And the percentage of those jobs that offer health insurance has plummeted to 22.8 percent, from 63.3 percent in 1979.
Though inflation has stayed relatively low in recent years, it has remained high for some of the most important things: college, health care and even, recently, food. The price of food in the home rose by 4.8 percent last year, one of the biggest jumps in the last two decades.
Sam Chea, 38, who lives in Oakland and works nights delivering pizzas for Domino's, said that he had been feeling the pinch at grocery stores, and worried that his lack of a college education was making it harder for him to find decent work. The other day he went to the nearby city of El Cerrito to apply for a second job at Nation's Giant Hamburgers, a regional chain.
"I'll be more secure with another job," he said. "It's scary. I don't have an education, and I'm worried about my rent."
"Everything's gone up. Rent went up, gas went up, food went up, milk went up, cheeseburgers went up, even cigarettes went up," said Mr. Chea, who had stopped at the barbershop to spiff up before his job interview. "I'm used to getting a haircut for $6 or $7, but they charged me $9. Even haircuts have gone up."

Abstract: [...]to the widening crisis in the euro zone, which will be the focus of the talks, Mexico will be able to point to 17 years of macroeconomic stability, low inflation, manageable debt, an open economy and increasing competitiveness. The reversed fortunes of Latin America's two largest economies are a sharp contrast to the euphoria over Brazil's prospects as recently as 2010, when the economy grew 7.5 percent in the last year of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government.

Full text: MEXICO CITY -- Mexicans looked on with envy in recent years as Brazilians won a reputation as Latin America's chosen people. With a surging economy and a prominent place on the world stage, Brazil was the country poised for greatness while Mexico remained mired in bloodshed and destitution.
But just as momentum can change suddenly in a match at the World Cup or an event at the Olympics -- both competitions that Brazil will host in the next four years -- so can the dynamics between nations.
Last year, Mexico's economy grew faster than Brazil's, and it looks set to outpace its larger Latin rival again in 2012.
Brazil's slowdown can be attributed partly to debt-burdened consumers and the erosion of industrial production, which is tied to the recent strength of Brazil's currency, the real. On top of that, slowing global growth, particularly in China, has pushed down prices of the commodities that Brazil exports.
Meanwhile, Mexican factories are exporting record quantities of televisions, cars, computers and appliances, replacing some Chinese imports in the United States and fueling a modest expansion.
Economically, Mexico does not appear as grim a place anymore.
"The best way to improve your image is G.D.P. growth," said Luis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade negotiator and an economic analyst here.
Mexico's strengthening economy underlies the glossy veneer on display as President Felipe Calderon hosts the Group of 20 leaders of major industrialized and emerging economies at the luxury beach resort of Los Cabos on Monday and Tuesday.
In contrast to the widening crisis in the euro zone, which will be the focus of the talks, Mexico will be able to point to 17 years of macroeconomic stability, low inflation, manageable debt, an open economy and increasing competitiveness. The gross domestic product expanded 3.9 percent last year, ahead of Brazil's growth of 2.7 percent.
And there are encouraging signs for the years ahead. Nissan, Mazda and Honda all announced that they would build new plants in Mexico, and new investments in aerospace and electronics are also on the horizon.
"Stars appear to be increasingly aligned for an economic outperformance" by Mexico, a report in May from Nomura Securities concluded. "A changing of the guard is slowly but surely taking place."
The reversed fortunes of Latin America's two largest economies are a sharp contrast to the euphoria over Brazil's prospects as recently as 2010, when the economy grew 7.5 percent in the last year of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government.
"The years of good growth are clearly in the past," said Antony Mueller, a professor of economics at the Federal University of Sergipe in Brazil.
In one sign of unease, the Brazilian government threatened this year to cancel a 10-year-old automotive trade accord with Mexico. For most of the pact's life, Brazil had sent more cars to Mexico, but last year that reversed, with imports of Mexican-made cars surging 70 percent to $2.4 billion. In March, Mexico agreed to cut its exports to Brazil to an average of $1.55 billion annually for the next three years and restore free trade after that.
The dispute highlights each country's distinct approach to development. Mexico has been dedicated to open markets, free trade and deregulation. Brazil's model involves muscular government intervention through big state-controlled companies.
At the same time, China's rise has affected Brazil and Mexico in opposite ways: China competes with Mexico and buys from Brazil. Mexico struggled for much of the past decade as Chinese-made products replaced Mexican goods in the United States, which buys 78 percent of Mexico's exports. And China's demand for raw materials helped lift Brazil's economy as stability allowed the government to redistribute the wealth and expand credit.
"Brazil has had two powerful narratives," said Gray Newman, an economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley. "If you believe in China, you believe in Brazil. That counted for a lot. The second narrative is that 'We've become a normal country and created the conditions for the emergence of a middle class.' Those narratives are so powerful."
Mexico's story has not been as positive, Mr. Newman said, with its fortunes tied to the United States and the government engaged in a war against powerful drug gangs. Even with the tide turning in their favor, Mexicans are so gloomy they do not see it, analysts say.
"This self-flagellation in Mexico is a malady," said Mr. de la Calle, who argues against the conventional wisdom and describes Mexico as a middle-class country. "When I said, 'You are not as badly off as you say you are -- there is a reason to have hope for the future,' the argument that I got back was that Brazil is doing much better."
Indeed, the candidate who leads in opinion polls ahead of Mexico's July 1 presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, began a recent presidential debate by asking people if they were better off and answering the question himself: "Surely, no."
One reason for the malaise is Mexico's drug war. The sight of miles upon miles of factories outside the industrial capital of Monterrey attracts far less attention than the image of nine bodies hanging from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Mexico's Finance Ministry has estimated that the violence shaves at least 1 percentage point from G.D.P. growth.
Even though Brazil's homicide rate trumps Mexico's, the gory nature of the killings in Mexico and Mr. Calderon's use of the military to combat traffickers have focused more attention on the death toll here.
And Mr. Pena Nieto is correct that growth has yet to trickle down to many workers. Real wages have barely increased. Indeed, one reason that Mexico has captured market share from China is the narrowing gap between Chinese and Mexican wages.
Brazil and Mexico probably have more in common than their supposed rivalry would suggest. Each has stabilized its economy after decades of veering from crisis to crisis and improved the well-being of many of its citizens.
In Brazil, "the dividends of what it did in the 1990s paid off with a political transition dovetailing with commodity prices," said Lisa M. Schineller, a Latin America analyst for Standard & Poor's. "It all came together."
Now the two countries also face many of the same problems: inadequate schools, creaky infrastructure, bureaucracy and corruption.
Mexico's political paralysis has stopped it from taking effective measures to break up monopolies, rewrite labor laws, collect more taxes and pry open the world's most closed oil company, changes that would add 2.5 percentage points to its growth rate, the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness estimated.
The question is how these middle-income countries find a way to advance further, said Shannon K. O'Neil, a Latin American analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Trying to move from G.D.P. per capita of $5,000 to $10,000 is much easier than moving from $10,000 to $20,000," she said. "I think that's the challenge that both face."

Full text: Ever since Greece hit the skids, we've heard a lot about what's wrong with everything Greek. Some of the accusations are true, some are false -- but all of them are beside the point. Yes, there are big failings in Greece's economy, its politics and no doubt its society. But those failings aren't what caused the crisis that is tearing Greece apart, and threatens to spread across Europe.
No, the origins of this disaster lie farther north, in Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin, where officials created a deeply -- perhaps fatally -- flawed monetary system, then compounded the problems of that system by substituting moralizing for analysis. And the solution to the crisis, if there is one, will have to come from the same places.
So, about those Greek failings: Greece does indeed have a lot of corruption and a lot of tax evasion, and the Greek government has had a habit of living beyond its means. Beyond that, Greek labor productivity is low by European standards -- about 25 percent below the European Union average. It's worth noting, however, that labor productivity in, say, Mississippi is similarly low by American standards -- and by about the same margin.
On the other hand, many things you hear about Greece just aren't true. The Greeks aren't lazy -- on the contrary, they work longer hours than almost anyone else in Europe, and much longer hours than the Germans in particular. Nor does Greece have a runaway welfare state, as conservatives like to claim; social expenditure as a percentage of G.D.P., the standard measure of the size of the welfare state, is substantially lower in Greece than in, say, Sweden or Germany, countries that have so far weathered the European crisis pretty well.
So how did Greece get into so much trouble? Blame the euro.
Fifteen years ago Greece was no paradise, but it wasn't in crisis either. Unemployment was high but not catastrophic, and the nation more or less paid its way on world markets, earning enough from exports, tourism, shipping and other sources to more or less pay for its imports.
Then Greece joined the euro, and a terrible thing happened: people started believing that it was a safe place to invest. Foreign money poured into Greece, some but not all of it financing government deficits; the economy boomed; inflation rose; and Greece became increasingly uncompetitive. To be sure, the Greeks squandered much if not most of the money that came flooding in, but then so did everyone else who got caught up in the euro bubble.
And then the bubble burst, at which point the fundamental flaws in the whole euro system became all too apparent.
Ask yourself, why does the dollar area -- also known as the United States of America -- more or less work, without the kind of severe regional crises now afflicting Europe? The answer is that we have a strong central government, and the activities of this government in effect provide automatic bailouts to states that get in trouble.
Consider, for example, what would be happening to Florida right now, in the aftermath of its huge housing bubble, if the state had to come up with the money for Social Security and Medicare out of its own suddenly reduced revenues. Luckily for Florida, Washington rather than Tallahassee is picking up the tab, which means that Florida is in effect receiving a bailout on a scale no European nation could dream of.
Or consider an older example, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, which was largely a Texas affair. Taxpayers ended up paying a huge sum to clean up the mess -- but the vast majority of those taxpayers were in states other than Texas. Again, the state received an automatic bailout on a scale inconceivable in modern Europe.
So Greece, although not without sin, is mainly in trouble thanks to the arrogance of European officials, mostly from richer countries, who convinced themselves that they could make a single currency work without a single government. And these same officials have made the situation even worse by insisting, in the teeth of the evidence, that all the currency's troubles were caused by irresponsible behavior on the part of those Southern Europeans, and that everything would work out if only people were willing to suffer some more.
Which brings us to Sunday's Greek election, which ended up settling nothing. The governing coalition may have managed to stay in power, although even that's not clear (the junior partner in the coalition is threatening to defect). But the Greeks can't solve this crisis anyway.
The only way the euro might -- might -- be saved is if the Germans and the European Central Bank realize that they're the ones who need to change their behavior, spending more and, yes, accepting higher inflation. If not -- well, Greece will basically go down in history as the victim of other people's hubris.

Abstract: Since Mr. Obama took office, 780,000 private sector jobs have been created, while the number of public sector jobs has fallen by about 600,000, mostly at the state and local level.

Full text: PRESIDENT OBAMA caused a stir recently when he said that "the private sector is doing fine" and pinned many of the nation's economic troubles on a decline in public-sector employment. He cited some interesting numbers, but he didn't draw the right lesson -- namely, that America is witnessing a collapse of trust in politics, including the shaping of its broad economic policy.
Since Mr. Obama took office, 780,000 private sector jobs have been created, while the number of public sector jobs has fallen by about 600,000, mostly at the state and local level. A quick look might suggest that we need only to bolster the number of public sector jobs to have a healthier economy, but there is a deeper way to think about the problem.
State and local governments are controlled by politicians and, indirectly, by voters. And for better or worse, those voters have lost faith in the social returns of these jobs and our ability to afford them. The voters have responded by looking to cut expenses, and they've chosen state and local government employment as a target.
During the financial crisis, the prices of stocks, homes and other assets all fell, leaving the American public feeling less wealthy. In fact, the Federal Reserve reported last week that the crisis had erased almost two decades of accumulated prosperity for a typical family. The American economy and its financial system failed a giant stress test, at least when compared with previous expectations. Feeding the fears today are the crisis in the euro zone, the slowdown in China and political polarization at home.
In short, there is a prevailing sense that we are simply not as safe, financially speaking, as we used to be. The productive capacity of the economy may appear largely intact, but the perceived risk is significantly higher.
Should state and local government jobs be such a low priority? There is considerable disagreement on this issue, but voters in most states have hardly been screaming to have those fiscal decisions overturned. Indeed, voters in San Diego and San Jose, Calif., chose earlier this month to sharply reduce pension benefits of city workers. Clearly, the decline in perceived wealth has brought a new, hard-to-manage shift away from government investment.
In response, some people have moralized about this shift -- sometimes by telling voters they're stupid to let government shrink. But that kind of talk can lower public trust even further. First, we all need to understand the problem.
SIMPLY recreating those state and local government jobs, without making other significant and confidence-restoring changes, may not bring much prosperity. After all, if the public feels a basic need to take less risk and to invest less money, such tinkering with one part of government spending would only bring demands to make offsetting cuts somewhere else.
The slow cure for this problem is to allow asset prices, along with perceived wealth and trust, to return to or exceed the previous levels over time. Americans would then spend and invest more money, bolstering both aggregate demand and supply, and in both the private and public sectors. But the process would be cumbersome, partly because trust is more easily destroyed than restored.
Various policies that are being put on the table, including forms of fiscal and monetary stimulus, try to accelerate this repair process. They would all be likely to underperform, partly because the public, rightly or wrongly, doesn't see them as ways to rebuild confidence. We have become skeptical of our own macroeconomic authorities and abilities, and that, in turn, makes successful policy harder to pull off.
For instance, there is a good case to be made for monetary expansion, given the current low rate of inflation and high rate of unemployment. But if fear of inflation puts off the American public, such a policy will again underperform, relative to what we have learned in textbooks. There won't be a credible commitment to see the monetary stimulus through, as people panic that resulting inflation will be used to redistribute wealth. (Although Sweden and Switzerland have had effective monetary policies recently, both of those countries have especially high rates of trust in government.)
The American problem is a particularly strong spin on John Maynard Keynes's concept of "animal spirits" -- the human emotion that drives confidence. These days, however, it's often the government that is spooking Americans. Too much debate is focusing on textbook remedies, and not enough on just how much trust has been broken.
We often hear the argument that our government should borrow and spend more money because the real rate of return on government borrowing is so low, as evidenced by bond yields. Maybe, but those yields are low because alternative investments are perceived as so risky, and people want a haven for their money.
Should government double-down on these risks by borrowing more money and pursuing more investment? After all, such a policy is supposed to be self-validating because of the accompanying economic stimulus. But will it be seen that way? Will government protect us from the risks of its potential mistakes?
That's not an easy debate to settle here, but suffice it to say that without more trust, it won't happen on a large scale.
The reason that we aren't getting more expansionary macro policy is fundamental: a lack of trust. It's not an easy problem to fix, but the place to start is by recognizing it.

Full text: As markets pummeled Spanish and Italian government bonds this week after Europe's latest effort to contain the euro crisis, Germany seemed increasingly isolated in its demands for more austerity. The June 9 cover of The Economist portrayed the world economy as a sinking oil tanker with the caption, "Please can we start the engines now, Mrs. Merkel?"
In the United States, the Obama administration has been urging Germany for months to loosen its tough conditions for helping its euro zone brethren. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, lost an ally last month when France's Francois Hollande, who campaigned for more stimulus and less austerity, defeated Nicolas Sarkozy. As recession- and riot-stricken Greece prepares to vote this weekend, evidence is mounting that the German-mandated cold shower isn't working.
So why is Germany being so intransigent?
"The Germans aren't crazy," Jacob Kirkegaard, an economist and European specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me this week. "They've read the same economics texts. They understand Keynesian economics and the case for stimulus."
He and other economists I spoke to this week ascribed Germany's stance to a combination of character, politics and economics -- and not so much the scars of World War II or the prewar inflation that ravaged Germany. Many Germans "are like the Swabian housewife," Peter Bofinger, a German economist and member of the German Council of Economic Experts, told me. (Swabians, from southwest Germany, are known for both their frugality and their strong work ethic, and Ms. Merkel lauded the Swabian homemaker in a 2008 speech.) "If you're spending too much, then you have to stop, and it's better to stop now than tomorrow," he said. "Our finance minister is fond of saying that in his hometown, Freiburg, they say, 'If everyone sweeps his own doorstep, the entire city will be clean.' "
He added, "There's a strong sense of fiscal rectitude and this is bolstered by a popular press that at every opportunity has conveyed the impression that countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy haven't done very much or tried very hard. Now, we have to bail them out. Why should we?"
Among Germany's leaders, "There was a belief that these countries have to go through the pain and then it gets better," he added. "They've committed a sin and now, to stop them from doing it again, they must suffer in purgatory."
The German attitude isn't that different from that of many Americans, who are still angry that Wall Street bankers were bailed out with tax dollars rather than punished for their profligacy.
Besides the moral hazard issue, German leaders have other political issues to contend with. "Applying a Keynesian perspective to the German approach is entirely misguided," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "The Germans aren't looking at this from a short-term economic perspective. They view this, entirely correctly in my view, as a political crisis that can only be resolved with greater fiscal and political union to complement the monetary union. No country is going to voluntarily give up its sovereignty. Yet if German taxpayers are going to be liable for Italian debt, then they have to have some democratic say in how Italy runs its affairs and spends German money. Without that, it's illegitimate. The markets want this to be resolved yesterday, but this takes time and political preparation."
Mr. Kirkegaard isn't alone in his view that a simple Keynesian approach to Europe would be misguided. "The uber-Keynesians just want to see bigger deficits and more spending," said Sebastian Mallaby, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. "We don't know what Keynes would have done because Keynes didn't live in world of huge budget deficits and massive sovereign debt. Spain was running a budget deficit in 2011 of 8.5 percent of gross domestic product. That's not sustainable. You need a path back to a sustainable budget, and that does require some belt-tightening. The Germans are right about that." He noted that the approach demanded by Germany isn't that different from what the International Monetary Fund has consistently extracted in numerous government rescue operations over the years.
But "where the Germans have gone wrong," Mr. Mallaby contended, "is the speed of the fiscal consolidation that they've mandated. You don't want to cut deficits so fast that the economy craters and you get riots in the streets. So you need to consolidate the budget but not so much that you kill the patient." He noted that during 2011, "budget deficits were cut quite a lot in Europe, but the ratio of government debt to G.D.P. increased because economies were shrinking." The Germans "need to be more generous."
Mr. Bofinger takes a harsher view. "Germany is responsible for the whole disaster," he said. "It overemphasized fiscal consolidation. It's a one-dimensional view. German leaders genuinely believed that financial markets would reward fiscal rectitude with lower interest rates. That was naive. It didn't happen. The problem is, it isn't easy politically to make a 180-degree turn. The German public needs to be re-educated. It will take a lot of courage and leadership from Merkel."
In the meantime, Europe seems destined to lurch from crisis to crisis -- but, in Mr. Kirkegaard's rosier view, will muddle through to achieve Germany's long-cherished dream for Europe, which is a closer fiscal and political union. "One should not underestimate that the Germans will ultimately pay whatever it takes to make this work," he said. "It's well understood among the German political elite and economic elite that no country has gained more from the euro than Germany. It has a massive export-based economy with a relatively weak currency, which is a tremendous benefit. Germany will write a check, but will only sign it on its terms. The way the German leadership views the crisis is simple: it's a way for them to get a better deal. That's why you see the same pattern. Angela says, 'No, no, no.' The crisis gets worse, Germany gains more concessions. Then she says, 'Yes.' "
Mr. Kirkegaard said he realized this might be a contrarian view but, "I think this is the only way forward."
So, apparently, does Ms. Merkel. In a speech to Germany's Parliament on Thursday, she said "no" again. She acknowledged that "all eyes are on Germany" but staunchly rejected the notion of any "miracle cures," like issuing euro bonds backed by Germany or guaranteeing bank deposits throughout Europe. She instead urged Europe to undertake the "herculean task" of political union. "It is our task today to make up for what was not done" when the euro was created, Ms. Merkel said, "and to end the vicious circle of ever new debt, of not sticking to rules."
The Germans have a point. Germany still has a triple-A credit rating and is in a position to rescue its more profligate neighbors for the very reason that the Germans have refused to write a blank check. But the danger is that Germany says "no" one time too many, pushing Europe and the world economy over the brink. With each failed effort to contain the crisis, that moment seems closer.

Full text: THE slow pace of the American economic recovery seems likely to be a major issue in this year's presidential election. But by the standards of other developed countries, the United States has done rather well since the credit crisis blossomed in 2008 and sent the world into recession.
The American economy, adjusted for inflation, was 1.2 percent larger in the first quarter of this year than it was in the peak quarter before the recession.
As the accompanying charts show, only Canada among the Group of 7 industrialized economies has done better. It has benefited from being an exporter of natural resources that China needs, but it also escaped the worst of the downturn because its banks, better regulated than those in this country, did not finance a real estate bubble during the boom.
Even Canada, however, had one quarter last year when its economy declined.
The charts show the performance of the Group of 7 nations, including three members of the euro zone, and that of seven other countries that use the euro. Of the 14, the United States is the only one to show consistent growth over the most recent four quarters. It has reported a growing economy for 11 consecutive quarters, even if the pace of growth has not been very fast.
At the bottom of the global recession, the American economy was 5.1 percent smaller than it had been at the peak and the recession ranked as the deepest since World War II. The only other recession since the Great Depression to shave as much as 3 percent from gross domestic product was the one in 1973 to 1975, brought on by the shock of higher oil prices. It took seven quarters for the American economy to regain all its losses during and after that downturn; this time it took twice as long.
When the American economy hit its low, it appeared that the United States ranked in the middle group of industrialized countries in terms of severity of recession. Portugal appeared to have escaped with a maximum decline of just 4.1 percent, and Spain with a loss of slightly less than 5 percent. But in the new downturn, Portugal now has a total decline of 5.2 percent, and Spain, buffeted by the need to bail out its banks, may be headed to a new low. Its economy has declined for two consecutive quarters. Italy, which like Spain is finding lenders hesitant to buy government bonds, has reported G.D.P. declines for the last three quarters.
Portugal, Ireland and Greece are the countries that were bailed out by Europe, but so far not one has shown much sign of recovery. Greece has now endured 13 consecutive quarters of decline, with no end in sight. Ireland for a time appeared to be a relative success story, as its G.D.P. grew at a rate of more than 4 percent in the first half of 2011. But it fell back later in the year.

Full text: Stocks advanced Thursday, erasing a weekly loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, amid reports that policy makers might act to help economies battered by the European debt crisis.
The S.& P. 500 gained 1.1 percent to 1,329.09. and is up 0.3 percent for the week.
"Good inflation data and weak employment is a good stage for a Fed policy response," Kevin Shacknofsky, a money manager for Alpine Mutual Funds in Purchase, N.Y., said in an e-mail. "We are at the stage where bad news is good news in terms of a policy response. Jobs will be the critical factor that influences the Fed."
Speculation grew that the Federal Reserve would discuss stimulus efforts at its meeting next week after reports showed jobless claims unexpectedly climbed by 6,000 to 386,000 last week and the cost of living fell by the most in more than three years.
The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index fell 0.3 percent in May, more than forecast and the biggest drop since December 2008, after no change in April. Economists projected a 0.2 percent decrease, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Stocks extended gains amid reports that central banks might increase liquidity as financial markets brace for possible turmoil from Greek elections this weekend.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mervyn A. King, the Bank of England governor, are preparing two programs to increase the flow of credit as the outlook deteriorates in the euro zone. Reuters reported that central banks were willing to coordinate actions if needed to raise liquidity in financial markets. The news service cited officials linked to the Group of 20 nations.
Stocks briefly pared gains as the Egan-Jones Ratings Company reduced its rating on France's government debt, feeding concern about contagion from the debt crisis.
The S.& P. 500 tumbled as much as 9.9 percent from a four-year high in April through June 1 amid lower-than-forecast economic data and concern that Europe's debt crisis was spreading. The index has rebounded 4 percent since.
The S.& P. 500 fell Wednesday as borrowing costs rose in Italy and Germany before elections in Greece that might determine whether it will leave the euro zone. Greeks will vote on Sunday after an inconclusive May 6 election that catapulted into second place a party opposed to austerity accords tied to 240 billion euros, or $301 billion, in international aid pledges received since May 2010.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.24 percent to close at 12,651.91. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.63 percent to 2,836.33.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 12/32, to 101, and the yield rose to 1.64 percent from 1.60 percent late Wednesday.
The Fed, which will gather two days after the election in Greece, has said that country's departure from the euro would deepen the European debt crisis and threaten economic expansion in the United States. The central bank bought $2.3 trillion in bonds in two rounds of so-called quantitative easing from 2008 through 2011 to stimulate growth through lower borrowing costs.

Abstract: "The bank and the Treasury are working together on a 'funding for lending' scheme that would provide funding to banks for an extended period of several years, at rates below current market rates and linked to the performance of banks in sustaining or expanding their lending to the U.K. nonfinancial sector," Mr. King told a room of bankers and other financial institution executives at an annual dinner.

Full text: LONDON -- The two largest European economies that do not use the euro announced measures on Thursday to help shelter their countries from a crisis that has engulfed Greece and Spain and appears poised to sweep over Italy.
While Britain and Switzerland will never be immune to the problems of the euro zone, their leaders are trying to set up whatever bulwarks they can to prevent their financial systems and broader economies from being dragged down if the crisis deepens.
In Britain, the government and central bank announced plans for a special bank-financing effort to increase lending to businesses, while Switzerland's central bank said it was prepared to take action to keep the value of the Swiss franc from rising further. It also said that Credit Suisse needed to increase its capital this year to prepare for a potential worsening of the debt crisis.
The British plan would provide banks with funds below market rates in exchange for collateral and a commitment to lend to businesses, Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said in a speech. He said the program could be in place within weeks.
The step would be less far-reaching than the European Central Bank's longer-term refinancing operation, which temporarily improved confidence in European markets after it was announced in December. But it would come in addition to an existing Bank of England program to purchase $:325 billion ($505 billion) in bonds. Mr. King also hinted that the central bank would expand the bond purchasing program further because the economic outlook was deteriorating.
"The bank and the Treasury are working together on a 'funding for lending' scheme that would provide funding to banks for an extended period of several years, at rates below current market rates and linked to the performance of banks in sustaining or expanding their lending to the U.K. nonfinancial sector," Mr. King told a room of bankers and other financial institution executives at an annual dinner.
While Britain does not belong to the euro zone, the bloc is the country's largest trading partner and Britain's banks have large operations in several euro zone countries. The British economy has slipped into recession, and prospects for growth in the near future are slim.
The Bank of England has come under growing pressure in recent weeks to step up its actions to help spur the economy. In his speech, Mr. King rejected earlier proposals that the central bank should not only buy bonds but also private sector assets, arguing that it would hurt the central bank's independence and increase risks for taxpayers.
In a speech at the same dinner, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said that "a lack of credit is damaging businesses and costing jobs." The bank-financing proposal would "inject new confidence into our financial system and support the flow of credit to where it is needed in the real economy," he said.
"We are not powerless in the face of the euro zone debt storm," he said.
In Switzerland, the head of the country's central bank warned that the country was faced with a potentially destabilizing tide of capital fleeing the euro crisis. He said that the monetary authorities were prepared to take action "at any time" to keep the Swiss franc from rising further.
The central bank "remains prepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities" to hold down the franc, Thomas Jordan, the Swiss National Bank president, said at a news conference in Bern, according to a text of his remarks. "Even at the current rate, the Swiss franc is still high. Another appreciation would have a serious impact on both prices and the economy in Switzerland. The S.N.B. will not tolerate this."
And he warned that "the risks for the Swiss economic situation remain exceptionally high," citing the debt crisis, the global slowdown and the heady Swiss real estate market. A strong currency puts downward pressure on prices by making imports less expensive. The central bank expected prices this year to decline 0.5 percent, and inflation next year to be just 0.3 percent, rising to 0.6 percent in 2014.
The Swiss National Bank expected the country's economy to slow considerably in the second half of 2012, with full-year gross domestic product growth of about 1.5 percent. That level was still respectable by the standards of the euro zone, which was expected to stagnate.
The Swiss National Bank started intervening in the currency market last summer, saying in September that it would not allow the euro to fall below 1.20 francs, after the currency plunged in August to as low as 1.007 francs -- near parity -- and the dollar fell as low as 0.7071 franc. A currency at those levels put many Swiss businesses at a disadvantage against companies whose costs were counted in euros, renminbi, yen or dollars, while creating extreme deflationary pressures that the central bank feared would harm on monetary policy.
Since the central bank established the currency floor, the euro has only briefly ticked below 1.20 francs, but it has spent most of the last few months just above that level, suggesting that it would have fallen much further without intervention. On Thursday afternoon the euro was trading at 1.2011 francs, while the dollar was at 0.9533 franc.
Separately, the Swiss National Bank singled out Credit Suisse in its annual financial stability report as a bank that needed to "significantly expand its loss-absorbing capital during the current year." Credit Suisse's local rival, UBS, should just continue with its efforts to strengthen its capital, the central bank said.
Shares of Credit Suisse fell 10.5 percent in trading in Zurich on Thursday. UBS shares were down only slightly.
"Despite progress achieved, the big banks' loss-absorbing capital is still below the level needed to ensure sufficient resilience given the high risks in the environment," the central bank wrote in the report. "The big banks' importance for the Swiss economy and for financial stability requires that they further strengthen their resilience."
The central bank recommended that Credit Suisse consider suspending its dividend or raising capital by selling shares. Unlike UBS, Credit Suisse has continued to pay a dividend throughout the debt crisis.
Marc Dosch, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Zurich, said the bank was already working to reduce its risk-weighted assets and its capital ratio was above current requirements.
Based on the new Basel III banking requirements, which are being phased in over the coming years, the capital strength of the two large Swiss banks was "below average for international big banks," the central bank said. By the new measures, Credit Suisse's loss-absorbing capital was about 5.9 percent of risk-weighted assets and 7.5 percent for UBS, the central bank wrote.
The central bank assessed Credit Suisse's and UBS's capital strength in a hypothetical situation in which European countries, including Switzerland, and the United States slipped into a "deep recession" and economic growth in emerging markets declined "sharply."
As part of its program to assist banks, the Bank of England would provide lenders with bonds or treasury bills in exchange for collateral. The aim is to increase net lending to businesses while lowering borrowing costs for both banks and their customers. Some consumer groups have complained that interest rates on loans or mortgages are relatively high given that the Bank of England's main interest rate has been at a record low of 0.5 percent since 2009.
But some analysts have doubted that any move to improve the availability of credit would be enough to improve Britain's economy. That is because there is also less demand for credit as many businesses postpone larger investment programs in light of economic uncertainty and the turmoil in the euro zone.
An earlier government initiative intended to encourage banks to lend more by setting lending targets was perceived as a failure when Britain's biggest banks fell short of some of the 2011 targets, citing sluggish demand.
Mr. King said the new measures would "support the banking sector, and provide it with incentives to increase lending to the real economy."
Mr. Osborne also added more pressure on European leaders to find a solution to the deteriorating crisis in the euro zone. He repeated earlier comments that a Greek exit might be necessary.
"One thing is for sure," he said. "If the exit is the chosen route, then the euro zone must have a very good plan in place to prevent contagion. The worst case for everyone would be exit without a sufficiently ambitious response."

Full text: London
THE United Kingdom turned out to be a good European by not joining the euro zone. In the 1990s, when a few of us argued strongly that our country was not cut out to be in the euro zone, keen advocates of European unity tried to write us off as skeptics. They said it would be only a matter of time before the British people asked to join.
Instead, the doubts and fears we had about the euro unfortunately turned out to be true, reinforcing our sense that we needed a more independent status than other countries as Europe tried to unify.
If we had been in the currency zone during and after the 2007-8 banking crisis, I suspect that the euro would have broken apart by now. It is difficult to think that the euro zone could have withstood the pressures from the large banks here that were overextended, and that our own government bailed out. If we no longer had our own currency, there also would have been no devaluation to help us remain competitive, and the result would have been fewer exports and fewer jobs.
It is worth remembering that our membership in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the forerunner of the euro, was the largest factor in breaking that system apart 20 years ago. Why would the euro have been different?
Our politicians had sufficient self-knowledge to realize that our country was not prepared to make all the sacrifices of self-determination necessary to share a single currency with our neighbors. We also saw that our economy was not sufficiently in line with those of Germany and France to make sharing a currency feasible.
The founding fathers of the euro knew that countries had to bring their economies together closely for the currency project to succeed. Initially, they demanded convergence of currency rates and interest rates. They set maximum levels for state debts and deficits, and for inflation. This wisdom was overruled by governments, however, in a mad dash to get as many countries as possible into the currency zone. Some, like Italy and Greece, started with too much debt. Some, like Portugal and Greece, added too much debt. Some, like Spain and Ireland, let banks become overextended, requiring huge sums to bail them out.
What should be done to limit the damage stemming from this scheme? Those countries that wish to stay in the euro zone and have a realistic chance of doing so must demonstrate much more ability to curb their deficits so they can finance themselves at market rates. They need to show they can make themselves more competitive without a devaluation.
If the euro countries decide they want to integrate more, our government should negotiate a new relationship with their emerging country (call it Euroland). If they want to govern themselves as one state -- to provide central controls over taxing, spending and borrowing -- that would be a different deal from the grouping of countries we joined in 1972 to create the European Common Market. Most people here have never wanted much more than trade and friendship with our neighbors in what is now the European Union. Among the large majority here, there is little appetite for more common government.
Many of us in Parliament recognize the realities of the euro crisis, and are urging the government to outline a new relationship with Europe based on trade and friendship. We should not wish to stand in the way of a more integrated euro zone if that is what the members wish, as long as they understand our need to have different arrangements. We negotiated the right not to join the euro, just as we had negotiated not to join the European Union's common borders policy, its social policy, and elements of its criminal justice regime. We have always opposed common taxation and any common defense policy.
Our government need not apologize or disguise the simple fact that most of our voters want to live in an independent, democratic United Kingdom. I am sure American voters would not want to share a currency with Mexico and Canada, if it meant major economic decisions being made by a Union of the Americas over the heads of the president and Congress. That is how we feel about the euro.
Saving the whole euro area is altogether a more difficult task. It will require statesmanship and compromise of high order. The richer parts of the union -- Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Luxembourg -- will have to pay more to the poorer areas that are struggling with large debts and deficits. The poorer countries will have to take more austerity medicine to curb their borrowing. A way must be found to correct the large imbalances in trade and competitiveness. It will not be an easy sell to voters.
Somehow growth has to be restarted and more jobs generated. The largest question is whether there is political will to do it.

Abstract: In the United States, a glut of natural gas has led to a price drop of about 10 percent over the last month and more than 50 percent over the last year. Since much of the nation's electricity is produced by burning natural gas, that should ease summer air-conditioning expenses for consumers.

Full text: HOUSTON -- Mark Juull, a construction contractor for public and residential housing, has something to be thankful for in this sluggish economy: With global commodity prices falling, he's saving $200 a week on fuel for his three trucks and finding deals on aluminum, lumber and roof shingles, which are typically made from petroleum.
But he says he thinks prices for his raw materials could easily shoot right back up, so he is not passing any of his savings on to his customers. "When the economy hit me bad, I actually lost money," he said. "So with prices going down, I am recouping."
Businesses big and small are getting a break these days as the European financial crisis and slowing growth in China, India and the United States have pushed down the prices of a wide array of commodities in recent weeks. If the trend continues, businesses and consumers are likely to reap benefits through cheaper prices for goods ranging from cotton shirts to copper wiring and coffee beans. So far, however, businesses seem to be benefiting a lot more than their customers.
Over the last month, global oil prices have declined by about 12 percent, while corn, copper, lead, cocoa and coffee have all dropped by 5 percent or more. Prices of corn, cocoa, oats, cotton, rubber, coffee, aluminum, silver, zinc and nickel are all more than 20 percent lower than a year ago.
Gasoline prices are falling precipitously, too, down nearly 20 cents over the last month alone, to a national average of $3.54 a gallon on Wednesday. That is nearly 45 cents below the high for the year reached in early April. The average household consumes 1,200 gallons of gasoline a year, so every dime shaved off the price of gas translates into a $120 annual savings, according to the Oil Price Information Service.
"The world economy is in risk of a recession and on that possibility, commodity prices weaken," said Allen L. Sinai, chief global economist for Decision Economics, a consulting firm. "Lower inflation comes with weakening economies."
Oil is among the commodities that have fallen in price the fastest despite continuing tensions in the Middle East and the tightening sanctions on Iran. OPEC production has been soaring in recent months because of mushrooming crude exports from Iraq, an almost total resumption of exports from Libya since the fall of the Qaddafi dictatorship, and a concerted drive by Saudi Arabia to push up production. At a meeting in Vienna on Thursday, OPEC is expected to decide to keep production steady despite weakening prices.
In the United States, a glut of natural gas has led to a price drop of about 10 percent over the last month and more than 50 percent over the last year. Since much of the nation's electricity is produced by burning natural gas, that should ease summer air-conditioning expenses for consumers. It will also help manufacturers, especially those who make plastics, fertilizers and other products that use natural gas as a feedstock.
But while consumers are pleased by lower fuel prices, they say they have yet to see much relief in the prices of other products linked to commodities.
"I don't feel food is going down," said Connie Shanley, a homemaker shopping at a Whole Foods store this week in West University Place, Tex. "Paper towels, deodorant, soap, cleaning products seem to be going up. The total bill seems to be more."
Libba Letton, a Whole Foods spokeswoman, conceded that there were limited benefits for consumers in the short term.
"Typically these market fluctuations do not immediately affect Whole Foods Market because we have long-term contracts with our suppliers," she said.
Other businesses also acknowledge that prices for raw materials go up and down far faster than the prices their customers pay for finished goods. Clothing retail executives have said they need to sell off inventory purchased when textile prices were higher before consumers can take full advantage of falling cotton prices, while car parts retailers say they are still paying high shipping costs that have not fallen along with lower fuel costs.
Paul J. Chakmak, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Boyd Gaming, a national chain of hotels and casinos, said his company was benefiting from lower jet fuel prices since it operates four weekly charter flights to shuttle tourists from Honolulu to Las Vegas. Lower natural gas prices help reduce the cost of cooking at hotel restaurants and of heating the shower water in 11,500 rooms. But he said the energy savings were marginal compared with labor and marketing costs, so customers would not see lower prices.
"It is a little soon," Mr. Chakmak said, to predict any long-lasting impact.
More than anything else, economists say, the steep drop in prices reflects deepening worries about a global economic slowdown as Greece prepares for elections next weekend that could lead to its withdrawal from the euro currency union, with financial repercussions across Europe and beyond. A sharp drop in European consumer demand, especially in Italy and Spain, has already reduced global trade in many goods.
But economists say that while manufacturers and retailers tend to pass higher costs on to their customers, they do not always pass along their savings when wholesale prices go down.
"Producers or stores tend to keep prices the same, and take a larger profit," said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Commodity prices are still generally high, and well above levels nearly four years ago, when the global financial panic reversed a seven-year bull market.
The decline in commodity prices varies widely depending on the raw material. Cotton prices are down nearly 50 percent over the last year, and have actually been recovering a bit in recent weeks. Copper, a metal that is viewed by many economists as a barometer for economic activity, is down by nearly 20 percent for the year. Gold, normally a commodity that soars with economic uncertainty, is higher but only by about 3 percent over the last year.
"Gold has behaved in line with risky assets, and the heightened uncertainty globally has not rallied the same support gold garnered on previous occasions," according to a recent research note from Barclays commodities.
Some analysts say that commodities have sold off so steeply that they are bound to turn around and resume the bull market that was spurred by growing demand from emerging middle classes in the developing world.
In an investment note this week, Goldman Sachs argued that oil and some other commodities were poised for a rebound. "Although the macroeconomic backdrop still remains uncertain, particularly in Europe," the bank said, "we believe that the price risks are now shifting more to the upside."
Some analysts note that China is still growing and importing large amounts of oil, and can be expected to be a steady importer of raw materials.
"The fact that China is moving from an export model to an internal consumption model may be positive for some commodities such as energy and agricultural products," said Nelson Louie, global head of commodities at Credit Suisse's asset management division.

Full text: Wall Street ended lower on Wednesday, driven down by fears ahead of the weekend elections in Greece.
Up to 800 million euros ($1 billion) have been pulled out of Greek banks daily before the election on Sunday, which many fear will result in Greece leaving the euro zone. If that happens, investors worry that other peripheral nations may also have to drop the euro.
The financial, energy and materials sectors were driven lower by concerns about the euro zone.
There is a "lack of details or specifics coming out of Europe, and that creates more of a vicious cycle," Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets in Boston, said. "The euro has been a concern every single day."
Also weighing on sentiment, the government reported that retail sales in the United States fell in May to their worst level in two years, the latest data to point to sluggish growth in the nation after a weaker-than-expected jobs report in May sparked widespread fears of a slowdown. The S.& P. retail index lost 1.5 percent.
Shares of JPMorgan Chase rose 1.6 percent as the bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, defended the portfolio behind JPMorgan's recent multibillion-dollar trading loss, telling lawmakers it was a genuine hedge aimed at making a profit if a credit crisis hit.
In the overall market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.42 points, or 0.62 percent, to 12,496.38. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 9.30 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,314.88. The Nasdaq composite index fell 24.46 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,818.61.
Investors have pushed Spain's 10-year borrowing costs to their highest level since the introduction of the euro in 1999, adding to uncertainty over the plan to bail out the country's struggling banks.
In the United States, government debt prices rose after a Treasury sale of new 10-year debt drew strong demand and weaker-than-expected inflation and consumer spending data reinforced the view of slowing economic growth.
Prices gained in early trading as the data raised expectations the Federal Reserve might embark on more bond purchases to support the economy, a move that would underpin private demand for Treasuries.
The gains were extended after the Treasury sold $22 billion in new 10-year notes at record low auction yields of 1.622 percent. The bid was aided by fears that Europe's debt crisis may worsen.
In trading for existing bonds, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 19/32, to 101 12/32, and the yield fell to 1.60 percent from 1.66 percent late Tuesday.
In company news, Dell, the No. 2 PC maker in the United States, said it intended to raise its target on dividends and share buybacks to 20 to 35 percent of free cash flow. Dell said its corporate software and services business was on track to grow by an average of 10 percent annually until 2016. Its shares advanced 2.5 percent to $12.27.
An influential government adviser in China was quoted as saying the country's economic growth could fall below 7 percent in the second quarter if weak activity persisted in June.
Investors have been looking to China's relatively robust expansion to pick up the slack from Europe, especially demand for commodities.

THE GREAT DIVERGENCE
America's Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It
By Timothy Noah
Illustrated. 264 pages. Bloomsbury Press. $25.
Rich people have more power than poor people, and they use that power to get what they want -- which is, normally, more wealth and more power. Across America, politicians invariably reflect the views of their richest constituents. And the Federal Reserve, too, appears to have been captured by the rich: It seems much more worried about the specter of possible future inflation (which might be bad for the rich) than it is about the tragedy of present-day unemployment (which is calamitous for today's jobless).
Right now, it turns out, is a great time to be rich -- quite possibly the best time ever. Over the course of what both Paul Krugman and Timothy Noah call the "Great Divergence" (Mr. Noah took that title for his book from a phrase used by Mr. Krugman in "The Conscience of a Liberal"), the top 1 percent doubled its share of national income. The happy one in a hundred had 12 percent of all income in 1984; that had risen to 24 percent in 2007.
As a result, the very title of Mr. Krugman's new book, "End This Depression Now!," is going to ring a little false to his wealthiest readers. What depression? Sure, a lot of rich people lost a lot of money when the stock market crashed at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009. But then the government and the Federal Reserve stepped in, did what needed to be done, the markets turned around, and the economy started growing again. We're now in a recovery, not a depression.
Each of these books, in its own way, is an attempt to disabuse the rich of precisely that idea -- to explain that while they're doing perfectly well for themselves, an overwhelming majority of the population, the bottom 80 percent to 90 percent of the country, is struggling hard and has tasted none of the fruits that have been showered on the wealthy.
Take the quarter-century from 1980 to 2005, during which markets soared and America got indisputably richer: over that period, Mr. Noah, a columnist for The New Republic, says that fully 80 percent of the nation's income gains went to just the top 1 percent. Most Americans' incomes stagnated, with the middle class getting nowhere. Mr. Krugman takes a shorter view, and demonstrates that the same group suffered dreadfully in the financial crisis, and that its plight continues today. Both of them try to inject urgency back into the national debate, spelling out how unacceptable the status quo is, and calling on the government to do something about it as a matter of the highest priority.
Their pleas will fall on deaf ears, as long as the rich remain well fed and in charge of the levers of power in Washington. That's a matter of simple political reality. But that just makes it all the more important for these books to be compelling reads in their own right. And sadly, neither author is at his best working at book length.
Mr. Krugman, the Nobel laureate and Princeton professor whose New York Times column and blog have made him arguably the most important and influential Op-Ed columnist in the nation, writes daily with fluency and fervor about the greatest issues facing the world. But give him a book to fill, and he starts becoming a bit repetitive: Reading this one is like listening to a Wagner opera in which the lead character first tells you what he's going to say, and then he says it, and then he tells you what he just said.
What's more, the real heart of "End This Depression" is distressingly thin. There are 13 chapters, plus an introduction and a postscript, and just one -- Chapter 12 -- attempts to deliver on the promise of the title and explain what Mr. Krugman would have the government actually do to improve our collective lot. And that chapter is pretty short. There are precious few detailed policy proposals here, and it would be extremely difficult to put a price tag on what Mr. Krugman wants. A lot of it is more attitude than money, in any case: the idea, for instance, that Ben Bernanke needs to demonstrate "Rooseveltian resolve" in his quest to get the country moving.
Would Mr. Krugman's vague prescription -- which boils down, at heart, to old-fashioned Keynesian stimulus -- really end this depression? Are we even in a depression? We're certainly suffering the aftermath of a particularly nasty financial crisis, and more government spending would surely help, at the margin.
But without knowing how much money Mr. Krugman proposes to spend, it's hard to judge what he's proposing. And he chooses to sidestep the idea, put forward most famously by the economic historians Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, that a recession of this magnitude was inevitable after a major financial crisis, and that there's very little any government could have done to prevent it.
Instead, we get yet another potted history of how we got into this mess in the first place, and a pretty large dose of politics. Mr. Krugman loves to explain why he thinks that Republicans are worse than wrong: They believe in a "dogma," he writes, that is "basically absurd." This is good for point scoring, but it does nothing to help the reader follow a clear argument.
Mr. Noah's book was born out of a wonderful project at Slate, which I highly recommend. And it opens with a terrific chapter, full of eye-opening data points and some very smart history. I had no idea, for instance, that in 1942 Franklin Roosevelt proposed a 100 percent marginal tax rate on incomes that were the equivalent of about $345,000 today: "F.D.R. wanted to bookend the minimum wage he'd created a decade earlier with a new maximum wage," Mr. Noah writes. "Congress didn't let him, but the idea won popular support."
But "The Great Divergence," like Mr. Krugman's volume, is written by someone who works best at shorter length. And they share another problem: There's no real story being told here. Mr. Noah never delivers on the promise of that first chapter, and instead has a tendency to get bogged down in long recitations of history.
In a book about the rise of income inequality since 1979, we don't really need eight pages on the history of immigration in the United States, or four full pages about the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. Especially when the ultimate point being made is that neither turned out to be very important in terms of rising inequality.
At the beginning of his book, Mr. Noah expresses "an enormous sense of urgency about the way this country is changing and our need to get it back on the right track"; Mr. Krugman surely feels the same way. But by the time he has reached the end, Mr. Noah, like Mr. Krugman, winds up with a chapter of prescriptions that seem wholly inadequate.
Yes, we should raise taxes on the rich by $30 billion a year, open our borders to skilled immigrants and even repeal Taft-Hartley. But none of those moves, individually or in combination, would make a real dent in the extreme inequality that we're living with today. This is now a country run by the rich, for the rich. And nothing in either of these books gives me reason to believe that there's any hope of changing that.

The earnings of the median family in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution actually increased from 2007 to 2010, in part because of the expansion of government aid programs during the recession.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The recent economic crisis left the median American family in 2010 with no more wealth than in the early 1990s, erasing almost two decades of accumulated prosperity, the Federal Reserve said Monday.
A hypothetical family richer than half the nation's families and poorer than the other half had a net worth of $77,300 in 2010, compared with $126,400 in 2007, the Fed said. The crash of housing prices directly accounted for three-quarters of the loss.
Families' income also continued to decline, a trend that predated the crisis but accelerated over the same period. Median family income fell to $45,800 in 2010 from $49,600 in 2007. All figures were adjusted for inflation.
The new data comes from the Fed's much-anticipated release on Monday of its Survey of Consumer Finances, a report issued every three years that is one of the broadest and deepest sources of information about the financial health of American families.
While the numbers are already 18 months old, the survey illuminates problems that continue to slow the pace of the economic recovery. The Fed found that middle-class families had sustained the largest percentage losses in both wealth and income during the crisis, limiting their ability and willingness to spend.
"It fills in details to a picture that we already knew was quite ugly, and these details very much underscore that," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. "It makes clear how devastating this has been for the middle class."
Given the scale of those losses, consumer spending has remained surprisingly resilient. The survey also illuminates where the money is coming from: American families saved less and only slowly repaid debts.
The share of families saving anything over the previous year fell to 52 percent in 2010 from 56.4 percent in 2007. Other government statistics show that total savings have increased since 2007, suggesting that a smaller group of families is saving more money, while a growing number manage to save nothing.
The survey also found a shift in the reasons that families set aside money, underscoring the lack of confidence that is weighing on the economy. More families said they were saving money as a precautionary measure, to make sure they had enough liquidity to meet short-term needs. Fewer said they were saving for retirement, or for education, or for a down payment on a home.
The report underscored the limited progress that households had made in reducing the amounts that they owed to lenders. The share of households reporting any debt declined by 2.1 percentage points over the last three years, but 74.9 percent of households still owed something, and the median amount did not change.
The decline in reported incomes could have increased the weight of those debts, tying up a larger share of families' take-home pay. But one of the rare benefits of the crisis, historically lower interest rates, has helped to offset that effect. Families also have been able to reduce debt payments by refinancing into mortgages with longer terms and deferring repayment of student loans and other obligations.
The survey also confirmed that Americans are shifting the kinds of debts they carry. The share of families with credit card debt declined by 6.7 percentage points to 39.4 percent, and the median balance fell 16.1 percent to $2,600.
Families also reduced the number of credit cards that they carried, and 32 percent of families said they had no cards, up from 27 percent in 2007.
Conversely, the share of families with education-related debt rose to 19.2 percent in 2010 from 15.2 percent in 2007. The Fed noted that education loans made up a larger share of the average family's obligations than loans to buy automobiles for the first time in the history of the survey.
The cumulative statistics concealed large disparities in the impact of the crisis.
Families with incomes in the middle 60 percent of the population lost a larger share of their wealth over the three-year period than the wealthiest and poorest families.
One basic reason for this disproportion is that the wealth of the middle class is mostly in housing, and the median amount of home equity dropped to $75,000 in 2010 from $110,000 in 2007. And while other forms of wealth have recovered much of the value lost in the crisis, housing prices have hardly budged.
Those middle-income families also lost a larger share of their income. The earnings of the median family in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution actually increased from 2007 to 2010, in part because of the expansion of government aid programs during the recession. Wealthier families, which derive more income from investments, were also cushioned against the recession.
The data does provide the latest indication, however, that the recession reduced income inequality in the United States, at least temporarily. The average income of the wealthiest families fell much more sharply than the median, indicating that some of those at the very top of the ladder slipped down at least a few rungs.
Ranking American families by income, the top 10 percent of households still earned an average of $349,000 in 2010.
The average net worth of the same families was $2.9 million.

Full text: GUANGZHOU, China -- With China's domestic economy stumbling badly this spring as construction and retail sales slow, this country is unleashing a fresh surge of exports that is preserving millions of jobs in Chinese factories but could fan trade tensions with the West.
China's General Administration of Customs announced on Sunday that exports had surged 15.3 percent in May from a year earlier, twice as fast as economists had expected and vaulting May past last December as the biggest month ever for Chinese exports. China's trade surplus has expanded in each of the last three months.
As indebted European economies slip into recession and unemployment inches back up in the United States, Chinese factories are outcompeting rivals in developing countries and the West to claim larger market shares even as global demand is barely rising.
"Our sales have picked up significantly and we're now overbooked," said Roger Lee, chief executive of the TAL Group in Hong Kong, one of the biggest suppliers of high-end dress shirts to department stores and luxury brands in the United States.
China's renewed success relies heavily on the American market, with Chinese exports to the United States soaring 23 percent in May from a year earlier, the data on Sunday showed. Chinese exports to the European Union rose only 3.2 percent.
But resurgent Chinese exports also have the potential to become a political issue in the American elections in November. Mitt Romney, who has clinched the Republican nomination for president, has already promised in campaign ads to stand up to China more vigorously on currency issues. President Obama has set up an interagency group to investigate trade law violations, particularly by China.
Underpinning China's export success is a combination of long-term investments in automation and short-term depreciation of the currency.
Manufacturers across China are investing in labor-saving equipment, reorganizing shop floor management and taking other measures to control labor costs, which have been rising steeply as the country grows in prosperity.
Here in southern China, a manufacturer of home saunas has installed a $25,000 computer-controlled drill that does the work of up to eight people. A garment company in Wenxi, in eastern China, is buying machinery to manufacture buttons more cheaply. And a printer in Wuhan, in central China, is fully automating paper cutting and plans further investments in printing and binding, so that workers will only be required to package the finished product.
"We are investing in additional machinery so as to improve productivity," said Jessica Meng, the sales director at the printer, Maxleaf Stationery. "Labor costs are too high these days."
The move to automation, consistent across many industries, is a central reason that Chinese imports in the United States are becoming cheaper. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States show that average prices for goods imported from China edged down in April for the first time in almost two years, despite double-digit increases in labor costs.
Rising Chinese labor costs have not yet meant relief for China's rivals in other developing countries, Japan and the West, partly because automation is offsetting an erosion in Chinese competitiveness.
Beijing officials have strongly endorsed stepped-up equipment investments by exporters. Labor shortages in export zones have meant that workers have not tended to protest the introduction of more machinery.
As the domestic Chinese economy slows, the government is also counteracting some of the pain by taking currency actions to help exporters. The Chinese government allowed the country's tightly managed currency, the renminbi, to fall nearly 1 percent against the dollar last month, its largest drop since Beijing officials unpegged the currency from the dollar in July 2005. A weaker renminbi makes Chinese goods less expensive in foreign markets, and makes imports less affordable in China.
The competitive advantage for Chinese exporters is amplified by a fundamental shift in inflation. For years, producer prices in China were rising faster than producer prices in the United States. As a result, the inflation-adjusted exchange rate of the renminbi to the dollar was rising even faster -- it was up 40 percent since 2005, according to a Treasury report last month.
But producer prices in China have been falling this year. They were down 1.7 percent in May from a year earlier, as the popping of China's real estate bubble over the past year depressed demand for steel, cement and other materials. Producer prices have kept rising in the United States, so the inflation-adjusted exchange rate has moved about 2 percent in favor of China's exporters this year.
At the same time, weakness in China's domestic economy has resulted in more workers seeking jobs in export factories.
"It is easier to find workers this year, much easier," said James Jian, the general manager of Hongyuan Furniture here, a 200-employee manufacturer of home saunas that use infrared lights instead of hot rocks. Demand for the saunas, which cost $1,500 to $4,000, is particularly strong from affluent households in the United States, he added.
Chinese officials have also urged the country's state-owned banks to lend more to small and medium-size manufacturers, many of which are exporters. The country's 70 financial institutions, all state controlled, have been lending heavily to state-owned enterprises; some are exporters, but many are engaged more in domestic activities like real estate development and infrastructure.
In antisubsidy trade cases, however, the United States Commerce Department typically regards loans from state-owned banks as carrying subsidized interest rates. Loans are widely issued at fairly low interest rates through a system that allocates credit based partly on the Five-Year Plan and other national policies, as opposed to who can pay the highest risk-adjusted interest rate.
The strong Chinese exports in May came after a much weaker month in April, when shipments to Europe actually shrank. But American demand for Chinese goods has been consistently strong.
May had an extra workday this year and April had one fewer day because of the timing of Chinese holidays. But this has a limited effect on exports because manufacturers schedule enough shifts to meet demand.
The biggest question mark is the extent to which manufacturers can continue to offset rising labor costs with investments in automation and the reorganization of often-inefficient work practices.
China's current Five-Year Plan calls for industrial wages to rise 13 percent a year through 2015, and some cities have been raising their minimum wages even faster. Mr. Lee of the TAL Group said that his company's labor costs were already rising at least 15 percent a year. By contrast, productivity per worker is rising only half as fast as wages, he said, as the manufacture of woven shirts is hard to automate.
The TAL Group has found some efficiencies through reorganizing its employees into smaller work teams. If Foxconn, which makes iPhones and other electronic products for Apple and many other manufacturers, fully carries out all of the pay and overtime policy changes that it announced in February, then its labor costs per worker could rise as much as 40 percent, Mr. Lee said, adding that this would put heavy pressure on other manufacturers like TAL to raise wages even faster.
Many mainland Chinese and Hong Kong companies have started diversifying production by opening factories in Southeast Asia, where wages are now lower than in China. The TAL Group has diversified by setting up operations in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.
But many other Chinese companies compare Southeast Asia's infrastructure and bureaucracies unfavorably to China's and are staying close to home.
Hongyuan has just faced a choice of whether to send senior managers late this summer to a conference in Vietnam promoting factory investments there or to a trade fair in Las Vegas, said Rachel Wang, the sales manager.
After deciding that China was still a competitive base for exports, through use of equipment like the computer-controlled drill, and that the United States would keep importing, the company chose Las Vegas.

Abstract: Lucas Papademos, a former interim prime minister of Greece, said that Greece's departure from the euro zone would be catastrophic, pushing inflation in the country to as high as 50 percent, putting extreme stress on Greek banks and slashing living standards. "The stakes are exceptionally high," Mr. Papademos, who is also a former vice president of the European Central Bank, told a group of bankers in Copenhagen last week. "Because the decisions to be made at, and immediately after, the forthcoming elections will determine the country's future for at least the next decade."

Full text: FRANKFURT -- With an agreement to bail out Spain's struggling banks, Europe again avoided financial chaos in a debt crisis that is in its third year. But Europe still faces far bigger challenges that threaten the Continent and with it, the world economy.
The most urgent of those concerns is being driven by events in a country at the other edge of the euro zone: Greece.
While the Spanish banking rescue will be expensive -- as much as $125 billion -- it will be well within the means of a European emergency fund established for just such purposes.
Far harder to calculate are the costs if, after Greek elections next Sunday, the new government reneges on the bailout Greece negotiated with its European lenders a few months ago. That could lead to a withdrawal from the euro zone, threatening that currency union, which has largely benefited more prosperous members like Germany.
What is more, the Spanish bailout will do little to address European banks' addiction to the borrowed money they have depended on for their daily financing needs.
"The way the currency union has been functioning is not sustainable," Jens Weidmann, the president of the German Bundesbank, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "A breakup of the currency union would bring extremely high costs and risks that no one can really predict."
Lucas Papademos, a former interim prime minister of Greece, said that Greece's departure from the euro zone would be catastrophic, pushing inflation in the country to as high as 50 percent, putting extreme stress on Greek banks and slashing living standards.
"The stakes are exceptionally high," Mr. Papademos, who is also a former vice president of the European Central Bank, told a group of bankers in Copenhagen last week. "Because the decisions to be made at, and immediately after, the forthcoming elections will determine the country's future for at least the next decade."
Those problems would not be Greece's alone. Europe's big fear is contagion -- an infection of financial panic that could spread far beyond Greece. Spain's leaders have long said Greece's problems contributed to the general market uncertainties that helped undermine Spanish banks.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy cautioned that the ailing Spanish economy, Europe's fourth largest, which has had an unemployment rate of nearly 25 percent, would worsen before getting better.
"This year is going to be a bad one," he said.
And it may not end there, with Italy struggling with economic stagnation and escalating borrowing costs.
A critical question will be how Saturday's deal will be received by investors on Monday, particularly with the Greek elections approaching.
"By no means is this a solution," said Adam Parker, chief United States equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. The aid for Spain "could be a near-term positive from a trading standpoint, but you haven't solved anything in the long term."
The next task for European leaders is to show the rest of the world that they are making a credible effort to repair the flaws in the euro zone that allowed the problems in one small country, Greece, to threaten the world economy.
On June 28 and 29, European Union leaders will gather in Brussels to discuss, among other things, ways to forge closer fiscal integration. Despite calls from some leaders for shared oversight of budgets and deficit spending, no concrete proposals have been made.
Even if Greece ends up with a government willing to try to live up to the terms of its 130 billion-euro bailout deal by meeting its payments and striving to narrow its wide budget gap, strong doubts remain whether any new leadership in Athens can fulfill those obligations. A lot of private money has already fled Greece, while its deeply depressed economy and dwindling tax revenues threaten to put the country even deeper in the hole.
"Even in case of a new government, I doubt whether the institutional framework in Greece can guarantee the program," said Jurgen Stark, a former member of the European Central Bank's executive board. "Who has the competence to implement the program? That is the key point."
Mr. Stark is among those who contend the euro zone is strong enough to withstand a Greek departure. "There will be contagion," he said in a telephone interview. "But I think it can be managed. It will be costly in the short term. There will be benefits in the long term."
Jitters about what Greek voters might do may have helped soften statements from Germany, the euro zone's paymaster, in recent days. Although Berlin has been Greece's harshest economic critic, Germans awoke last Thursday to find Angela Merkel, their chancellor, telling them on television that Europe needed a fiscal union -- implying that some of their tax dollars may be needed to help the suffering Spaniards and Greeks.
"We need more Europe," Ms. Merkel said on ARD television. "We do not only need a monetary union, but we also need a so-called fiscal union. This means that we also need a common budgetary policy, and we also need a political union."
Such a statement might have provoked an outcry a year ago -- Ms. Merkel quickly played down the prospect of a "big bang" solution coming from the gathering in Brussels -- but Germans may be realizing that their own well-being is in imminent danger.
This week official data will provide more clues about how the crisis is affecting Europe's largest countries. Figures on industrial production in France and Italy are expected Monday and for the euro zone as a whole Wednesday.
Analysts have predicted declines, which would be bad for Germany because Europe's biggest trading partners are other European countries. But slower growth in Germany could also create a political backlash, making Germans more reluctant to help their stricken fellow euro zone citizens.
"If people think they are poorer maybe they become more reluctant to share the burden," said Clemens Fuest, economics professor at Oxford University.
Mr. Fuest said he was skeptical that Europeans would ever agree to delegate control over their national budgets to a European authority as part of a fiscal union. European leaders would be better off concentrating on measures that are more realistic, he said, like a common system for overseeing banks, guaranteeing deposits and dealing with sick financial institutions.
That could help avoid situations like those in Ireland, Cyprus or now Spain, where the cost of bank rescues raises doubts about the solvency of the national government.
Many proposals to push members of the European Union closer together would take years to carry out, too late to help ease current tensions. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said last week that it would help a lot if European leaders simply wrote a detailed plan for the future of the euro zone.
"The very fact of having an objective, a goal, an end point and a clear path would, by itself, contribute to a stabilization of the financial situation in Europe," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference.
How much time he and other leaders have to chart such a path may depend on what Greek voters decide.
"The Greek government, when one is formed, must send a clear signal that it is prepared to implement the reforms that have been agreed to," Mr. Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, told ARD on Sunday. "It's in the hands of the Greeks."

Full text: THE next meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers, on June 19 and 20, will probably be contentious. The latest employment report, showing anemic job growth for a third consecutive month and an uptick in unemployment, will surely make some Fed members want to take additional expansionary action. Others, however, appear steadfastly opposed.
The argument for additional monetary action is straightforward. By law, the Fed is supposed to aim for maximum employment and stable prices. But the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent -- a good two percentage points above what even the most pessimistic members say is its sustainable level. Moreover, the spate of disappointing data and the deepening crisis in Europe make continued weakness all too likely.
What about the arguments against further action? I don't think they are convincing enough to win the debate.
Some Fed members contend that monetary policy has already done its share. Other policy makers, they say, need to step up. Both the Fed's chairman and its vice chairwoman have talked about the need for additional near-term fiscal stimulus as part of a gradual deficit-reduction plan. And many Fed committee members have called for a more aggressive housing policy. Indeed, the Fed raised some hackles in January when it sent an unbidden white paper to Congress, outlining possible administrative and legislative initiatives to deal with problems like foreclosures and underwater homeowners.
I agree that we need more effective fiscal and housing policies. But neither is likely to happen, at least not before the presidential election. As a result, the Fed is the only plausible source of immediate help for the American economy. It was set up as an independent body precisely so that somebody can do what's right when politicians can't or won't.
I find a related argument even more frustrating: that the Fed shouldn't act because Congress wouldn't like it and might retaliate. This argument exposes the important truth that the Fed is only as independent as Congress lets it be.
But it also raises a key question: what are Fed policy makers saving their independence for? If rescuing millions of Americans from the torment of unemployment isn't a reason to risk their independence, what is?
In 1958, when the Fed was taking an unpopular stand to fight inflation, a very wise Fed chairman, William McChesney Martin, said this: "If the System should lose its independence in the process of fighting for sound money, that would indeed be a great feather in its cap and ultimately its success would be great." The current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, should add the phrase "and full employment" after "sound money," and paste that line on his bathroom mirror.
MANY Fed officials contend that additional action might push up inflation. But right now, the inflation measure that the Fed watches is a bit below its target of 2 percent, so that isn't an immediate issue.
Furthermore, most analyses suggest that the main determinant of inflation is the state of the economy. With continuing high unemployment at home and slowing growth abroad, inflation seems more likely to fall than to rise. And there's no evidence that a modest relaxation of the Fed's vigilance could cause inflation to jump suddenly. Inflation is likely to rise only if the economy takes off -- an outcome to pray for, not fear.
More fundamentally, the Fed's dual mandate doesn't say it should care about unemployment only so long as inflation is at or below the target. It's supposed to care about both equally. If inflation is at the target and unemployment is way above, it's sensible to risk a little inflation to bring down unemployment.
Beyond worrying that expansionary action might cause some inflationary pain, many Fed officials argue that the benefits, in terms of reduced unemployment, are likely to be small.
On this topic, there's a severe disconnect between central bankers and academic monetary economists. As Laurence Ball of Johns Hopkins University discussed in a recent paper, Mr. Bernanke epitomizes the two very different views. As an academic, he mocked the Bank of Japan for its claim in the 1990s that it was helpless in the face of persistent economic weakness. He detailed all the ways that a central bank could help an economy even when its benchmark interest rate was zero.
Yet, as Fed chairman, he has seemed to side with those who say the Fed's tools are limited right now. Professor Ball suggests that Mr. Bernanke's change of view was a result of peer pressure and groupthink among his Fed colleagues.
The academic literature shows that monetary policy can be very effective at reducing unemployment in situations like ours. In the recovery from the Great Depression, for example, aggressive expansion of the money supply played a large role in lowering the real cost of borrowing and in spurring growth.
After the Fed has pushed interest rates down to zero, its main remaining tool is communications. It can affect expectations of future growth and inflation, which can have powerful effects on consumer spending and business investment today. But to have a big impact, the monetary actions need to be bold -- and pursued with gusto. In an earlier column, I discussed one of economists' favorite examples of such a policy: setting a target for the path of nominal gross domestic product.
If the Fed doesn't want to do something as drastic as adopting a new operating procedure, it could at least make any smaller actions it takes more effective. The previous rounds of quantitative easing may have done little to improve expectations because their size and duration were limited in advance. If the Fed does another round, it should leave the overall size and end date unspecified. Or, better yet, the ultimate scale and timing could be tied to the goals the Fed wants to achieve.
Likewise, the Fed's statement about the federal funds rate has seemed almost intended to undermine any positive confidence effects. It says the Fed expects a low rate through late 2014, which is supposed to give people hope. But the low rate is then justified by invoking continued weakness in the economy, which is likely to make people want to hide under the covers.
Instead, the policy-making committee could adopt the proposal of Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, that the Fed pledge to keep rates near zero until unemployment is down to 7 percent or inflation has risen to 3 percent. Such conditional guidance assures people that the Fed will keep at the job until unemployment is down or the toll on inflation becomes unacceptable.
The Fed meeting will be the first for two new governors, Jerome H. Powell and Jeremy C. Stein. It would be a great time to confront some of the faulty arguments being made against aggressive Fed action. For all our sakes, I hope Mr. Powell and Mr. Stein jump right in.

Full text: More income should be taxed, a writer says. Readers react.
The Letter
To the Editor:
In a nation that prides itself on fair play and equal opportunity, it seems incongruous that people with wealth-based income -- interest, dividends, capital gains, rent -- are excused from paying Social Security (traditionally 12.4 percent) and Medicare taxes (2.9 percent) on that income. Equally odd, they do not pay Social Security tax on wages above $110,100. Shouldn't these taxes be paid on all income? Taxing the "earned" and not the "unearned" seems rather un-American, doesn't it?
The two preferences hark back to Social Security's 1930s groundbreaking origins. Without these exclusions, would there have been a political consensus to create Social Security? Maybe, maybe not, but no decision is fixed forever.
If these preferences were eliminated and the economy recovered to mirror a positive year like 2007, the Social Security Trust Fund would nearly double its annual revenue. We could expect to see an additional $500 billion for Social Security and $100 billion for Medicare. The additional Social Security inflow would almost cover the annual outflow, leaving most of the current revenue as a surplus to accommodate the baby boomers.
Virtually all income of the bottom 50 percent is "earned" and fully taxed for Social Security and Medicare. Many people are unaware that wealthy taxpayers are entitled to exempt much, if not most, of their wages, as well as investment income. Ending those exemptions would allow a major reduction in Social Security and Medicare tax rates.
Alternatively, if tax rates stayed at or near current levels, Congress could use half the new revenue to strengthen Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment and other support programs. The other half could be used to abolish the corporate income tax, which has averaged about $224 billion in annual revenues over the last decade.
Such a "grand bargain" would make the funding of the safety net fairer and eliminate the double taxation of dividends. Abolishing the corporate income tax would also make American companies more competitive internationally.

Readers React
Mr. Abert argues for imposing Social Security taxes on all income on the grounds that this nation prides itself on fair play. But the people of this nation also pride themselves on self-reliance.
Social Security gained its great popularity precisely because it is not a welfare program. People pay into it from the money they earn during their working years. The amount of benefits they receive is calculated based on lifetime earnings. No one feels guilty about getting Social Security because "it's my own money I'm getting back."
Mr. Abert's proposal would change all that. While the amount of income taxed would no longer be capped at $110,100, or at all, the maximum payments presumably would be limited. Thus, many Americans would pay taxes on income not included in the calculation of the benefits they will receive on retirement. In short, wealthier Americans will be subsidizing the retirement of the less wealthy. No one would any longer be able to say, "I'm just getting my own money back."
Franklin D. Roosevelt believed that Social Security could never be repealed because all workers invested in it and all shared an interest in its continuation. Breaking the link between taxes and benefits would destroy that sense of self-reliance that has long sustained the program. Turning Social Security into a welfare program would be the first step on the way to its eventual demise.
CHARLES W. SNYDER
Savannah, Ga., June 6, 2012
The writer is a lawyer.
I agree with some things Mr. Abert says and disagree with others. The most upsetting is using the excess revenues for things other than Social Security.
Revenues from the payroll tax do not go into the general fund. Sure, the surplus is invested in Treasury bonds, with proceeds going toward financing general government spending until the bonds mature and get paid back, but no Social Security money is used for anything other than Social Security. That is one key factor that gives Social Security such widespread support.
Increasing or abolishing the ceiling on earned income subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act, or F.I.C.A., contributions would alone finance Social Security in perpetuity, and the rate may even be lowered after the baby boom generation passes through the system.
The biggest problem Social Security has is that most Americans do not understand it. Participants (involuntarily, I'll grant you) make contributions to the fund while they are working, then withdraw from it when they retire. If the money just sat there, there would be no accumulation for population bulges, like the baby boom, and no increase for inflation. Therefore, it is invested in Treasury bonds, where it collects interest and allows the government to borrow domestically from its own citizens instead of sending interest payments to foreigners. The money is completely accounted for, and the government is obliged to pay the promised benefits.
It is an ingenious system, and we must do everything we can to preserve it.
SCOTT KOCHMAN
Brooklyn, June 6, 2012
Mr. Abert's letter points out the enormous inequity in our tax system that is heavily skewed in favor of the wealthy. I also agree with him that a tax code that treats "unearned income" more favorably than "earned income" is toxic in a society that still professes to have at least a modicum of commitment to equal rights and equal opportunity.
What I don't understand is the rationale for his proposal to abolish corporate income taxes. Don't the laws of the United States already treat corporations more favorably than ordinary mortals?
During the 1950s, corporations paid about 49 percent of their profits in taxes, yet the economy grew and the middle class expanded and prospered. By 2011, corporations paid taxes at about half that rate, as they outsourced American jobs, destroyed unions, deindustrialized the economy and hollowed out the middle class. Corporations should not be rewarded for their irresponsible behavior.
More important, Mr. Abert's proposed "grand bargain" needs to be viewed in the context of current political realities. The enormous concentration of wealth in a minuscule income group has spawned an incredibly influential elite who have gamed this country's dysfunctional political system and are able to shape it to serve their needs. Until this problem is addressed, no proposals that compel the wealthy to pay higher taxes, however meritorious, have a chance of ever being enacted into law.
PAUL L. NEVINS
Boston, June 6, 2012
The writer is a lawyer.
There are several points I take issue with in Mr. Abert's letter.
There is a limit on Social Security payments in retirement. So if we raise the current cap on F.I.C.A. taxes from $110,100 to infinity, should we also raise the maximum Social Security retirement benefit? If not, then where is the "fairness" in that?
Mr. Abert's references to a "positive year like 2007" would be more accurately translated as "bubble year." The economy in 2012 is most likely the new normal, so the additional revenue Mr. Abert cites is highly suspect.
There are many retirees who, after working 30 to 40 years, have amassed a "golden years" nest egg. As the Federal Reserve maintains record low interest rates, many retirees have found their income decimated. To add an F.I.C.A. tax on the earned interest, even at a reduced level, would add insult to injury.
While I agree with Mr. Abert that abolishing the corporate income tax would make American companies more competitive internationally, the current political reality will keep that a distant fantasy. Until our multitrillion-dollar national debt is pared down, corporations should not be let off the hook.
JOHN LAIDO
Brooklyn, June 7, 2012
Eight decades ago it was a new notion, but Social Security has been the most popular government program for many decades. Mr. Ebert's suggestions regarding caps and unearned income are ripe for pursuing. We should go beyond "saving Social Security" to both strengthening the Trust Fund and increasing benefits.
We could include in the proposal to increase the Trust Fund's income some increases in benefits. This is particularly attractive nowadays as people are conscious of two new threats to their old-age security: employer-provided pensions have been eliminated or reduced, and individual savings have been crippled by the recession.
It would not be as expensive as might, at first, appear. Our Social Security income is taxable, and the proceeds circulate back to the Trust Fund. Raise our benefits and we pay a bit more taxes -- to the benefit of the Trust Fund.
It is politically possible. Recall that eliminating the cap on Medicare "taxes" occurred during Bill Clinton's presidency with barely a whimper. Few even know that it occurred.

MARTIN MORAND
Mifflintown, Pa., June 7, 2012
The writers are retired professors of industrial and labor relations at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
Social Security was designed as a payroll tax, not a second income tax, so it is not appropriate to include unearned income in the tax base. The system is intended to partly replace earnings after retirement, not investment income.
While the income level on which taxes are levied is capped at $110,100, so too are benefits. Moreover, the benefits formula is redistributive, heavily favoring low-income earners.
In 2012, benefit recipients receive 90 percent of their first $767 of monthly earnings, 32 percent of their next $3,857 of monthly earnings, and only 15 percent of their monthly earnings in excess of $4,624 (up to the cap). It is hard to see why this is so unfair to the poor.

Henrico, Va., June 7, 2012
The writer is a professor of economics at Virginia Commonwealth University.
The Writer Responds
Responding to Mr. Kochman, I envision that all revenues from the expanded "safety net tax" would be designated for specific safety-net-related programs. Social Security and disability insurance would grow somewhat. Other safety net programs, such as food stamps, would be swept out of the regular budget to new trust funds supported by the safety net tax. This swap allows for the corporate tax relief part of the bargain.
Mr. Nevins is right. Any legislation that raises taxes paid by the rich faces stiff opposition. But there would be considerable compensation. Elimination of the corporate tax should increase corporate profits, repatriate overseas income, increase dividends and drive up stock prices.
Mr. Laido asks if the maximum Social Security payout should increase since the amount of taxed income -- earned plus unearned -- would increase. No. These payments are intended to provide a safety net. They are more insurance than investment. The Social Security payout should provide a reasonable standard of living to those who have little, not a supplementary payment to those who have much.
I agree with Mr. Snyder that most Americans favor self-reliance and feel guilty if forced to seek welfare. I only wish that those who have turned "entitlement" into a code word for freeloaders would agree as well.

Abstract: Excluding the effects of the Chinese New Year, April and May were the two slowest months for growth in electricity generation since the spring of 2009, when many export factories temporarily closed during the global financial crisis. Since China relies on coal to generate four-fifths of its electricity, very slow growth may have a small environmental benefit, by slowing emissions of toxic gases and global-warming gases.

Full text: HONG KONG -- The Chinese economy, widely seen until the last few weeks as the strongest remaining locomotive that could drag the global economy back from the brink of recession, showed a second month of anemic growth in May and performed even worse than the already lowered expectations of most economists.
Growth in industrial production, retail sales and investment in fixed assets like factories and office buildings was little changed from April, according to data released on Saturday afternoon in Beijing by China's National Bureau of Statistics. Some economists had considered the April figures to be a fluke and had predicted a rebound in May, when the Chinese government began measures to rekindle growth.
April had been the weakest month in China since 2001 for growth in fixed-asset investment, and May was slightly weaker still. Before adjustment for inflation, retail sales grew even more slowly in May than in April.
But retail sales were a little stronger in May after they were adjusted for inflation, which has slowed steadily this spring.
Industrial production grew at a slightly faster pace in May from a year earlier, 9.6 percent, than it had in April, when growth was 9.3 percent.
And in an unexpected piece of good news released Sunday morning, China's exports and imports both grew twice as fast last month as economists had expected. Exports rose 15.3 percent, triple the pace in April, and imports grew 12.7 percent after stalling the month before.
Some economists said that if demand for China's exports held up long enough for the Chinese government to start the many infrastructure projects approved in recent weeks, the country's economy could avoid a more serious downturn.
"If this trend continues, and if exports don't collapse to the extent that millions of workers are sacked, continued policy fine-tuning, rather than a serious stimulus, should be enough to generate" economic growth of 8 percent for the full year, said a research report on Saturday from CLSA, an Asian brokerage firm.
China's General Administration of Customs is expected to release export and import data for May late Sunday morning in Beijing.
China's increasingly apparent economic struggles come at an already difficult time for the global economy. Economies across Europe's periphery have already stalled, and the Continent's core has begun to struggle. Unemployment has started to inch back up in the United States, while growth has also faltered in the large emerging markets of Brazil and India.
Many economists are wary of Chinese economic statistics. Studies over the years have suggested that local, provincial and national government agencies tend to smooth out the ups and downs of the business cycle by underreporting growth during booms and overstating it during downturns.
Some local Chinese officials, leery of informing provincial leaders about economic troubles in their jurisdictions, have been telling big companies to overstate growth, with an assurance that local taxes will be levied on the true rate, said two managers in China who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid legal difficulties with the authorities.
One of the most reliable proxies for growth has been electricity generation, because a handful of big companies dominate the industry and report data directly to Beijing. Electricity generation grew only 3.2 percent in May compared with a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday, far short of its usual double-digit pace. That was up from year-over-year growth of 1.5 percent in April.
Excluding the effects of the Chinese New Year, April and May were the two slowest months for growth in electricity generation since the spring of 2009, when many export factories temporarily closed during the global financial crisis.
Since China relies on coal to generate four-fifths of its electricity, very slow growth may have a small environmental benefit, by slowing emissions of toxic gases and global-warming gases.
Other data offers hints that the Chinese economy may still be slowing. The China Iron and Steel Association said on Friday that the country's average daily tonnage of steel production from May 21 through May 31 had dropped 3.9 percent compared with May 11 through 20.
Cement production, another indicator of vitality in the construction sector, was up only 4.3 percent in May from a year earlier, but that was slightly better than an increase of 4 percent in April, according to official data released on Saturday. China's leaders deliberately popped a real estate bubble last summer because of concerns that middle-class families had been priced out of homeownership in many cities.
Real estate brokers say prices have fallen as much as 20 percent since then, and work at many construction sites has slowed to a crawl.
Another exception to the gloomy statistics released on Saturday was auto sales, which rose 22.6 percent in May from a year earlier. But sales were weak in May 2011 because the tsunami and subsequent nuclear power plant meltdowns in eastern Japan disrupted the supply of parts for the assembly in China of many popular Japanese models.

Full text: There's no question that America's recovery from the financial crisis has been disappointing. In fact, I've been arguing that the era since 2007 is best viewed as a "depression," an extended period of economic weakness and high unemployment that, like the Great Depression of the 1930s, persists despite episodes during which the economy grows. And Republicans are, of course, trying -- with considerable success -- to turn this dismal state of affairs to their political advantage.
They love, in particular, to contrast President Obama's record with that of Ronald Reagan, who, by this point in his presidency, was indeed presiding over a strong economic recovery. You might think that the more relevant comparison is with George W. Bush, who, at this stage of his administration, was -- unlike Mr. Obama -- still presiding over a large loss in private-sector jobs. And, as I'll explain shortly, the economic slump Reagan faced was very different from our current depression, and much easier to deal with. Still, the Reagan-Obama comparison is revealing in some ways. So let's look at that comparison, shall we?
For the truth is that on at least one dimension, government spending, there was a large difference between the two presidencies, with total government spending adjusted for inflation and population growth rising much faster under one than under the other. I find it especially instructive to look at spending levels three years into each man's administration -- that is, in the first quarter of 1984 in Reagan's case, and in the first quarter of 2012 in Mr. Obama's -- compared with four years earlier, which in each case more or less corresponds to the start of an economic crisis. Under one president, real per capita government spending at that point was 14.4 percent higher than four years previously; under the other, less than half as much, just 6.4 percent.
O.K., by now many readers have probably figured out the trick here: Reagan, not Obama, was the big spender. While there was a brief burst of government spending early in the Obama administration -- mainly for emergency aid programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps -- that burst is long past. Indeed, at this point, government spending is falling fast, with real per capita spending falling over the past year at a rate not seen since the demobilization that followed the Korean War.
Why was government spending much stronger under Reagan than in the current slump? "Weaponized Keynesianism" -- Reagan's big military buildup -- played some role. But the big difference was real per capita spending at the state and local level, which continued to rise under Reagan but has fallen significantly this time around.
And this, in turn, reflects a changed political environment. For one thing, states and local governments used to benefit from revenue-sharing -- automatic aid from the federal government, a program that Reagan eventually killed but only after the slump was past. More important, in the 1980s, anti-tax dogma hadn't taken effect to the same extent it has today, so state and local governments were much more willing than they are now to cover temporary deficits with temporary tax increases, thereby avoiding sharp spending cuts.
In short, if you want to see government responding to economic hard times with the "tax and spend" policies conservatives always denounce, you should look to the Reagan era -- not the Obama years.
So does the Reagan-era economic recovery demonstrate the superiority of Keynesian economics? Not exactly. For, as I said, the truth is that the slump of the 1980s -- which was more or less deliberately caused by the Federal Reserve, as a way to bring down inflation -- was very different from our current depression, which was brought on by private-sector excess: above all, the surge in household debt during the Bush years. The Reagan slump could be and was brought to a rapid end when the Fed decided to relent and cut interest rates, sparking a giant housing boom. That option isn't available now because rates are already close to zero.
As many economists have pointed out, America is currently suffering from a classic case of debt deflation: all across the economy people are trying to pay down debt by slashing spending, but, in so doing, they are causing a depression that makes their debt problems even worse. This is exactly the situation in which government spending should temporarily rise to offset the slump in private spending and give the private sector time to repair its finances. Yet that's not happening.
The point, then, is that we'd be in much better shape if we were following Reagan-style Keynesianism. Reagan may have preached small government, but in practice he presided over a lot of spending growth -- and right now that's exactly what America needs.

Abstract: According to data from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, since 2007, South Dakota has lost nearly 500,000 acres of grassland to farming.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- At the same time that high crop prices are prompting farmers to expand into millions of acres of land once considered unsuitable for farming, Congress is considering expanding a federal insurance program that reimburses farmers for most losses or drops in prices.
The combination could cost the government billions of dollars if the newly farmed land does not yield enough crops and especially if crop prices fall.
Advocates, including farm interest lobbyists and lawmakers with a long history of creating and protecting benefits, argue that the new program would save Washington money by replacing a longstanding one costing $5 billion a year, known as direct payments, that pays owners of farmland a set amount regardless of whether they have planted crops.
Crop insurance has existed for decades, with the government now spending about $7 billion a year to pay about two-thirds of the cost of farmers' premiums. Under the federal program, farmers can buy insurance that covers poor yields, declines in prices or both.
On Tuesday, the Senate began debate on a farm bill, passed by the Agriculture Committee in April, that would set up another crop insurance subsidy, costing $3 billion a year, to cover any losses farmers suffer, known as deductibles, before their crop insurance policies kick in.
The change from the existing direct payment program to the crop insurance subsidies as the primary safety net for farmers means that "payments are going to people who are actually farming," Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, said Wednesday.
The Senate measure would cut about $23 billion in spending over the next 10 years, though that is far less than the Obama administration wanted.
Crop insurance supporters say insurance programs provide an important safety net for farmers, who are subject to the whims of weather, pests and volatile markets.
"Cuts in the crop insurance program would reduce the effectiveness of the most important risk-management tool farmers have," said Sam Willett, senior director of public policy at the National Corn Growers Association.
Even some farmers argue that the subsidies are already generous to agribusinesses, especially with the government facing large deficits. Jim Faulstich, a farmer and rancher in Highmore, S.D., said he was in favor of farmers having crop insurance, but added that the insurance should not be used to make money at taxpayer expense.
"If we as farmers expect taxpayers to support premium subsidies, it's only fair that we grow on land that is capable of supporting it," he said. "Could some of this land be profitable without the crop insurance subsidy? I think not."
The sharp rise in the price of corn, wheat, soybeans and other crops, driven in large part by the growth of Asian economies, has caused farmers to plant land long prone to erosion and flooding. In the prairies and rolling hills of the Northern Great Plains in the Dakotas and in Montana, millions of acres that are home to ducks and other waterfowl, and attractive grounds for hunters, are rapidly being turned into corn, soybean and wheat fields.
In some Montana counties, once-marginal land is selling for nearly $2,000 an acre, up from about $300 in 1991, as the high crop prices drive the need for more areas for farm production. According to data from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, since 2007, South Dakota has lost nearly 500,000 acres of grassland to farming. In North Dakota, more than one million acres have become farmland over the same time period.
"Land that was once considered marginal is now being looked at more from a farm production and financial standpoint," said Bruce Brock, a real estate auctioneer in Le Mars, Iowa. "With commodity prices being what they are, people are looking everywhere for land they can plant corn or some other high-priced crop."
Mr. Brock said he recently sold about 1,300 acres of pastureland in South Dakota that fetched a price of about $2,600 an acre. The same land would have gone for $200 to $300 if it had remained grassland, he said.
By guaranteeing income, farmers say, crop insurance removes almost any financial risk for planting land where crop failure is almost certain.
"When you can remove nearly all the risk involved and guarantee yourself a profit, it's not a bad business decision," said Darwyn Bach, a farmer in St. Leo, Minn., who said that he is guaranteed about $1,000 an acre in revenue before he puts a single seed in the ground because of crop insurance. "I can farm on low-quality land that I know is not going to produce and still turn a profit."
For years, the government provided an incentive for farmers and landowners to keep marginal land in conservation because years of farming had led to topsoil erosion. In 1985, the government started the Conservation Reserve Program, which paid farmers to let lands stay wild.
Today, the government pays about $50 an acre for farmers to keep their lands in conservation. But with land prices skyrocketing, many farmers are more likely to sell land than take a modest payment to preserve grassland.
Environmentalists, hunting groups and even some farmers say the prospect of expanding insurance will only speed the push to turn grasslands into farms. Crop insurance programs do not require farmers to adopt any conservation methods for the land.
Farmland values have been increasing for years and have been pushed up by several factors.
But numerous studies, including a report in 2007 by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that a major incentive for farmers to buy land and farm it was the government-subsidized crop insurance program. The study also found that areas where grasslands were converted into farmland had the highest crop insurance payouts, nearly twice that of other areas.
Crop insurance is obtained through private insurers. The federal government pays most of the premiums, as well as administrative expenses. Last year, the crop insurance industry was paid about $1.3 billion to cover expenses for selling and servicing policies.
The existing crop insurance subsidy ballooned to $7.3 billion last year from $951 million in 2000, or about $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation, according to another G.A.O. report released in April. The costs of the program have risen as the value of crops has increased. Over the next 10 years, a Congressional Budget Office study estimates, the premium subsidy for the existing program will cost about $90 billion.
"This is better than a government bailout," said Steve Ellis, vice president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group in Washington. "A bailout is a one-time thing when something bad happens. But crop insurance keeps giving, good or bad. And it's about to give even more."

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank left its main interest rate unchanged Wednesday, choosing to put the onus on political leaders to address increasingly dangerous tension in the euro zone.
The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 1 percent, where it has been since December.
Noting the stress in Europe and signs of flagging economic growth, the central bank promised to continue providing banks with effectively unlimited low-interest loans at least through the end of the year.
While most analysts had not expected the central bank to cut rates at its monthly meeting on Wednesday, there was growing speculation that the governing council might cut below 1 percent for the first time in an attempt to restore confidence in the euro zone.
The bank and its president, Mario Draghi, appear to have decided to wait at least another month in order to discourage complacency by political leaders. Mr. Draghi and other top central bank officials have repeatedly stressed that they lack the tools and the mandate to address the underlying problems in the euro zone.
Mr. Draghi said the central bank had no "silver bullets" for what he acknowledged was a worrying situation.
"Some of these problems in the euro area have nothing to do with monetary policy," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference after the monthly meeting of the bank's governors. "I don't think it would be right for monetary policy to fill other institutions' lack of action."
In a statement, Mr. Draghi noted "increased downside risks to the economic outlook" and said that, judging by futures prices for commodities, annual inflation rates should fall below 2 percent again in early 2013.
By keeping its firepower in reserve for now, the central bank put pressure on political leaders to weave the euro zone more closely together, for example by sharing the cost of bank bailouts and giving up more control over government spending.
The central bank may also be concerned that earlier measures intended to calm tensions in the banking system have had unwanted side effects. For example, Spanish banks used inexpensive central bank credit to buy Spanish government bonds. That helped lower the government's borrowing costs but also made Spanish banks vulnerable to the fortunes of their hard-pressed government.
While few analysts expected the central bank to cut rates, many still expect a cut in coming months. Mr. Draghi said that a few of the 23 members of the bank's governing council had argued for a rate cut and left open the option of a cut later on. "We will stand ready to act," he said.
Many analysts said the effect of a cut would be mostly psychological because short-term interest rates are already close to zero.
In an attempt to reassure financial markets, the central bank pledged to continue providing banks with low-interest credit, but stopped well short of promising another blast of cheap, three-year loans like the ones it offered in December and March.
At the news conference, Mr. Draghi seemed to be groping to appear neither alarmist nor complacent. He said the current level of tension was not as bad as it was last fall, or at the end of 2008 after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers.
He said Europe should not take all the blame for slow economic growth in the United States or other parts of the world. But he also described the interbank lending market, which is crucial to the functioning of the financial system, as "dysfunctional," and acknowledged anxiety among investors.
On Wednesday, the European Commission announced a plan for more coordinated oversight of large banks, in part to prevent problems at one institution from spreading. The plan would shift the cost of bailouts to the banking industry and bondholders, though the measures will not be in place in time to help Spain deal with Bankia.
Political leaders seem to be responding to Mr. Draghi's call last month for a "bold leap" toward a more cohesive euro zone. But by keeping rates unchanged, the central bank appeared to be signaling that it would like to see concrete steps, not proclamations or statements of good intent.
"From the E.C.B. perspective, there is likely to be frustration at euro area governments' seeming inability to deploy the collective mechanisms they developed," analysts at Barclays said in a note to clients Wednesday. "The E.C.B.'s inaction so far seems to reflect an attempt to put greater pressure on governments to address fiscal and banking issues."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: At a Capitol Hill news conference, he said the economy would be bolstered by increasing "the purchasing power of millions of low-income and low-wage workers, and one proven and effective way of doing that is to raise the federal minimum wage."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. tried to give new vitality to the issue of the federal minimum wage on Wednesday, coming at the debate with a fresh angle: that raising it might encourage Americans to spend more and, thus, help stimulate the nation's struggling economy.
At a Capitol Hill news conference, he said the economy would be bolstered by increasing "the purchasing power of millions of low-income and low-wage workers, and one proven and effective way of doing that is to raise the federal minimum wage." He has introduced a bill that would immediately increase the minimum wage by $2.75, to $10 an hour from $7.25.
The argument in favor of raising the minimum wage as a form of economic stimulus goes to the heart of the debate in government and business spheres about whether more spending needs to be part of the prescription for strengthening the economy.
It also alludes to an underlying bitterness about income inequality that has intensified during the recession and subsequent recovery efforts.
"We've bailed out banks, we've bailed out corporations, we've bailed out Wall Street, we've tried to create sound fundamentals in the economy," Mr. Jackson, Democrat of Illinois, said. "Now it's time to bail out working people who work hard every day and they still only make $7.25. The only way to do that is to raise the minimum wage."
An increase in the federal minimum wage was last approved in 2007, when Congress voted to raise it from to $7.25 from $5.15 over two years. Eighteen states now have minimum wages in place that exceed the federal minimum.
At face value the federal minimum wage is the highest ever, but proponents of raising it argue that past minimum wages should be considered as adjusted for inflation. That would make 1968, when the minimum wage was nominally $1.60, the highest, at roughly $10 an hour in 2012 dollars.
As of last year, 5.2 percent of hourly paid workers in the United States, or about 3.8 million people, were compensated at or below the federal minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In the past, raising the minimum wage has been anathema to many Republicans and some business interests, like the National Restaurant Association, which argued in 2007 that an increase would cost jobs. Economists, meanwhile, disagree about the effects on the job market.
It might seem counterintuitive, that Democrats would decide to raise the issue again now, with Republicans in control of the House and Congress already distracted by the campaign season. On Wednesday, though, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio told reporters that it was "precisely because it's an election year" that the time is ripe for a renewed debate. Mr. Kucinich, a former Democratic candidate for president, said "President Obama could guarantee his election" if he came out in favor of Mr. Jackson's proposal.
As a candidate for president in 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama said he would support raising the federal minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president this year, has said he sees no need to increase the minimum wage at this time. Both men support a mechanism that would automatically adjust the federal minimum in proportion to increases in the Consumer Price Index.
Speaking to the press Wednesday, Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and himself a former candidate for president, said,
"This is a unifying issue in our country at a time where there are few declared unifying political issues."
He added, "I don't think a conservative Republican worker in Walmart making $7.75 an hour is going to say that his or her ideology prevents them from supporting a $10 minimum wage."
But Republican or not, some workers take issue with such an increase.
A few blocks from the Capitol on Wednesday, Ryan Young was at work, dragging a garden hose toward a planter. As a supervisor for a landscaping company, Mr. Young earns about twice the federal minimum, but has worked for much less. "If you raise the minimum wage, that cost gets spread out somewhere else," he said. "I think the market should determine wages, rents, pretty much everything."
For now, though, the debate might be moot: A spokesman for Mr. Jackson made clear that the congressman's main aim is to reinvigorate discussion on the issue.
With the divisive political climate in Washington, the spokesman, Frank E. Watkins, said he doubted the bill would come to a vote. "In fact," he said," I'm fairly certain that it won't under this Republican Congress."

Obama's Fate Rests in Part On Europe

Full text: The recent downshift in the economy has dealt a powerful blow to President Obama's chances of re-election in November. But perhaps most worrying for the president is just how little sway he retains over where the economy goes from here.
His attempts to convince voters as he stumps around the country that Europe's financial mess and Republican obstruction are largely to blame for the faltering economy only underscore how his destiny hinges on decisions by other people, notably the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Republican speaker of the House, John A. Boehner.
At home, the president's plans to stimulate the economy with tax cuts and spending programs have invariably crashed against solid Republican opposition in Congress. As a result the government is becoming a big drag on the economy, cutting more than half a million jobs at the federal, state and municipal level since national employment bottomed out in February 2010.
In Europe, the political constraints are the same. Most economists, including those in the Obama administration, say they believe that for the euro to survive, weak European countries must grow. But this means curbing the harsh austerity policies imposed in return for aid from European institutions and the International Monetary Fund -- policies that have only deepened the countries' recessions. Germany, the only country in Europe with the wherewithal to backstop its poorer neighbors' finances, has so far said no.
To many economists, the policy gridlock makes no sense. Historical precedent and recent evidence suggest that cutting public spending in the middle of a slump only worsens the downturn -- damaging public finances because it reduces tax revenue even as unemployment and unemployment benefit costs are rising.
In some countries -- notably the United States and Germany -- interest rates are so low that governments could essentially borrow free, using funds to blunt the impact of the economic slump on the most vulnerable. For the United States this could mean building roads and hiring teachers. For Germany, it could mean providing a financial backstop to prevent Spain from going bankrupt.
When the crisis struck in 2009, most industrial countries and big developing nations followed this script, ramping up public spending to keep their economies from floundering as the private sector shrank.
Today, even the governments that could afford to do more are slashing public spending. Predictably, the world economy is slowing again.
What happened? Champions of austerity will make the economic case that stimulus went too far and government debt grew too much. Many European countries -- virtually shut out from financial markets -- could not spend even if they wanted to. But the reason the world so quickly U-turned from fiscal stimulus to fiscal austerity has a lot to do with how the crisis changed the world's politics.
It's hard to overstate the shock dealt by the Great Recession to the political order. In the United States it gave rise to the Tea Party -- born from the rant of a cable TV business commentator against an administration plan to help underwater homeowners. It spawned the Occupy Wall Street movement, angry at the concentration of wealth among a fortunate few who rebounded smartly from the crisis while the rest of the nation wallowed.
In Europe, 11 euro area governments have fallen in just over a year -- it happened twice in Greece -- punished by electorates who see no end in sight to the downturn. Extreme populist parties are on the rise, like France's right-wing National Front, which garnered a record 18 percent of the vote in the French presidential elections last month. Battle lines have been drawn across the Continent between a political establishment that defends austerity at all costs in the name of preserving the euro, and increasingly radical oppositions.
This kind of political polarization may be a standard feature of financial crises. Economists have noted that such crises naturally widen the chasm between the interests of creditors -- like banks, investors and even governments -- and debtors, who are suddenly made insolvent by a crisis that takes away their jobs and destroys the value of their homes.
Creditors push austerity as the best way for debtors to repay their debts. They oppose efforts to write down or renegotiate loans, or to allow higher inflation to erode their value. And creditors, better financed and organized, usually gain the upper hand. Debtors, who are generally poorer, lose.
This cleavage is evident in Europe, where German voters have staunchly opposed committing more German resources to aid indebted Southern European countries. It is also evident on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have countered the administration's stimulus plans with proposals to cut public spending to finance tax cuts that would favor the most affluent Americans. The ensuing gridlock has paralyzed policy-making on both sides of the Atlantic. And it could produce a lot of economic damage.
With an economy in free fall and 22 percent unemployment, Greece looks very close to dropping the euro and defaulting on its debts. This could potentially lead to the departure of other vulnerable nations, including Spain, Portugal and Ireland, and the dismemberment of the single currency into up to 17 different parts.
While nobody has a clear idea of how a breakup of the euro would affect the American economy, it would hurt. Citizens of vulnerable European countries would rush to withdraw their euro deposits ahead of the breakup, to avoid having their savings converted into pesetas or drachmas. Banks would fail, and financial markets would plummet as investors took their money out of risky assets and put them into the comparative safety of German bunds and American Treasury bonds.
This would very likely cripple some big American banks. And a stock market crash would wipe out the savings of many ordinary citizens. Exports to Europe would slow sharply as European economies contracted -- depriving the United States of one of its few engines of growth.
Look at it this way: When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008, sending the global financial system into a tailspin, its debts amounted to about $600 billion. Government debt alone in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland -- the most vulnerable European countries -- adds up to about $1.9 trillion. And the economies and government finances of most developed countries are in worse shape than they were four years ago.
All is not lost for President Obama, however. There is, of course, little incentive for Republicans in Congress to come to the aid of the economy and increase his chances of re-election. But Chancellor Merkel seems to have realized that Germany, Europe's main creditor, would also lose big if the euro were to break apart.
In high-level meetings the last few days, German officials have signaled that Germany might be willing to do what it takes to save the euro, in exchange for more centralized control over public spending in Europe. This would mean providing resources to backstop the governments of its weak neighbors, so they can relax austerity and spend more. But Germany would also have to accept more inflation at home, to help its less competitive neighbors close the cost gap with the ultracompetitive Germans. It would have to encourage spending at home, to help the export sectors of weaker countries in the euro area.
"Germany realizes it is going to have to write a blank check," said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist. "This will require open-ended transfers for a long time. Loans will have to become gifts. In reciprocity, Germans want a political union."
And if the euro doesn't go over the brink, Chancellor Merkel will have done President Obama a favor no Congressional Republican would match.

Full text: College graduation is supposed to be a giant step on the way to a prosperous future. But the weak labor market means that graduates lucky enough to find good jobs will face reduced starting salaries, while many others will struggle to find work or have to settle for lower-level and lower-paid positions that do not require college degrees.
Even after the economy strengthens, many recent college graduates may never catch up. Research shows that early bouts of joblessness and low pay can damage career prospects and earnings over a lifetime.
While recent college graduates are still doing far better than high school graduates, the numbers are grim. In the past year, unemployment among college graduates under age 25 has averaged 8.5 percent, an improvement from 9.5 percent a year earlier, but still much higher than 5.4 percent in the year before the Great Recession struck at the end of 2007. From 2007 to 2011, the wages of young college graduates, adjusted for inflation, have declined by 4.6 percent, about $2,000 each per year.
It would be bad enough if one or two classes had to make up lost ground. But five, and counting since the economic meltdown, present a more profound challenge to prevailing assumptions and policies.
The biggest misperception -- fed by decades of growth with relatively shallow recessions -- is that a college diploma virtually guarantees a good job. It does not. Without robust economic expansion to fuel growth, job shortages are inevitable, even for the educated.
Another misperception is that today's joblessness is mainly the result of mismatches -- with employers unable to find skilled workers or workers unwilling or unable to move to where the jobs are. Recent college graduates are both skilled and mobile, yet they experience high joblessness, demonstrating, once again, that a lack of jobs stems primarily from a lack of demand in a weak economy.
Education still makes one more likely to land an available job, as evidenced by the far lower jobless rate of young college graduates -- 8.5 percent, on average, in the past year -- compared with 21 percent for young high school graduates. But underemployment for young college graduates, which includes the jobless plus involuntary part-timers and those who have given up an active job search, has averaged 19.1 percent. That is nearly twice the prerecession levels.
Even full-time employment for many young graduates is a letdown. Research shows that nearly 40 percent of working recent graduates are in jobs that do not require a college degree, compared with roughly 30 percent before the onset of the recession in 2007.
Until the government does more to stoke demand and growth, including with job-creating aid to states and investments in energy and infrastructure, college graduates and everyone else will struggle. Republican politicians have blocked the needed policies, claiming that cutting the budget deficit is more important and that somehow -- given enough deregulation and tax cuts for the rich -- things will turn around. They haven't, and they won't.
The damage will be deep and lasting. The lack of good jobs at good pay, combined with high student debt loads, means a slower economy for a long time to come, as underemployed and indebted workers delay starting families and buying homes. College graduates are certainly not the only collateral damage of the Great Recession, and, in many ways, their education will provide them with tools and flexibility to cope. But if young people with college diplomas cannot prosper in America, who can?

Full text: What should be done about the economy? Republicans claim to have the answer: slash spending and cut taxes. What they hope voters won't notice is that that's precisely the policy we've been following the past couple of years. Never mind the Democrat in the White House; for all practical purposes, this is already the economic policy of Republican dreams.
So the Republican electoral strategy is, in effect, a gigantic con game: it depends on convincing voters that the bad economy is the result of big-spending policies that President Obama hasn't followed (in large part because the G.O.P. wouldn't let him), and that our woes can be cured by pursuing more of the same policies that have already failed.
For some reason, however, neither the press nor Mr. Obama's political team has done a very good job of exposing the con.
What do I mean by saying that this is already a Republican economy? Look first at total government spending -- federal, state and local. Adjusted for population growth and inflation, such spending has recently been falling at a rate not seen since the demobilization that followed the Korean War.
How is that possible? Isn't Mr. Obama a big spender? Actually, no; there was a brief burst of spending in late 2009 and early 2010 as the stimulus kicked in, but that boost is long behind us. Since then it has been all downhill. Cash-strapped state and local governments have laid off teachers, firefighters and police officers; meanwhile, unemployment benefits have been trailing off even though unemployment remains extremely high.
Over all, the picture for America in 2012 bears a stunning resemblance to the great mistake of 1937, when F.D.R. prematurely slashed spending, sending the U.S. economy -- which had actually been recovering fairly fast until that point -- into the second leg of the Great Depression. In F.D.R.'s case, however, this was an unforced error, since he had a solidly Democratic Congress. In President Obama's case, much though not all of the responsibility for the policy wrong turn lies with a completely obstructionist Republican majority in the House.
That same obstructionist House majority effectively blackmailed the president into continuing all the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, so that federal taxes as a share of G.D.P. are near historic lows -- much lower, in particular, than at any point during Ronald Reagan's presidency.
As I said, for all practical purposes this is already a Republican economy.
As an aside, I think it's worth pointing out that although the economy's performance has been disappointing, to say the least, none of the disasters Republicans predicted have come to pass. Remember all those assertions that budget deficits would lead to soaring interest rates? Well, U.S. borrowing costs have just hit a record low. And remember those dire warnings about inflation and the "debasement" of the dollar? Well, inflation remains low, and the dollar has been stronger than it was in the Bush years.
Put it this way: Republicans have been warning that we were about to turn into Greece because President Obama was doing too much to boost the economy; Keynesian economists like myself warned that we were, on the contrary, at risk of turning into Japan because he was doing too little. And Japanification it is, except with a level of misery the Japanese never had to endure.
So why don't voters know any of this?
Part of the answer is that far too much economic reporting is still of the he-said, she-said variety, with dueling quotes from hired guns on either side. But it's also true that the Obama team has consistently failed to highlight Republican obstruction, perhaps out of a fear of seeming weak. Instead, the president's advisers keep turning to happy talk, seizing on a few months' good economic news as proof that their policies are working -- and then ending up looking foolish when the numbers turn down again. Remarkably, they've made this mistake three times in a row: in 2010, 2011 and now once again.
At this point, however, Mr. Obama and his political team don't seem to have much choice. They can point with pride to some big economic achievements, above all the successful rescue of the auto industry, which is responsible for a large part of whatever job growth we are managing to get. But they're not going to be able to sell a narrative of overall economic success. Their best bet, surely, is to do a Harry Truman, to run against the "do-nothing" Republican Congress that has, in reality, blocked proposals -- for tax cuts as well as more spending -- that would have made 2012 a much better year than it's turning out to be.
For that, in the end, is the best argument against Republicans' claims that they can fix the economy. The fact is that we have already seen the Republican economic future -- and it doesn't work.

Abstract: Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said, "There is no question that had Congress acted on the president's proposals nine months ago to prevent teacher layoffs, put construction workers back to work and cut small-business taxes, our job situation today would be notably stronger and unemployment would be lower."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The bleak jobs report on Friday predictably had heads snapping toward the White House, looking to President Obama to do something. Yet his proposed remedies only underscore how much the president, just five months before he faces voters, is at the mercy of actors in Europe, China and Congress whose political interests often conflict with his own.
That day, Mr. Obama continued his weekly travels around the country, prodding Congressional Republicans to pass his "to-do list" of temporary tax cuts and spending initiatives to help create jobs. The Republicans only mock him, which leaves Mr. Obama free to blame his opponents and their presidential standard-bearer, Mitt Romney. But in doing so, he telegraphs a message of powerlessness that no leader likes to convey -- least of all one who ran for office four years ago vowing to bridge Washington's partisan gulf.
Developments overseas have not helped either. American officials have complained as Beijing began letting its currency devalue again, making its exports cheaper and those from the United States to China more costly. And administration officials, and Mr. Obama himself, have lobbied leaders in Europe for more forceful action to promote growth or at least contain the threat of financial contagion there.
In his weekly address on Saturday, recorded on Friday at a Honeywell International plant near Minneapolis, the president cited the global woes buffeting the economy. But he singled out Congress for rebuke.
"While we can't fully control everything that happens in other parts of the world, there are plenty of things we can control here at home," Mr. Obama said. "There are plenty of steps we can take right now to help create jobs and grow this economy."
Without mentioning Republicans, Mr. Obama said Congress had not passed measures he had proposed to get jobless construction workers rebuilding roads, bridges and runways; to give small businesses a tax break for new hires; and to help states pay teachers, firefighters and police officers. The steady elimination of public sector jobs has offset increased hiring in the private sector for more than two years.
"So my message to Congress is: Get to work," he added.
Alan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said, "Frankly, I don't see what President Obama can do right now other than to forcefully present a detailed plan for action and challenge Congress to take it up."
But "short of a real crisis," as in 2008, Mr. Auerbach, an expert on fiscal policy, added, "I doubt that there is anything he can do to spur meaningful legislation before the election."
Yet even in 2008, with the financial system near collapse, most Congressional Republicans rejected the rescue plan of a Republican president, George W. Bush. And now, despite their own record-low numbers in the polls, they have next to no incentive to help an embattled Democratic president lift the economy.
Continued economic anemia plays to Mr. Romney's call for new stewardship, and to Republicans' demands to extend and deepen the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans rather than let them expire, as Mr. Obama and Democrats want. And they figure that if Mr. Romney succeeds, it will probably help them win close House and Senate races, while Mr. Obama's re-election could do the opposite.
By emboldening Republicans, the report on Friday that the economy added only 69,000 jobs in May seemed to dash the hopes of some in the White House for a replay of 1996. That summer, as President Bill Clinton sought re-election with the economy improving, Republicans in Congress decided that their party's weak presidential nominee, Senator Bob Dole, was doomed. To Mr. Dole's chagrin, they compromised with the Democratic president to notch some significant achievements and ensure their own survival.
Gene Sperling, the chief White House economic adviser, said, "There is no question that had Congress acted on the president's proposals nine months ago to prevent teacher layoffs, put construction workers back to work and cut small-business taxes, our job situation today would be notably stronger and unemployment would be lower." Analyses by macroeconomic firms and nonpartisan financial analysts agreed.
While Mr. Obama seeks to make Republicans the villains when it comes to the economy, he is also, more diplomatically, blaming Europe. In Minneapolis and Chicago on Friday, he cited the impact of the continent's travails on the American economy.
Citing the jobs report, Mr. Obama said, "A lot of that is attributable to Europe and the cloud that's coming over from the Atlantic, and the whole world economy has been weakened by it."
As lackluster as the American jobs data was, with unemployment inching up one-tenth of a percentage point to 8.2 percent, the news from Europe was far worse: the jobless rate in the euro zone hit 11 percent, the highest since tracking began in 1995. "There's really nothing the U.S. can do," said Charles Calomiris, professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School.
On Wednesday, Mr. Obama had a video conference call with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Francois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy to discuss developments in Europe and plan for this month's G-20 summit meeting in Mexico. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner continued to trade calls with Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble. And late Friday, Mr. Obama's Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, Lael Brainard, returned from a week of consultations in Athens, Frankfurt, Madrid, Paris and Berlin.
Mr. Obama "emphasizes that what happens in Europe is of global concern," said Michael Froman, the White House adviser for international economic affairs. "We want to be of help, whether in providing ideas or lessons from our experience as they work through these issues."
For more than two years, Mr. Obama and Mr. Geithner have prodded Europe, led by Germany, to do more to revive the region's weakest economies rather than push budget cuts, which have resulted in more losses of jobs and consumer spending power. Their results, however, have been limited at best.
Germany has shown some willingness to bend. Officials in Berlin have signaled that they could accept higher wages at home and inflation above the euro zone's average. Last week, a finance ministry spokesman said Germany could be more flexible about the timing of budget cuts in Spain -- after Greece, the source of greatest anxiety now.
But Germans are deeply concerned that supporting big transfers of aid to troubled countries within the euro zone will create a precedent and the expectation in other countries that they, or their banks, will be bailed out whenever necessary. Germans also believe that issuing debt jointly with other European countries, known as euro bonds, which the United States supports, would be struck down as unconstitutional by their high court.
And they routinely dismiss any criticism from across the Atlantic as election-year politicking.
"Germans do not think Americans have anything to offer at the moment in terms of helping us with the euro crisis," said Thomas Risse, professor of international politics at the Free University in Berlin. "Everyone thinks it's just about Obama's re-election here, which is wrong, but they think it."
After the United States said this spring that it would not increase its contribution to the International Monetary Fund, its influence in Europe was blunted.
Even so, "the I.M.F. appears to not be having the influence it usually does," said Franklin Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "It seems like Berlin is making all the decisions at the moment."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The odds surely increased Friday that the Federal Reserve will ride again to the rescue of the faltering economic recovery, making borrowing a little cheaper for a little longer, as it has done repeatedly over the last four years.
But the government's announcement that employers added only 69,000 workers in May also highlights a less comfortable reality: The economy seems unable to wean itself from dependence on the Fed's flow of aid. It keeps coming back for more.
What began as a one-time jolt in 2008, an unprecedented effort to revive economic activity, has become an uncomfortable status quo, an enduring reality in which savers are punished and borrowers rewarded by a permafrost of low interest rates.
And the Fed, acutely uneasy with this new role in the American economy, may now find itself unable to avoid doubling down.
Although Fed officials have said repeatedly that they were reluctant to expand what has already been a substantial campaign to stimulate growth, the slowing rate of job creation suggests that they have not done enough. And there's little prospect that Congress will rise to the occasion.
A Morgan Stanley economist and former head of the Fed's monetary policy division, Vincent Reinhart, said Friday that the odds had climbed to 80 percent that the Fed's policy-making committee would announce new measures at its next meeting in three weeks.
The most likely option: buying several hundred billion dollars of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities in a fourth round of purchases that could expand the Fed's portfolio to $3 trillion, a once-inconceivable sum.
In a note published after the jobs report, Mr. Reinhart said the central bank was likely to act unless it was paralyzed by internal conflicts, "or the unlikely event that the situation in Europe is clarified in a positive way surprisingly soon."
Other analysts doubt that the Fed will act so soon as June. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, and other senior officials have made clear that the trajectory of economic growth must shift substantially before the Fed adjusted its current policies.
"As long as the U.S. economy continues to grow sufficiently fast to cut into the nation's unused economic resources at a meaningful pace, I think benefits of further action are unlikely to exceed the costs," William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Wednesday. Mr. Dudley's remarks received particular attention because he is the vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee, and is generally careful to remain publicly consistent with Mr. Bernanke.
It seems unlikely that one month of jobs data will be sufficient to cause him to shift on such an explicit judgment, but the news on Friday was worse than one month of bad numbers. The government also significantly reduced its estimate of job creation over the last few months, creating an impression of a longer-term trend of slowing growth.
Moreover, the news from the rest of the world has been grim. Europe continues to flirt with crisis, and the growth of emerging economies like China and India is showing disconcerting signs of an inopportune slowdown.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Eric Rosengren, said Wednesday for the first time that the Fed should act. "I believe further monetary policy accommodation is both appropriate and necessary," Mr. Rosengren said. "The U.S., like many other countries, needs to facilitate a more rapid recovery."
While Mr. Rosengren does not hold one of the 12 votes on the policy-making committee this year, his remarks suggest that Fed officials who pressed for action last year, then fell silent earlier this year, are once again growing restive.
On the other hand, the American economy continues to add jobs, and a revised estimate of economic activity in the first quarter, which the government published Thursday, provided further evidence of consistent, if mediocre, growth.
Fed officials also are concerned that their policies cannot fix some of what is ailing the economy. Low interest rates make no difference to borrowers who cannot qualify to refinance or businesses that cannot persuade banks to take risks. Each successive round of Fed interventions has produced a diminishing return as interest rates are compressed toward zero. Inflation has remained at roughly 2 percent a year, the level the Fed regards as healthy.
Mr. Bernanke may provide greater clarity when he testifies Thursday before Congress's Joint Economic Committee. In the meantime, some Fed watchers said that they thought the central bank would wait as long as possible before acting.
Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said the prospect of action was not "the near-certainty that some commentators seem to believe."
The Fed's choices will be made against the backdrop of a presidential campaign whose outcome may be determined by the health of the economy. Already the Fed faces loud demands from liberals to act forcefully, and anger from conservatives over the measures that it has taken already. It seems likely that whatever choices it makes will draw fresh anger, which could actually provide its own peculiar kind of insulation.
There are limited options for additional action. The Fed generally guides the economy by adjusting short-term interest rates, but it has held rates near zero since December 2008, and has said that it planned to keep rates near zero until late 2014, at least. Even an extension of that promise would have little impact on interest rates.
That leaves bond purchases, the Fed's major tool during the current crisis. In 2009 and 2010, the Fed bought more than $2 trillion of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, forcing private money into investments that carried higher risks and driving down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
More recently, the Fed has sold short-term Treasuries to finance the purchase of $400 billion in long-term Treasuries, putting further downward pressure on long-term rates without expanding its portfolio. Those purchases end in June.
The forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers said that it would be difficult for the Fed to extend that strategy, nicknamed Operation Twist, because it is running out of short-term Treasuries and risks cornering the market for long-term Treasuries, which are used as grease and ballast in a wide range of transactions.
Instead, Macroeconomic Advisers said that the Fed would have to return to expanding its portfolio, a policy that most likely would include new purchases of mortgage-backed securities, in part to focus the impact on driving down the interest rates on mortgage loans.
"If they do anything, more likely it would be these outright purchases," said Antulio Bomfim, a managing director at the firm and a former Fed economist.
He said the firm still was updating its forecast of what the Fed would do next, but added that the situation clearly was deteriorating. Looking out the window of his Washington office on a day of storm clouds and tornado warnings, he said, "The weather outside certainly seems consistent with the economic data."

Abstract: Oil prices sank but gold soared as the bargain-basement interest rates spurred expectations for the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy with another round of asset purchases.\n

Full text: In their worst daily performance this year, stocks dropped more than 2 percent on Wall Street Friday, and United States government bond yields fell to record lows as investors sought refuge amid new signs of trouble in the global economy.
The upheaval across markets reflected the resignation among investors that it is safer to stash money in assets that offer hardly any returns than to risk losing the assets themselves. Driving the panic were the usual suspects of the intensifying European debt crisis, a cooling economy in China, and weak employment in the United States and the euro zone.
The dismal report by the Labor Department showed a net gain of 69,000 jobs in May and an unemployment rate of 8.2 percent, up from 8.1 in April. The jobless rate in the 17-nation euro zone reached 11 percent in March and April, the highest since the European statistical agency, Eurostat, began tracking data for that region in 1995.
Ten-year bonds in some of the European countries seen as relatively safe, like Germany and Britain, also fell to record lows. While the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields reached a new low of 1.46 percent, the German bund dropped to 1.171 percent and the British gilt fell to 1.529 percent.
The low rates allow governments and corporations to borrow on the cheap, but American investors in 10-year Treasury notes are effectively losing money when factoring in a 2 percent rate of inflation. In Germany, the two-year bond fell below zero -- meaning investors felt safer taking a guaranteed loss than in holding other securities.
"People are very risk-averse right now," said Jerry H. Tempelman, an analyst in the capital markets research group of Moody's Analytics. "What it tells you is investors are anxious and are willing to forgo a lot of potential return for the ability to park their money with what they perceive to be high quality, safe governments."
In contrast, borrowing costs for Italy and Spain, which have become the center of attention in the festering European banking and sovereign debt crisis, were far higher. They rose earlier in the week but then declined Friday. Italy's 10-year bond was down slightly to 5.711 percent and Spain's dipped to 6.459 percent, though both have risen sharply in recent months.
The jobs report in the United States should have provided "something of a distraction for the markets, which have had a single-minded focus on the devolving European situation," wrote Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, in a research note. "Unfortunately, that distraction was extremely disappointing from an economic perspective and is essentially throwing gasoline onto an already raging risk-off fire in the capital markets."
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 2.2 percent, or 274.88 points, to 12,118.57. The broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 2.5 percent, or 32.29 points, to 1,278.04. And the Nasdaq fell 2.8 percent to 2,747.48.
The three indexes were down about 3 percent this week.
The daily decline pushed the Dow negative for the year so far, or down 0.8 percent, while the S.& P. 500 was still ahead about 2 percent for 2012 and the Nasdaq was up 6 percent.
In May, stocks recorded their worst monthly performance this year, with the S.& P. falling more than 6 percent. The Dow shed a net 820 points in May, its worst monthly showing since the same month in 2010.
"Uh oh -- reintroducing recession call?" said the headline of an economic commentary by Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist for BTIG, a financial services firm. He said the American jobs report, "in the context of every other development, certainly reintroduces" the possibility of a recession.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index closed down 2.4 percent, while the CAC 40 in France fell 2.2 percent. Stocks in Germany slid, with the DAX down 3.4 percent for the day.
Analysts said investors were grappling with data that showed economy activity slowing down in the core and periphery countries of the euro zone, while leaders struggled to keep strapped governments and the banking system afloat.
Petr Zemcik, director of European economics for Moody's Analytics, said he was "a little surprised" to see the drop in stocks, although Germany's macroeconomic data has recently been mixed and the top loser among stock sectors on Friday was automobiles, suggesting that the market may be starting to price in a potential hit to exports.
Oil prices sank but gold soared as the bargain-basement interest rates spurred expectations for the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy with another round of asset purchases.
"This week, economic data sparked renewed chatter about further monetary easing by the Fed," said James Steel, an HSBC analyst.
"What we can say at a minimum is gold's own fundamentals are reasserting themselves," he said. "It is being sought out by investors not as a safe haven necessarily, but it is attractive in comparison to other assets."
As an indicator of future volatility, the VIX, officially known as the CBOE Volatility Index, was up to 26, its highest level so far this year. But that is still less than half its level in late 2008 and early 2009 as the financial crisis emerged.

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Private payroll growth accelerated only slightly in May and claims for jobless benefits rose last week, suggesting the recovery in the nation's labor market was stalling after a strong performance early in the year.
Other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the Midwest slowed considerably in May, and economic growth in the first quarter was a bit softer than initially estimated.
Economists said the reports reflected anxiety amid an uncertain global economic outlook as the euro zone's debt crisis escalates and China's economy slows.
"The economy is growing at an anemic pace, and the job market is showing some signs of hesitation in the pace of hiring," said Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. "There is a lot to worry about."
Private employers created 133,000 jobs in May, the payrolls processor ADP said. That was only a slight step up from April's tepid increase of 113,000 and below economists' expectations for a gain of 148,000.
The report comes ahead of the government's closely watched May employment report on Friday, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls up from a paltry 115,000 in April to about 150,000.
The recent cooling in the labor market has been largely viewed as payback for strong gains during the winter, when unusually warm weather spurred economic activity. But economists are starting to worry that the troubles in Europe and an uncertain fiscal outlook at home are now dampening the recovery.
Initial claims for state jobless benefits rose 10,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 383,000, a Labor Department report showed. Claims have now risen in seven of the last eight weeks.
Another report showed the number of planned layoffs at companies in the United States hit an eight-month high.
Joel Prakken, chairman of the forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers, which helps produce the ADP report, said the soft private-sector payroll gains of the past two months at least partly reflected the unusual weather patterns, but he said they also raised a red flag about fundamental weakness.
"Today's number both confirms and reinforces the deceleration of employment that we saw last month," he said. "While the deceleration is disappointing, it's hardly surprising, given the tepid macroeconomic data we have seen reported over the last several months."
A report from the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago found factory activity in the Midwest lost steam in May. The group said its business barometer fell to 52.7, the lowest since September 2009, from 56.2 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy.
Other regional surveys of factory activity also have found activity slowing, suggesting the manufacturing sector was losing a step nationally. The Institute for Supply Management will release a report on national factory activity for May on Friday.

Abstract: Sudan has struggled under tough economic sanctions for years, and Mr. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges for the massacres in Darfur.

Full text: NAIROBI, Kenya -- For the first time in months, after killing scores if not hundreds of each other's men, Sudan and South Sudan are back at the negotiating table, wrangled into peace talks by an increasingly worried international coalition, including the United States and China, that was terrified that the two countries were on the brink of a cataclysmic war.
It was less than two months ago that Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, ridiculed South Sudan's government in Juba as a measly "insect" that needed to be swatted away. Since then, the two sides have announced that they pulled out of Abyei, a disputed area. On Thursday, Barnaba Marial Benjamin, South Sudan's information minister, said the negotiations, taking place in Ethiopia, were "going well."
Guns flashing one day. Smiles the next. Sudan analysts say that is simply how it is going to be with these two feuding neighbors. Though Sudan and South Sudan may never descend to a full-fledged war, partly because of all the international attention, they will probably never achieve full-fledged peace either.
"I do not see things improving much and basically think that the current style of destructive but low-level violence will be the order of the day," said John O. Voll, a professor of Islamic history at Georgetown University and a longtime Sudan specialist.
Mr. Bashir recently offered a similar assessment, saying, "If they want to change the regime in Khartoum, we will work to change the regime in Juba." He added, "And if they want to support our rebels, we will support theirs."
The tensions run deep. Guerrilla fighters in what is now South Sudan, which is mostly Christian and animist and culturally more akin to sub-Saharan Africa, fought for decades against the Arab-dominated leaders in Khartoum, Sudan's capital. Last July, South Sudan officially broke off from Sudan and became the world's newest country. People celebrated for days.
But the euphoria did not last. There were too many unresolved issues, and Sudan and South Sudan soon began squabbling bitterly over how to demarcate the border and share oil profits. (The conundrum of the two Sudans is that while most of the oil is in the south, the pipeline runs through the north.)
Complicating things even further was a fierce rebellion in the Nuba Mountains, which lie just across the border in Sudan. The Nuban fighters had been close allies of the southern rebels, and there was evidence that South Sudan's new government was covertly supplying the Nubans with money, tanks and militia fighters. At the same time, Khartoum seemed to be covertly arming ethnic militias in the south that had killed thousands in the past few years, making a mockery of the South Sudanese security forces.
In January, South Sudan cut off oil production, a measure aimed at Khartoum that also hurt at home. The southern government gets 98 percent of its revenue from oil sales and may soon run out of cash to pay its army, a situation everyone agrees is a time bomb. In April, vicious north-south fighting broke out along the border. Despite Mr. Bashir's boast that he had "fertilized the soil with their dead," South Sudan surprised many by seizing Heglig, one of the last oil fields Sudan still has. It seemed that all the internal stress and divisions in the north, including the continuing insurgency in the Darfur region, were finally catching up with Sudan and that its army was not what it once was.
Mr. Bashir has many headaches, including soaring inflation, urban protests and his own status as an international pariah. Sudan has struggled under tough economic sanctions for years, and Mr. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges for the massacres in Darfur. Analysts fear that a war would be just the lifeline he needs, and that his country would rally behind him. The same may be true for Salva Kiir, South Sudan's president, who also faces rising discontent and sharpening ethnic divisions in his new nation.
"Both sides have an interest in war," said Mariam al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, a leading opposition politician in Khartoum. "It's a way out for them, from internal problems they can't handle."
The last major conflict between the two sides, from the 1980s until the early 2000s, was a disaster, with more than two million people killed. Hundreds of thousands of starving refugees fled the fighting, including the so-called Lost Boys, orphaned children who trudged hundreds of miles across jungles and savannas, dodging bombers and lions.
The specter of a relapse into this carnage prompted the United Nations Security Council to intervene, passing a resolution on May 2 that threatened the two sides with sanctions if they did not stop fighting. The south immediately signaled it was ready to talk. Mr. Bashir kept stalling, part of a strategy to allow the southern economy to become even more distressed and to bolster his own country's leverage to squeeze the south to pay higher oil transit fees.
"And it's true," said a United Nations official in Juba, speaking on background to frankly assess the state of affairs. "If a deal isn't worked out soon and those soldiers don't get paid, things could get ugly. The lights could literally go out in Juba."
The two sides are now discussing a seven-point security "road map" that requires pulling back from contested border areas, setting up a joint monitoring mechanism and ending covert support for proxy militias. The Security Council has given negotiators two more months to tackle the really delicate issues, like oil, but there is still a Persian Gulf-size gap between the two, with the north wanting more than $30 a barrel in transit fees and the south offering about a dollar.
Most analysts predict an oil compromise may be reached, but the more complicated territorial disputes may have to go to international arbitration, which could take years. While all this grinds on, analysts anticipate more breakdowns and attempts to patch things up, more violence followed by more hastily arranged cease-fires.
"While the tensions still exist and there's a lot of friction, both sides are saying, 'Look, we're committed to implementing the mandates spelled out by the African Union and the U.N. Security Council,' " said Princeton N. Lyman, the American special envoy for Sudan, who has been attending the talks.
The most obvious problem is the lack of trust.
In the past year, the two sides have signed about five different protocols promising to demilitarize the border and cooperate on security issues and a variety of other matters. All have been summarily violated.

Abstract: Indian business leaders, foreign investors and analysts say India's strengths are being undermined by growing political dysfunction: the populist tendencies of Indian politicians, a lack of action by top leaders and allegations of corruption that have undermined the authority of policy makers. At the core of the political uncertainties is the weakened status of the Indian National Congress Party, which leads the coalition government, known as the United Progressive Alliance. Since 2004, the government has operated under an unorthodox partnership between Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party and the governing coalition, and Manmohan Singh, her handpicked prime minister.

Full text: NEW DELHI -- India's coalition government just celebrated the third anniversary of its tenure with a self-congratulatory banquet that could not have been more poorly timed: India's currency, the rupee, is falling; investment is down; inflation is rising; and deficits are eating away at government coffers.
While short-term growth has slowed but not ground to a halt, India's problems have dampened hopes that it, along with China and other non-Western economies, might help revive the global economy, as happened after the 2008 financial crisis. Instead, India is now facing a political reckoning, as the country's elected leaders must address difficult, politically unpopular decisions -- or risk even deeper problems.
"When India was being run comparatively well in 2008, they seemed to cope with these external shocks, at least from a financial perspective," said Glenn Levine, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in Sydney, Australia. "I think people are starting to question the long-term Indian story. That is the difference now."
India's difficulties come as the global economy is wobbling once again. Europe is grappling with a sovereign debt crisis that could shatter the continent's economic and political union. The United States is still not producing enough new jobs. China's growth has weakened, with a real estate downturn and stalling exports, while important emerging economies like Brazil are slowing down, adding to pessimism about the world economy at a critical time.
India is often viewed as a rising global powerhouse and, not too long ago, Indian officials were predicting growth rates of 9 percent or higher. The Obama administration, eager to tap into such a booming market and envisioning India as a regional counterweight to China, trumpeted the United States-India partnership. Some analysts even saw the global downturn as an opportunity for India, making it more attractive for foreign investors wary of putting money into declining advanced industrial countries.
Today, India's economy is still expanding, with growth projected between 6 percent and 7 percent this year. And analysts say India's long-term strengths remain significant. It has one of the world's youngest populations, and polls consistently show they are overwhelmingly optimistic about their future. Meanwhile, India's businesses are competing more aggressively on the global stage.
But the slowdown has punctured the once bubbly mood in the business and political classes and brought sharp criticism of the government. Indian business leaders, foreign investors and analysts say India's strengths are being undermined by growing political dysfunction: the populist tendencies of Indian politicians, a lack of action by top leaders and allegations of corruption that have undermined the authority of policy makers.
India is desperate for investment in mining, roads, ports, urban housing and other areas, but Indian businesses and foreign investors are starting to shy away. Indian corporations, unable to obtain governmental licenses or permissions for projects, are investing overseas instead. Foreigners are also pulling back; their investment in Indian stocks and bonds totaled only $16 billion in the last fiscal year, compared with $30 billion the year before. The trend accelerated in recent months after the Finance Ministry, trying to stem a rising budget deficit, proposed a raft of new taxes on foreign institutions doing business in India.
"A quiet crisis of confidence is building up," said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. "There is no certainty over the regulatory regime. There is no certainty over the tax regime."
Indians have long thrived amid adversity, often by creatively -- at times, illegally -- subverting onerous regulations with a workaround ethos that has spurred economic activity. Even today, industries like pharmaceuticals, information technology and consumer goods, which do not need many licenses and official approvals, are prospering. But those sectors tied to the government, including mining, construction and manufacturing, are struggling.
"We have consciously kept away from businesses where we would have needed lots of permissions," said Ajay Piramal, who heads a Mumbai-based conglomerate focused on pharmaceuticals.
At the core of the political uncertainties is the weakened status of the Indian National Congress Party, which leads the coalition government, known as the United Progressive Alliance. Since 2004, the government has operated under an unorthodox partnership between Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party and the governing coalition, and Manmohan Singh, her handpicked prime minister.
The division of duties worked during the government's first term. Mrs. Gandhi managed the coalition partners, rode herd on the Congress Party, championed safety net programs for the poor and oversaw election strategy; Mr. Singh, a quiet economist considered a father of India's reform era, moved India closer to the United States and oversaw a booming economy where growth topped 9 percent.
In 2009, voters returned the U.P.A. to power amid expectations that India, having shrugged off the 2008 global recession, was on an inevitably upward growth track. But analysts say the contradictions in the Singh-Gandhi partnership have since been exposed. Mr. Singh holds the most politically powerful job in the country, yet is seemingly reluctant to wield power and often must seek approval on policy questions from Mrs. Gandhi. She oversees an advisory panel largely consisting of social activists that her critics regard as a shadow government.
The result has been a lack of a clear political agenda emanating from the top, analysts and business leaders say, allowing the bureaucracy to fall back into its traditional resistance to making decisions. When officials do act, they often change course after encountering political opposition.
"The last year was wasted," said Sanjaya Baru, a former spokesman for the prime minister who is now at a research institute. "We've had a crisis of leadership on the economic side."
Moreover, the government has been on the defensive since a series of corruption scandals, dormant for several years, exploded into public view. Attempts by technocrats to push through a so-called "second generation" of deeper economic changes were undermined by the inability of the Congress Party to corral its coalition partners.
In December, Mr. Singh's cabinet announced that foreign retailers like Walmart would be allowed for the first time to open stores in the country with local partners. But Mr. Singh was forced to reverse course after an ally, Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of the state of West Bengal, balked and threatened to bring down the government.
Then in March, facing pressures to raise revenues and stem the rising fiscal deficit, Pranab Mukherjee, the finance minister, released a budget that proposed new taxes on foreign entities in India, including levies on past deals that the Indian Supreme Court had ruled were not taxable in the country. Foreign investors were stunned, and analysts say the outflow of capital is one reason the rupee has tumbled 13 percent since the end of February.
"We are fed up and our investors are not keen to even talk about India," said a senior executive at an American bank in Mumbai, asking not to be identified so he could speak bluntly. "They are sick and tired."
Kaushik Basu, the government's chief economic adviser, acknowledged that the government had made mistakes and had missed opportunities to better position India as the global economic landscape shifts. Yet he said that the rising pessimism was unwarranted and that India was still growing, still had high investment and savings rates, and should take advantage of the depreciation of the rupee to push exports. He said India's problems were no worse than those in other emerging economies.
"It is a difficult stage," Mr. Basu said in an interview. "But I do remain very, very optimistic. Six months and we will pull up."
In the meantime, the immediate challenges are piling up. This month, in a move to raise revenues, the government raised gasoline prices, drawing public fury. Now the question, analysts say, is whether the administration can muster the political courage to trim the bigger subsidies affecting diesel fuel and cooking gas.
Mr. Singh warned last week that the government would have to make some unpopular decisions. Many experts, however, say they expect more stalemate.
"It has always been tough," said Mr. Levine, the Moody's economist, "but there is a sense, at the moment, that it's too difficult. For the time being people are just giving up on it."

Full text: AS problems mount in the euro zone, it's increasingly evident that we've been witnessing an institutional failure of monumental proportions.
What is to be done about Greece? Simply keeping it in the euro zone won't help much, even if it's possible. The continuing crisis has sapped confidence in banks not only in Greece, but also in Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, though to varying degrees. Unless there are explicit guarantees to these banks soon, the market will likely take a further turn for the worse.
An absence of guarantees could prompt a broader chain reaction of capital flight and bank collapses across several countries.
The basic problem is that many people won't keep their euros in a Greek bank, and perhaps not in a Spanish bank, either, when those euros can be moved to Germany or some other haven.
Yet German citizens do not appear ready to guarantee Spanish banks or, by extension, the whole credit system of Spain and the other periphery nations. Guarantees of that scope are probably impossible and may also require constitutional changes in some nations.
We thus face the danger that the euro, the world's No. 2 reserve currency, could implode. Such an event wouldn't be just another depreciation or collapse of a currency peg; instead, it would mean that one of the world's major economic units doesn't work as currently constituted.
We are realizing just how much international economic order depends on the role of a dominant country -- sometimes known as a hegemon -- that sets clear rules and accepts some responsibility for the consequences. For historical reasons, Germany isn't up to playing the role formerly held by Britain and, to some extent, still held today by the United States. (But when it comes to the euro zone, the United States is on the sidelines.)
THERE appears to be a power vacuum, and the implications are alarming. We may be entering a new world where international cooperative arrangements, in environmental areas as well as finance, are commonly recognized as impossible. If the core European nations cannot coordinate effectively, what can we expect in dealings with China, Russia and other countries that have less of a common background and understanding?
In the euro zone, we are seeing two refusals to cooperate: Germany won't renew financial pledges to Greece without Greek compliance on previous agreements, and Greece doesn't want Germany to control its national budget. Both seem reasonable positions, and maybe they are, but reasonable positions can apparently destroy an international agreement rather easily.
Is there a way out? To seek a binge of pro-growth government spending, in the hope of stimulating economies, is to assume what already stands in doubt. The crisis has reached a head partly because the market already lacks trust in the periphery governments to invest money for sustainable economic growth.
There is also talk of forming a true fiscal union, but that seems to be doubling down on a bad idea. If the euro zone cannot summon enough cooperation now, how is any union requiring tighter cooperation supposed to work? How would national budgets be set and approved? A credit collapse remains a real possibility.
Is it too late for monetary policy to make a difference? The other euro-zone nations might allow Greece to leave, while guaranteeing payments for food and fuel, both of which Greece imports, for a reasonable period. Higher price inflation might then depreciate the euro, limit the need for difficult downward wage adjustments, and help Spain and Italy improve their competitiveness. The inflation could come through central bank bond purchases from the troubled nations, thus easing their debt problems. That may be the only useful option still on the table.
But that's also not easy. First, economically healthier nations may be reluctant to accept the inflation, which would represent a rather direct, continuing redistribution of wealth to the troubled debtor countries.
The second problem is that some of the banking systems in the periphery nations may be too broken for monetary policy to take hold. Imagine the European Central Bank trying to infuse new money and credit into Spain, while bank deposits move quickly to Germany, Switzerland and other safer places. Again, why would anyone want to keep money in the bank of a fiscally troubled nation? That loss of confidence will not be easily repaired.
Since December, the European Central Bank has lent more than a trillion euros to euro-zone banks, but that has bought no more than a few months of peace. It isn't clear how much more can be done. It probably is about time to judge the euro zone as a failed idea -- and rarely is it wise to double down on failed ideas.
What is most disturbing is that the euro-zone nations are democratic, protective of basic liberties, and have advanced intellectual and research communities. The final lesson of this debacle is that smart nations with noble motives can make very big mistakes. And that should concern us all.

Full text: Inspector Clouseau got lots of laughs when he was bitten by a mutt in a classic scene from the movie "The Pink Panther Strikes Again." But in real life, aggressive dogs can be a big problem. Dog bite claims account for more than a third of all homeowner's insurance liability claims paid out, according to an insurance industry group.
That proportion has remained roughly constant over the last decade, according to Loretta Worters of the Insurance Information Institute. And the number of claims has hovered around 15,000 to 16,000 annually over the last 10 years, though with an uptick last year. But the average cost per claim was more than $29,000 in 2011, an increase of 25 percent in eight years (after accounting for inflation), mostly because of increases in medical costs. State Farm says it paid out more than $109 million as a result of 3,800 dog bite claims last year.
Homeowner's liability insurance covers you for injuries or damage to someone else -- say, someone slipping on your icy steps in winter, or your dog biting the neighbor's child when he comes over to play with your child. (Or, if your dog bites someone while you're out walking it in the park.)
"If your dog bites somebody, you are liable," said Robert Hartwig III, president of the institute.
The institute, along with other organizations like the United States Postal Service, are publicizing dog bite statistics to highlight National Dog Bite Prevention Week.
Typically, homeowner's and renter's insurance cover dog liability as part of the policy's standard coverage with limits up to $100,000 or $300,000. Most companies will insure homeowners with dogs, but once a dog has bitten someone, your premium may go up -- or the dog may be excluded from coverage. Still others require the owner to take the dog to behavior modification classes to continue coverage.
To prevent dog bites in the first place, experts offer these tips:
Check with a professional, like a veterinarian or breeder, to learn about suitable dog breeds.
Spend time with a dog before buying or adopting it, and use caution when bringing a dog into a home with an infant or toddler.
Have your dog spayed or neutered.
Seek professional advice if your dog develops aggressive behavior.
Discourage children from bothering a dog when it is eating or sleeping. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than half of the 4.7 million Americans bitten by dogs annually are children.)
Never approach a strange dog, especially one that's tethered or confined, and avoid eye contact with a dog that appears threatening.
Don't run past a dog.
If you are knocked down by a dog, curl into a ball and protect your face with your hands.
Have you ever been bitten by a dog? Or has your dog ever bitten someone?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Citing Gains, U.S. Doesn't Call China Currency Manipulator

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department said on Friday that China had made progress in allowing its currency to rise against the dollar and declined to accuse the nation of manipulating its currency to gain a trade advantage.
The department's decision should help avert a trade dispute. But the department said China's currency was still undervalued and must rise further against the dollar.
The renminbi has gained 8 percent against the dollar in the last two years. A currency with a lower value gives China a trade advantage by making its exports cheaper and imports from the United States more expensive.
If the department found that China was manipulating its currency, the Obama administration would have had to initiate negotiations with China. If those talks failed, the United States could have imposed trade sanctions.
Some American manufacturers have urged the administration to take punitive steps to force China to allow the renminbi to trade freely. The renminbi now trades within a narrow range against the dollar.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has said that he would label China a currency manipulator on his first day in office.
The Treasury Department said China had made commitments in recent negotiations, including some at high-level meetings this month, to make its exchange rate more flexible.
In April, China widened the daily amount the renminbi was allowed to fluctuate to 1 percent, from 0.5 percent. That move came just before Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met President Hu Jintao of China for high-level talks in early May in Beijing.
Mr. Geithner told Mr. Hu during those meetings that China's loosening of the range was "very promising."
The United States has urged China to let its currency appreciate for almost a decade. In 2005, China ended its tight peg of the renminbi to the dollar and permitted the renminbi to trade within a narrow range. Since then, the renminbi has appreciated 40 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, the department said.
The United States trade deficit with China widened in March, the Commerce Department said this month. The deficit with China this year is on pace to exceed last year's gap of $295.5 billion, a high for any country.

Abstract: The prime minister has said that the double-dip recession was the result of higher energy prices, a dearth of bank lending and, to a large extent, the economic crisis in the euro zone, Britain's largest export market.

Full text: LONDON -- When the British economy fell back into a recession at the beginning of the year, the government put part of the blame on the turmoil in the euro zone.
That claim lost some credibility Thursday, with the release of official statistics showing that the country's downturn in the first quarter was worse than had been estimated, while the euro zone escaped recession altogether.
The data put added pressure on the coalition government led by Prime Minister David Cameron to soften its emphasis on austerity measures to reduce the deficit and instead consider ways to spur economic growth.
The Office for National Statistics revised the decline in gross domestic product in the first three months of this year to 0.3 percent, from the 0.2 percent it estimated last month, because of a deeper slump in the construction industry. Construction output dropped 4.8 percent from a year earlier, the agency said, not 3 percent, as it had estimated earlier.
The revised figures were "bad news for U.K. policy makers as it shows the economy faring even more badly than initially thought," said Scott Corfe, senior economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London. "Indeed, the latest data show the U.K. economy performing worse than the euro zone economy, which saw zero growth at the start of the year -- meaning the U.K.'s woes cannot even be fully attributable to the debt crisis embroiling the Continent."
Mr. Cameron has repeatedly rejected calls by the opposition Labour Party and by some economists to scale back austerity measures, arguing that government spending cuts helped Britain keep its borrowing costs low and investor confidence high. The prime minister has said that the double-dip recession was the result of higher energy prices, a dearth of bank lending and, to a large extent, the economic crisis in the euro zone, Britain's largest export market.
Statistics released last week showed that the euro zone's economy avoided slipping into recession in the first quarter, if only because the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the period, pulling up the average for the currency area. Britain is a member of the European Union but is outside the euro zone.
Mr. Cameron irked some European leaders over the weekend when he weighed in on the debate about the euro zone crisis by calling on member states to do more to solve it.
"What would be bad for Greece, bad for Europe and bad for the world is if we just allowed the can to be kicked further down the road with an inconclusive outcome," Mr. Cameron said in Chicago after a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 8 large industrialized countries.
The revised economic data give more ammunition to those who oppose the government's budget cuts, which have resulted in pay freezes and tens of thousands of job cuts throughout the public sector. But Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, have said they will stick to their program to bring down the government deficit. They point to the relatively low interest rates Britain pays on its debt, and praise from the major debt rating agencies, as evidence that their plan is working.
"Our complacent and out-of-touch prime minister and chancellor have spent the last week claiming their plan is on track, but these figures show that Britain's double-dip recession is even deeper than first thought," said Ed Balls, the Labour Party's spokesman on fiscal issues. "What more evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies have failed and that they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth and jobs?"
The government has rejected Labour's repeated calls to spur economic growth by spending more, arguing that it was the previous Labour government's excessive spending before the economic crisis that caused Britain's difficulties in the first place.
Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, backed the austerity plan this week but also said Britain would need to consider incremental policy changes, which could include more stimulus from the Bank of England, if the economic recovery continued to falter.
The Bank of England decided this month to halt a stimulus program that included the purchase of government bonds as it shifted its focus from economic recovery and back to controlling inflation, which has been running above the central bank's 2 percent target. But minutes of the most recent meeting of the central bank's policy committee showed that members remained open to expanding the stimulus program should the economy worsen.

Abstract: "The medical community needs to transform care," said Dr. Thomas L. Simmer, the chief medical officer of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state's largest insurer. In Michigan, for example, Blue Cross financed an effort to have the state's major hospitals compare results in areas like bariatric or general surgery so that they could reduce infection rates and surgical complications.\n

Full text: Giselle Fernandez is only 17 but she has had more than 50 operations since she was born with a rare genetic condition. She regularly sees a host of pediatric specialists, including an ophthalmologist, an endocrinologist and a neurologist at UCLA Health System. Her care has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars so far, and she will need special treatment for the rest of her life.
While UCLA Health System has long prided itself on being at the forefront of treating patients like Giselle, it is now trying to lower sharply the cost of providing that care. By enrolling young patients with complex and expensive diseases in a program called a medical home, the system tries to ensure that doctors spend more time with patients and work more closely with parents to coordinate care. The program has cut emergency room visits by slightly more than half.
The effort is part of a much broader ambition by UCLA Health System to reduce its costs by 30 percent, or hundreds of millions of dollars, over the next five years, according to Dr. David T. Feinberg, the system's president.
"We have definitely found religion," Dr. Feinberg said.
After years of self-acknowledged profligacy, hospitals, doctors and health insurers say there is a strong effort under way to bring medical costs under control. Their goal is to slash the rate of growth in the nation's $2.7 trillion health care bill by roughly half to keep it more in line with overall inflation.
Private insurers, employers and government officials are providing urgency to these efforts, and the federal health care law passed two years ago helped accelerate them.
Even if the Supreme Court decides next month to declare the entire law unconstitutional, many experts in the field say the momentum is likely to continue.
"Regardless of what happens to the law, the market will force the system to become more efficient," said Paul H. Keckley, the executive director of the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a research arm of the consultant Deloitte.
The drive to lower costs is resulting in numerous efforts. UCLA Health System is scrutinizing its use of imaging procedures on patients in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Over the last year, the average number of X-rays per patient each day was reduced to two, from 10.
The Cleveland Clinic, another medical powerhouse that has little difficulty attracting patients and demanding high prices, is trying group visits for diabetic patients so more people can be seen at a lower cost. The clinic has started reminding its surgeons about the $400 price of a unit of blood as a way of discouraging unnecessary transfusions, which along with other changes in patient care last year helped save $4 million. The clinic's medical residents also can no longer order as many expensive tests as they want. "What we're talking about is driving the value equation," said Dr. Delos M. Cosgrove, the chief executive for the clinic.
These efforts include trying to keep the health system's own employees healthy by enlisting them in wellness programs or, as at UCLA, eliminating fried food in the cafeteria.
"Nobody has died because the Tater Tots are gone," said Dr. Feinberg.
Many of those involved say the impetus should come directly from hospitals and doctors.
"The medical community needs to transform care," said Dr. Thomas L. Simmer, the chief medical officer of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the state's largest insurer.
By collaborating with Michigan hospitals to share best practices, Blue Cross estimated it achieved savings of $233 million over three years.
Despite the flurry of activity, many caution that these efforts may not succeed in saving money. Many previous programs failed in the end to reduce costs or improve care. And many people within the industry are still wedded to the status quo, said Dr. Michael W. Cropp, the chief executive of Independent Health, an insurer in Buffalo. Dr. Cropp has been vocal about the need to address rising costs.
"The mind-set shift is beginning, albeit too slowly," he said.
Experts also warn that many of these initiatives will take time to work, especially since the more tests and procedures they do, the more money doctors and hospitals get. But there are also signs that insurers, which traditionally have focused on paying hospitals and doctors the least they can, are working much more closely with providers to improve care.
In Michigan, for example, Blue Cross financed an effort to have the state's major hospitals compare results in areas like bariatric or general surgery so that they could reduce infection rates and surgical complications. The insurer never sees data that identifies individual hospitals, and the hospitals meet regularly to discuss how they can learn from one another to improve care.
"There's basically a 'leave your guns at the door' attitude," said Dr. Darrell Campbell, the chief medical officer for the University of Michigan Health System.
The program's benefits extend far beyond Blue Cross's own customers, according to the insurer's calculations. Only a third of the savings was attributable to patients it insured. Unlike previous attempts by insurers to reward individual hospitals for quality and efficiency, the program tries to help all hospitals improve.
The earlier efforts, which focused on overly specific measures or reporting on individual hospitals, "tended to inspire providers to do the least necessary to achieve the incentive rather than the most to transform care," said Dr. David Share, a senior executive at Blue Cross.
In other cases, health insurers are collaborating with hospitals and doctors through new models like so-called accountable care organizations, which coordinate the care for a group of people. In early 2010, Blue Shield of California teamed with a San Francisco-based hospital system, now Dignity Health, and a large medical group, Hill Physicians, to provide coverage for 40,000 members of the California Public Employees' Retirement System in Sacramento. Blue Shield promised to keep premiums flat the first year and increase them as little as possible afterward.
Simply by working together, the three were able to reduce the number of times patients had to be readmitted to the hospital by 15 percent. Previously, the insurer, the hospital and the medical group had each assigned a case manager to the same patient, but patients were still failing to schedule follow-up visits with their doctors and were not getting clear instructions about their care when they left the hospital.
"None of the case managers from the three organizations were talking to each other," said Paul Markovich, an executive vice president of Blue Shield.
In the end, the hospital was deemed responsible for follow-up care, even though it had the least incentive to prevent a patient from returning, he said.
Before the program, "there's no way we could even contemplate doing that," Mr. Markovich said.
The hospital system says it is committed to more affordable care, which is why it agreed to work with Blue Shield in the first place.
"We do think there is a problem with cost," said Michael D. Blaszyk, the chief financial officer for Dignity Health.
"Our goal was not to ramp up our profits," he said. "Our goal was not to lose money on this."
Patients also benefit. Sandra Fernandez, Giselle's mother, said she appreciates that the doctors at Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA are now well versed in her daughter's condition so that she does not have to go through the complicated history repeatedly. Giselle's condition involves developmental delays, and she has also been treated for hypothyroidism and seizures, and the program ensures that she is connected to all the right specialists.
"For me as a mother, it was easier to communicate," said Ms. Fernandez, who speaks Spanish, through an interpreter.

Full text: BERLIN -- When European leaders meet on Wednesday to discuss the troubles of the euro zone, France's president will press the issue of euro bonds, his finance minister said in Berlin on Monday. Yet, while the German government has been receptive to many proposals to revive growth on the Continent, officials here said euro bonds might well be a step too far.
Pierre Moscovici, France's newly appointed finance minister, traveled to Berlin for talks with his counterpart, Wolfgang Schauble. In a news conference after the closed-door meeting, both characterized the exchange as friendly and productive, but Mr. Moscovici acknowledged that the two men, and their governments, had real differences of opinion over pooling obligations to use the credit of the strongest European countries to prop up the weaker ones, an approach achieved through euro bonds.
All options will be on the table when European leaders meet this week, including euro bonds, Mr. Moscovici said. "Each one has his own point of view, but at the same time, Francois Hollande has said that it is important to put everything on the table," said Mr. Moscovici, referring to his boss, the newly inaugurated president of France.
Mr. Hollande's victory in the French election has pushed the question of how to kindle economic growth in the euro zone to the top of the agenda, challenging the focus of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on trimming back budget deficits to reduce indebtedness. Mr. Hollande has argued that the prescription of austerity has failed and on Saturday, at Camp David for the Group of 8 meeting, said he would revive the subject of euro bonds.
European markets were mixed on Monday, after the leaders offered moral support, but no road map, for addressing the euro crisis. Markets in Europe had swooned in recent weeks over concerns that Greece would no longer be able to fulfill its obligations, as the economy shrank faster than projected.
Greece has been the subject of anxiety for more than two years, since its national accounts were found to have greatly understated the parlous state of its finances. Greek voters face an election June 17 that could decide whether the country remains part of the euro and continues to receive bailout aid.
If Greece were forced to leave the euro zone, a step both Mr. Moscovici and Mr. Schauble said they opposed, it could have dangerous ripple effects as speculators go after other vulnerable countries that use the currency, including Portugal and Ireland, both of which have received bailouts like Greece.
Policy makers are concerned that unless those economies as well as ones in Spain, Italy and even France can grow faster, the sovereign-debt crisis will grow even more dangerous. Ms. Merkel has signaled flexibility on some of Mr. Hollande's ideas, including more financing for the European Investment Bank and redirecting unspent European Union funds to try to fight unemployment.
The German Bundesbank said this month that it was prepared to accept inflation above the average in the euro zone, while Mr. Schauble said higher wages for German workers could help correct imbalances among the countries that use the currency. Germany's largest industrial union, IG Metall, won a 4.3 percent wage increase for 800,000 workers in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg over the weekend, an agreement the unions said would be the benchmark for millions of members.
But the German government is staunchly opposed to euro bonds until deeper integration and harmonization of budgetary and public spending policies have been achieved. Most Germans see euro bonds as another way for fellow European states to benefit from, and ultimately drag down, Germany's unblemished credit rating.
Mr. Schauble refused to address a direct question about his reaction to the discussion of pooling European debt. "We will take part in discussions about all constructive ideas to support sustainable growth," Mr. Schauble said. "It will all be discussed on Wednesday."
Mr. Schauble's deputy, Steffen Kampeter, was much more forthcoming in reiterating German opposition to any such proposal. Mr. Kampeter called the joint bonds "a prescription at the wrong time with the wrong side effects," in an interview with German public radio.
"The government has repeatedly made clear that collective state borrowing -- that is, euro bonds -- are no way to overcome the current crisis," said Georg Streiter, a spokesman for Ms. Merkel on Monday. "It is still the case that the government rejects euro bonds."
In his remarks to reporters at Camp David, Mr. Hollande promised to raise the issue of euro bonds at the informal European summit on Wednesday, and said "I will not be alone in proposing them." Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain are expected to support him but the plan will have little chance without the backing of Germany, Europe's largest economy.
Mr. Hollande has his work more than cut out for him if he expects to bring the Germans around. In the absence of strict controls, German policy makers say, euro bonds would be comparable to the United States' agreeing to pay off Mexico's debts, almost like a blank check for nations that are in trouble for overspending in the first place.
"Euro bonds are not where the keys to heaven lie," said Michael Huther, director of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research, because it would "mix up risk" and act as a disincentive for less competitive economies to reform.
The discussion at the Brussels meeting is expected to focus on possible pro-growth initiatives, a reflection of what appears to be a growing consensus that Europe must balance its budget consolidation efforts with measures to bolster growth.
The European Commission floated the idea of bonds issued jointly by euro zone governments in November, suggesting that such "stability bonds" could be created "in parallel" with moves toward closer fiscal union, rather than at the end of the process, as the German government prefers, to "alleviate tension" in sovereign debt markets.
"From an economic point of view this makes sense," a commission spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, said Monday. "But at the end of the day this is a political decision that has to be taken by the member states of the euro area." Mr. Altafaj added that "any form of common debt issuance requires a closer coordination of fiscal policies, moving toward a fiscal union, it is a prerequisite."

Full text: The wealthiest 1 percent of New York City residents took in nearly one-third of the personal income in the city in 2009 -- almost double the comparable proportion nationwide, a new study shows.
In a report scheduled to be released on Monday, the city comptroller's office found that large percentages of New Yorkers earned high incomes and low incomes, leaving a smaller middle class than in the nation as a whole.
"There is some evidence of the kind of common worry that New York has a weak middle," said Frank Braconi, chief economist in the comptroller's office.
The report analyzed tax filings by city residents for income earned from 2000 through 2009, the most recent data available, and compared them with the national numbers. All of the numbers were adjusted for inflation.
The most striking difference between New York and the rest of the United States, the report showed, was the concentration of earning power at the high end.
In 2009, nearly 15,000 filers reported adjusted gross income of $1 million or more. They accounted for less than half of 1 percent of the total number of filers, but they took in 26.7 percent of the income in the city. Nationally, people who earned at least $1 million in 2009 collected less than 10 percent of all the income.
Income was much more volatile for the wealthy than for other New Yorkers, the study found.
The average income for the bottom 99 percent of city residents rose from about $42,000 in 2000 to a high of about $50,000 in 2007, then fell back to about $47,000 in 2009.
During the same period, the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent rose sharply, then fell precipitously after the financial crisis hit.
In 2000, to qualify as part of the city's top 1 percent, a filer needed adjusted gross income of slightly less than $460,000. By 2007, after the mid-decade boom, the cutoff had risen to $660,000. But by 2009, it had dropped back to about $492,000.
The top 1 percent in the city received about 32.5 percent of all income in 2009, compared with under 17 percent of all income for the top 1 percent of earners nationwide.
The threshold to reach the top 1 percent in the city may have risen back above $500,000 since 2009, but the tax data for 2010 will not be available until later this year. "I'm curious to see what happened in 2010, when incomes apparently rebounded," Mr. Braconi said.
The comptroller's report also revealed that New York had a smaller bulge in its middle than the rest of the country. Nationally, about 31 percent of filers earned $50,000 to $200,000, and they took in 52 percent of all the personal income in the country. In New York, just 28 percent of filers fell into that income bracket, and they collected only 36 percent of all the personal income in the city.
"New York City's economy would be healthier and more dynamic if the benefits of growth were more fairly distributed," said the comptroller, John C. Liu. "We need to promote a shared prosperity through policies that narrow the income gap, like strengthening investments in education and implementing a more progressive income-tax structure."
Mr. Liu, a Democrat who hopes to run for mayor, has proposed cutting taxes for New Yorkers earning less than $500,000 a year and raising taxes for those earning more than that amount.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has repeatedly stated his opposition to raising taxes only for the wealthiest filers, and has advocated allowing the broad, temporary tax cuts enacted when George W. Bush was president to expire.
Republicans have also made use of city income-tax data to support their arguments. Late last year, Councilman James S. Oddo, a Republican from Staten Island, asked the city's Independent Budget Office to analyze the 2009 filing data. The budget office found that the top 1 percent of filers received over one-third of all personal income and had an average income of almost $2.25 million.
Mr. Oddo's reaction, though, was different from Mr. Liu's. He focused on the top 10 percent of earners, a group for which the income threshold was about $105,400, and said it could include veteran police officers, nurses and school principals.
"I don't think anybody would consider those folks rich," he said.

Abstract: CAMP DAVID, Md. -- Leaders of the world's richest countries banded together on Saturday to press Germany to back more pro-growth policies to halt the deepening debt crisis in Europe, as President Obama for the first time gained widespread support for his argument that Europe, and the United States by extension, cannot afford Chancellor Angela Merkel's one-size-fits-all approach emphasizing austerity.

Full text: CAMP DAVID, Md. -- Leaders of the world's richest countries banded together on Saturday to press Germany to back more pro-growth policies to halt the deepening debt crisis in Europe, as President Obama for the first time gained widespread support for his argument that Europe, and the United States by extension, cannot afford Chancellor Angela Merkel's one-size-fits-all approach emphasizing austerity.
Pointedly recognizing "that the right measures are not the same for each of us," the leaders of the Group of 8 nations, at a meeting hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David, committed to "take all necessary steps" to strengthen their economies. They said they wanted to keep Greece in the euro zone and vowed to work to promote growth in Europe, though behind the scenes distinct differences remained over what kinds of stimulus policies to pursue.
"Our imperative," the leaders said in their statement, "is to promote growth and jobs."
It is by no means the final word in the growth-versus-austerity fight that has been under way for two years. Even with the future of the European currency union in doubt, Germany has insisted that Europe's ailing economies tackle their financial problems through spending cuts, a policy that critics say has caused higher unemployment, brought Greece to the edge of bankruptcy and worsened the crises in Spain and Italy.
The leaders did concede somewhat to Ms. Merkel's position on austerity, acknowledging that national budget deficits had to be addressed. But they added that spending cuts must "take into account countries' evolving economic conditions and underpin confidence and economy recovery," a recognition of how much the austerity packages have dampened consumer and political confidence in Europe.
Also, in a warning to Iran, the leaders pledged to take steps to guarantee continued oil supplies after an oil embargo against Iran begins on July 1.While Greece is not part of the Group of 8 -- the club is made up of the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia -- the political and economic crisis facing Athens hovered over the meeting. Greece has been unable to form a government after voters, angry over austerity measures, brought down the last government, and there is now talk of bringing back the drachma and abandoning the euro.
Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama met privately after the meeting ended. In her public remarks, the German chancellor said that growth and deficit-cutting reinforced each other, and that "we have to work on both paths, and the participants have made that clear, and I think that is great progress."
With his own re-election bid tied to a fragile American economic recovery that could easily reverse if Europe's economy takes another turn for the worse, Mr. Obama was pushing hard on Saturday for a euro-zone growth package. American officials said they hoped that after the full-court press this weekend at Camp David, Ms. Merkel would be more amenable to the pro-growth argument when she meets with European leaders this week at a summit to come up with specific steps to fight rising debt while spurring the economy.
The last time world leaders met to discuss the European debt crisis, in Cannes last November, the French president at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, joined with Ms. Merkel to push Italy to stick to an austerity package. But the tone was different this time. Mr. Sarkozy lost his re-election bid to Francois Hollande, who came into office last week promising to focus on growth. And even before they showed up at Camp David to gang up on Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande and Mr. Obama had forged a new alliance at a prearranged meeting at the White House to focus on growth.
In comments to reporters afterward, Mr. Obama said that the group needed to discuss "a responsible approach to fiscal consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda."
"If a company is forced to cut back in Paris or Madrid, that might mean less business for workers in Pittsburgh or Milwaukee," Mr. Obama said to explain why the European crisis matters to the United States. He said that while Europe's predicament is "more complicated" since it requires coordination among multiple governments, steps his own government took to blunt the impact of the American financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, including the stimulus, can stand as an example for Europe.
In a tense meeting here at this storied presidential retreat, it seemed at times as if it was Ms. Merkel -- who faces stiff opposition at home to more bailouts of its neighbors by German taxpayers -- against the world. Things did not seem to get off to a good start either on Friday night, as Mr. Obama greeted his guests for dinner in a rustic wood cabin.
"How've you been?" Mr. Obama asked Ms. Merkel.
She shrugged and pursed her lips.
"Well, you have a few things on your mind," Mr. Obama said consolingly.
Mike Froman, Mr. Obama's top adviser on international economic affairs, was careful not to publicly single out Ms. Merkel and Germany when talking to reporters after the meeting. The debate over austerity vs. growth, he said, "has been going on for some time, and we welcome the evolution on that debate."
But it remains unclear how far Ms. Merkel will go, despite the pressure from other leaders. Ms. Merkel on Saturday was fresh from a war of words with Greece over that country's continued membership in the euro, with Greek politicians complaining that Ms. Merkel had suggested a referendum asking Greece whether it wanted to stay in the euro, a claim that a spokesman for Ms. Merkel has denied.
Separately, the leaders also said they "stand ready" to call on the International Energy Agency to take appropriate action to guarantee oil supplies if prices spike. "There have been increasing disruptions in the supply of oil to the global market over the past several months, which pose a substantial risk to global economic growth," the group said in a statement.
The oil statement was meant to reassure oil markets that nations will consider tapping into their oil reserves if there is a supply shortage. It is particularly meant to send a warning to Iran -- which is the target of an oil embargo to begin July 1 as part of the western effort to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions -- that the West will work to counteract high oil prices once the sanctions go into effect. Finally, it is meant to reassure countries like India and China that they will not be hurt by higher prices once the sanctions begin.
Still, American officials expressed optimism that negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, which are set to reopen at the end of the month in Baghdad, might be productive.
The intimate setting of the meeting -- in secluded Camp David, where the leaders slept in cabins and their attendants shared rooms -- allowed for a more relaxed atmosphere, White House officials said.
Mr. Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain were on treadmills early Saturday morning discussing ways to help ease the debt crisis.
"Nobody felt defensive or put on the defense," Mr. Froman said, disputing reports that Ms. Merkel was isolated.

Abstract: The Republican National Convention says that it is expecting 13,000 to 15,000 members of the news media, which would make it "the single largest media event in the world except for the Olympic Games." Back in the 1970s, after a Watergate scandal involving lobbyists who traded huge donations to the Republican convention for special favors from the Nixon administration, Congress passed a law providing federal funding.

Full text: Our subject for today is: Presidential nominating conventions -- why are they still around?
Other possible subjects were: The Facebook phenomenon and why does its board of directors look like a reunion tour of the Backstreet Boys and their managers?
Or: The new sensation of dancing dogs on TV talent shows and how many of them do you think were ever made to ride on the roof of a car?
But, no, I think we should go with the conventions. The Republicans are having theirs in Tampa, Fla., in August and then the Democrats will be in Charlotte, N.C., at the beginning of September. The presidential nominees have been chosen, but there's still a lot to look forward to. The speeches! The funny hats! And, um ...
Little-known factoids about the upcoming conventions:
The Democrats have an official barbecue sauce. Actually, three. You can buy them on the official Web site, along with a bunch of T-shirts and a very fetching oven mitt.
The Republican National Convention says that it is expecting 13,000 to 15,000 members of the news media, which would make it "the single largest media event in the world except for the Olympic Games." The convention should try to use this Olympic theme more extensively, perhaps decking out all the potential vice presidential nominees in Speedos and recounting heartwarming stories involving ailing family members who are rooting for them back home.
The governor of Florida has rejected Tampa's attempt to ban the carrying of concealed weapons downtown during the Republican convention. I guess this is one way to ratchet up excitement, but I'd prefer Donald Trump nominated for vice president.
You, the taxpayer, are paying the bill. Yes! Back in the 1970s, after a Watergate scandal involving lobbyists who traded huge donations to the Republican convention for special favors from the Nixon administration, Congress passed a law providing federal funding. Indexed for inflation, it's now about $18 million per.
"It's the one part of the public funding program both parties seem more than happy to accept," said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College and an expert on the financing of political conventions. (Isn't it reassuring that there are people struggling to get the country worried about presidential nominating convention finances? It reminds me of the year I was in charge of making it fun to read about the New York City Charter Revision Commission.)
The parties swear, when they take the cash, that they won't solicit additional contributions. But in American politics, when there's a law against raising money you want to raise, the answer is:
A) Break the law.
B) Find a crazy billionaire.
C) Form a committee.
Option C wins! The cities that want to be a convention site create committees, which promise to raise copious cash if chosen. The host committee in Charlotte, for instance, is pledged to raise $36.65 million.
This is turning into something of a struggle, particularly since the Democrats, in a little-noted reform effort, prohibited the host committee from accepting donations above $100,000, or money from lobbyists or corporations. (The Republicans will pretty much take anything from anybody.) Instantly, like a daffodil in spring, a new committee popped up in Charlotte, called New American City. Its mission is to "showcase all that the city and region has to offer" during the convention and, of course, it has none of those irksome limitations.
While they were banning corporate contributions, the Democrats also reduced this year's convention to three days from the usual four. However, the eliminated day will be turned over to a celebration at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, during which viewers will have the opportunity to note the close ties between the Democratic Party and Nascar dads. And since it is happening before the official opening gavel, it can be paid for by New American City.
Do not tell me that this country has lost its capacity for innovation.
In a sane world, the conventions could run one day and $18 million would be plenty. They could skip almost everything but the speeches by the candidates, and President Obama will actually leave the convention to make his at Charlotte's unfortunately-named Bank of America Stadium.
Why do they stretch it out? Well, there are a lot of politicians out there yearning for a chance to address an empty auditorium at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. And our public officials have to deal with an endless line of really irritating people who are impossible to make happy. A convention is a mound of favors they can do for their special interests -- a party invitation, a seat in the vicinity of Joe Biden, or just the opportunity to mingle on the floor with the South Dakota delegation. (Good hats!) If it wasn't for the need to treat the monied troops, the Republicans could hold their convention at Mitt Romney's vacation house. Which I hear is much more pleasant than Tampa in late August.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As Greece's turmoil deepened, Alex Batistatos fumed. In phone calls from Athens, his 83-year-old grandmother told him how her pension was slashed and neighbors were forced to beg. She gives medicine to a friend, she said. Hungry Athenians pick over street garbage for food.
Frustrated, Mr. Batistatos, a 19-year-old student, returned to his Virginia home from college determined to help. Last weekend, he, along with his brother Chris, his parents and friends, organized a fund-raising walk at the National Mall -- one family's effort to offer help in the face of what many Greeks see as a calamity.
As the ramifications of Greece's financial problems have spread, Americans of Greek descent have been struggling with how to respond. For many, the crisis represents an emergency as acute as an earthquake or a tsunami, with the same wrenching consequences of hunger, poverty and displacement.
The crisis has spurred clothing drives and church collections, but it has also revealed uncertainty. Many worry that aid will not reach those in need. Others balk because of the Greek government's instability.
"If there was leadership, we would overcome this ambivalence and this hesitation," said Lefteris Karmiris, 68, of Bethesda, Md., a retired World Bank employee who joined the march last Saturday. "We could give a message to say this is what we should do, but there is a leadership problem."
In general, man-made disasters do not garner as much largess from outside donors as natural disasters, "because there are humans to blame," said Sam Worthington, president of a consortium of aid organizations based in the United States called InterAction. Moreover, Greece is relatively affluent, and its fraying social safety net is a symptom of a broader structural problem.
"People tend to focus on the degree to which they can make a difference in a tangible way, and Greece is a challenging environment to do that," Mr. Worthington said, adding that he was not aware of any recent international relief efforts around a financial crisis, although he noted that emergency aid went to Zimbabwe when soaring inflation put food prices out of reach.
Nonetheless, aid groups have watched in alarm as social and health problems mount because of austerity measures in Greece. An article in The Lancet last fall warned of a potential "Greek tragedy" as the public health care system is stretched thinner and thinner. Unemployment is soaring and suicides are rising. Doctors Without Borders has reported spikes in H.I.V., AIDS and malaria cases.
Andrew S. Natsios, former administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said that Greece's safety net is disintegrating along with its health care system, and hunger is forcing families to return to depopulated islands to grow food.
"I don't think people realize how serious this is," Mr. Natsios said. "We know that families are breaking up now over this, people can't support their children. I've never seen anything like this, actually, since World War II."
For Greek-Americans -- particularly older ones -- that time represents the only comparison to the country's situation today, albeit on a much larger scale then. During the Nazi occupation, hundreds of thousands of Greeks starved to death, and Greeks abroad responded by pouring relief money into the country.
The failure to quickly mobilize in the current crisis led to finger-pointing last winter when Gregory C. Pappas, owner of a Chicago marketing firm and founder of the Greek America Foundation, wrote an online column castigating Greek-Americans for not doing enough to ease the crisis.
"I upset some people, and I know that I upset some people, because they came and told me," he said. "Well, if that's what it takes to feed some people over there, then I'm glad it happened."
The column appeared to touch a nerve. One organization he singled out, the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, published a response defending its record and pointing out that there was no "silver bullet" to address the country's growing needs.
Within weeks, however, the organization announced a charitable drive, and reported that it raised $150,000. Basil N. Mossaidis, the association's executive director, said his group had been helping Greece long before Mr. Pappas's column appeared. But he acknowledged that many Greek-Americans are hesitant to lend a hand.
"You have to address that first," Mr. Mossaidis said. "You have to tell them first this is not a game, we're not just going to point fingers at people and say these fat cats stole our money. This is a humanitarian issue."
The archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church in the United States, Demetrios Trakatellis, also issued an appeal. Churches responded with extra collections during Masses and assembled emergency kits for children and the sick. International Orthodox Christian Charities, the church's relief arm, shipped medical supplies and equipment in April.
In an interview, the archbishop said Greek-Americans were worried about where their donations would go, a concern he called "very serious." He hand-delivered a $500,000 check to the church in Athens several weeks ago to allay those fears.
"We have full transparency and accountability," he said. "The archbishop of Athens is personally offering a report with details about the last dollar sent from here."
The chaotic political situation, as well as humanitarian needs, provided lively debate among the two dozen or so people who gathered at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday for the walk.
They set out, following a bobbing Mylar balloon festooned with blue and white streamers and with "Stand by Greece" printed on one side. Steven Martnishn, Alex and Chris Batistatos's father, pointed out Doric columns along the route, and his wife, Ergini, led the way with an unfurled Greek flag.
They raised about $600 for families on the island of Kefalonia, the Batistatoses' ancestral home. Alex Batistatos admitted it was a small gesture, but hoped it would be an example for others to follow.
"Hopefully there are more things like this going on -- I really don't know," he said. "There's a lot of dialogue, but few organized events. Hopefully things will actually happen, instead of just talking about it."

A Tempting Rationale For Leaving The Euro

Abstract: Monetary union has shackled together nations with vastly different economies, depriving them of an independent monetary policy that can help them through rough times. The main problem is that while leaders eagerly embraced the monetary bond, they rejected its necessary complement: a central budget that would transfer money from successful regions to underperforming ones, as the United States government sends tax dollars collected in Massachusetts to pay for unemployment benefits in Nevada.

Full text: Some two decades ago, when Europe's leaders worked out the details of their grand vision to connect the European Union with a single currency, virtually every economist on this side of the Atlantic -- and most of those on the other -- figured out that the euro would be fatally flawed.
What took economists some time to understand was that Europe's leaders didn't much care what they thought.
"The European Commission did invite economists to present their views. It was a Darwinian process," said Paul De Grauwe, professor of European political economy at the London School of Economics. "I was invited, but when I expressed my doubts I wasn't invited anymore. In the end only the enthusiasts were left."
The single currency served an overriding political objective. Like the single market before, it was conceived primarily as glue to bind Europe more closely together, tie Germany's prosperity to that of its neighbors and prevent a third world war from the Continent, which had brought us two. A few engineering flaws wouldn't be allowed to get in the way of such an important project.
A little over a decade since the first euro bills hit the shops in Madrid and Berlin, the euro's design flaws have pushed much of the European Union into a deep economic pit. And political imperative is again being deployed as a major reason to stick to the common currency. "This enormously important motivation is often underestimated by outsiders," argued the Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, the most sober analyst of Europe's economic maelstrom.
Yet for a project intended to draw Europe together, the euro did surprisingly little to build solidarity. German voters endured a recession two decades ago after bringing in their brethren from the Soviet bloc. They now appear unwilling to spend a pfennig to help the Greeks, Spaniards, Portuguese, Irish or Italians.
Conceived as a tool for integration, the euro could, instead, tear Europe apart.
The longstanding political order in Greece, a country in an economic tailspin and dependent on the International Monetary Fund and its European partners to pay its debts, imploded on May 6. Voters punished the main parties for agreeing to a budget-cutting strategy that has contributed to an unemployment rate above 20 percent. With no party able to form a governing coalition, Greece is headed to new elections in June.
Turmoil -- the economies of about half the countries in the euro area are shrinking -- has spawned political crises across the Continent. Eleven euro area governments have fallen in just over a year. Extremist political parties are on the rise. Almost two-thirds of the population in euro zone countries still support the euro, according to the latest Eurobarometer poll taken last November.
Yet angry nationalism and mistrust are overpowering Europe's sense of common purpose. Trust in the European Union fell to a low of 34 percent in November from 48 percent in the fall of 2009.
"The paradox would be that the monetary union that was supposed to be a steppingstone to more union becomes a steppingstone to less union," said Mr. De Grauwe, who is also a former member of the Belgian parliament.
Social upheaval across the euro area suggests that it may be time to call it quits and try to work out an orderly process to re-establish national currencies throughout the bloc.
Europe would be in much better shape if the euro didn't exist and each member country had its own currency. Monetary union has shackled together nations with vastly different economies, depriving them of an independent monetary policy that can help them through rough times. The interest rate and exchange rate that serve Germany also have to serve Spain, though that country has more than four times Germany's joblessness.
The main problem is that while leaders eagerly embraced the monetary bond, they rejected its necessary complement: a central budget that would transfer money from successful regions to underperforming ones, as the United States government sends tax dollars collected in Massachusetts to pay for unemployment benefits in Nevada.
The euro fed the illusion that Greece, Spain and Italy were as creditworthy as Germany or the Netherlands, propelling a decade-long credit boom in Europe's less-developed periphery. And it was spectacularly ill-designed to deal with the shock when capital flows to those nations suddenly stopped. Weak countries not only had to rely on their own devices; they had to do so without a currency or a monetary policy of their own to absorb the blow.
There was no European budget to help Madrid out when its housing market and economy imploded and its unemployment rolls surged. Spain had no central bank to flood the economy with pesetas -- to backstop its banks and to stimulate lending and investing.
The European Central Bank helped some by letting Spanish banks post government bonds as collateral for cheap three-year loans, providing some relief to the banks and leading to lower interest rates. But the central bank and its German paymasters have so far been unwilling to countenance a credit boom and higher inflation in Germany to juice economic growth in its neighbors.
Devaluation to strengthen Spain's exports was, of course, out of the question. The only thing Spain could do was borrow to pay for unemployment insurance and other safety net programs that have exploded even as tax revenue shrank. When investors would lend it no more at bearable rates, it had to slash public spending, digging itself a bigger economic hole.
Germany's leaders insist the solution for Spain and other sickly countries is to devalue "internally" to regain competitiveness, essentially, slashing wages to reduce labor costs. Yet it is unlikely that a democracy could sustain such an adjustment for long. Labor costs in Spain are still rising though almost one in four workers does not have a job. How deep would unemployment have to be for wages to start to fall?
Against the punishing austerity demanded by Germany, an exit from the euro -- followed by a sharp devaluation -- might not seem too bad a proposition.
This has been done before. In 2001 Argentina dropped the peso's decade-long peg to the dollar, virtually wiping out the savings of Argentine citizens. Banks went belly-up. Real wages plummeted. Foreign investment dried up after the country defaulted on its foreign debt, and the government had to slash spending to live within its means. But though the Argentine economy contracted 11 percent in 2002, it bounced back sharply to experience a decade of rapid exports and stellar growth.
Despite its flaws, there is one powerful reason to stick to the euro that even some of the most skeptical economists accept: the prospect of breaking away from the euro is very scary. It's difficult to forecast how such a dissolution would unfold. There is, in fact, no legal way to leave. And it would be searingly painful for many countries.
Greece probably couldn't be surgically excised. Once investors realized that countries could leave the euro, interest rates would soar on the next most likely candidates. There would be a huge capital flight out of peripheral countries into Germany, as savers tried to protect their euros from potential devaluation.
Even with a well-coordinated separation, households and firms with debts across borders could go bankrupt if their wages and savings were devalued but their debt remained the same. Banks in a number of countries might collapse. Companies could abruptly lose access to funds. It would probably require long bank holidays to prevent capital flight and allow for new currencies to be minted. A messy divorce could reverberate through the streets and political systems.
Still, the risks of unscrambling the monetary union omelet must be evaluated alongside the risks of leaving it scrambled.
On the campaign trail this year, Marine Le Pen, presidential candidate for France's far-right National Front party, referred to the European Union as the "European Soviet Union," which was ruining France's economy and "imposing on us a model of living which is not our own." She proposed to "get out of Europe." In the first round of elections, the National Front got a record 18 percent of the vote.
For the sake of European unity, letting go of the euro may be the better option.

Abstract: "Even if the euro zone as a whole narrowly escaped technical recession in the first quarter, there is no sign of a strong, sustained economic bounceback on the horizon," Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. Germany has benefited from the European Central Bank's low lending rate of 1 percent, a benchmark that is set with the euro zone as a whole in mind but is probably too low for German conditions.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- It's way too early to call a turning point. But while Greeks were marching in the streets against austerity, their economy may actually have been growing for the first time since 2009. That surprise news resided deep within first-quarter economic data for Europe released Tuesday that also showed, to everyone's mild relief, that the euro zone as a whole has still avoided slipping into a regional recession.
Greece, where the economy has been in free fall, "grew" only after adjusting for seasonal effects -- a calculation made by economists at Barclays. The Greek government did not provide an official figure.
"I cannot imagine this is really a new spring," said Fabio Fois, European economist at Barclays in London. Nor is news of technically defined growth likely to offer much consolation to ordinary Greeks. Not while one in five people in the work force are out of work.
Still, along with growth in Germany that was much better than expected, the data provided mild respite from the gloom that has pervaded Europe in recent days. Despite the figures, major stock indexes retreated Tuesday in Europe, and Spanish and Italian bond yields, or interest rates, edged up on news that those two countries' economies continued to contract. Indexes in the United States, however, were modestly higher in afternoon trading.
The euro zone, by not slipping into recession in the first quarter of 2012, ran counter to expectations. Growth in the region was zero compared to the previous quarter, according to the figures, from Eurostat, the E.U. statistics agency.
"In the current context, zero growth in the euro zone in the first quarter is relatively good news," Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in a statement. "It suggests that the economy is not falling off a cliff under the burden of fiscal austerity."
In the fourth quarter of 2011, gross domestic product in the euro zone had declined 0.3 percent. A second consecutive quarter of decline would have met the general definition of a recession.
Germany's economy expanded 0.5 percent in the first quarter, more than analysts expected. But France did not grow at all, Spain's economy slipped 0.3 percent, and Italy experienced a 0.8 percent decline in output.
The divergence in the numbers, which officials adjusted for seasonal effects, showed that there remains a wide gulf between Northern and Southern Europe.
"Even if the euro zone as a whole narrowly escaped technical recession in the first quarter, there is no sign of a strong, sustained economic bounceback on the horizon," Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. The data, he said, "offers scant consolation for the peripheral economies, where the recession is deepening and whose economic fortunes look bleak at best and downright depressing at worst."
The growth numbers arrived hours before Francois Hollande, newly sworn in as French president, traveled to Berlin, where he was to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel. She was likely to see the data as vindication of her position that growth must be the product of sound government finances and economic restructuring, not the stimulus advocated by Mr. Hollande.
The Greek economy has shrunk by more than a quarter since 2008, and continued to plunge at the beginning of the year without adjusting for seasonal effects, although at a slower velocity. While Greece's official statisticians do not make such adjustments, statistics agencies in most countries adjust quarterly data to reflect the fact that economic activity typically picks up at the end of a year and slows at the beginning of the next.
Another euro zone trouble spot, Portugal, also performed less dismally than expected. Its economy shrank 0.1 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter, compared with a 1 percent decline that analysts had forecast.
Portugal, which is seen as having done more than Greece to improve economic performance, may have benefited from stronger exports. But Mr. Fois of Barclays said a recovery probably remains distant.
"Expecting sustained growth in the short term would be a bit optimistic," he said. "You still have a lot of fiscal austerity to come through."
Germany has benefited from the European Central Bank's low lending rate of 1 percent, a benchmark that is set with the euro zone as a whole in mind but is probably too low for German conditions.
While credit is tight in much of Europe, it is still available in Germany at inexpensive rates that have pushed up real estate prices in urban areas. German wages are also likely to rise as companies have trouble finding skilled workers, fueling inflation which is already above the official target of about 2 percent.
Higher wages and inflation in Germany are likely to trouble some policy makers and segments of the German public, but may be good news for other countries in Europe. They would have an easier time competing with Germany for investment, while higher wages might increase German demand for their products.
"Robust German demand is essential to help offset falling domestic activity in the peripheral countries," Ms. Diron said.
Germany depends on trade with other euro zone members, and in coming months there is a risk its economy may suffer from problems in countries like Italy and Spain.
"The highly competitive German economy has not entered a recession," Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. "Still, it is unlikely to expand at the same pace in the next few months."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: First used in 2005, it is a more timely and accurate way to ask questions that used to be posed on the "long form" decennial census.

Full text: The Web site of Representative Daniel Webster, Republican of Florida, instructs visitors to click on a link for "Census data for the 8th district" to learn about the area's economy, businesses, income, employment, homeownership and other important features. And yet, on Wednesday, Mr. Webster declared that the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- the source for much of that data -- is an unconstitutional breach of privacy.
He then proposed an amendment to the bureau's 2013 appropriation to forbid any money from being spent on the survey; the amendment was passed by most House Republicans and four Democrats.
This is know-nothingness at a new level. The American Community Survey, which gives annual updates of Americans' economic, demographic and housing characteristics, is widely considered a vital tool for business decision makers. It is also a bipartisan creation. First used in 2005, it is a more timely and accurate way to ask questions that used to be posed on the "long form" decennial census. Indeed, in 2006, Republican Congressional staff members participated in efforts to promote the survey under the slogan "Better Data for Better Decisions."
But that was then. Last week, 224 Republicans and 23 Democrats voted to cut the bureau's 2013 budget to $855 million, $88 million below last year's total and $116 million below the White House's request. On top of ending the American Community Survey, the truncated budget would cripple the Economic Census -- a survey of nearly five million businesses, conducted every five years, that is the foundation for economywide statistics on growth, inflation, productivity and consumer spending.
The survey cuts would reduce understanding about what is happening in the economy and the effectiveness of business and government policy. Lack of information can lead to paralysis and costly mistakes. When Republicans proposed similar cuts last year, even the deficit hawks at the United States Chamber of Commerce opposed them.
The White House is opposed to the cuts and the Senate will soon have a chance to reject them when it takes up the appropriation bill. It should.

Analysts Expect China To Broaden Stimulus

Full text: SHANGHAI -- A decision by China's central bank to loosen monetary policy is not an antidote by itself for emerging weakness in the Chinese economy and is likely to be just the start of a broader program of economic stimulus by the government, economists said on Sunday.
"We expect more aggressive delivery of policy stimulus via quantitative easing, substantial tax breaks, fiscal spending and investment deregulation in the coming months to ensure a soft landing," Qu Hongbin, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, said in a report.
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said on its Web site late Saturday that effective this Friday, it would reduce the share of deposits that banks must set aside as reserves by a half percentage point. The reduction in the so-called reserve ratio means that banks will have more cash available to lend.
But economists were skeptical about the effectiveness of allowing banks to lend more money at a time when many businesses do not necessarily see a lot of attractive opportunities that would prompt them to borrow and invest. At the same time, a steep decline in land prices and apartment prices, engineered by the government to improve the affordability of housing, has left many companies without enough collateral to post in order to qualify for loans.
Interbank lending rates have been sinking in China, a sign that the banks have plenty of spare cash even without being told that they can hold smaller reserves.
The cut in the reserve ratio should be seen "more as a signaling device used by the government to show its willingness to loosen policy in light of the significant weakening in activity growth in April," Yu Song, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a research report.
China's General Administration of Customs announced on Thursday that growth in imports had come to a virtual halt in April compared with a year earlier. The development was unexpected in an economy that depends heavily on imported raw materials as well as on imported computer chips, sophisticated factory tools and other high-end imports for its industrialization.
China's exports also grew half as fast as expected in April.
Figures released on Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing showed that industrial production, fixed-asset investment and retail sales in April all increased somewhat more slowly than expected. Separate figures from the central bank also showed weak growth in bank lending.
The reduction in the reserve ratio, the third in the last six months, means that large banks will be required to hold reserves equal to 20 percent of deposits instead of 20.5 percent.
China has considerable room for further reductions if its economy shows further weakness. While it is hard to compare reserve ratios across national borders because of differences in how they are calculated, by some calculations Chinese ratios are now roughly twice those found in the West.
China had raised the reserve ratio six times through last July in a bid to contain inflation. Inflation peaked in July at 6.5 percent.
Consumer prices now appear more under control, rising 3.4 percent in April from a year earlier -- below the level of 4 percent that the government describes as unacceptable and requiring action.
The Chinese government has been uncharacteristically slow to respond to the slowdown in the economy this spring; the two previous reserve ratio reductions were announced in late November and mid-February. The delay has fostered concern among some economists that factional rivalries in China, and the suspension of a Politburo member, Bo Xilai, may be distracting Chinese leaders from day-to-day management of the economy.
Unlike in the United States, the central bank in China is completely controlled by the country's political leaders, who make the final decisions on monetary policy.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
ADA, Ohio -- Kelsey Griffith graduates on Sunday from Ohio Northern University. To start paying off her $120,000 in student debt, she is already working two restaurant jobs and will soon give up her apartment here to live with her parents. Her mother, who co-signed on the loans, is taking out a life insurance policy on her daughter.
"If anything ever happened, God forbid, that is my debt also," said Ms. Griffith's mother, Marlene Griffith.
Ms. Griffith, 23, wouldn't seem a perfect financial fit for a college that costs nearly $50,000 a year. Her father, a paramedic, and mother, a preschool teacher, have modest incomes, and she has four sisters. But when she visited Ohio Northern, she was won over by faculty and admissions staff members who urge students to pursue their dreams rather than obsess on the sticker price.
"As an 18-year-old, it sounded like a good fit to me, and the school really sold it," said Ms. Griffith, a marketing major. "I knew a private school would cost a lot of money. But when I graduate, I'm going to owe like $900 a month. No one told me that."
With more than $1 trillion in student loans outstanding in this country, crippling debt is no longer confined to dropouts from for-profit colleges or graduate students who owe on many years of education, some of the overextended debtors in years past. As prices soar, a college degree statistically remains a good lifetime investment, but it often comes with an unprecedented financial burden.
About two-thirds of bachelor's degree recipients borrow money to attend college, either from the government or private lenders, according to a Department of Education survey of 2007-8 graduates; the total number of borrowers is most likely higher since the survey does not track borrowing from family members.
By contrast, 45 percent of 1992-93 graduates borrowed money; that survey included family borrowing as well as government and private loans.
For all borrowers, the average debt in 2011 was $23,300, with 10 percent owing more than $54,000 and 3 percent more than $100,000, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports. Average debt for bachelor degree graduates who took out loans ranges from under $10,000 at elite schools like Princeton and Williams College, which have plenty of wealthy students and enormous endowments, to nearly $50,000 at some private colleges with less affluent students and less financial aid.
Here at Ohio Northern, recent graduates with bachelor's degrees are among the most indebted of any college in the country, and statewide, graduates of Ohio's more than 200 colleges and universities carry some of the highest average debt in the country, according to data reported by the colleges and compiled by an educational advocacy group. The current balance of federal student loans nationwide is $902 billion, with an additional $140 billion or so in private student loans.
"If one is not thinking about where this is headed over the next two or three years, you are just completely missing the warning signs," said Rajeev V. Date, deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal watchdog created after the financial crisis.
Mr. Date likened excessive student borrowing to risky mortgages. And as with the housing bubble before the economic collapse, the extraordinary growth in student loans has caught many by surprise. But its roots are in fact deep, and the cast of contributing characters -- including college marketing officers, state lawmakers wielding a budget ax and wide-eyed students and families -- has been enabled by a basic economic dynamic: an insatiable demand for a college education, at almost any price, and plenty of easy-to-secure loans, primarily from the federal government.
The roots of the borrowing binge date to the 1980s, when tuition for four-year colleges began to rise faster than family incomes. In the 1990s, for-profit colleges boomed by spending heavily on marketing and recruiting. Despite some ethical lapses and fraud, enrollment more than doubled in the last decade and Wall Street swooned over the stocks. Roughly 11 percent of college students now attend for-profit colleges, and they receive about a quarter of federal student loans and grants.
In the last decade, even as enrollment at state colleges and universities has grown, some states have cut spending for higher education and many others have not allocated enough money to keep pace with the growing student body. That trend has accelerated as state budgets have shrunk because of the recent financial crisis and the unpopularity of tax increases.
Nationally, state and local spending per college student, adjusted for inflation, reached a 25-year low this year, jeopardizing the long-held conviction that state-subsidized higher education is an affordable steppingstone for the lower and middle classes. All the while, the cost of tuition and fees has continued to increase faster than the rate of inflation, faster even than medical spending. If the trends continue through 2016, the average cost of a public college will have more than doubled in just 15 years, according to the Department of Education.
Much like the mortgage brokers who promised pain-free borrowing to homeowners just a few years back, many colleges don't offer warnings about student debt in the glossy brochures and pitch letters mailed to prospective students. Instead, reading from the same handbook as for-profit colleges, they urge students not to worry about the costs. That's because most students don't pay full price.
Even discounted, the price is beyond the means of many. Yet too often, students and their parents listen without question.
"I readily admit it," said E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State University, who has also served as president of Vanderbilt and Brown, among others. "I didn't think a lot about costs. I do not think we have given significant thought to the impact of college costs on families."
Of course, economists and many parents say that the only thing worse than graduating with lots of debt is not going to college at all, since study after study has shown that graduates earn more over a lifetime. And most college students in the United States manage to eventually pay back their student loans.
To that end, the Obama administration has given out more grants and loans than ever to more and more college students with the goal of making the United States first among developed nations in college completion. The balance of federal student loans has grown by more than 60 percent in the last five years. And in 2007, Congress made sure the interest rates on many of those loans were well below commercial rates; currently, a debate over keeping those lower rates from doubling in July is roiling lawmakers.
But even if student loans are what many economists consider "good debt," an increasing number of borrowers are struggling to pay them off, and in the process becoming mired in a financial morass.
Education Department data shows that payments are being made on just 38 percent of the balance of federal student loans, down from 46 percent five years ago. The balances are unpaid because the borrowers are still in school, have postponed payments or have stopped paying altogether.
Nearly one in 10 borrowers who started repayment in 2009 defaulted within two years, the latest data available -- about double the rate in 2005.
Economists do not predict a collapse of the student loan system, which would, in essence, mean wholesale default. And if there were one, it would be unlikely to ripple through the economy with the same devastating impact as the mortgage crash. Though now larger than credit card and other consumer debt, the student loan balance remains smaller than the mortgage market, and most student loans are issued by the federal government, meaning banks wouldn't be affected as much.
Still, economists say, growing student debt hangs over the economic recovery like a dark cloud for a generation of college graduates and indebted dropouts. A study of recent college graduates conducted by researchers at Rutgers University and released last week found that 40 percent of the participants had delayed making a major purchase, like a home or car, because of college debt, while slightly more than a quarter had put off continuing their education or had moved in with relatives to save money. Roughly half of the surveyed graduates had a full-time job.
"I'll be paying this forever," said Chelsea Grove, 24, who dropped out of Bowling Green State University and owes $70,000 in student loans. She is working three jobs to pay her $510 monthly obligation and has no intention of going back.
"For me to finish it would mean borrowing more money," she said. "It makes me puke to think about borrowing more money."
'Nothing Is Free'
Christina Hagan is an Ohio lawmaker who says students need to understand that attending college is not an entitlement. Last year, she was appointed to fill a seat once occupied by her father in the Ohio House of Representatives.
Ms. Hagan, 23, is also a college student.
She will graduate shortly from Malone University, an evangelical college in Canton, Ohio, with more than $65,000 in student debt (among her loans is one from a farm lender; she had to plant a garden to become eligible). Though she makes $60,000 a year as a state representative, she plans to begin waiting tables in the next few weeks at Don Pancho's, a Mexican restaurant in Alliance, Ohio, to help pay down her student loans and credit cards. She pays about $1,000 a month.
"I placed a priority on a Christian education and I didn't think about the debt," said Ms. Hagan, who says she takes responsibility for her debt and others should do the same. "I need my generation to understand that nothing is free."
While Ms. Hagan's perspective is unusually personal, it is a common view among lawmakers here in Ohio and many states. Across the country, elected officials are increasingly unwilling to assume a large share of the bill for public colleges and universities, which seven out of 10 students attend. The change has contributed to sharp increases in tuition and more fund-raising -- and the need for students to borrow more.
From 2001 to 2011, state and local financing per student declined by 24 percent nationally. Over the same period, tuition and fees at state schools increased 72 percent, compared with 29 percent for nonprofit private institutions, according to the College Board. Many of the cuts were the result of a sluggish economy that reduced tax revenue, but the sharp drop in per-student spending also reflects a change: an increasing number of lawmakers voted to transfer more of the financial burden of college from taxpayers to students and their families. (Local funding is a small percentage of the total, and mostly goes to community colleges.)
"To say that tuition goes up because the state doesn't pay enough money, well, that is the taxpayers' money," said Ohio's governor, John Kasich, a Republican elected in 2010 whose budget included cuts to higher education because of the end of federal stimulus money.
Donald E. Heller, an expert on higher education, said elected officials in both parties had figured out that colleges were one of the few parts of state government that could raise money on their own. If lawmakers cut state financing, the schools could make it up by raising tuition.
"It lets legislators off the hook and makes universities look like the bad guy," said Mr. Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University.
Ohio's flagship university, Ohio State, now receives 7 percent of its budget from the state, down from 15 percent a decade ago and 25 percent in 1990. The price of tuition and fees since 2002 increased about 60 percent in today's dollars.
The consequence? Three out of five undergraduates at Ohio State take out loans, and the average debt is $24,840.
If any state is representative of the role government has played in the growth of student debt, Ohio makes a good candidate. While other states have made steeper cuts in recent years because of the recession, Ohio has been chipping away at it far longer. It now ranks sixth from the bottom in financing per student, at $4,480.
In the late 1970s, higher education in Ohio accounted for 17 percent of the state's expenditures. Now it is 11 percent. By contrast, prisons were 4 percent of the state's budget in the late 1970s; now they account for 8 percent. Federal mandates and court orders have compelled lawmakers to spend more money on Medicaid and primary education, too. Legislators could designate a greater percentage of the budget to higher education by raising taxes, but there is no appetite for that. Governor Kasich has signed a pledge not to raise taxes, as have about two dozen legislators.
Some Ohio elected officials say state colleges and universities have brought the debt problem upon themselves.
They suggest, for example, that state schools are bloated, antiquated and don't do a good enough job graduating students or training them for the work force. Some complain about the salaries of football coaches and college presidents, like Mr. Gee, who has a compensation package of $2 million a year as president of Ohio State. Mr. Kasich questions why all state universities need to offer every major, like journalism or engineering, instead of parceling those programs among the schools.
"It's not just inefficiencies," said the governor, an Ohio State graduate. "It's, 'I want to be the best in this.' It's duplication of resources. It's a sweeping change that is needed across academia."
There is an ideological and political tug of war as well. State Representative John Patrick Carney, a Democrat, said if legislators were serious about financing higher education they could find a way, like eliminating tax breaks for corporations. He noted that even as funds for higher education were being reduced, Mr. Kasich and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the state's estate tax, which will cost the state an estimated $72 million a year.
Mr. Carney said he worried that the constant tuition and fee increases would limit access to college for lower- and middle-income students -- a founding principle of public universities. At least two-thirds of Ohio lawmakers attended public colleges or universities, including Mr. Carney, an Ohio State graduate.
"It's hard to say it's affordable when students leave with that much debt," he said.
The new financial reality for colleges has left administrators scrambling to maintain academic quality and all-important rankings with diminished state resources. That puts an even higher premium on attracting top-tier students -- the rankings depend on them -- and playing down the burdens of college debt.
Buy Now, Pay Later
At Ohio State, "college can be a reality for everyone, no matter your income or background," its Web site says, while at Ohio Northern, future students are urged to get over the "sticker shock," and focus instead on "return on investment."
Oberlin College's Web site tells prospective students that its financial aid policy is simple: "We meet the full demonstrated financial need of every admitted student." The University of Dayton declares itself "one of the most affordable private Catholic schools in the country" and a "lifetime investment, appreciating over the course of time."
The costs for these colleges? At Ohio State, about $25,000 a year for tuition and fees, room and board and living expenses; at Ohio Northern, about $48,000; at Oberlin $60,000; and at Dayton $48,000.
Colleges are aggressively recruiting students, regardless of their financial circumstances. In admissions offices across the country, professional marketing companies and talented alumni are being enlisted to devise catchy slogans, build enticing Web sites -- and essentially outpitch the competition.
Affordability, or at least promising that the finances will work out, is increasingly a piece of the pitch.
Almost all colleges promote the money they give away in financial aid, though generally only the most elite schools -- like Oberlin in Ohio -- are able to provide enough in grants and scholarships to significantly keep student debt down.
College marketing firms encourage school officials to focus on the value of the education rather than the cost. For example, an article on the cover of Enrollment Management, a newsletter aimed at college admissions officials, urged writers of admissions materials to "avoid bad words like 'cost,' 'pay' (try 'and you get all this for...'), 'contract' and 'buy' in your piece and avoid the conflicting feelings they generate."
"There are direct marketing 'words' that can make or break your piece," the article, published in 2009, added.
The financial aid award letters to newly admitted students can also be a minefield for students and parents sorting through the true costs of a school. Some are written in a manner that suggests the student is getting a great deal, by blurring the line between grants and loans or not making clear how much the student may have to pay or borrow.
A quick reading of an award letter from Drexel University, received by a New Jersey applicant in March, implied that the student would owe nothing and might actually walk away with money. The expected payment to Drexel, it said in highlighted bright yellow, would be a negative $5,900. The calculation presumed grants, student loans and a $42,120 loan taken out by the parents toward the $63,620 estimated cost -- figures also included in the letter but not highlighted.
A Drexel spokeswoman said that the letter was not misleading and that it had not received complaints about it. But for many students, the financial realities of attending a college conflict with the optimistic rhetoric of campus tours, financial aid materials and salesmanlike admissions officers. And many of them don't realize it until it is much too late.
"The overall message was, 'It's doable and normal to go into that much debt,' " said Jillian Potter, 23, who grew up in Ohio and attended Anderson University, a nonprofit private Christian school in neighboring Indiana.
Ms. Potter figured she would have to borrow about $10,000 a year. But the tuition increased every year, and because she didn't declare a major until her junior year, she needed five years to graduate.
A social worker, she now owes $80,000. "I try not to think about it because it's really depressing," she said.
For Evan Frank, Ashland University, a nonprofit private school in Ohio, dangled the possibility of a sports scholarship, he said. Mr. Frank liked the campus and was promised a spot on the football team. His high school guidance counselor encouraged him and so did his family, though they couldn't help financially.
Ashland offered to knock about $12,000 off the costs, and when Mr. Frank called financial aid to ask for more, they suggested he keep applying for scholarships. No one at the time said to consider a cheaper alternative, he said. Ashland costs about $42,000 a year.
"Maybe at the time I was a little naive," said Mr. Frank, 22, a senior who owes $80,000. "Everyone was like, 'You can get grants, you can always get loans.' I wanted to play football really bad, and I hoped eventually I'd get a football scholarship."
Many students and parents don't have a firm understanding of the cost of attending college, or the amount of debt they will incur. And most colleges aren't much help. Student debt is not their primary concern in the end -- the loan money usually gets deposited directly with the colleges, so they get paid either way -- and the main job of the admissions staff, after all, is to admit students.
"Ultimately with everything in financial aid, from start to finish, the student and their family need to take responsibility and monitor their aid," Melanie K. Weaver, the director of financial aid at Ohio Northern, said in an e-mail. "With over 3,000 on aid it is difficult for our office of 10 staff members to stay on top of every student."
While there are standardized disclosure forms for buying a car or a house or even signing up for a credit card, no such thing exists for colleges.
Instead, college pricing is complicated by constant tuition increases, a vast array of grants and loans and a financial-aid system that discounts tuition for most students based on opaque formulas. "No one has a vested interest in simplifying the process but families," said Mark Kantrowitz, the founder of FinAid, a Web site devoted to explaining college financial aid. "It obscures the price of a college and makes the choice of college not depend on the price but other factors."
Federal regulations require financial aid officers to counsel students when they take federal loans and again when they graduate. The counseling typically consists of making sure they complete a brief online course about student loans and repayment.
Beyond that, it is up to the college to decide what, if any, debt counseling to provide. With a few exceptions, their track record is not very good, according to students and experts on college finance. Until Congress banned the practice a few years ago, some colleges outsourced counseling to private lenders, the same ones offering loans. Now many colleges do little beyond what is required by law, experts say.
Ohio Northern administrators said they were trying to come to grips with the growing debt of their students -- an average of $48,886 for borrowers -- at a time when enrollment is down slightly, as it is at many of the small nonprofit private colleges with which it competes.
Financial aid officers have not yet told any prospective students that they cannot afford to attend, school administrators said. But Ms. Weaver, the director of financial aid, noted, "We are having that conversation."
Mr. Frank, at Ashland, said he did eventually receive financial counseling -- on the day he arrived for football camp as a freshman.
A financial aid adviser suggested Mr. Frank rethink his decision to attend "because the way it's looking you are going to be looking at a high amount of debt if you are going to stay here," he recalled. "I wanted to play football really bad, and I was already moving in for camp," he said. "I wasn't going to turn back then." He never did receive a football scholarship.
Officials at both Ashland and Anderson Universities said they provided thorough financial aid counseling to incoming students.
Ms. Griffith, the Ohio Northern student whose mother is taking out life insurance on her -- a precaution that might be unnecessary because some lenders forgive loans upon death -- said she wished someone had been frank with her about the consequences of taking on so much debt. (She also received grants.) She is searching for a full-time job in marketing, her major, while earning $225 a week at two restaurants.
"When I was young, I wanted to get out of Putnam County, get out of the cornfields," said Ms. Griffith, who is from rural Ottawa, Ohio. "I would love to get away. But it would be more financially responsible if I got a job near here and lived with my parents."
The Shadow of For-Profits
Wanda McGill has stopped opening her student loan bills.
She isn't sure how much debt she has accumulated, though she thinks it's about $100,000. But Ms. McGill, a 38-year-old single mother, knows for sure she cannot pay it.
Ms. McGill said she dropped out of DeVry University, a for-profit college with a branch in Columbus, two years ago after she ran out of money -- even with the loans. She now makes $8.50 an hour working for an employment training center in Florida.
"I was promised the world and was given a garbage dump to clean up," she wrote in an online complaint at consumeraffairs.com. "Like my life was not already screwed up with welfare and all."
The student loan crisis has spread from for-profit colleges to more traditional institutions, but the for-profit colleges continue to represent the worst of the problem. Students complain that they were misled about the costs of education and that their job prospects were exaggerated. Government reports and lawsuits have accused some for-profit colleges of outright fraud, including doctoring attendance records or peddling near-worthless degrees.
The result? Students at for-profit colleges are twice as likely as other students to default on their student loans. Moreover, among students seeking a bachelor's degree, only 22 percent succeed within six years, compared with 65 percent at nonprofit private schools and 55 percent at public institutions. (For-profit students, however, tend to do better at obtaining associate degrees and certificates.)
Leaders of the for-profit industry defended themselves, saying they were providing higher education for lower-class students that traditional colleges had left behind. "The reality is the type of students we attract have no other opportunity," said Steven Gunderson, head of a leading trade organization. "We are the ones that provide a path to the middle class."
Still, the outcomes for many students have been so poor -- and the reported abuses and misdeeds by the colleges so abundant -- that the for-profit colleges have played another role in the worsening debt problem: drawing attention away from nonprofit private and public colleges and universities, which have been slow to face public scrutiny.
The situation has parallels to the mortgage crisis of a few years ago, said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The for-profit colleges are like the subprime lenders -- attracting the limelight because they represent the worst of the problem, he said.
"Mainstream higher ed can really self-righteously look at the big problem out there and say, 'The problem lies with the other guy,' " Mr. Nassirian said. "If you are looking at highway robbery and raping and pillaging, that is true. But there are all kinds of unfortunate practices in traditional higher education that are equally as problematic that are reaching the crisis point." Last year, Congress approved regulations to curb abuses in the for-profit sector, but there has been less focus on establishing broader rules for traditional colleges and universities.
The Obama administration has tried to make college pricing easier to understand; as of last year, colleges and universities were required to post calculators on their Web sites that explain the net price after grants and loans, but critics say they can be confusing, misleading or hard to find. And the administration has proposed that colleges be required to offer a "shopping sheet" to make it easier for families to measure the true costs and benefits.
"We just have to get them much more information," said Education Secretary Arne Duncan. "If you're going to college, you need to know not what the first year costs. You need to know what it's going to cost for the long haul."
But even with more information, students and their parents seem willing to pay the ever-escalating price of a college degree, which remains the key rung up the ladder of economic mobility.
Denise Entingh, 44, dropped out after two quarters at Columbus State Community College because she didn't want to wait any longer to get into the nursing program. So she signed on at the Hondros School of Nursing, a for-profit college that advertises "No Waitlist!" on a billboard a few blocks from Columbus State.
Ms. Entingh said she expected to borrow about $45,000 to get a bachelor's degree in nursing from Hondros, which costs more than three times as much as Columbus State.
"It scares the hell out of me," she said of her debt load. "But I think it will be all right. I'm not going to worry about it right now. I had to take that plunge."
Degrees of Debt: This series examines the implications of soaring college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families.
Correction: May 16, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about college students' debt, and an accompanying chart, misstated the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed money for their education from the government, private lenders, or with the help of family members.
The article stated that the percentage had increased to 94 percent from 45 percent in 1993, based on data from the Department of Education, whose officials reviewed The Times's methodology before publication. While the percentage of students borrowing for college has indeed increased significantly, the 94 percent figure reflected an inaccurate interpretation of the data, which came from a survey of 2007-2008 graduates.
That survey showed that 66 percent of bachelor's degree recipients borrowed from the government or private lenders; an additional percentage of graduates had family members who borrowed on their behalf or who lent them money, meaning that the total percentage with college borrowing increased to more than 66 percent. But the precise figure isn't known because the department survey did not address borrowing involving family members. (The earlier survey, of 1992-1993 graduates, found that just 45 percent of graduates had borrowed from all sources, including from family members.)

Abstract: Average debt for bachelor degree graduates who took out loans ranges from under $10,000 at elite schools like Princeton and Williams College, which have plenty of wealthy students and enormous endowments, to nearly $50,000 at some private colleges with less affluent students and less financial aid.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
ADA, Ohio -- Kelsey Griffith graduates on Sunday from Ohio Northern University. To start paying off her $120,000 in student debt, she is already working two restaurant jobs and will soon give up her apartment here to live with her parents. Her mother, who co-signed on the loans, is taking out a life insurance policy on her daughter.
"If anything ever happened, God forbid, that is my debt also," said Ms. Griffith's mother, Marlene Griffith.
Ms. Griffith, 23, wouldn't seem a perfect financial fit for a college that costs nearly $50,000 a year. Her father, a paramedic, and mother, a preschool teacher, have modest incomes, and she has four sisters. But when she visited Ohio Northern, she was won over by faculty and admissions staff members who urge students to pursue their dreams rather than obsess on the sticker price.
"As an 18-year-old, it sounded like a good fit to me, and the school really sold it," said Ms. Griffith, a marketing major. "I knew a private school would cost a lot of money. But when I graduate, I'm going to owe like $900 a month. No one told me that."
With more than $1 trillion in student loans outstanding in this country, crippling debt is no longer confined to dropouts from for-profit colleges or graduate students who owe on many years of education, some of the overextended debtors in years past. Now nearly everyone pursuing a bachelor's degree is borrowing. As prices soar, a college degree statistically remains a good lifetime investment, but it often comes with an unprecedented financial burden.
About two-thirds of bachelor's degree recipients borrow money to attend college, either from the government or private lenders, according to a Department of Education survey of 2007-8 graduates; the total number of borrowers is most likely higher since the survey does not track borrowing from family members.
By contrast, 45 percent of 1992-93 graduates borrowed money; that survey included family borrowing as well as government and private loans.
For all borrowers, the average debt in 2011 was $23,300, with 10 percent owing more than $54,000 and 3 percent more than $100,000, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports. Average debt for bachelor degree graduates who took out loans ranges from under $10,000 at elite schools like Princeton and Williams College, which have plenty of wealthy students and enormous endowments, to nearly $50,000 at some private colleges with less affluent students and less financial aid.
Here at Ohio Northern, recent graduates with bachelor's degrees are among the most indebted of any college in the country, and statewide, graduates of Ohio's more than 200 colleges and universities carry some of the highest average debt in the country, according to data reported by the colleges and compiled by an educational advocacy group. The current balance of federal student loans nationwide is $902 billion, with an additional $140 billion or so in private student loans.
"If one is not thinking about where this is headed over the next two or three years, you are just completely missing the warning signs," said Rajeev V. Date, deputy director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal watchdog created after the financial crisis.
Mr. Date likened excessive student borrowing to risky mortgages. And as with the housing bubble before the economic collapse, the extraordinary growth in student loans has caught many by surprise. But its roots are in fact deep, and the cast of contributing characters -- including college marketing officers, state lawmakers wielding a budget ax and wide-eyed students and families -- has been enabled by a basic economic dynamic: an insatiable demand for a college education, at almost any price, and plenty of easy-to-secure loans, primarily from the federal government.
The roots of the borrowing binge date to the 1980s, when tuition for four-year colleges began to rise faster than family incomes. In the 1990s, for-profit colleges boomed by spending heavily on marketing and recruiting. Despite some ethical lapses and fraud, enrollment more than doubled in the last decade and Wall Street swooned over the stocks. Roughly 11 percent of college students now attend for-profit colleges, and they receive about a quarter of federal student loans and grants.
In the last decade, even as enrollment at state colleges and universities has grown, some states have cut spending for higher education and many others have not allocated enough money to keep pace with the growing student body. That trend has accelerated as state budgets have shrunk because of the recent financial crisis and the unpopularity of tax increases.
Nationally, state and local spending per college student, adjusted for inflation, reached a 25-year low this year, jeopardizing the long-held conviction that state-subsidized higher education is an affordable steppingstone for the lower and middle classes. All the while, the cost of tuition and fees has continued to increase faster than the rate of inflation, faster even than medical spending. If the trends continue through 2016, the average cost of a public college will have more than doubled in just 15 years, according to the Department of Education.
Much like the mortgage brokers who promised pain-free borrowing to homeowners just a few years back, many colleges don't offer warnings about student debt in the glossy brochures and pitch letters mailed to prospective students. Instead, reading from the same handbook as for-profit colleges, they urge students not to worry about the costs. That's because most students don't pay full price.
Even discounted, the price is beyond the means of many. Yet too often, students and their parents listen without question.
"I readily admit it," said E. Gordon Gee, the president of Ohio State University, who has also served as president of Vanderbilt and Brown, among others. "I didn't think a lot about costs. I do not think we have given significant thought to the impact of college costs on families."
Of course, economists and many parents say that the only thing worse than graduating with lots of debt is not going to college at all, since study after study has shown that graduates earn more over a lifetime. And most college students in the United States manage to eventually pay back their student loans.
To that end, the Obama administration has given out more grants and loans than ever to more and more college students with the goal of making the United States first among developed nations in college completion. The balance of federal student loans has grown by more than 60 percent in the last five years. And in 2007, Congress made sure the interest rates on many of those loans were well below commercial rates; currently, a debate over keeping those lower rates from doubling in July is roiling lawmakers.
But even if student loans are what many economists consider "good debt," an increasing number of borrowers are struggling to pay them off, and in the process becoming mired in a financial morass.
Education Department data shows that payments are being made on just 38 percent of the balance of federal student loans, down from 46 percent five years ago. The balances are unpaid because the borrowers are still in school, have postponed payments or have stopped paying altogether.
Nearly one in 10 borrowers who started repayment in 2009 defaulted within two years, the latest data available -- about double the rate in 2005.
Economists do not predict a collapse of the student loan system, which would, in essence, mean wholesale default. And if there were one, it would be unlikely to ripple through the economy with the same devastating impact as the mortgage crash. Though now larger than credit card and other consumer debt, the student loan balance remains smaller than the mortgage market, and most student loans are issued by the federal government, meaning banks wouldn't be affected as much.
Still, economists say, growing student debt hangs over the economic recovery like a dark cloud for a generation of college graduates and indebted dropouts. A study of recent college graduates conducted by researchers at Rutgers University and released last week found that 40 percent of the participants had delayed making a major purchase, like a home or car, because of college debt, while slightly more than a quarter had put off continuing their education or had moved in with relatives to save money. Roughly half of the surveyed graduates had a full-time job.
"I'll be paying this forever," said Chelsea Grove, 24, who dropped out of Bowling Green State University and owes $70,000 in student loans. She is working three jobs to pay her $510 monthly obligation and has no intention of going back.
"For me to finish it would mean borrowing more money," she said. "It makes me puke to think about borrowing more money."
'Nothing Is Free'
Christina Hagan is an Ohio lawmaker who says students need to understand that attending college is not an entitlement. Last year, she was appointed to fill a seat once occupied by her father in the Ohio House of Representatives.
Ms. Hagan, 23, is also a college student.
She will graduate shortly from Malone University, an evangelical college in Canton, Ohio, with more than $65,000 in student debt (among her loans is one from a farm lender; she had to plant a garden to become eligible). Though she makes $60,000 a year as a state representative, she plans to begin waiting tables in the next few weeks at Don Pancho's, a Mexican restaurant in Alliance, Ohio, to help pay down her student loans and credit cards. She pays about $1,000 a month.
"I placed a priority on a Christian education and I didn't think about the debt," said Ms. Hagan, who says she takes responsibility for her debt and others should do the same. "I need my generation to understand that nothing is free."
While Ms. Hagan's perspective is unusually personal, it is a common view among lawmakers here in Ohio and many states. Across the country, elected officials are increasingly unwilling to assume a large share of the bill for public colleges and universities, which seven out of 10 students attend. The change has contributed to sharp increases in tuition and more fund-raising -- and the need for students to borrow more.
From 2001 to 2011, state and local financing per student declined by 24 percent nationally. Over the same period, tuition and fees at state schools increased 72 percent, compared with 29 percent for nonprofit private institutions, according to the College Board. Many of the cuts were the result of a sluggish economy that reduced tax revenue, but the sharp drop in per-student spending also reflects a change: an increasing number of lawmakers voted to transfer more of the financial burden of college from taxpayers to students and their families. (Local funding is a small percentage of the total, and mostly goes to community colleges.)
"To say that tuition goes up because the state doesn't pay enough money, well, that is the taxpayers' money," said Ohio's governor, John Kasich, a Republican elected in 2010 whose budget included cuts to higher education because of the end of federal stimulus money.
Donald E. Heller, an expert on higher education, said elected officials in both parties had figured out that colleges were one of the few parts of state government that could raise money on their own. If lawmakers cut state financing, the schools could make it up by raising tuition.
"It lets legislators off the hook and makes universities look like the bad guy," said Mr. Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University.
Ohio's flagship university, Ohio State, now receives 7 percent of its budget from the state, down from 15 percent a decade ago and 25 percent in 1990. The price of tuition and fees since 2002 increased about 60 percent in today's dollars.
The consequence? Three out of five undergraduates at Ohio State take out loans, and the average debt is $24,840.
If any state is representative of the role government has played in the growth of student debt, Ohio makes a good candidate. While other states have made steeper cuts in recent years because of the recession, Ohio has been chipping away at it far longer. It now ranks sixth from the bottom in financing per student, at $4,480.
In the late 1970s, higher education in Ohio accounted for 17 percent of the state's expenditures. Now it is 11 percent. By contrast, prisons were 4 percent of the state's budget in the late 1970s; now they account for 8 percent. Federal mandates and court orders have compelled lawmakers to spend more money on Medicaid and primary education, too. Legislators could designate a greater percentage of the budget to higher education by raising taxes, but there is no appetite for that. Governor Kasich has signed a pledge not to raise taxes, as have about two dozen legislators.
Some Ohio elected officials say state colleges and universities have brought the debt problem upon themselves.
They suggest, for example, that state schools are bloated, antiquated and don't do a good enough job graduating students or training them for the work force. Some complain about the salaries of football coaches and college presidents, like Mr. Gee, who has a compensation package of $2 million a year as president of Ohio State. Mr. Kasich questions why all state universities need to offer every major, like journalism or engineering, instead of parceling those programs among the schools.
"It's not just inefficiencies," said the governor, an Ohio State graduate. "It's, 'I want to be the best in this.' It's duplication of resources. It's a sweeping change that is needed across academia."
There is an ideological and political tug of war as well. State Representative John Patrick Carney, a Democrat, said if legislators were serious about financing higher education they could find a way, like eliminating tax breaks for corporations. He noted that even as funds for higher education were being reduced, Mr. Kasich and the Republican-controlled Legislature eliminated the state's estate tax, which will cost the state an estimated $72 million a year.
Mr. Carney said he worried that the constant tuition and fee increases would limit access to college for lower- and middle-income students -- a founding principle of public universities. At least two-thirds of Ohio lawmakers attended public colleges or universities, including Mr. Carney, an Ohio State graduate.
"It's hard to say it's affordable when students leave with that much debt," he said.
The new financial reality for colleges has left administrators scrambling to maintain academic quality and all-important rankings with diminished state resources. That puts an even higher premium on attracting top-tier students -- the rankings depend on them -- and playing down the burdens of college debt.
Buy Now, Pay Later
At Ohio State, "college can be a reality for everyone, no matter your income or background," its Web site says, while at Ohio Northern, future students are urged to get over the "sticker shock," and focus instead on "return on investment."
Oberlin College's Web site tells prospective students that its financial aid policy is simple: "We meet the full demonstrated financial need of every admitted student." The University of Dayton declares itself "one of the most affordable private Catholic schools in the country" and a "lifetime investment, appreciating over the course of time."
The costs for these colleges? At Ohio State, about $25,000 a year for tuition and fees, room and board and living expenses; at Ohio Northern, about $48,000; at Oberlin $60,000; and at Dayton $48,000.
Colleges are aggressively recruiting students, regardless of their financial circumstances. In admissions offices across the country, professional marketing companies and talented alumni are being enlisted to devise catchy slogans, build enticing Web sites -- and essentially outpitch the competition.
Affordability, or at least promising that the finances will work out, is increasingly a piece of the pitch.
Almost all colleges promote the money they give away in financial aid, though generally only the most elite schools -- like Oberlin in Ohio -- are able to provide enough in grants and scholarships to significantly keep student debt down.
College marketing firms encourage school officials to focus on the value of the education rather than the cost. For example, an article on the cover of Enrollment Management, a newsletter aimed at college admissions officials, urged writers of admissions materials to "avoid bad words like 'cost,' 'pay' (try 'and you get all this for...'), 'contract' and 'buy' in your piece and avoid the conflicting feelings they generate."
"There are direct marketing 'words' that can make or break your piece," the article, published in 2009, added.
The financial aid award letters to newly admitted students can also be a minefield for students and parents sorting through the true costs of a school. Some are written in a manner that suggests the student is getting a great deal, by blurring the line between grants and loans or not making clear how much the student may have to pay or borrow.
A quick reading of an award letter from Drexel University, received by a New Jersey applicant in March, implied that the student would owe nothing and might actually walk away with money. The expected payment to Drexel, it said in highlighted bright yellow, would be a negative $5,900. The calculation presumed grants, student loans and a $42,120 loan taken out by the parents toward the $63,620 estimated cost -- figures also included in the letter but not highlighted.
A Drexel spokeswoman said that the letter was not misleading and that it had not received complaints about it. But for many students, the financial realities of attending a college conflict with the optimistic rhetoric of campus tours, financial aid materials and salesmanlike admissions officers. And many of them don't realize it until it is much too late.
"The overall message was, 'It's doable and normal to go into that much debt,' " said Jillian Potter, 23, who grew up in Ohio and attended Anderson University, a nonprofit private Christian school in neighboring Indiana.
Ms. Potter figured she would have to borrow about $10,000 a year. But the tuition increased every year, and because she didn't declare a major until her junior year, she needed five years to graduate.
A social worker, she now owes $80,000. "I try not to think about it because it's really depressing," she said.
For Evan Frank, Ashland University, a nonprofit private school in Ohio, dangled the possibility of a sports scholarship, he said. Mr. Frank liked the campus and was promised a spot on the football team. His high school guidance counselor encouraged him and so did his family, though they couldn't help financially.
Ashland offered to knock about $12,000 off the costs, and when Mr. Frank called financial aid to ask for more, they suggested he keep applying for scholarships. No one at the time said to consider a cheaper alternative, he said. Ashland costs about $42,000 a year.
"Maybe at the time I was a little naive," said Mr. Frank, 22, a senior who owes $80,000. "Everyone was like, 'You can get grants, you can always get loans.' I wanted to play football really bad, and I hoped eventually I'd get a football scholarship."
Many students and parents don't have a firm understanding of the cost of attending college, or the amount of debt they will incur. And most colleges aren't much help. Student debt is not their primary concern in the end -- the loan money usually gets deposited directly with the colleges, so they get paid either way -- and the main job of the admissions staff, after all, is to admit students.
"Ultimately with everything in financial aid, from start to finish, the student and their family need to take responsibility and monitor their aid," Melanie K. Weaver, the director of financial aid at Ohio Northern, said in an e-mail. "With over 3,000 on aid it is difficult for our office of 10 staff members to stay on top of every student."
While there are standardized disclosure forms for buying a car or a house or even signing up for a credit card, no such thing exists for colleges.
Instead, college pricing is complicated by constant tuition increases, a vast array of grants and loans and a financial-aid system that discounts tuition for most students based on opaque formulas. "No one has a vested interest in simplifying the process but families," said Mark Kantrowitz, the founder of FinAid, a Web site devoted to explaining college financial aid. "It obscures the price of a college and makes the choice of college not depend on the price but other factors."
Federal regulations require financial aid officers to counsel students when they take federal loans and again when they graduate. The counseling typically consists of making sure they complete a brief online course about student loans and repayment.
Beyond that, it is up to the college to decide what, if any, debt counseling to provide. With a few exceptions, their track record is not very good, according to students and experts on college finance. Until Congress banned the practice a few years ago, some colleges outsourced counseling to private lenders, the same ones offering loans. Now many colleges do little beyond what is required by law, experts say.
Ohio Northern administrators said they were trying to come to grips with the growing debt of their students -- an average of $48,886 for borrowers -- at a time when enrollment is down slightly, as it is at many of the small nonprofit private colleges with which it competes.
Financial aid officers have not yet told any prospective students that they cannot afford to attend, school administrators said. But Ms. Weaver, the director of financial aid, noted, "We are having that conversation."
Mr. Frank, at Ashland, said he did eventually receive financial counseling -- on the day he arrived for football camp as a freshman.
A financial aid adviser suggested Mr. Frank rethink his decision to attend "because the way it's looking you are going to be looking at a high amount of debt if you are going to stay here," he recalled. "I wanted to play football really bad, and I was already moving in for camp," he said. "I wasn't going to turn back then." He never did receive a football scholarship.
Officials at both Ashland and Anderson Universities said they provided thorough financial aid counseling to incoming students.
Ms. Griffith, the Ohio Northern student whose mother is taking out life insurance on her -- a precaution that might be unnecessary because some lenders forgive loans upon death -- said she wished someone had been frank with her about the consequences of taking on so much debt. (She also received grants.) She is searching for a full-time job in marketing, her major, while earning $225 a week at two restaurants.
"When I was young, I wanted to get out of Putnam County, get out of the cornfields," said Ms. Griffith, who is from rural Ottawa, Ohio. "I would love to get away. But it would be more financially responsible if I got a job near here and lived with my parents."
The Shadow of For-Profits
Wanda McGill has stopped opening her student loan bills.
She isn't sure how much debt she has accumulated, though she thinks it's about $100,000. But Ms. McGill, a 38-year-old single mother, knows for sure she cannot pay it.
Ms. McGill said she dropped out of DeVry University, a for-profit college with a branch in Columbus, two years ago after she ran out of money -- even with the loans. She now makes $8.50 an hour working for an employment training center in Florida.
"I was promised the world and was given a garbage dump to clean up," she wrote in an online complaint at consumeraffairs.com. "Like my life was not already screwed up with welfare and all."
The student loan crisis has spread from for-profit colleges to more traditional institutions, but the for-profit colleges continue to represent the worst of the problem. Students complain that they were misled about the costs of education and that their job prospects were exaggerated. Government reports and lawsuits have accused some for-profit colleges of outright fraud, including doctoring attendance records or peddling near-worthless degrees.
The result? Students at for-profit colleges are twice as likely as other students to default on their student loans. Moreover, among students seeking a bachelor's degree, only 22 percent succeed within six years, compared with 65 percent at nonprofit private schools and 55 percent at public institutions. (For-profit students, however, tend to do better at obtaining associate degrees and certificates.)
Leaders of the for-profit industry defended themselves, saying they were providing higher education for lower-class students that traditional colleges had left behind. "The reality is the type of students we attract have no other opportunity," said Steven Gunderson, head of a leading trade organization. "We are the ones that provide a path to the middle class."
Still, the outcomes for many students have been so poor -- and the reported abuses and misdeeds by the colleges so abundant -- that the for-profit colleges have played another role in the worsening debt problem: drawing attention away from nonprofit private and public colleges and universities, which have been slow to face public scrutiny.
The situation has parallels to the mortgage crisis of a few years ago, said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The for-profit colleges are like the subprime lenders -- attracting the limelight because they represent the worst of the problem, he said.
"Mainstream higher ed can really self-righteously look at the big problem out there and say, 'The problem lies with the other guy,' " Mr. Nassirian said. "If you are looking at highway robbery and raping and pillaging, that is true. But there are all kinds of unfortunate practices in traditional higher education that are equally as problematic that are reaching the crisis point." Last year, Congress approved regulations to curb abuses in the for-profit sector, but there has been less focus on establishing broader rules for traditional colleges and universities.
The Obama administration has tried to make college pricing easier to understand; as of last year, colleges and universities were required to post calculators on their Web sites that explain the net price after grants and loans, but critics say they can be confusing, misleading or hard to find. And the administration has proposed that colleges be required to offer a "shopping sheet" to make it easier for families to measure the true costs and benefits.
"We just have to get them much more information," said Education Secretary Arne Duncan. "If you're going to college, you need to know not what the first year costs. You need to know what it's going to cost for the long haul."
But even with more information, students and their parents seem willing to pay the ever-escalating price of a college degree, which remains the key rung up the ladder of economic mobility.
Denise Entingh, 44, dropped out after two quarters at Columbus State Community College because she didn't want to wait any longer to get into the nursing program. So she signed on at the Hondros School of Nursing, a for-profit college that advertises "No Waitlist!" on a billboard a few blocks from Columbus State.
Ms. Entingh said she expected to borrow about $45,000 to get a bachelor's degree in nursing from Hondros, which costs more than three times as much as Columbus State.
"It scares the hell out of me," she said of her debt load. "But I think it will be all right. I'm not going to worry about it right now. I had to take that plunge."
Degrees of Debt: This series examines the implications of soaring college costs and the indebtedness of students and their families.
Correction: May 16, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Sunday about college students' debt, and an accompanying chart, misstated the percentage of bachelor's degree recipients who had borrowed money for their education from the government, private lenders, or with the help of family members.
The article stated that the percentage had increased to 94 percent from 45 percent in 1993, based on data from the Department of Education, whose officials reviewed The Times's methodology before publication. While the percentage of students borrowing for college has indeed increased significantly, the 94 percent figure reflected an inaccurate interpretation of the data, which came from a survey of 2007-2008 graduates.
That survey showed that 66 percent of bachelor's degree recipients borrowed from the government or private lenders; an additional percentage of graduates had family members who borrowed on their behalf or who lent them money, meaning that the total percentage with college borrowing increased to more than 66 percent. But the precise figure isn't known because the department survey did not address borrowing involving family members. (The earlier survey, of 1992-1993 graduates, found that just 45 percent of graduates had borrowed from all sources, including from family members.)

Full text: AT its annual meeting this week, the American Psychiatric Association did two wonderful things: it rejected one reckless proposal that would have exposed nonpsychotic children to unnecessary and dangerous antipsychotic medication and another that would have turned the existential worries and sadness of everyday life into an alleged mental disorder.
But the association is still proceeding with other suggestions that could potentially expand the boundaries of psychiatry to define as mentally ill tens of millions of people now considered normal. The proposals are part of a major undertaking: revisions to what is often called the "bible of psychiatry" -- the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or D.S.M. The fifth edition of the manual is scheduled for publication next May.
I was heavily involved in the third and fourth editions of the manual but have reluctantly concluded that the association should lose its nearly century-old monopoly on defining mental illness. Times have changed, the role of psychiatric diagnosis has changed, and the association has changed. It is no longer capable of being sole fiduciary of a task that has become so consequential to public health and public policy.
Psychiatric diagnosis was a professional embarrassment and cultural backwater until D.S.M.-3 was published in 1980. Before that, it was heavily influenced by psychoanalysis, psychiatrists could rarely agree on diagnoses and nobody much cared anyway.
D.S.M.-3 stirred great professional and public excitement by providing specific criteria for each disorder. Having everyone work from the same playbook facilitated treatment planning and revolutionized research in psychiatry and neuroscience.
Surprisingly, D.S.M.-3 also caught on with the general public and became a runaway best seller, with more than a million copies sold, many more than were needed for professional use. Psychiatric diagnosis crossed over from the consulting room to the cocktail party. People who previously chatted about the meaning of their latest dreams began to ponder where they best fit among D.S.M.'s intriguing categories.
The fourth edition of the manual, released in 1994, tried to contain the diagnostic inflation that followed earlier editions. It succeeded on the adult side, but failed to anticipate or control the faddish over-diagnosis of autism, attention deficit disorders and bipolar disorder in children that has since occurred.
Indeed, the D.S.M. is the victim of its own success and is accorded the authority of a bible in areas well beyond its competence. It has become the arbiter of who is ill and who is not -- and often the primary determinant of treatment decisions, insurance eligibility, disability payments and who gets special school services. D.S.M. drives the direction of research and the approval of new drugs. It is widely used (and misused) in the courts.
Until now, the American Psychiatric Association seemed the entity best equipped to monitor the diagnostic system. Unfortunately, this is no longer true. D.S.M.-5 promises to be a disaster -- even after the changes approved this week, it will introduce many new and unproven diagnoses that will medicalize normality and result in a glut of unnecessary and harmful drug prescription. The association has been largely deaf to the widespread criticism of D.S.M.-5, stubbornly refusing to subject the proposals to independent scientific review.
Many critics assume unfairly that D.S.M.-5 is shilling for drug companies. This is not true. The mistakes are rather the result of an intellectual conflict of interest; experts always overvalue their pet area and want to expand its purview, until the point that everyday problems come to be mislabeled as mental disorders. Arrogance, secretiveness, passive governance and administrative disorganization have also played a role.
New diagnoses in psychiatry can be far more dangerous than new drugs. We need some equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration to mind the store and control diagnostic exuberance. No existing organization is ready to replace the American Psychiatric Association. The most obvious candidate, the National Institute of Mental Health, is too research-oriented and insensitive to the vicissitudes of clinical practice. A new structure will be needed, probably best placed under the auspices of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Institute of Medicine or the World Health Organization.
All mental-health disciplines need representation -- not just psychiatrists but also psychologists, counselors, social workers and nurses. The broader consequences of changes should be vetted by epidemiologists, health economists and public-policy and forensic experts. Primary care doctors prescribe the majority of psychotropic medication, often carelessly, and need to contribute to the diagnostic system if they are to use it correctly. Consumers should play an important role in the review process, and field testing should occur in real life settings, not just academic centers.
Psychiatric diagnosis is simply too important to be left exclusively in the hands of psychiatrists. They will always be an essential part of the mix but should no longer be permitted to call all the shots.

Germany Signals It Will Permit Small Steps to Promote Growth in Europe

Abstract: Mr. Schauble was echoing a statement to the German Parliament the day before by the German Bundesbank, normally a bastion of price stability, that higher inflation rates in Germany were acceptable as long as the euro zone average remained on target.

Full text: BERLIN -- The outlines of a potential compromise in Europe's battle between deficit-cutting austerity and policies to promote growth have begun to take shape. The question is whether the kind of cautious measures palatable to Germany, austerity's champion, will do enough to combat the Continent's imbalances and do it soon enough to put its weaker countries on more solid economic footing.
In typical German fashion, the steps under discussion are incremental and spread across a range of policy areas so as not to raise the ire of German voters. Germany's rigid central bank has signaled a willingness to tolerate slightly higher inflation, while the government has indicated its openness to modest but real wage growth in Germany.
Most important for the stricken economies, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, may be prepared to accept a longer timetable for curtailing budget deficits for countries like Spain that are reeling from recession. For Ms. Merkel, the most important prize is ratification of the fiscal compact, signed in March by the leaders of 25 of the 27 European Union countries, to control deficits in the long run.
Ever since the victory of Francois Hollande in the French presidential election on Sunday, the debate in Europe has shifted, with attention focusing on Ms. Merkel's growing isolation over austerity and whether she would yield to calls for stimulus spending to promote short-term economic growth.
The recognition seems to be dawning even here that forcing heavily indebted countries to cut spending too quickly and deeply can be counterproductive. "The mood appears to be shifting in Germany," said Sebastian Dullien, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. "Even conservative economists are beginning to question whether this austerity is too brutal at the moment."
Despite marked differences in tone, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande may not be so far apart in substance, said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consultancy in New York. Germany may ultimately accept minor adjustments to Greece's aid program if a viable government emerges, Mr. Rahman said.
"This is Germany's way of signaling both to Hollande and the Greek political elite it is willing to be constructive to keep the system together," he said.
German officials have been adamant in saying the bailout terms would not be renegotiated with Greece. The sharp reduction in public spending in the teeth of a recession has sent Greek unemployment to over 20 percent and, in Sunday's elections, brought radical parties on the right and left into Parliament.
Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble repeated Germany's mantra that Greece had to stand by its commitments, but this time he added that Berlin could tolerate a slightly higher inflation rate.
Germany has traditionally found inflation "in the corridor between 2 and 3 percent" acceptable, Mr. Schauble said, even though the European Central Bank's official target is about 2 percent. Mr. Schauble was echoing a statement to the German Parliament the day before by the German Bundesbank, normally a bastion of price stability, that higher inflation rates in Germany were acceptable as long as the euro zone average remained on target.
The Bundesbank said the country might have inflation above the euro zone average as other countries regained competitiveness. A more flexible line by the powerful German bank, after which the European Central Bank was modeled, would create space for the E.C.B. to cut interest rates further or take other steps to encourage growth.
Earlier in the week, Mr. Schauble said higher wages for German workers could also help combat imbalances in the euro zone, where years of wage discipline have made German companies far more competitive than those in many of Germany's neighbors. His statement coincided with warning strikes across Germany by IG Metall, a powerful union, which is pushing for higher wages for workers in the automobile, steel and electronics industries.
If prices and wages rise in Germany, it will be easier for countries like Spain, Italy and Greece to compete.
Other measures under consideration include increasing financing for the European Investment Bank as well as helping struggling countries tap unspent resources in existing European Union funds. But these proposals would offset just a tiny fraction of the cuts in public outlays pursued by countries trying to rein in their debt.
While her subordinates were talking of compromise, Ms. Merkel maintained her tough line before a domestic audience with little sympathy for Europe's laggards, particularly Greece. Germans will vote in an important election on Sunday in North Rhine-Westphalia, the country's most populous state.
Speaking to Parliament on Thursday, Ms. Merkel rejected proposals to allow more deficit spending in the name of growth. She said "growth through debt," pumping up government spending to stimulate growth, would "send us back to the beginning of the crisis."
At the Group of 8 summit meeting next week at Camp David, Ms. Merkel is sure to face pressure from allies -- in particular the United States -- to loosen the purse strings and encourage growth. But in Thursday's address, she rejected "wonder weapons" like issuing joint European debt and warned that the Continent faced a long slog.
Mr. Dullien of the European Council on Foreign Relations said deficit spending to stimulate the economy and delaying spending cuts were not the same thing in the eyes of voters here. "You can sell that much more easily to the German public," he said of delays in cuts. "They are trying to do what's politically palatable to ease the burden and allow more room for growth."
German policy makers have played down disagreements with Mr. Hollande since his victory on Sunday, pointing to the long and successful cooperation between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a conservative, and President Francois Mitterrand, a socialist. Chancellor Merkel spent her first term combating the financial crisis with a Social Democrat, Peer Steinbruck, as finance minister.
The fiscal compact remains the most important prize for Ms. Merkel, and she needs the Social Democrats' help in Parliament to pass it. She has proved adept at shifting with the circumstances to get what she wants, to the frustration of her opponents.
Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of the Social Democrats, said Wednesday that Ms. Merkel "will make the shift" toward more growth policies, the German news agency dpa reported. "She'll even explain that it was her idea."

Full text: CHONGQING, China -- After the economies of Western nations imploded in late 2008, Chinese leaders began boasting of their nation's supremacy. Talk spread, not only in China but also across the West, of the advantages of the so-called China model -- a vaguely defined combination of authoritarian politics and state-guided capitalism -- that was to be the guiding light for this century.
But now, with the recent political upheavals, and a growing number of influential voices demanding a resurrection of freer economic policies, it appears that the sense of triumphalism was, at best, premature, and perhaps seriously misguided. Chinese leaders are grappling with a range of uncertainties, from the once-a-decade leadership transition this year that has been marred by a seismic political scandal, to a slowdown of growth in an economy in which deeply entrenched state-owned enterprises and their political patrons have hobbled market forces and private entrepreneurship.
"Many economic problems that we face are actually political problems in disguise, such as the nature of the economy, the nature of the ownership system in the country and groups of vested interests," said Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing. "The problems are so serious that they have to be solved now and can no longer be put off."
On Thursday, China released data that showed its economy was continuing to weaken. Many economists have been urging the government to loosen controls over the financial system, to support lending to private businesses while reining in state-owned enterprises, to allow more movement in exchange rates and interest rates, and to improve social benefits.
Such changes would curb the state's role, lessen corruption and encourage competition. But making them would involve a titanic power struggle. Executives of Chinese conglomerates, army generals, Politburo members, local officials and the "princeling" children of Communist Party elders have little incentive to refashion a system that fills their coffers.
Another significant aspect of the China model is the growing security apparatus. Its heavy-handed tactics in pursuit of social stability have been called into question by, among other things, more than 30 self-immolations by disaffected Tibetans and a diplomatic crisis between China and the United States precipitated by the plight of a persecuted dissident, Chen Guangcheng. A well-documented uprising last winter against corrupt officials in the southern village of Wukan ignited a debate about how protests should be addressed: by the sword of the security forces, or through mediation by senior officials.
But it is the scandal over Bo Xilai, until recently a member of the party's elite Politburo, that has most humbled those who previously praised the well-oiled nature of China's political system and its appearance of unity.
Before the charismatic Mr. Bo lost his party chief post in Chongqing, other leaders were already starting to view him as an increasingly intolerable maverick. After arriving in Chongqing in late 2007, Mr. Bo began what was billed as a crackdown on crime, along with a revival of Mao-era singalongs and welfare policies, aimed at generating populist backing and winning political support from the "new left," or hard-core socialists, for his bid to join the top-level Politburo Standing Committee, which is scheduled to turn over this year.
Mr. Bo's bid veered sharply from the traditional route of ascension, which since the era of Deng Xiaoping has been one of back-room patronage and shadowy negotiations among party elders. The problem now in China is that the powers of those elders have diminished with each generation -- the current president and party chief, Hu Jintao, is weaker than his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, who was much weaker than Mr. Deng.
With the dissolution of power, a multitude of factions and alliances are emerging under one-party rule, with no one voice able to impose order.
"China needs a system in place more than ever," said Wang Kang, a liberal writer from Chongqing. "Only a system can guarantee stability."
Some say that the purge of Mr. Bo was a correction in the political system, and that the system has returned to normal. But many others argue that given the growing incoherence at the top, and the diversity and reach of mass media in China, it is inevitable that more politicians will adopt Mr. Bo's populist methods. Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics, noted that at the annual National People's Congress in March, several rising sixth-generation leaders gave prominent news media interviews, a form of self-promotion that was a break from tradition.
"There are no clear and steadfast rules," said Wu Si, chief editor of Yanhuang Chunqiu, a journal of politics and history. "In this confused state, there is bound to be someone like Bo Xilai who deploys various methods to compete to enter the standing committee."
Mr. Bo's policies also helped expose another fault line in the China model: the priority placed on economic growth through investment projects carried out by state-owned enterprises, with generous loans from state banks. This is the framework propping up the Chinese economy.
Flush with infrastructure projects, Chongqing, with a population of 31 million, had an economic growth rate of 16.4 percent last year, the highest of any municipality. But the municipal government and local state-owned companies have accumulated $160 billion in debt, according to an estimate by Victor Shih, who studies China's political economy. Many of those loans might never be repaid.
Policy makers pushing for a different model across China, one that relies more on consumer spending and encourages private enterprise, insist that long-stalled structural overhauls must be restarted. Some see an opening in the coming leadership transition. But the biggest hurdle may be the fact that both departing and incoming leaders have close ties to state-owned enterprises, which are keen to preserve the status quo.
The hesitancy over the next step is heightened by China's cooling economy. The growth rate slowed to 8.1 percent in the first quarter of this year, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao in March cut the forecast for the year to 7.5 percent. The property market is deflating. The data released on Thursday showed that domestic demand is weakening and exports are flagging.
China warded off the global financial crisis with a $580 billion stimulus package and a loosening of bank lending. Its leaders could fall back on that government-led, investment-driven approach if the economy cools too much.
One thing keeping them in check, however, is fear of rampant inflation, which could increase social unrest. Discontent among the poor and middle class is a major source of anxiety for Chinese leaders, yet there are no easy solutions to the widening wealth gap, as long as rapid growth is the priority.
The surging number of protests arising from this gap is another stress point in the China model. Officials rely heavily on domestic security forces to quell what they call "mass incidents," which one sociologist, Sun Liping, estimated at 180,000 in 2010. In March, the government announced that it planned to spend $111 billion on domestic security this year, a 12 percent increase over 2011, and $5 billion more than this year's military budget.
During the uprising in Wukan last winter, which began because of what villagers called illegal land seizures by local officials, police units surrounded the village, but backed off after Guangdong Province officials negotiated with the residents. Wang Yang, the provincial party chief, took credit for the peaceful settlement and has proposed that that strategy be more widely adopted, in an implicit criticism of the militant tactics used in "stability maintenance."
The weakness of those tactics was exposed once again when Mr. Chen, the activist put under house arrest in 2010, made his nighttime escape from village guards who had beaten him and his wife. Mr. Chen, who is blind, fled to the United States Embassy in Beijing. That such brutality could set off a diplomatic crisis between the world's superpower and its rising rival is as obvious a sign as any of the deep flaws in China's security methods.
"From the few times I've engaged with them," Mr. Chen said, "I know they have the intention of reforming, of slowly initiating the rule of law. But I don't know how soon."

Full text: Many businesses and consumers are finding it easier to borrow as banks shore up their balance sheets, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Thursday.
"Notwithstanding the various headwinds, credit conditions in the United States have improved significantly in a number of areas," Mr. Bernanke said.
He said that large companies were selling bonds at historically low interest rates and that people with strong credit had "ready access" to credit card and auto loans.
But, he also noted, many creditworthy Americans were finding it difficult to get mortgage loans. Small-business owners who have used their homes as collateral for loans also face "challenging" conditions, he said.
Mr. Bernanke's comments were prepared for delivery at a banking conference in Chicago.
The Fed chairman said that banks had made "considerable progress" in shedding risk from balance sheets and building cushions against future loan losses. Cash and securities holdings at large banks have doubled since 2009, he said.
He also said that the way banks finance themselves had become safer. Large banks are now "flush" with deposits, he said, and depend less on short-term loans from financial institutions for their borrowing needs.
In the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, much of the lending among financial institutions in this so-called wholesale funding market froze, spreading panic and helping push the economy into its deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Mr. Bernanke noted that most of the 19 largest banks passed "stress tests" earlier this year, meaning they would probably survive and be able to lend in a financial crisis worse than 2008.
In those tests, regulators supposed the unemployment rate would spike to 13 percent, stocks would drop by half and home values would drop by more than a fifth.
Mr. Bernanke said loans to homeowners had fallen 13 percent from their peak, after adjusting for inflation. A slow economic recovery, a troubled housing market and caution by lenders mean that situation is unlikely to improve quickly, he said.
Turning to small businesses, Mr. Bernanke said small loans from banks, though increasing, were still 15 percent below their 2008 peak at the end of last year.
In response to criticism that heightened scrutiny by regulators has made it difficult for banks to lend, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had emphasized to supervisors on its staff that they should take a "balanced approach" in overseeing banks.

Chinese Economy Losing Some Of Its Sizzle

Full text: HONG KONG -- As China's leaders have been preoccupied with a political struggle leading up to a once-in-a-decade leadership change this autumn, there are increasing signs that the Chinese economy may be running into trouble.
China announced Thursday that growth in imports had unexpectedly come to a screeching halt in April -- rising just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier, compared with expectations for an 11 percent increase. Businesses across the country appeared to lose much of their appetite for products as varied as iron ore and computer chips.
China has been the largest single contributor to global economic growth in recent years, and a sustained slowdown in its economy could pose problems for many other countries. Particularly exposed are countries that export commodities like iron ore and oil and rely on demand from China's steel mills and ever-growing ranks of car owners.
Exports, a cornerstone of China's economic growth over the last three decades, grew 4.9 percent last month -- half as much as economists had expected. And a slump in new orders over the last month at the Canton Fair, China's main marketplace for exporters and foreign buyers, suggests that overseas shipments by the world's second-biggest economy, after that of the United States, may not recover quickly.
Growth in other sectors appears to be slowing, too, particularly in real estate. Soufun Holdings, a Chinese real estate data provider, released figures Monday showing that residential land sales in the country's 20 largest cities had fallen 92 percent last week from the week before, as declining prices for apartments have left developers short of cash and reluctant to start further projects.
In a series of interviews over the last week, bankers and senior executives from provinces all over China, in a range of light and heavy industries, cited a broad deterioration in business conditions. Two of them said that some tax agencies in smaller cities had been telling companies to inflate their sales and profits to make local economic growth look less weak than it really was, while reassuring the companies that their actual tax bills would be left unchanged.
There are early signs of a credit squeeze, at least among private sector companies. Many seem to be asking their suppliers for more time to pay debts and complaining of cash flow problems. Zhang Jinmei, the sales manager at the Qitele Group, a company that makes playground equipment in the coastal city of Wenzhou, said that local investment and lending pools there were starting to charge higher interest rates for loans, a sign of worries about creditworthiness.
"The business environment is getting tougher and tougher," said Tom Zhang, the sales manager at the Hebei Haihao High Pressure Flange and Pipe Fitting Group. "Competition is very intense to get more business -- our domestic sales are down from last year, though our export sales are more or less stable."
Some sectors are faring better. Car sales rose 12.5 percent in April from a year earlier, the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers announced on Wednesday.
The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Friday morning in Beijing that inflation in consumer prices slowed to 3.4 percent in April from 3.6 percent in March, while producer prices, measured at the factory gate, actually fell 0.7 percent in April from a year earlier. The fading of inflation pressures makes it easier for the government to stimulate the economy without pushing up prices. A clearer signal of China's economic health may emerge later Friday when the National Bureau of Statistics announces April figures for industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.
China has noticeably not loosened monetary policy in recent months to mitigate the economic slowdown. The government had been moving toward easing through the winter, lowering cash reserve requirements for banks in November and most recently in February, so that the banks could lend more.
But the government has left the reserve ratio unchanged since then. It has also left regulated interest rates unchanged at the fairly high levels set last July, when the economy was much stronger. Changes in the reserve ratio or interest rates are ultimately decided not by the central bank in China but by the country's political leadership.
The government's inactivity has coincided with the biggest political drama in China in more than a decade: the ouster of Bo Xilai, a leading advocate of renewed government control over the economy and public life. The Communist Party removed him March 15 as the party secretary in Chongqing and on April 10 suspended his membership in the Politburo and the larger Central Committee.
On March 12, three days before Mr. Bo lost his job in Chongqing, the governor of the Chinese central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, strongly hinted that the government was prepared to lower the reserve requirement further, but it has done nothing since to follow up.
"We have a lot of room to adjust the reserve ratio," Mr. Zhou said at the time. "On the other hand, it is necessary to see whether there is a necessity to adjust."
Stock market investors appeared to be betting Thursday that Chinese leaders would be forced to ease policy in response to the latest trade figures. After early gains, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets dropped sharply in late morning when the export and import statistics were released. But both markets later rebounded, and they closed the day little changed.
GaveKal Dragonomics, a research firm specializing in the Chinese economy, said in a report Thursday that it was "still true the Chinese leadership's obsession with growth and stability is heightened during transition years. This makes it implausible that the leadership would allow the economy to collapse while they fight over who gets what job."
The sectors doing best in China these days seem to be connected to state-owned enterprises and local governments, which continue to enjoy preferential access to loans from the state-controlled banking system. Projects like rail construction and low-income housing continue to move ahead.
But Chinese officials have long tracked prices of industrial commodities and activities like electricity consumption for signs of the economy's health, said Andy Xie, an independent economist based in Shanghai. Growth in electricity consumption has been slowing. And while commodity prices have begun to weaken worldwide because of worries about European debt, they have particularly slumped in China in the last few weeks, according to corporate buyers and specialty data tracking services.
One result is a lot of unhappy business executives. "Our industry sector is facing tough times, and some companies in our sector are struggling," said Amanda Wang, the sales manager at Steady Shower Technology, a manufacturer of bathroom fixtures in Ningbo.

Kerry, general counsel for the Commerce Department, said at a hearing of the Senate commerce committee that writing new laws and giving the F.T.C. the power to enforce them with civil penalties would promote Internet commerce by increasing the trust that Americans put in online transactions.

WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration and the nation's chief privacy regulator pressed Congress on Wednesday to enact online privacy legislation, saying new laws would level the playing field between companies that already had privacy policies and those that lacked them, and thus escape regulatory oversight.
Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces limited Internet privacy laws, and Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel for the Commerce Department, said at a hearing of the Senate commerce committee that writing new laws and giving the F.T.C. the power to enforce them with civil penalties would promote Internet commerce by increasing the trust that Americans put in online transactions.
Currently, the F.T.C. monitors whether Internet companies that have privacy policies keep their promises to consumers about when and where they will share personal information. But the commission lacks the authority to assess penalties for most transgressions, and it has little authority over how companies operate when they have no written privacy rules.
"Granting direct enforcement authority to the F.T.C. would enable the commission to take action against outliers and bad actors even if their actions do not violate a published privacy policy," Mr. Kerry said, according to written testimony released at the beginning of the hearing.
The F.T.C. recently accused Google, Facebook and Myspace of breaching promises about what consumer information they would keep secret or when they would share it with advertisers. While those companies face possible fines for further privacy violations, they were not financially penalized for the original incidents.
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the committee, also expressed his support for "strong consumer-focused privacy legislation this year," according to prepared remarks.
And he cast doubt on proposals for industry self-regulation. "Sometimes industry self regulation efforts do not end up protecting consumers," Mr. Rockefeller said. "In my experience, corporations are unlikely to regulate themselves out of profits."
Both Senator John F. Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Cameron Kerry, his brother, said it was important for the United States to establish its own privacy standard and not let European regulators dictate the industry standard.
Some Republican members of the Senate and the House have supported some privacy measures, while others have warned that strict new regulations could lead to an overexpansion of government red tape, inhibiting economic growth.
Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said at the hearing that he does not believe there is a demonstrated need for new privacy laws. "It's premature to begin discussing specific legislative fixes," he said, "when we don't fully know whether the problem exists."
Privacy concerns have come to the fore as consumers grow increasingly aware of just how closely their actions online are tracked. Individual Web sites or e-mail programs can follow users long after they leave a particular page on the Web, and in many cases use that information to display specific ads to the user. Sometimes, companies also sell the information to third parties.
Reflecting heightened consumer objections, the White House and the F.T.C. each produced privacy reports and recommendations this year calling for varying degrees of industry self-regulation and statutes. The White House has put forward what it calls a Privacy Bill of Rights to provide basic online protection guarantees.
Mr. Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, said he was against the creation of a centralized database of Internet users who request not to be tracked, as has been done with "Do Not Call" telephone lists. That could cause privacy concerns itself, he said.
While praising the efforts of retailing, advertising and technology companies to establish a "Do Not Track" mechanism, he also called on the industries to do more than simply block targeted ads. They should also address the collection of information by Web sites for other purposes, he said.
"While much work remains to be done on Do Not Track," Mr. Leibowitz said, "the commission believes that the developments to date, coupled with legislative proposals, provide the impetus" toward useful methods of protecting privacy.
Mr. Leibowitz said he expects that "by the end of the year there's going to be meaningful Do Not Track for American consumers so they can opt out of third-party advertisements."
The F.T.C. also repeated its call for regulation of data brokers, companies that resell databases of personal information. Such oversight would allow consumers to see and correct the information that those companies have gathered.

Online Correction: May 9, 2012, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article published online referred incorrectly to data brokers. They are companies that sell databases of personal information, not inflation.

Full text: THE SCRIPT A male announcer says: "An economic meltdown. Worst financial collapse since the Great Depression. 4.4 million jobs lost. All before this president took the oath. Some said our best days were behind us, but not him. He believed in us, fought for us. And today our auto industry is back, firing on all cylinders. Our greatest enemy brought to justice by our greatest heroes. Our troops are home from Iraq. Instead of losing jobs, we're creating them: over 4.2 million so far. We're not there yet. It's still too hard for too many. We're not there yet. It's still too hard for too many. But we're coming back -- because America's greatness comes from a strong middle class, because you don't quit. And neither does he.
ON THE SCREEN The ad makes heavy use of old television clips that are intended to remind voters of the crisis President Obama confronted when he took office. Stories about huge job losses, a plummeting stock market and record home foreclosures are relayed by new anchors. The ad shifts when Mr. Obama is shown at his inauguration in 2009, raising his right hand and proclaiming "So help me God." The visuals then become more positive. Workers are assembling cars in a factory. A young girl hugs her father, just home from war. Osama bin Laden's picture flashes on screen, but he goes unnamed as the announcer says the country's "greatest enemy" has been brought to justice.
ACCURACY The ad has none of the squishy factual assertions or questionable statistics that cause opponents to cry foul. If anything, Mr. Obama's opponents can claim error by omission. While the ad includes numbers that point to an economic recovery, it does not mention bleaker points like the decline in wages when adjusted for inflation or foreclosure rates that remain stubbornly high.
BOTTOM LINE In 2008, the Obama campaign demonstrated its skill in telling the candidate's story. Today it confronts a different kind of storytelling challenge. Since Mr. Obama is no longer an unknown quantity, his campaign has to figure out how to shape a compelling narrative arc for his first term. This ad tries to do that by doing three things: reminding voters about the difficulties he faced in 2009, laying out the progress the country has made, and telling them that his work is not done yet.

Full text: PARIS -- Francois Hollande defeated President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday, becoming the first Socialist elected president of France since Francois Mitterrand. Mr. Hollande campaigned on a gentler and more inclusive France, but his victory will also be seen as a challenge to the German-dominated vision of economic austerity as a way out of the euro crisis.
Mr. Sarkozy became the latest European leader to lose his post amid economic upheaval and the first French incumbent to be rejected since 1981.
In his five years in office, he propelled France, and himself, into a more central role in world affairs, rejoining the NATO military command and helping drive an international military campaign in Libya. He also proved to be a difficult but crucial ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in their joint effort to master the European debt and currency crisis and save the euro.
That project, however, received multiple blows on Sunday, when Greek voters sent their own message against austerity. They handed the two main parties, both of which had pledged to follow harsh international bailout terms, significant losses as they streamed to parties on the far left and far right that have opposed budget cuts. In the process, voters cast into question the ability of any party to form a government soon, let alone continue with the austerity program.
For their part, French voters may not like belt-tightening, but both Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy had promised to balance the budget in the next five years.
The balance between reducing the debt and addressing popular anger is proving complicated for Europeans, and Mr. Hollande has said that he intends to give "a new direction to Europe," demanding that a European Union treaty limiting debt be expanded to include measures to produce economic growth. Domestically, he has promised to raise taxes on big corporations and raise the tax rate to 75 percent for those earning more than one million euros a year.
Calling his victory "a fresh start," Mr. Hollande pronounced: "Austerity need not be Europe's fate."
The vote was viewed domestically as a rejection of Mr. Sarkozy and his relentless effort to appeal to the voters of the far-right National Front.
"I take the measure of the honor that's been given me and the challenge that awaits me," Mr. Hollande said before cheering supporters in the central French town of Tulle, which he represents in Parliament.
Mr. Hollande's victory was narrow but undisputed. With 95 percent of the vote counted, official results showed him with 51.6 percent of the vote while Mr. Sarkozy, of the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, had 48.4 percent, The Associated Press said.
While thanking Mr. Sarkozy for his service to France, Mr. Hollande said: "Too many divisions, too many wounds, too many ruptures, too many cuts have separated our fellow citizens from one another. That's all finished."
After weeks of energetic, and at times bellicose, campaigning, Mr. Sarkozy was gracious in defeat. "Francois Hollande is the president of the republic, he must be respected," Mr. Sarkozy said after calling Mr. Hollande to congratulate him. "I want to wish him good luck in the midst of these tests."
Speaking earlier to party members, Mr. Sarkozy said that he would not lead the party into June's legislative elections and that now, "I become a citizen among you." He urged supporters not to give in to division, though, as he saw those elections as winnable for the party.
The French and Greek elections were closely watched in European capitals and particularly in Berlin, where Ms. Merkel has led the drive to cure the euro zone debt and banking crisis with deep budget cuts and caps on future spending. She spoke on the telephone with Mr. Hollande on Sunday night, congratulating him on his victory in the election, according to a statement by her spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Mr. Hollande has said for months that his first trip will be to Berlin.
But Ms. Merkel herself was embroiled in electoral politics on Sunday, suffering setbacks in elections in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, where her party appeared to be losing its hold on the state Parliament. With another election coming May 13 in North Rhine-Westphalia, Ms. Merkel is not viewed as having much room domestically to compromise on the critical issues of inflation and debt limits.
"How Hollande handles Merkel could make or break his prospects for the next five years," said Francois Heisbourg of the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. "He has favorable circumstances, but she has domestic politics, too," he said, and she is seen as likely to agree only to symbolic changes in the fiscal pact -- not renegotiating it so much as adding clauses about growth to it.
Mr. Hollande, who may take over as president as early as May 14, will have little time to relax. He must travel to the United States for a meeting of the Group of 8 industrialized countries on May 18-19 and then a NATO summit meeting in Chicago on May 20-21, where he intends to make good on his promise to pull French combat troops out of Afghanistan by the end of this year, and where American and NATO officials will try to get him to change his mind.
Mr. Hollande's victory will also have important implications for the right in France, with Mr. Sarkozy's party already split between the prime minister, Francois Fillon, and the Sarkozy-like party leader, Jean-Francois Cope. The strong showing of Marine Le Pen of the National Front, who got nearly 18 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential election, is a serious threat to Mr. Sarkozy's party. It now must decide whether to make a deal with Ms. Le Pen for assembly seats in the second round of the legislative election; if not, the Union for a Popular Movement could lose up to 100 seats, political experts say.
Mr. Hollande campaigned on "change" and a more traditional presidency, where he would set the main course of policy but not micromanage day-to-day affairs, as Mr. Sarkozy did.
For the French, "it is a leap of faith that shows there is a strong will for a different policy course, not just at the national but at the E.U. level as well," said Paul Vallet, a professor of history and political science at the Paris-based Institut d'Etudes Politiques.
The indebted countries of Europe are also hoping that Mr. Hollande can be a champion buying them more time to adjust. "Some countries in Europe are banking on that," Mr. Vallet said.
Domestically, Mr. Hollande said he would raise taxes in a drive to balance the budget by 2017. He has vowed to raise the minimum wage, hire 60,000 more teachers over five years and lower the retirement age from 62 to 60 for manual workers who started their work as teenagers.
Voter turnout Sunday was about 81 percent of the 46 million registered voters, down from the 84 percent who participated in the last presidential ballot five years ago -- the highest turnout since 1974.
The French, voting under gray skies with some rain, expressed a sharp desire for change and a better economic future.
Nicole Hirsch, a 60-year-old retiree in the working-class 20th arrondissement of Paris, said she was voting for Mr. Hollande in the hope that he would "bring the change that France needs."
Claire, a 26-year-old engineer in Paris, agreed that change was needed, but still cast her ballot for Mr. Sarkozy. "I would like to believe in the Socialists' sweet dream, but unfortunately, it is not going to happen," she said, asking for privacy reasons not to use her last name. "Their program is unclear and not concrete."
Pierre Marcus, a 59-year-old civil servant, said his vote for Mr. Hollande was motivated by a hope that a Socialist government would take steps to promote economic growth and soften the blow of the crisis on average citizens. "Five years of Sarkozy dismantled social institutions," Mr. Marcus said. "I think that Hollande will reverse French politics in terms of employment and social issues."
Sebastien Modat, 38, who works in marketing, stopped his jog to get a newspaper. "I found that Hollande had the power to bring people together," he said. "The right was compelled to take up its traditional topics, creating tension among people."
But the main question, he said, "is how we are going to resume growth." He voted for Mr. Sarkozy five years ago, but on Sunday cast a blank ballot. "I hope there will be a change in mentalities and more consensus."

Full text: "IT'S a boy," Edward Teller exulted after the world's first hydrogen bomb exploded in 1952 with a force 1,000 times more powerful than the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
From the start, the nuclear era seethed with sexual allusions. Military officers joked about the phallic symbolism of their big missiles and warheads -- and of emasculating the enemy. "Dr. Strangelove" mocked the idea with big cigars and an excited man riding into the thermonuclear sunset with a bomb tucked between his legs.
Helen Caldicott, the antinuclear activist, argued in the 1980s that male insecurity accounted for the cold war's perilous spiral of arms. Her book? "Missile Envy."
Today, the psychosexual lens helps explain why North Korea, in addition to dire poverty and other crippling woes, faces international giggles over its inability to "get it up" -- a popular turn of phrase among bloggers and some headline writers.
"Things like this never go away," Spencer R. Weart, an atomic historian and director emeritus of the Center for History of Physics at the American Institute of Physics, said in an interview. "There's little doubt that missiles are phallic symbols. Everybody agrees on that."
On Friday, April 13, North Korea fired a big rocket on a mission to loft the nation's first satellite into orbit. But it fell back to Earth with a splash.
The flop was the latest in 14 years of fizzles and outright failures in North Korea's efforts to conduct showy tests of its long-range missiles and atom bombs. The blunders have damaged its military image and raised its profile among late-night comedians.
Arms controllers, more comfortable with technical minutiae than erotic imagery, nevertheless concede that North Korea now most likely stews with worries akin to those that can accompany sexual failure.
"It must be incredibly stressful," noted Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. He called it "performance anxiety."
Analysts say that a flustered North Korea might now be preparing to conduct its third nuclear test, after the rocket failure last month. They point to satellite indications of atomic test preparations. And North Korea resorted to underground blasts after botched rocket launchings in 2006 and 2009.
A psychoanalyst might see the shift from blastoff to blast as a weird kind of substitute gratification. The recent rocket failure came during the impoverished state's biggest holiday in decades -- the centenary of the birth of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung. The pressure for a face-saving spectacular is seen as correspondingly large.
A complication is that North Korea's nuclear establishment is facing fundamental changes that could thwart an easy comeback. It is running out of plutonium bomb fuel, and is seen as probably trying to switch to highly enriched uranium.
Atomic analysts differ on the likely makeup of the test device but agree that the country stands at a critical juncture in getting beyond the giggles -- if not the sexual innuendo.
"It was a huge loss of face," Mark Fitzpatrick, a senior nonproliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, an arms analysis group in London, said of last month's rocket failure. "It's almost certain they will double down by proceeding with a third nuclear test."
The odds of a new explosion rose on April 17 when North Korea scrapped a deal with Washington. In exchange for food, it had agreed to give up the enrichment of uranium and the testing of atom bombs and long-range rockets. Engineers use such tests to fix problems and verify advances, though most atomic states now adhere to a global nuclear test ban.
The big question is whether North Korea, if it moves ahead, will do a better job at shaking the ground locally and making the faraway needles of seismographs twitch.
During the cold war, nuclear foes used underground blasts to try to intimidate one another -- and perhaps to feel more manly. Moscow had a habit of popping bombs on the Fourth of July, including the holiday that marked the American bicentennial.
North Korea fired its first bomb on Oct. 9, 2006. Surprised analysts judged the yield to be less than one kiloton -- or equal to less than 1,000 tons of high explosives. By contrast, the first atomic blast of the United States was more than 20 times as powerful.
James R. Clapper, the director of national intelligence, recently told Congress that federal analysts had judged the explosion to be "a partial failure."
North Korea's second blast, on May 25, 2009, he added, "appeared to be more technically successful." Mr. Clapper stopped short of calling it a roaring success. Its yield, after all, was estimated at two kilotons. By contrast, China's second bomb was about 20 times stronger and Dr. Teller's hydrogen bomb about 5 million times more powerful.
Analysts see North Korea's switch to a new fuel as likely because in 2007 it shut down a reactor that made plutonium -- which fueled its first two atomic blasts.
"Why base anything else on plutonium if it's a dead end?" asked Siegfried S. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons lab who has repeatedly visited North Korea.
A move to highly enriched uranium -- or a mixture of the two bomb fuels, known as a composite core -- would let North Korea expand its ways of shaking the earth and perhaps, one day, of mounting warheads atop missiles to intimidate neighbors.
In 1983, President Ronald Reagan sought to reinvigorate the old metaphor by saying his Star Wars initiative would render enemy missiles "impotent and obsolete." Ever since, antimissile salesmen, including some with an eye on North Korea, have engaged in various degrees of threat inflation.
But some military analysts say it's quite possible that North Korea -- instead of mastering the difficult technologies and expanding its nuclear arsenal -- will continue to fail.
Jacques E. C. Hymans, who teaches international relations at the University of Southern California, argues in the current issue of Foreign Affairs that failed states like North Korea are doomed to poor workmanship, technical errors and finger pointing.
"These problems," he said, "cannot be fixed simply by bringing in more imported parts through illicit supply networks."
The phallic symbolism once centered on success. Nowadays, at least with North Korea, it seems as if it's more about dysfunction.

Full text: Before the Great Recession, I would sometimes give public lectures in which I would talk about rising inequality, making the point that the concentration of income at the top had reached levels not seen since 1929. Often, someone in the audience would ask whether this meant that another depression was imminent.
Well, whaddya know?
Did the rise of the 1 percent (or, better yet, the 0.01 percent) cause the Lesser Depression we're now living through? It probably contributed. But the more important point is that inequality is a major reason the economy is still so depressed and unemployment so high. For we have responded to crisis with a mix of paralysis and confusion -- both of which have a lot to do with the distorting effects of great wealth on our society.
Put it this way: If something like the financial crisis of 2008 had occurred in, say, 1971 -- the year Richard Nixon declared that "I am now a Keynesian in economic policy" -- Washington would probably have responded fairly effectively. There would have been a broad bipartisan consensus in favor of strong action, and there would also have been wide agreement about what kind of action was needed.
But that was then. Today, Washington is marked by a combination of bitter partisanship and intellectual confusion -- and both are, I would argue, largely the result of extreme income inequality.
On partisanship: The Congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein have been making waves with a new book acknowledging a truth that, until now, was unmentionable in polite circles. They say our political dysfunction is largely because of the transformation of the Republican Party into an extremist force that is "dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition." You can't get cooperation to serve the national interest when one side of the divide sees no distinction between the national interest and its own partisan triumph.
So how did that happen? For the past century, political polarization has closely tracked income inequality, and there's every reason to believe that the relationship is causal. Specifically, money buys power, and the increasing wealth of a tiny minority has effectively bought the allegiance of one of our two major political parties, in the process destroying any prospect for cooperation.
And the takeover of half our political spectrum by the 0.01 percent is, I'd argue, also responsible for the degradation of our economic discourse, which has made any sensible discussion of what we should be doing impossible.
Disputes in economics used to be bounded by a shared understanding of the evidence, creating a broad range of agreement about economic policy. To take the most prominent example, Milton Friedman may have opposed fiscal activism, but he very much supported monetary activism to fight deep economic slumps, to an extent that would have put him well to the left of center in many current debates.
Now, however, the Republican Party is dominated by doctrines formerly on the political fringe. Friedman called for monetary flexibility; today, much of the G.O.P. is fanatically devoted to the gold standard. N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard University, a Romney economic adviser, once dismissed those claiming that tax cuts pay for themselves as "charlatans and cranks"; today, that notion is very close to being official Republican doctrine.
As it happens, these doctrines have overwhelmingly failed in practice. For example, conservative goldbugs have been predicting vast inflation and soaring interest rates for three years, and have been wrong every step of the way. But this failure has done nothing to dent their influence on a party that, as Mr. Mann and Mr. Ornstein note, is "unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence, and science."
And why is the G.O.P. so devoted to these doctrines regardless of facts and evidence? It surely has a lot to do with the fact that billionaires have always loved the doctrines in question, which offer a rationale for policies that serve their interests. Indeed, support from billionaires has always been the main thing keeping those charlatans and cranks in business. And now the same people effectively own a whole political party.
Which brings us to the question of what it will take to end this depression we're in.
Many pundits assert that the U.S. economy has big structural problems that will prevent any quick recovery. All the evidence, however, points to a simple lack of demand, which could and should be cured very quickly through a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus.
No, the real structural problem is in our political system, which has been warped and paralyzed by the power of a small, wealthy minority. And the key to economic recovery lies in finding a way to get past that minority's malign influence.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The pace of appreciation of the Chinese currency against the dollar has slowed in the last year, ensuring that China's manipulation of its exchange rate remains a central topic as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner arrives in Beijing for the annual dialogue between the nations.
While praising the Chinese government for its progress, Treasury officials have promised to maintain the pressure.
"The process of correcting the misalignment of the exchange rate remains incomplete," Mr. Geithner said in a speech in April. "The Chinese currency needs to appreciate further against the dollar and the other major currencies."
The Chinese government has been holding back the pace of appreciation, which makes Chinese goods relatively more expensive and American goods relatively cheaper.
With bond yields spiraling in Italy and Spain last winter, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund warned of recessions across Europe, sluggish growth in the United States and Japan and the possibility of hard landings in fast-growing emerging economies, like China's.
Economic issues have been overshadowed by diplomatic ones in advance of Mr. Geithner's meetings Thursday, which will include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and officials from the upper echelons of the Chinese government. Last week, Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights lawyer, escaped from Chinese security forces and sought refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing. On Wednesday, he left the compound, but his fate remained unclear.
A senior administration official in the American delegation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid disturbing diplomatic relations, said that the incident had not seemed to disrupt the economic dialogue, even as it had taken some attention from it.
Officials on both sides, who had spent about two months negotiating before the meetings, were determined to pursue their respective agendas, and early sessions were congenial, the administration official said.
"Both sides are bending over backward to not make strong statements about the issue," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group. Mr. Peterson said in a call with reporters that he expected open talks but little progress.
Mr. Geithner's central goal is to encourage changes to make the Chinese currency and financial systems more responsive to market forces, with exchange rate and interest rate controls as main points of American concern.
The renminbi has appreciated about 30 percent against the dollar since 2005, adjusting for both economies' rates of inflation.
Beijing had halted the currency appreciation during the financial crisis from summer 2008 to mid-2010 to help increase the competitiveness of Chinese exporters and maintain China's rapid pace of economic growth. But the government allowed the currency to resume its upward drift in 2010, to applause from the Obama administration.
The rate of appreciation initially spiked. But about 18 months ago, it started to fall, and the currency remains too cheap relative to the dollar, according to the Congressional Research Service.
The American official taking part in the dialogue said that in response to the widespread worries, the Chinese government might have halted the renminbi's appreciation or even allowed the currency to fall in value relative to the dollar over the winter. But that did not happen, the official said, for which Washington gave China's government credit.
Moreover, last month the Chinese central bank widened the currency's trading band to a daily range of 1 percent from a range of 0.5 percent, letting market forces play a bigger role in determining the value of the currency versus the dollar.
The appreciation of the currency and other changes by the Chinese government have started to rebalance the country's economy.
China's current-account surplus, a measure of how much more the country exports than it imports, fell to less than 3 percent of economic output in 2011 from about 10 percent in 2010. Its trade surplus has fallen as well. And as the government has eased certain controls, more Chinese companies are investing overseas.
But an International Monetary Fund report released in April warned that the changes have not been a result of increased consumption as a share of Chinese economic output, which the fund and the Obama administration describe as vital for the world economy.
Instead, the results were because of trade and currency dynamics. "Sustainable rebalancing will depend on China's successful transition from investment-led to consumption-led growth," the report said.
The official said that given the brightening global outlook, Washington expected the currency appreciation to continue, and would press for that and a variety of economic and financial changes at the meeting.
In the April speech, Mr. Geithner focused on changing China's financial system: loosening state controls on interest rates, leveling the playing field so that private companies can compete with China's state-owned enterprises and allowing the value of the renminbi to be determined by market forces.
Progress on the currency issue is expected to be slow but consistent.
"For so long, that's been the flash point in the bilateral relationship," said William R. Cline, a former Treasury official now at the Peterson Institute. But the global recession seemed to convince China that absolute reliance on exports for growth was a "risky strategy," he said.
The administration has applauded China's efforts to let its currency appreciate, but it remains a hot-button issue in Washington.
The Senate last year passed a bill punishing China for undervaluing its currency but the bill never passed the House.
Moreover, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, has repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to name China as a "currency manipulator," a term the Obama administration has avoided.

Full text: WHILE continuing economic uncertainty around the world has rattled business confidence, it has not stopped companies -- from the smallest widget-maker to the largest financial institution -- from sending their battle-tested travelers back on the road this year.
Still, business travelers face a changed world. Corporate travelers are locked between a vexing economic recovery and rising travel costs. They face higher fares, steeper fees and new challenges to navigate, even as their corporations insist that employees stretch travel dollars more than ever.
Air travel drops corporate travelers into a land of a thousand perils. Airline mergers in recent years have reduced competition. Many flights have been canceled, forcing more passengers to connect at big and increasingly crowded hubs. With higher demand and higher costs, airlines have increased ticket prices, both in coach and in business class.
Hotels, too, have raised rates, and are increasingly following the airline business in charging extra fees for a variety of services, including in-room Wi-Fi and access to business centers.
Business travel is still growing this year, but corporations are being more cautious with their travel spending and enforcing greater adherence to travel policies.
"More businesspeople are traveling, but companies are being tighter with their budgets," said Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and a founder of the Atmosphere Research Group. "Travelers increasingly have to justify their trips, and trips have to be approved by more managers. They have to perform the equivalent of a return-on-investment analysis before they book."
Yet frustrated as corporate travelers may be, they have never been better armed for the hazards of life on the road.
Mobile technology provides them with up-to-date information and immediate access to a broad range of resources unimaginable just a few years ago. They can make or change plane, hotel or dinner reservations on the fly and perform a thousand other tasks, from boarding check-in to room checkout, all from digital devices.
This access to mobile technology promises in coming years to further change the travel experience and how businesses manage it, corporate travel experts said.
"You can't say enough about mobile technology and how an expanding and incredible amount of information is provided and available to travelers through their mobile devices and apps," said Jay Campbell, the editorial director of the BTN Group, which publishes Business Travel News, Travel Procurement magazine, and The Beat, a specialized newsletter, all aimed at corporate travel managers.
The last decade has been tough for business travel. Business trips have dropped by 22 percent since 2000, according to a study by the Global Business Travel Association. Yet travel spending has increased by 3.6 percent during that period, largely because travel has gotten more expensive. The association says that business travelers are making fewer trips and opting to stay fewer nights while maximizing their time in one place.
"Travel managers have to do more with less," the association said in its latest market survey report.
A report by American Express, released last year, found that American businesses probably cut back on corporate travel a lot more than was necessary in the downturn of 2007 through 2009. And these cutbacks, the report said, probably worsened the recession and "likely hampered business recovery in 2010 and beyond."
Since then, the recovery has been held back by a series of factors, including the Japanese tsunami and nuclear meltdown, the European debt crisis, renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Persian Gulf and a global rise in energy prices.
IHS Global Insight, an economic consulting firm, recently revised its forecast for global economic growth, saying it now expected the world economy to expand by 2.8 percent this year, up from the 2.7 percent rate it predicted in March. Global growth is expected to strengthen to 3.6 percent next year, the firm said, and reach 4.3 percent in 2014. But the forecast optimistically assumes a rebound in China and other emerging markets, a pickup in growth in the United States and the end to the recession in the euro zone.
After a timid uptick in 2010, business travel rebounded strongly last year. Airlines welcomed the return of business passengers, who account for the bulk of their revenue and helped the industry return to profitability. And they have fought as fiercely as ever for the company traveler's loyalty by refurbishing their planes with new seats in business class, renovated business lounges and improved service on board.
The International Air Transport Association said premium, or noncoach, travel rose by 6.3 percent in February, for instance, extending a trend that started last year.
"The performance of premium markets is once more being supported by improvements in the business environment, with both trade activity and business confidence increasing in recent months," the association said. "Better economic results in the U.S., for example, are supporting traffic across the North Atlantic as well as having positive impacts on trade partners, with revived demand for Asian consumer exports."
Michael W. McCormick, executive director of the Global Business Travel Association, said he expected travel spending by American businesses to grow this year to $260 billion, mostly thanks to domestic growth, while international spending remained relatively flat. That figure compares with $251 billion last year, and $234 billion in 2010. But in a reflection of the mixed outlook for business travel, corporations are expected to take fewer trips in 2012 and 2013, according to the group.
In 2010, American businesspeople took a total of 437 million trips. That figure rose to 445 million trips in 2011. But it is expected to drop to 440.4 million this year and 438.5 million next year as a result of fewer domestic trips. (International trips are still expected to grow, according to the forecast.)
"Full recovery in business travel spending will require a more sustainable economic environment, rather than the two-steps-forward-one-step-back pattern that has prevailed," the business travel association said in a recent report released with Visa.
Mr. McCormick said growth in business travel was stable, though slow. "Last year we were in recovery mode, but everybody was looking for the next bad thing to happen," he said. "I don't see this kind of concern anymore. Now, it's steady as she goes."
Travelers are also spending more on each of their trips. The average amount spent in 2000 was $422, and it grew to $564 by 2011. Two-thirds of that increase was because of inflation, and a third was a result of real increases in expenditures. But every dollar invested in business travel has historically brought in $20 in extra profits to American businesses.
"We're seeing road warriors taking fewer trips but making the most of them, making more stops and spending more on the road," Mr. McCormick said. "The productivity explosion is a huge factor, and it's being brought on by better travel management, better technology and making the most of their time on the road."
At the same time, travelers are facing a world of rising prices. The surge in oil costs this year is once more forcing airlines to raise fares, analysts said. The industry's recent mergers have also pared competition in some markets and allowed airlines to charge more.
The airline industry's financial outlook remains fragile. High oil prices are the biggest threat to the sector's profitability. They are forecast to average $115 a barrel this year, the International Air Transport Association said, and a new spike in prices could easily wipe out the industry's tenuous gains.
With slow economic growth, and very low profit margins for the airlines, "it will not take much of a shock to push the industry into the red for 2012," Tony Tyler, the director general and chief executive of the International Air Transport Association, said in a speech last month.
In 2011, average fares on domestic flights rose 10 percent, to $254, according to the American Express Business Travel Monitor. And prices keep on rising. Domestic fares averaged $261 in February, the latest month for which that data is available, compared with $250 in the same month last year, according to American Express. Hotel rooms are also going up: domestic nightly rates rose 3 percent on average, to $155, in February compared with last year.
International fares are soaring, too. Corporate fares for international flights from the United States averaged $2,240 in the first quarter this year, up from a recession low of $1,651 in the first quarter of 2009 and nearly double the rate of $1,190 for the same period in 2007, according to Travel G.P.A., which collects travel reservation data from 45,000 companies worldwide and produces scorecards on how well corporations maximize their travel spending.
"Travel budgets this year will be similar to last year's as companies focus on growing their businesses and get their travelers on the road," said Lane Dubin, a vice president and general manager for American Express Business Travel. "But prices are up. And this creates a dilemma. Companies need to be increasingly strategic about how they manage their travel."
The Travel Price Index, which includes the key travel components of the Consumer Price Index, measures travel inflation. It had strong growth in 2011, gaining 4 percent from the previous year, reflecting the price rises seen throughout the industry last year. The trend should moderate this year, although travel prices are still expected to rise by 2.2 percent.
This price inflation is forcing companies to tighten travel policies, said Rock Blanco, the president of Travel G.P.A.
Mr. Blanco said businesses did not pay much attention to travel policy enforcement from 2008 to 2011 because business travel slowed as the economy slowed. But with the return of business travel, companies know they must loosen the purse strings again, even as they are more focused on saving.
As a result, they are making sure employees adhere to company policies in booking air travel, which can mean buying tickets at least 14 days in advance, accepting the lowest fare even if it means a longer trip or a connecting flight and booking a lower grade of hotel or car rental.
Savings can be substantial, Mr. Blanco said. For instance, travel managers are increasingly asking employees to move down one hotel category, from the so-called Upper Upscale Hotel Tier, which includes brands like DoubleTree, Embassy Suites, Hilton and Hyatt Regency, to the Upscale Hotel Tier, which includes the brands Courtyard, Homewood Suites, Radisson and Residence Inn.
A midsize company with an annual travel budget of $5 million, including $1.1 million on hotels, could save $150,000 a year if just 5 percent of its hotel bookings were downgraded by one notch, Mr. Blanco said.
"If companies can get their employees to be more compliant, they can really maximize their savings," he said. "For a while, policy enforcement had lost its way. But it is back in vogue now."
Hotel chains have recognized the opportunity, said Mr. Harteveldt, the travel analyst. Holiday Inn, for instance, has completed a top-to-bottom refurbishment of its properties, with business travelers in mind. Likewise, Courtyard by Marriott and Hilton Garden Inn have undertaken redesigns recently, Mr. Harteveldt said.
"All this means that travelers can pretty much get a four-star experience in a three-star hotel," he said. "Of course it all depends on the kind of travel, and some of these hotels are probably better for a one-night stay than a three-night stay."
A recent report by Business Travel News found that 70 percent of 168 travel buyers surveyed from December 2011 to February 2012 said they had reviewed or tightened their expense policies. Three in five of businesses surveyed said they had introduced an online expense reimbursement system, according to Business Travel News, and more than half of the respondents had increased expense report auditing.
Corporations insist that each travel dollar has to go further these days, said Ron DiLeo, the executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.
"That's always been the biggest topic of conversation: each dollar, each euro, each yen gets scrutinized," he said. "If you are a wasteful business traveler, you will not be working at your company for a very long time."
But while emphasizing greater frugality, companies must adapt to new mobile technology and applications for travelers that are making their policies seem dated. New applications and Web sites like Kayak, FlightTrack, GateGuru, OpenTable and TripIt Pro help travelers manage their trips, find deals and look for the best place to dine or the cheapest fare to fly.
Corporations must learn how to embrace such innovations, not fight them, Mr. DiLeo said. Some are, notably Google, which allows employees to bank any savings they find on airfare or hotel rates and use them to upgrade a trip or spend an extra night.
Mr. Campbell, the BTN Group's editorial director, said there was a generational divide at play.
"The baby boomers who are still managing the travel departments of many companies don't feel they quite understand how the younger generation want or don't want to be connected with their company programs," he said.
Mr. DiLeo said: "You can't stop travelers using their apps or device of choice. You have to accept they do it and help them manage it."

China's Trade Imbalance Is Vanishing

Author: Porter, Eduardo

Abstract: Senators Charles E.

Full text: America's economic imbalance with China has been a singular concern of policy makers for more than half a decade. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Lindsey Graham wanted to punish China for pegging the exchange rate to the dollar in 2005 -- arguing that its policy of cheapening the currency to subsidize exports was fueling a huge trade surplus that cost America jobs.
Their bill never passed. But reducing China's surpluses has remained at the top of the bilateral agenda ever since.
Something unexpected has happened to China's economy, however. Its surplus with the rest of the world has largely disappeared.
China's imbalance with the United States is still likely to take center stage when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner sits down to the fourth round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue this week. But he will have a harder time making the case that America's trade deficit is somehow China's fault.
China's current-account surplus -- the broadest measure of its trade relations, which tracks how much more China exports in goods and services than it imports -- has plummeted. In 2007 it amounted to more than 10 percent of the entire Chinese economy.
By last year it had shrunk to about 2.8 percent. And the International Monetary Fund estimates it will decline to 2.3 percent of the nation's output in 2012, the smallest since 2001.
The United States' current-account deficit has shrunk, too, to 3.1 percent from 5.1 of American gross domestic product. Senator Schumer and colleagues nonetheless continue to attack China for its cheap currency. Last October the Senate passed a bill, which has yet to pass the House, to let American companies seek duties on Chinese imports to compensate for what is said to be an undervaluation.
Mitt Romney has promised that if he becomes president he will declare China guilty of currency manipulation, something which the Obama administration has declined to do and which would pave the way to slapping duties on Chinese exports.
But to hear leaders in Beijing, the problem is solved. In March, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, said the Chinese currency may "have reached its equilibrium level." China's currency manipulation is undisputed. The government tightly controls the exchange rate to preserve the competitiveness of Chinese exports. The manipulation has been at the core of a strategy that led China's merchandise exports to quintuple from 2000 to 2010, increasing its share of world exports by about 0.75 of a percentage point a year, according to the I.M.F.
Still, there is reason to think that China's economic strategy may be turning a corner. While its current-account surplus with the United States, $318 billion last year, was somewhat bigger than it was in 2007, China actually ran a big deficit with the rest of the world. China's vast takeover of world markets may be running out of steam.
"The rapid growth of China's export market share during the past decade was the result of a variety of factors that have largely run their course," noted the I.M.F.'s World Economic Outlook, published in April. These include cheap labor, multinationals' outsourcing of production to China, a huge jump in productivity and China's 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, which limited the ability of other countries to stop its exports.
There is scattered evidence. China's wages have been rising over the last decade -- about 10 percent a year in real terms, according to Nicholas R. Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The combination of climbing Chinese wages and transportation costs has led American companies, including General Electric and Master Lock, to reassess their global production lines and move some production back to the United States.
Though China has only slowly loosened its grip on the exchange rate, the appreciation is greater than it might appear at first sight. Nominally, China's renminbi has risen 8 percent against the dollar since June of 2010. But factoring in China's higher inflation, it has gained about 13 percent. And it has appreciated about 40 percent in real terms since 2005.
This is making a difference. The I.M.F. forecasts that China's surplus will rebound gradually to 4.25 percent of the country's output by 2017. But it noted that if the renminbi continues to gain -- either through faster appreciation or sustained higher inflation -- the surplus will be smaller.
Skepticism is warranted, of course. It is too soon to know whether these changes really mean China is turning a page in its development strategy. The I.M.F.'s central forecast is that China's share of world markets will keep growing at the same rate as in recent years.
An important reason the surplus shrank in China is that the global recession clipped consumer spending in its main export markets in the United States and Europe. China's own reaction to the global contraction -- a huge buildup of roads, rail and other public infrastructure alongside a wave of cheap lending for private investment in construction and other projects -- sucked in imports rapidly.
These factors are unwinding. What is more, the investment boom could help Chinese companies gain share in new, high-tech markets where they did not compete before. In the wind energy industry, for example, China now has about 6 percent of world exports, up from almost zero five years ago.
Still, China has not adopted many of the reforms that economists suggest are needed to lay the groundwork for a new phase of development that relies less on exports to other countries and depends more on the spending of the Chinese themselves. To do this, wages and incomes must rise.
The government must bolster the social safety net -- providing better pensions and health care to Chinese families so they do not have to save every last penny in case of a rainy day. And interest rates on bank deposits -- which the government keeps artificially low to reduce its borrowing costs and provide cheap credit to industry -- must rise too, so consumers can get a return on their savings.
Despite these uncertainties, the goal of a more balanced Chinese economy is closer than it has been in at least a decade.
Some effects of the global recession will linger. Exports of machines and equipment to the United States, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of China's export growth early in the last decade, will not recover until the American housing market does. And China's terms of trade will get worse as the price of energy and the other raw materials it imports keeps rising even as the electronic devices and other machines it exports keep getting cheaper.
China has already saturated markets in many of the low-tech goods it makes -- toys, for example. And gaining new markets in higher-tech goods against established rivals is likely to become increasingly difficult.
And weird as this may seem for a country of 1.4 billion people, China is looking at a labor shortage down the road that will start increasing wages ahead of productivity growth, eroding China's competitive edge. Its working-age population is expected to peak and start shrinking within five years, partly as a result of the one-child policy that depressed birthrates and accelerated the aging of the population.
China's backward farm economy will continue shedding workers for a few years, adding to the urban labor force. Still, Chinese factories on the coast are having a harder time drawing workers from the agricultural hinterland in the west. That is partly because rising food prices are raising farm incomes. And it is partly because living conditions are grim in Chinese cities, where workers must make do without a social safety net.
Whether China's economy stays on a more balanced keel is important for the entire world, which is struggling with weak consumer demand after a deep recession. It is also important for China -- whose reliance on exports to drive employment and growth is distorting the economy, repressing consumer demand, feeding a surge in unproductive investment and loading banks with dubious loans.
China's economy is in a peculiar spot. Its surplus has shrunk drastically, but without any of the reforms needed to transform China into more of a consumer economy that relies less on exports. In fact, household consumption has fallen consistently as a share of the economy since the early 1990s.
This path leads nowhere good. Further investment booms may continue to shrink China's trade surplus. But they come at a high cost: more resources wasted on empty buildings and unused roads.
Fortunately, China's leaders appear to understand the need to change. The 12th five-year plan begun last year is centered on the goal of raising family incomes, shifting to an economy more reliant on the production of services and building the kind of safety net that gives the Chinese people the confidence to spend some of their vast savings.
If these reforms are actually made, China could be on a more sustainable path of economic growth that would increase the well-being of regular Chinese. And American senators would have to blame somebody else for the nation's trade deficit.

Abstract: Infants in the study spent an average of 16 days in the hospital, usually in neonatal intensive care units, which are especially expensive because of the specialized nursing care. Since 2000, the length of time infants spend in the hospital has not decreased, suggesting that doctors have not yet learned how to make treatment for withdrawal more efficient, said Dr. Stephen Patrick, an author of the study and a neonatologist in the University of Michigan Health System.

Full text: The fast-growing abuse of prescription drugs has reached maternity wards in hospitals across the country, with the number of pregnant women addicted to opiate drugs -- and the number of babies born experiencing withdrawal symptoms -- rising sharply over the last decade.
A new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association has quantified the growth of the problem for the first time, as well as the increase in the costs of treating these newborns.
The study estimated that every hour a baby is born in the United States with symptoms of withdrawal from opiates -- roughly 13,500 babies a year. The condition, known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, can cause seizures, breathing problems, dehydration, difficulty feeding, tremors and irritability. Many infants are hospitalized for several weeks while doctors treat them with methadone or morphine to gradually wean them from their dependence on the drugs that their mothers used.
"The incidence has gone crazy and I think it has the potential to become a national or international issue," said Marie J. Hayes, a clinical neuroscientist at the University of Maine, and an author of an editorial accompanying the study. "People who previously might not have used heroin or the needle are more likely to use prescription opiates."
It is unclear whether babies exposed to opiates in the womb will experience long-term consequences. In the 1980s, there was alarm over whether babies born to cocaine-addicted mothers would suffer developmental problems or other damaging effects, but studies later showed that such problems were far from certain and much more likely if the child had to contend with economic hardship, family instability, poor education and other factors.
The new study looked at two large databases that included a representative sample of patients from across the country and found that the number of pregnant mothers using opiate drugs jumped fivefold from 2000 to 2009. The number of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome nearly tripled in the same period. The average cost of taking care of each infant climbed to $53,400 from $39,400, adjusted for inflation. Medicaid paid for more than three-quarters of the cases, since many of the women were low-income.
"These babies require a tremendous amount of nursing care," said Dr. Mark Hudak, chairman of pediatrics at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Jacksonville and an author of new guidelines on neonatal abstinence syndrome issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics this year.
Infants in the study spent an average of 16 days in the hospital, usually in neonatal intensive care units, which are especially expensive because of the specialized nursing care. Since 2000, the length of time infants spend in the hospital has not decreased, suggesting that doctors have not yet learned how to make treatment for withdrawal more efficient, said Dr. Stephen Patrick, an author of the study and a neonatologist in the University of Michigan Health System.
"Are there other places in the hospital that can treat them?" like standard pediatric wards or outpatient clinics, Dr. Patrick asked. "Are there different medications or ways to treat them?"
Dr. Hudak recommends trying to soothe babies first by cuddling them and placing them in darkened rooms. If that is unsuccessful, the newborns are given methadone, morphine or another drug related to what the baby was exposed to in utero; the drug is tapered off gradually until the baby is weaned. That process requires careful monitoring. "These drugs are very easy to overdose babies with," Dr. Hudak said. "There have been deaths." And if babies are weaned too soon, "they can wind up getting rehospitalized."
Still, despite the risks, studies suggest it is more effective to give the babies a drug related to what their mothers were taking, rather than just treating the symptoms of the babies' withdrawal -- seizures and breathing problems, for example, said Hendree E. Jones, a Johns Hopkins University researcher in psychiatry and behavioral sciences.
But the experts agreed that the best approach is to deal with women's drug addictions before they are pregnant.

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans increased their spending more slowly in March, suggesting that some people were worried that their paychecks were not growing fast enough.
The Commerce Department said Monday that consumer spending increased just 0.3 percent in March after a 0.9 percent gain in February.
Personal income grew 0.4 percent following a 0.3 percent gain in February. But after-tax income when adjusted for inflation increased just 0.2 percent in March. The gain followed two months of declines.
Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic growth, rose 2.9 percent in the January-to-March quarter -- the fastest pace in more than a year. The increase was a bright spot in an otherwise weak first quarter for economic growth.
But Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, noted that stronger spending in January and February drove the quarterly increase. And consumers spent more while saving less, which suggests they cannot sustain their spending pace without higher pay.
"Real incomes will need to grow at a faster rate to prevent consumption growth from slowing," Mr. Dales said. He noted that Friday's report on April hiring was a crucial sign of where the economy was headed.
The government reported Friday that the overall economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the January-to-March quarter. That is down from 3 percent annual growth in the October-to-December period. The weakness mainly reflected government budget-cutting and weaker business investment.
In March, consumers spent 0.9 percent more on nondurable goods, like clothing. Spending on durable goods, like cars and appliances, fell 0.3 percent.
An inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a modest 0.2 percent in March. Over the last 12 months, the index is up 2.1 percent, just above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target
Some economists worry consumers cannot keep spending as freely as they did in the first three months of this year without bigger pay raises. After-tax income rose just 0.6 percent in the first three months compared with a year earlier. That was the smallest pay increase in two years.
The savings rate crept up to 3.8 percent in March, after dropping to a 30-month low of 3.7 percent of after-tax income in February.
In a separate report on Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its business activity index for Chicago and the Midwest dropped to 56.2 in April, its lowest level in more than two years. This was the index's second decline in two months.
A healthy job market could reinvigorate consumers. But the economy created just 120,000 jobs -- half the pace of the previous three months.
Economists forecast that employers added 163,000 jobs in April, slightly better than March's figures but below the pace from December through February.
A positive change since the winter was that gas prices appear to have peaked. That would give consumers more money to spend elsewhere.

Full text: TEHRAN -- For Iranians, whose country's borders have shrunk in the past 200 years after wars and unfavorable deals by corrupt shahs, territorial issues are a delicate matter. So a renewed claim by the United Arab Emirates to the tiny island of Abu Musa in the Persian Gulf has touched a raw nerve.
But many here say that may just be the point.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his reactionary agenda tend to be unpopular among the urban middle classes, but he is enjoying a rare surge of support even in those inhospitable quarters in the growing dispute with Iran's Persian Gulf neighbors -- one that he touched off by making a surprise visit to the island last month, a first by an Iranian president.
Other Iranian politicians have rushed to embrace the controversy, aware of how it is playing at home.
A parliamentary delegation made a high-profile visit to the island on Sunday to observe Iran's National Day of the Persian Gulf, a normally low-key event, which seems bound to further inflame the issue. Other legislators have called for the establishment of a Persian Gulf province, and want the Tehran street that the United Arab Emirates Embassy is on renamed Abu Musa.
For many Iranians, the dispute over Abu Musa, a four-square-mile spit of sand with about 2,000 inhabitants and surrounded by pristine blue waters, arouses strong nationalistic feelings at a time of general hopelessness over the devastating impact of a grinding economy, foreign sanctions and a feeling of unprecedented isolation. To that extent, it mirrors Iran's nuclear program, which has also whipped up nationalistic emotions that Mr. Ahmadinejad has used to build support for the government.
"We Iranians continuously fight and disagree like a husband and wife during a nasty divorce," Somaye Allahdad, 35, a Tehran homemaker who does not always agree with Mr. Ahmadinejad's policies, said over a family lunch of traditional lamb kebab and sabzi, a sort of herbal stew. "But when someone tries to take away our child, we team up and face the threat."
Mr. Ahmadinejad's visit to Abu Musa, where he spoke to an audience of sun-tanned Iranian fishermen, prompted angry reactions from Arab states on the western shore of the Persian Gulf, which rejected his assertion that the island is occupied by Iran. That, too, may have been part of the plan, some Iranians believe.
"Be sure that Ahmadinejad saw those angry Arab reactions coming," said Mrs. Allahdad's aunt, who would not give her name. "He needs distraction from his internal problems."
If that was the plan, it seems to be working. On Sunday, the Facebook page of the Saudi leader, King Abdullah, was closed after tens of thousands of Iranians had left the slogan "Persian Gulf forever" in the comments section of his latest post.
At Mrs. Allahdad's lunch, several relatives, none of whom had voted for the president, debated loudly over his intentions, the continuing scourge of inflation and the effects of sanctions imposed by the West because of Iran's nuclear program. But all concluded that Mr. Ahmadinejad had done the right thing by visiting Abu Musa.
Mrs. Allahdad spoke of her father, who died on the front lines during the eight-year war with Iraq when she was a young girl in 1981. "We defended every inch of our nation with our lives, and now we should give the Arabs our island? Over my dead body," she said.
Tensions in the Persian Gulf have always run high, but with Iran jockeying for the position of regional power and recent weapons purchases by Saudi Arabia and the emirates worth more than $100 billion, the dispute over the island takes on added significance.
According to a 1971 memorandum of understanding between Iran and the emirate of Sharjah, the island and its energy resources are to be divided between the two. By agreeing to the pact, the tiny emirate prevented an invasion by Iran, which two days earlier had taken two other disputed islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, which were even smaller and uninhabited.
Iran has stoutly defended its actions, saying all three islands were Iranian territory until Britain occupied them in 1908. The United Arab Emirates say most of the inhabitants of Abu Musa have been Arab for centuries. In 1980, the emirates took their claim to the United Nations Security Council, which rejected it. Most of the island's infrastructure like roads and schools, including a university, have been built by Iran, and Abu Musa's governor is Iranian.
One Iranian analyst sympathetic to the government said the ownership issue had surfaced now as part of the Western campaign to pressure Iran over its nuclear program, which it says is peaceful but the West suspects is a cover for developing weapons.
"The emirates are not acting independently in this matter," said the analyst, Sadollah Zarei, 55, a columnist for the hard-line state Kayhan newspaper. "Bigger powers are behind this."
He said the West was trying to raise the pressure on Tehran ahead of the second round of nuclear talks between Iran and world powers, scheduled for May 23.
"By driving up tensions in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. and their allies are trying to send a message to Iran: back down, or face pressure on other fronts," Mr. Zarei said.
Whatever the reason for the resurfacing of the Abu Musa claims, many here agree the Iranian collective psyche can be wounded by even the smallest verbal threat to the nation's territorial integrity. History has not smiled on Iran, which has lost territory in the Caucasus, Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Bahrain after wars with Russia and highly unfavorable land sales by a succession of shahs, among other things.
"In the past 200 years, our territory has been taken from us bit by bit," said Mohammad Esmael Heydari, 68, a retired journalist. He also pointed out that the Soviet Union and Britain invaded Iran during World War II.
"Such incidents are not quickly forgotten here," he said.
"We do not want to lose any more territory. No more."
While the Persian Gulf is a handy motive for stirring up nationalist support, there is also an ethnic element to the appeal, as Mrs. Allahdad explained after lunch. "These Arabs pretend as if they rule the region, but they have no history, and no independence, like Iran," she said. "They have no right to look down upon us."
For three years, Mrs. Allahdad and her family lived on the Iranian island of Kish, where her husband was working. Mrs. Allahdad confided that in all that time she had never made an effort to visit Abu Musa, even though it was quite near. There was no point, she said, because she had been told it was a barren place where there was nothing to do.
"I don't need to go there," she said. "All that matters is that it is Iranian."

Full text: EUROPE is hitting another rough patch. But this time, the troubles have barely rattled world financial markets. That's a huge change.
Even though events in the United States precipitated some of the most acute stages of the 2007-8 financial crisis -- the Lehman Brothers collapse is a prime example -- the crisis in Europe has been the fulcrum on which world markets have pivoted over the last couple of years.
"We've seen world markets trade in unison to an astonishing degree," said Stacy Williams, an HSBC strategist in London, in a telephone conversation last week. "Worries about the risk of a meltdown in Europe have been the main factor in the risk-on, risk-off phenomenon." Global markets are tightly synchronized, he said, and they are still moving up and down primarily in reaction to short-term risk assessments.
For the moment, however, they haven't responded dramatically to events in Europe, one way or another. It's as if traders can't decide whether to add to their bets or head for the exits. For now, at least, markets are moving sideways.
It's not as if the European economy is suddenly flourishing. To the contrary. Government statistics released in London last week, for example, suggested that Britain's fiscal austerity program has helped to plunge that country back into recession. While there are pockets of prosperity, the economy of the European Union as a whole contracted in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Eurostat. Many forecasters believe that a recession in the region is under way.
Economic pain and fiscal austerity led to the fall of the Dutch government last week, and are threatening the chances of Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, in next weekend's runoff against Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate. Sovereign bond yields in Spain, which finds itself at the heart of the euro zone crisis, are testing the 6 percent level, a sure sign of serious trouble. Bailouts are already under way in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, while Italy remains in a precarious state.
But how have world markets reacted to all this? With a sigh and a collective shrug. Stocks rose last week in London, Paris and Frankfurt, and with the help of reassuring comments from the Federal Reserve, they did in New York as well.
Larry Kantor, head of research for Barclays, said the European Central Bank is largely responsible for the benign market response to Europe's latest troubles. Through March, he said, the central bank has injected 1.153 trillion euros, approximately $1.52 trillion, into the European banking system, and much of that money has been used to buy sovereign debt, driving down yields and reducing some pressure on embattled governments and on the region's broader economy.
"In November there was the risk of a real credit freeze," Mr. Kantor said. Lack of bank lending actually "tipped the euro area into recession," he said. "The injection by the E.C.B. was very important, and it really takes a lot of that disaster scenario off the table."
He said that Europe would be struggling to resolve its financial problems for years, but that the "pragmatic" approach of the European Central Bank under its new president, Mario Draghi, has given the markets much comfort.
"For the short term, at least," he said, "much of the tail risk has been removed."
NONE of which is to minimize the fundamental challenges ahead for Europe, where frictions are mounting over the wisdom of the prevailing orthodoxy of fiscal austerity aimed at bringing down government debt loads.
In France, Mr. Hollande favors including a more Keynesian solution, involving government stimulus aimed at promoting growth and government revenue. Mr. Draghi, who has been firmly in the austerity camp, last week shifted his rhetoric modestly, calling for a "growth compact" in parallel with the European Union's fiscal treaty, which limits budget deficits and national debt.
"We need to actively step up our reflections about the longer-term vision for Europe as we have done in the past at other defining moments in the history of our union," Mr. Draghi told members of the European Parliament in Brussels. But he made it clear that he envisioned "structural reforms" intended to make European economies more competitive, rather than greater government spending. That is an approach that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, also favors.
The United States faces similar issues, of course, but its economy, while hardly robust, is now growing more rapidly than most of Europe's. Gross domestic product rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter, according to Commerce Department figures released on Friday. That's less than Wall Street had expected.
The economy is weak enough that Fed policy makers on Wednesday reiterated their commitment to hold short-term interest rates, now near zero, at "exceptionally low levels" for an extended period. They didn't embark on any new unorthodox programs to stimulate the economy, but according to Barclays calculations, the Fed's various quantitative easing efforts expanded its balance sheet by $2.35 trillion.
These balance-sheet operations, on top of the rock-bottom interest rates, have had an extremely stimulative effect, amounting to the theoretical equivalent of a Fed benchmark interest rate of approximately negative 4 percent, according to Thomas Lam, an economist at the OSK-DMG Group in Singapore.
Clearly, Fed policy makers remain on high alert, although their assessment of the domestic economy was slightly more upbeat than their previous forecast, in January. On average, they predicted last week that G.D.P. would grow 2.65 percent in 2012, an increase of 0.2 percentage point from their January estimate. The inflation rate will remain under the Fed's target of 2 percent for the year, they estimated, and the unemployment rate will drop slightly, to 7.9 percent from its current 8.2 percent, according to Fed figures compiled by UBS Investment Research.
In a news conference on Wednesday, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said the central bank "will not hesitate" to take further action as needed to support the economy. Mr. Kantor said the markets might view that promise as "a kind of extension of the Bernanke put" -- a guarantee of intervention should data deteriorate sharply -- which should give traders some solace.
With election campaigns under way in the United States as well as in Europe, major new economic initiatives are unlikely for now, whether they amount to fiscal austerity or fiscal stimulus. If the markets remain calm in the interim, it may be mainly thanks to the influence of the central banks.

In a very positive move, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have greatly increased their rescue funds over the past month. [...]if the authorities put their seal of approval on more gradual fiscal consolidation plans and stand ready to support troubled countries if needed, market interest rates on the countries' debts will most likely come down.

Full text: EUROPEAN policy makers just don't get it. To hear them talk, you'd think that Europe was on the right path. Troubled countries just need more of the same, they say -- more fiscal austerity, more labor market flexibility, more price stability -- and the European crisis will be licked.
Have they looked at their own numbers? It has been two years since moves to austerity started, but the crisis is still with us. Growth in European gross domestic product was negative in the last quarter of 2011. Unemployment in the entire euro zone in February was 10.8 percent; in Spain it was an astounding 23.6 percent. And judging from the renewed turbulence in bond markets, investors don't believe that prosperity is just around the corner.
Fiscal austerity is normally a sensible response to a loss in confidence in a country's solvency, as has occurred in parts of Europe. But the current situation is exceptional. Short-term interest rates are very low, so large rate reductions to offset the negative impact of budget cutting are impossible.
In addition, the troubled countries of Europe are part of a common currency area. This means that the other obvious tool for stimulating growth during a time of fiscal austerity -- depreciating the currency relative to that of their main trading partners -- is not available, either.
The result is that austerity is uniquely destructive right now. Indeed, because of the harsh effect of budget cutting on growth, debt-to-G.D.P. ratios in Europe have continued to rise.
If stringent belt-tightening isn't the answer, what is? It's not to just ignore the deficit. Many European countries have long-run fiscal situations that are unsustainable and must be dealt with.
The core of a more sensible approach is to pass the needed budget measures now, but to phase in the actual tax increases and spending cuts only gradually -- as economies recover. To use economists' terminology, the measures should be backloaded.
They should also be specific -- no more deficit targets without specifying how they'll be achieved. Instead, lay out right now whose taxes will be raised and what spending will be cut. And specify when the measures will take effect -- either along a set schedule, or tied explicitly to indicators of economic recovery.
BUT can such plans actually work? What's to stop policy makers from promising the moon and not delivering?
History shows that countries have done such gradual consolidations before. In 1983, for example, the United States passed a Social Security reform plan that was backloaded in the extreme: it specified tough changes, including higher taxes and increases in the retirement age, to be phased in over almost three decades. They've all occurred on schedule and without debate. Likewise, in 1995, Sweden laid out a plan to cut its deficit by a whopping 8 percent of G.D.P. over the next three years. It worked as intended. Australia did the same thing on a somewhat smaller scale starting a year later.
Once legislation is on the books, politicians, even from opposing parties, have little incentive to change it. Why mess with a consolidation that's already last year's -- or sometimes the last decade's -- news?
But what about bond markets? Don't fiscal consolidation plans need to put the pain up front to persuade investors that they're serious? After all, a number of European countries desperately need their borrowing rates to fall.
Investors, however, are very aware that low growth and high unemployment devastate a country's fiscal outlook. I did the simple exercise of looking at news reports after the biggest increases in Spanish government bond interest rates over the last year. The most common cause was concern about whether European leaders would take needed measures to help troubled countries. But in about a third of the cases, bad news about Spanish growth was viewed as the culprit.
Markets don't want counterproductive measures. For credibility, what matters is the nature and the composition of the tax and spending measures, and the clarity of the phase-in schedule.
Other steps could help bring markets along and allow distressed countries to follow a more gradual approach. In a very positive move, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have greatly increased their rescue funds over the past month. Thus, if the authorities put their seal of approval on more gradual fiscal consolidation plans and stand ready to support troubled countries if needed, market interest rates on the countries' debts will most likely come down.
If that doesn't work, the European Central Bank could effectively cap the cost of borrowing for countries like Italy or Spain by buying large amounts of their bonds. If this were done after the countries had enacted specific, backloaded consolidation plans, the risk to the central bank would be manageable.
More generally, the European Central Bank could take further expansionary action. For example, it could reduce its benchmark interest rate, which is not yet at zero, and pursue quantitative easing by buying a range of assets. Any measure that would raise European growth even a little would make it easier for troubled countries to get their budget deficits under control.
Expansionary monetary policy could also help these countries to become more competitive. European policy makers talk about structural reforms -- increasing labor market flexibility and reducing regulation -- as the way to reduce wages and costs. But when overall inflation in Europe is very low, this strategy requires wages in troubled countries to fall, which rarely happens. If the European Central Bank aimed for slightly higher overall inflation -- say, 3 percent -- for a few years, these countries could become more competitive just by holding wage growth below that of their trading partners. That would help them to grow by increasing their exports.
FINALLY, countries that are not in distress, both inside and outside Europe, could help by stimulating their own economies. For example, Germany has a relatively modest long-run deficit and an enormous trade surplus. A tax cut for German consumers would raise domestic growth at a time when it's anemic, and increase imports from its neighbors, helping them to grow as well.
What about the United States, which faces a terrible long-run budget problem, but no immediate threats from the bond market? The best policy here is to combine the backloaded consolidation I'm recommending for troubled countries with the short-run stimulus I'm advocating for countries like Germany. We could enact something like the Bowles-Simpson plan to reduce the deficit sharply over 10 years, and include in it more near-term investment in infrastructure, education and scientific research.
This would lower unemployment faster, and put us on a path to fiscal health. And, by strengthening our growth, it would help the world economy, too.
These policies are nuanced, so they are easily caricatured as doing something with one hand and undoing it with the other. Their key element is dynamics -- using credible plans to lower borrowing costs and address long-run fiscal problems, while not taking immediate austerity measures that would raise unemployment when what countries need most is growth.
Current measures aren't working. Sooner or later, politicians and citizens will demand a strategy that does.

Full text: The economic recovery slowed more than expected early this year, raising fears of a spring slowdown for the third year in a row and giving Republicans a fresh opportunity to criticize President Obama's policies.
The United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter, down from 3 percent at the end of last year, according to a preliminary report released Friday. It was the first deceleration in a year, but it was not nearly as severe as other setbacks in the last couple of years.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been hammering on economic issues all week, insisting that the president has held back the recovery and intends to do further damage.
But the White House focused on the bright spots in the report, like solid growth in consumer spending and a surge in residential building.
"When you look at the report in the totality, I think it shows that the private sector is continuing to heal from the financial crisis," said Alan Krueger, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Congress should pass elements of the president's jobs plan, he said, like one that would subsidize the employment of teachers and first responders to emergencies. "We would like to see the pace of economic growth pick up, and those additional measures which the president proposed are well targeted to the areas of weakness in the economy now."
Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, called the numbers "beyond disappointing."
"The damage being done by the Obama administration's policies have produced a weak recovery," he wrote in a statement.
The American economy has been growing since the second half of 2009, coming close to a 4 percent growth rate in early 2010 before faltering. Growth slowed nearly to a halt in the first quarter of 2011 but accelerated throughout the rest of the year.
The first-quarter growth was weaker than expected. United States stock markets largely shrugged it off, however, perhaps in part because the country is growing while many economies are contracting.
Economists initially predicted a much weaker showing in the latest quarter, partly because of a large accumulation of inventories in the fall and winter that needed to be worked off. But in the last few weeks, expectations rose on strong jobs reports and rising consumer confidence.
Consumer spending did turn out to be the major strength early this year, growing 2.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent in the last quarter of 2011. Business investment, which had been a bright spot, declined in the most recent quarter.
Government spending also fell more than anticipated, lopping more than half a percentage point off total growth, thanks in part to a particularly large drop in military outlays.
Many economists pointed out that consumer spending, mostly on cars and other large items, seemed to have come at a cost. Consumer savings declined. That suggests that spending growth could become unsustainable as households exhaust their reserves. But estimates of personal income tend to be revised upward, and past declines in the savings rate have been erased by later estimates.
Economists were also troubled by the decline in business investment. Businesses spent more on equipment and software but much less on infrastructure. Some of that decrease was expected because a tax break for capital investment expired at the end of the year.
By far the steepest decline in investment in the first quarter was in construction related to mining, oil and gas, while manufacturers actually increased their spending on factories and office buildings.
Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics said the low investment numbers showed that businesses remained "very cautious."
Growth in residential housing swelled by 19 percent, the fourth consecutive increase in that much-diminished sector and the first time it has shown a straight year of growth since 2005. Economists argued over how much of that increase -- and, for that matter, the surprising strength in consumer spending -- was caused by the unseasonably warm winter.
Other factors that contributed to the growth have already appeared to soften, contributing to fears of another false dawn. Shipments of durable goods increased last month, but new orders showed the steepest drop since January 2009. The trade balance improved, but job growth weakened and, more recently, new claims for unemployment benefits have risen.
"The G.D.P. report was disappointing," economists at Morgan Stanley wrote. "The mix of activity pointed to slower growth ahead."
But Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics dismissed fears of another significant slowdown, saying that last year's hiccup was the result of a series of external shocks, like a spike in gas prices (this year's was less severe and is already subsiding) and the Japanese earthquake.
"What have we got this year that's comparable?" he asked. "Nothing. Europe is sort of a constant rather than a variable now."
A growth rate of 2.2 percent is barely enough to nudge the unemployment rate down, and it is substantially lower than the 3 percent that is considered the comfort zone for incumbent presidents.
"I don't think the issue is whether or not the growth rate is sustainable," said Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. "I think the question is whether the growth rate that's sustainable is acceptable -- politically and socially acceptable."
Still, 2.2 percent was enough to generate envy in Europe, where many countries are already in recession and where this week Britain announced that it had entered the dreaded "double dip." Stagnation in Europe and a slowing of China's breakneck expansion have weakened global demand even as corporate profits have continued to outpace expectations.
