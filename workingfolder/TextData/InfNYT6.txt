Full text: Italian political dysfunction is nothing new. Italian political dysfunction that ripples through global financial markets and has the potential to upend Europe is something the world woke up to Tuesday morning.
What are markets really signaling, and how much danger is there for the global economy? To answer, it helps to tease apart the crosscurrents between Italian politics, European institutions, financial markets and economies worldwide.
The New Political Risk in Italy
The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, rejected an anti-E.U. nominee for economy minister, setting the stage for elections later in the year that, if a recent pattern repeats, could put in place a parliamentary majority that is hostile to European institutions.
In effect, those events have made it more likely that there will be a showdown between authorities in Rome and officials in Brussels, Berlin and Frankfurt over deficit spending, with an unraveling of the European Union one potential outcome, even if not the most likely one.
New Italian elections would help decide whether that is the case. In the last elections, in March, populist parties skeptical of European institutions won a comfortable majority of seats in parliament, but included both right-wing and left-wing parties that have struggled since then to form a coalition.
If the populists maintain or expand their advantages in elections, it raises the prospect of serious friction between Italian politicians looking to increase spending and a European Commission, European Central Bank and German government that insist upon fiscal austerity as a condition for, among other things, continued E.C.B. purchases of Italian bonds.
As a result, the European Union is entering yet another perilous phase, after years of crises that started in Greece nine years ago. No one would confuse the latest events with the high drama of the eurozone crisis from 2010 to 2012. But the ultimate stakes are higher. Italy is a much more populous country than Greece, more at the core of the European Union, and with much higher public debt.
What the Markets Are Telling Us
The movements Tuesday -- a spike in Italian bond yields, and drops in the euro and stocks worldwide -- suggest that the risk of some calamitous outcome for Europe has risen after a weekend of political drama in Rome, but that it's still an unlikely outcome.
So far, there are few signs of "contagion effects," in which developments in Italy could create a self-fulfilling crisis in other countries with similar economic challenges. But Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.
The Italian government's borrowing costs for two years soared from 0.94 percent to 2.42 percent Tuesday, as investors demanded greater compensation against the risk that the Italian government might repay them not with the rock-solid euro but with less valuable newly issued currency.
Meanwhile, Spanish two-year bond yields rose only slightly Tuesday -- by 0.07 percentage points, not the 1.48 percentage points of Italian yields.
"The contagion has been really muted," said Megan Greene, global chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. "I think investors are correctly looking at this as an Italy-specific risk for now."
Bond investors seem pretty well persuaded that the issue here is not a broad a loss of confidence in South European nations' ability to pay their debts. Since 2012, the European Central Bank has instilled confidence that it is willing to do "whatever it takes" -- to use the memorable phrase of the E.C.B. president Mario Draghi -- to preserve the euro.
Europe's Dilemma
What is happening in Italy is more a political crisis than a financial one. Mr. Draghi's tools are helpful only when a country's elected leaders are trying to avoid crisis. They are of little use if a government truly wants to break away from the rest of Europe.
Other European countries, especially powerful Germany, will have little desire to subsidize what they view as fiscal profligacy in Italy. The push toward greater economic unity across Europe since the Greek crisis has included jointly guaranteeing the continent's banks and the E.C.B.'s purchase of government bonds.
If there is conflict, both sides have reason to work things out. Germany and European institutions certainly don't want a crackup of the eurozone. And within Italy, the economic consequences of peeling away from Europe -- high inflation and lost savings in the near term and the long-term growth consequences from being a less appealing place for investment -- are severe enough that there would be reason to strike a deal.
Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro, puts the chance that Italy will exit the euro at only around 10 percent to 15 percent. He argues in a research note that European institutions will probably seek to de-escalate the tensions in the coming months.
The Risks for the U.S. and the World
So far the damage to markets outside Italy is mostly limited to a sell-off in global stock markets, including a 1.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 index Tuesday. As is often the case when the rest of the world looks risky, money flowed into Treasury bonds, lowering interest rates in the United States.
No doubt Italy has the most at risk economically, followed by the rest of Europe. But one thing that has become clear over the last decade is how effects can spread unpredictably in times of financial disruption.
For the last decade, the world has experienced a rolling series of crises, in which financial turmoil fuels economic despair which intensifies political dysfunction which -- through financial markets -- can spread across oceans and repeat the pattern.
No one would have thought that a crisis centered on home mortgages in the United States would prove the trigger for crises in Greece and across Europe all those years ago. If things go badly in Italy, there's no telling where the damage could end up.

Full text: MEMPHIS -- The view from the chief executive's office window at Memphis International Airport is as sweeping as it is dispiriting: On a recent afternoon, he could see 10 empty jet bridges and not a single airliner. Later, at the curb in front of the terminal, there were only three cars dropping off passengers, and inside, a pair of moving walkways carried just three people between them.
An empty airport may sound heavenly to anyone who has had to cope with the crowds and chaos at La Guardia or Hartsfield-Jackson or O'Hare. But it is a humbling reality for Memphis.
To walk the airport's deserted corridors now is to know that its glory days of just a decade ago are gone, a glaring casualty of an airline merger that transformed the American aviation industry but cost the Mid-South's most important city its status as a hub.
So now, while many airports are desperately trying to figure out how to add more gates, more destinations, more parking, more restaurants and, for goodness' sake, more bathrooms, Memphis is grappling with the opposite, much rarer riddle: how to shrink gracefully.
"We spend most of our careers trying to figure out how to grow passengers and grow facilities," said Scott A. Brockman, the president and chief executive of the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority. "To remove things, without a plan to rebuild them better, is really a painful thing for an airport guy."
Memphis used to be a regular transfer stop for business and leisure travelers, when Northwest Airlines was the dominant carrier and the airport was marketed as a "hassle-free" hub. But then Delta Air Lines gobbled up Northwest, and decided it only needed one hub in the South, its own base in Atlanta. The decision cost Memphis almost two-thirds of its passengers: From more than 11 million in 2007, the last full year before the merger announcement, the count fell to about four million last year.
That has sometimes left the spacious three-concourse terminal looking staggeringly deserted, with most of its gates unused. The airport's solution is to spend $219 million on what it is calling a modernization effort: closing and renovating Concourse B, and then consolidating operations there and essentially mothballing Concourses A and C.
The plan is as much a push toward the future as it is an admission that Memphis -- the sign at the entrance still calls it "America's Aerotropolis" -- is a lesser passenger magnet these days than Omaha or Columbus, Ohio, or even the second airport serving Dallas.
"It was death by a thousand cuts," said Mr. Brockman, who has worked at the airport long enough that he can recall when the terminal was "bustling," "crazy" and "kind of orchestrated mayhem."
Memphis had few role models to look to. The closest analogue, industry experts said, was Pittsburgh, which had to reimagine its airport after US Airways, which is now part of American Airlines, stopped using it as a hub.
But such demoralizing plans and strategies can only do so much, especially for now. In Memphis, there are direct flights to far fewer destinations than before, and only two to help justify the "international" in the name (Toronto and CancÃºn, Mexico). It takes no time at all to walk through the terminal's three ticketing areas or to zip through the security line. A gate may be crowded when a flight is about to board, but others nearby will be idle, and finding a place to sit is rarely a problem.
The airport is betting its future on Concourse B. Over the next three years or so, it will be rebuilt to feature wider corridors, more amenities, more natural light and even a stage for live entertainment. (After all, this is Memphis, where blues notes still pulse through the airport's parking garage, and the airport's logo is a reminder of the city's musical heritage.)
When Concourse B reopens, A and C will close, idling about 60 gates. The airport plans to keep a minimal level of heat and ventilation in each of them, Mr. Brockman said, and will test their equipment occasionally just in case they are needed again someday. That day may be a long time coming, or may never come.
Though Concourse B is already closed, demolition work won't start for a few months yet. There are still some signs there for Allegiant and Delta, and portraits of Elvis Presley and B.B. King still hang, reflected on the gleaming terrazzo floors. Every so often, the public address system booms out recorded announcements to no one.
The sprawling terminal may have become a bit of a white elephant with the falloff in passenger traffic, but not so the airport as a whole. Its runways are still busy, chiefly because Memphis is home to FedEx, whose purple, orange and white cargo jets roar morning and night through the western Tennessee sky. Among the world's cargo airports, Memphis is second only to Hong Kong.
Airport officials tend to toggle between offering optimism and consolation. A favorite statistic is the decline in airfares to and from Memphis since the merger. They averaged $389.81 last year, down nearly $70 from 2007 when adjusted for inflation.
Even so, residents lament the lost hub, and when you mention the airport in these parts, you will often get a shrug, a grimace or a sad stare.
"So sad to watch a booming airport turn into a ghost town," a letter to the editor of The Commercial Appeal said in January.
And the criticism used to be even harsher.
"Probably the biggest impact was the psychology on the community -- 'Oh, my God, we're not going to be a real city any more,"' Mr. Brockman said. "I think that now, the community has pretty much come to terms. The ones who grumble the most are the business travelers who now have to spend two-and-a-half hours laying over somewhere. Instead of a two-hour trip somewhere, it's now six or seven hours."

Full text: When Rebecca Wills pictures the home she would like to buy, it looks like the one she grew up in: Small house. Big backyard. Enough grass for the family to lie out on when the New Jersey summers cooperate.
"A place where you can come take your kids to swim, or do a barbecue," she said. "Somewhere where we can have people, have a lot of family, over."
She doesn't expect to live out that fantasy anytime soon. At 28, Ms. Wills has spent all of her adult years wrestling with student loans. She figures she has paid around $30,000 to the government and private lenders since she graduated from Rutgers University.
That has helped make a healthy dent in her loan bill. It has also sucked away all of the money she would have otherwise put into a savings account, earmarked for her big backyard.
Ms. Wills might already have a mortgage if she had gone to college a decade earlier, when it wasn't quite so expensive. Instead, she is stuck in limbo, like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans who have delayed buying a home because of the ever-growing cost of tuition.
Homeownership among Americans in their 20s and 30s is hovering near a three-decade low. Just 35 percent of households headed by someone younger than 35 owned a home in 2017, down from 41 percent in 1982, according to census data. Now, they are much more likely to be living at home with their parents or elders.
At the same time, the nation's student loan bill has soared to $1.4 trillion, surpassing credit cards to become the largest source of personal debt outside mortgages.
A broad set of headwinds is holding millennials back from buying homes. Underwriting standards have become stricter in the last decade, making it more difficult to get a mortgage. Many young people are moving to cities where they can only afford to rent -- a problem that has been compounded as home prices have soared while wages have barely outpaced inflation.
And recent research suggests that the explosion in tuition costs and student debt is another significant force keeping many millennials out of the home buying market. An analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year suggests that student debt was responsible for up to 35 percent of the decline in homeownership among people between the ages of 28 and 30 from 2007 to 2015. (Homeownership for people under 28 tends to be low.)
If student debt levels had stayed where they were in 2001, more than 360,000 people in that age group would have owned a home in 2015, according to those findings.
"If people had the same levels of student debt as about 20 years ago, they probably would be buying a lot more homes than they are buying now," said Wilbert van der Klaauw, an economist at the New York Federal Reserve and an author of the study.
In an alternate universe where Ms. Wills might have graduated without much debt, and where the financial crisis had never happened, her father would never have been laid off and he would have kept chipping in to help pay her tuition bill. She wonders about who she would be if that had been her life.
"I don't know if I would have been the kind of person who would save every penny so I could own a home," she said. She might have traveled, or frittered her paycheck away on other things that tempt you in your twenties. "I might have chosen a completely different lifestyle if I had been free of this debt."
Of course, Ms. Wills's father did lose his job as a financial manager. Ms. Wills dropped out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst after a semester, moved back home, and took classes at a local community college before moving on to Rutgers.
She had some debt from her first undergraduate stint, and collected more the second time. During college, she waited tables at Ruby Tuesday, then at an Italian restaurant and then at a diner. She sent a hundred dollars here and there to her creditors. When she got her diploma, her loan bill was $60,000.
It is not as if she is scared of all kinds of borrowing. She knows that she can pay things off. She has a steady job as an analyst at the New Jersey Department of Education. She has been sinking more than $600 into paying off her loans every month since graduating. To improve her credit, she bought a new Hyundai Accent and paid it off in six years.
But a home loan comes with more zeros. And Ms. Wills said she is not exactly jumping at the prospect of "taking out another massive amount of debt and being trapped forever."
Her boyfriend proposed to her about a month ago. She giggles when she talks about it. They rent a one-bedroom in Jersey City for $1,350 a month.
"We want to start making our own kind of home, where we would stay for a while," she said. "But coming up with a plan where that's feasible has been pretty difficult."
For most people, college is still a relatively good bet. About half of the people who went to college own a home by the age of 33, compared to about a quarter of people who didn't go to college, according to data compiled by the New York Fed.
But student debt is one compelling reason that many millennials have stopped buying homes. Those who graduate with debt are less likely to own a home by age 33 than those who get away debt-free, the New York Fed data show. And thirty-somethings with more than $25,000 in debt fare worse than people with smaller bills.
Adrienne Naylor turned 34 this month. She has a stable job at a university in Cambridge, Mass., where she lives. She has a girlfriend she loves. But she does not feel like she is getting any closer to buying a home.
Ms. Naylor remembers her guidance counselors in high school going on about how much she would make if she went to college (a lot) versus what she would earn if she didn't (much less). So she borrowed. And then changed colleges. And borrowed some more. Then she got a master's degree in history, with a focus on managing archives and records. Now she has close to $300,000 in debt.
Eventually she fell behind on her payments and went into default, wrecking her credit score. No one wanted to hire her as an archivist, the focus of her graduate education. Before she got the university job, she made money however she could. She painted herself white and stood like a statue on a crate in Harvard Square, waiting for people to give her change. She worked the box office at a local theater. She collected garbage in Northampton for a stretch.
She now lives in a three-bedroom with two college students who sometimes have trouble remembering to replace the toilet paper.
"I would love to have a place that was just mine, but I don't let myself want that too much," she said. The university where she works recently offered employees a free seminar on home buying. A representative from Coldwell Banker rattled off the average price of a single-family home in the area ($2.7 million) and a condo ($800,000).
"I'm just like, 'Oh my God, is this guy for real?"' said Ms. Naylor, who pays $550 a month for her room. "It really brought home how incredibly out of reach this is for me."
Ms. Naylor's girlfriend is a preschool teacher -- "she's going to be poor forever"-- who lives nearby, with her own roommates. The couple would like to live together eventually. "I do have fantasies about buying a duplex that my girlfriend and I can live in and only see each other when we want to," she said.
Surveys that ask people about their student loans are hard to trust, as many people do not seem to know how much debt they have, research shows, let alone how interest works. But they reveal one thing: College loans have made mortgages a pipe dream.
More than 80 percent of millennials surveyed by the National Association of Realtors and the nonprofit group American Student Assistance said that student debt had forced them to shelve their plans to buy a home. And people who did not own homes estimated that the debt had forced them to put off buying by seven years.
The delay feels like it could be more open-ended for Matthew McCabe, who is staring down age 40 and long odds on ever owning property. He has paid about $25,000 back to the government for his student loans, yet he still owes $86,000 for the Ph.D. in music composition that he received in 2010.
"It's stifling," he said. "I feel like I am moving in the wrong direction."
Mr. McCabe expected to own a little place by now. "Maybe I am pulling too much on my middle-class expectations, but that's what you're supposed to do," he said.
He grew up in New Jersey, and lived in a house in the suburbs that his parents owned. His parents paid for him to go to a private high school, and for most of college. But Mr. McCabe had to take out loans for his doctoral degree in music. He makes $55,000 a year teaching at the Columbus State University, in Georgia, and earns an extra couple thousand by giving summer classes.
He pines after the cute little houses in historic Columbus that he walks by on the way to work. The town's quaint vibe suits him. It is relatively cheap to live there. His neighbors have told him they would prefer to have more owners in the area. There is no way he could pull together a down payment right now, though.
"I am not in a financial position to think about buying a house," he said. "I don't have a piece of land to build up on, a home base."
In contrast, Mr. McCabe's brother didn't take out loans for graduate school. He started working right after college, and now he has two children and owns his home. Mr. McCabe could have gone that route, but he loves teaching music, and he offers that he has already paid plenty back to Uncle Sam.
He has made payments "like clockwork" every month, he said, because he thought he would qualify for a loan forgiveness program the government provides to public service employees. But he found out last summer that he would not be able to get a break on the debt.
Still, whenever he walks by a house on his block with a "for sale" sign, he can't help gazing longingly at it.

Full text: In the last 16 years, parts of Louisiana have been struck by six hurricanes. Areas near San Diego were devastated by three particularly vicious wildfire seasons. And a town in eastern Kentucky has been pummeled by at least nine storms severe enough to warrant federal assistance.
These places are part of a small fraction of the United States that has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters, forming a pattern of destruction concentrated in specific areas.
About 90 percent of the total losses across the United States occurred in ZIP codes that contain less than 20 percent of the national population, according to an analysis of data from the Small Business Administration.
The federal government, through disaster relief programs and flood insurance, subsidizes the cost of rebuilding in areas hit repeatedly by storms, floods and fires.
Critics say that encourages too much development in those regions, wasting tens of billions of dollars in tax money and endangering lives.
Christina DeConcini, the director of government affairs at the World Resources Institute, said that federal programs do not adequately emphasize adapting to the risks posed by climate change. She said that instead of just being responsive, the government should stress building for resilience against disasters.
Some residents continue living in disaster-stricken areas because they cannot afford to leave. Others rebuff appeals to resettle, citing deep family ties or a sense of fatalism. Rather than move the town, "it's easier to throw your hands up and say, 'Forget it,"' said Linda Lowe, the president of a historical society in flood-prone Olive Hill, Ky.
"Abandoning a location and moving a city makes sense from a scientific, risk point of view, but the fact is that to get to a place culturally and psychologically where that conversation can be tolerated is a difficult thing to imagine," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. "It's not all that rational -- but I guess a lot of these things are not really rational."
As hurricane season begins, residents of Slidell, La., near New Orleans, are planning ahead. Susan McClamroch, who works at a museum there, said that locals joke that they "start eating everything in the freezer" this time of year because of the likelihood of a power failure after a hurricane.
Brian Smith, who runs a print shop in Slidell, said the business flooded in 1995 and again during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. So when Hurricane Isaac hit in 2012, flooding his shop once more, he moved it away from the vulnerable downtown area.
"I'm not going to take that chance again," Mr. Smith said.
Eastern Kentucky is similarly susceptible to disaster. Almost yearly, it is hit with severe storms.
Susan Thomas, who owns a bookstore and coffee shop in Morehead, Ky., said that the store flooded once when her parents owned it. When it flooded again in 2010, she had to throw away 3,000 books.
"Honestly, there was a moment where I was, like, can we recover from this?" she said, adding that she returned to check on the store every time it rained. The business moved to a new location in town the next year.
Three Brothers Bakery in Houston has flooded five times since 2001, most recently during Hurricane Harvey. But its owners, Robert and Janice Jucker, the self-proclaimed "king and queen of disaster," are not moving -- and Ms. Jucker, who anticipates more storms, is unafraid.
The Juckers received low-interest disaster loans from the Small Business Administration to rebuild their business after Hurricanes Ike and Harvey. Officials verified the damage and estimated the amount of their property loss.
The agency tracks properties nationwide whose owners or renters applied for disaster loans. Data about these loans provide a window into the geographic pattern of destruction that disasters cause each year.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration attempts to calculate the full cost of major disasters, namely those that cause more than a billion dollars in damages. It estimates that 2017 was the costliest year on record, with 16 billion-dollar disasters that together cost the United States more than $300 billion.
While natural disasters are unpredictable, the annual losses from billion-dollar disasters, adjusted for inflation, have increased over the last 40 years.
In the first three months of 2018, billion-dollar storms hit the United States three times. By contrast, in the first three months of an average year, just one disaster that causes more than a billion dollars in damages occurs, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records dating back to 1980.
Climate change is making some kinds of disasters more frequent. Studies show that large wildfires have become more common in the western United States because global warming has made Western forests drier.
But rising damage costs are partly because of demographic shifts and development decisions that make natural disasters more destructive.
Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, said that the rise in population and wealth near the coast was contributing to most of the increase in destruction caused by hurricanes.
In the last century, there has been no clear trend in the frequency of hurricanes that made landfall in the continental United States.
Over the same period, the number of buildings has ballooned in parts of the country susceptible to tropical storms as the population in those places has also increased. In 2016, there were more than 3.6 times as many homes in states that border the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean as in 1940, according to the Census Bureau.
The effects of global warming on individual storms have been difficult to determine, scientists say, because there are only about a dozen observed even in an active season.
But scientists also contend that climate change is expected to lead to stronger, wetter hurricanes over all. It has also made them more destructive, Dr. Klotzbach said. Because global sea levels have risen, hurricanes create storm surges that go further inland, flooding homes and businesses.
"You can build your house to withstand pretty much any wind, but the surge is what will get you," he said.
Only about 4 percent of all hurricanes that make landfall globally hit the United States, said Robert Mendelsohn, an economist at Yale University who studies the damage caused by hurricanes. Yet 60 percent of worldwide damage from hurricanes happens in the United States.
Dr. Mendelsohn attributed this partly to federal government programs that discourage citizens and local governments from building walls to protect housing near the coast. Only in the United States do relief programs and subsidized insurance make it attractive for people to move toward disaster-prone areas, he said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials gave no indication that they are likely to speed up their pace of interest rate increases during their most recent two-day meeting, suggesting instead that they would be willing to allow the inflation rate to rise slightly above 2 percent for a "temporary period," while the economy continues to expand.
Minutes from the meeting, which ended May 2 and are released after a typical three-week delay, reveal Fed officials are on track to raise rates again in June. The minutes also indicate officials are less worried about inflation rising above 2 percent, its current level and the Fed's target rate, than they are about the rate of inflation dipping again.
Officials continue to see the economy as strong, but they remain worried about global trade tensions, including potential damage from American and Chinese tariffs and the possibility that uncertainty over trade policy could already be crimping business investment in the United States.
Officials at the Federal Open Market Committee concluded the May 2 meeting with a unanimous decision to leave the Fed's benchmark interest rate unchanged, at a range from 1.5 to 1.75 percent. The Fed last raised interest rates in March, by a quarter of a percentage point. It is widely expected to raise them by the same amount at its next meeting in June.
The minutes from the May meeting reported that officials said recent economic indicators "had increased their confidence that inflation on a 12-month basis would continue to run near the committee's longer-run 2 percent symmetric objective." But the minutes noted that some officials believed "it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the committee's 2 percent objective."
Some officials noted, the minutes added, that "a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the committee's symmetric inflation objective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run inflation expectations at a level consistent with that objective."
As if to drive home the point, the minutes use the word "symmetric" nine times in reference to inflation. Two additional references are found in the statement the Fed released after the May meeting, which noted that annual inflation "is expected to run near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
Analysts have largely seen the inclusion of "symmetric" as an indication that Fed officials would be willing to tolerate inflation running slightly above target for a period of time. Researchers at Morgan Stanley said this week that in reading the minutes, they would "pay careful attention to the discussion behind the upgraded language" on inflation.
The emphasis on "symmetric" -- and the policy stance it signals -- is likely to cheer economic advisers in the White House, who have long insisted that the $1.5 trillion tax cut package that President Trump signed into law late last year will increase economic growth without stoking higher inflation. Many analysts expect that an acceleration in the pace of rate increases would dampen growth and potentially offset some of the stimulus from the cuts and from the federal discretionary spending increases that Mr. Trump and congressional leaders agreed to this year.
The policy decision at the May meeting was widely seen as an affirmation by Fed officials that they will stay the course on their plans to increase rates to historically normal levels, after leaving them near zero for years following the Great Recession. The minutes seem to affirm that Fed officials are not wavering in that approach -- though they report officials expressing "a range of views" on the amount of rate increases that will be needed to maintain the Fed's policy objectives in the medium term.
Economic projections released after the Fed's March meeting suggest officials expected to raise rates two more times in the months to come, for a total of three increases this year. Nearly half of the officials indicated they expected one additional increase on top of that, for a total of four in 2018. Many economists continue to forecast a total of four hikes this year, as well.
Recent economic data points have seemed to validate the Fed's approach. The unemployment rate has dropped to 3.9 percent -- though at the time of the May meeting, the most recent data showed 4.1 percent. While wage growth remains sluggish, particularly for a time of such low unemployment, the inflation rate has risen to about 2 percent.
A few developments in the data appear to have surprised officials in recent months, the minutes indicated. One was a slowdown in growth in advanced countries around the world, particularly Britain. Consumer spending in the United States has lagged the expectations of Fed staff in recent months, the minutes showed, which in turn has lowered the staff's growth projections slightly.
While some Fed officials have warned in recent months that they are concerned about the economy "overheating" -- a condition when very low unemployment sets off a rapid increase in wages and prices, which then forces the Fed to raise rates abruptly -- there were few signs of such concerns in the May meeting statement. There were continued signs -- as Fed officials expressed in their March meeting -- of concern for the potential harm from an escalating trade war with China. The Trump administration remains locked in negotiations with Chinese leaders that have included threats of tariffs on both sides.
The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has taken a wait-and-see approach to such risks in public comments this spring. In the May minutes, other officials reported unease among business leaders they had spoken to about trade. In several Fed districts, the minutes said, "contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and trade restrictions, including the potential for postponing or pulling back on capital spending." In other cases, "it was noted that the potential for higher Chinese tariffs on key agricultural products could, in the longer run, hurt U.S. competitiveness."
Business contacts also reported that they were seeing "shortages of workers in specific industries or occupations," the minutes show. "In some cases, labor shortages were contributing to upward pressure on wages."

Full text: NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks turned higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it's not in a hurry to raise interest rates too quickly. Retailers and technology companies led the way as the market erased some early losses.
Stocks opened lower after a business survey suggested that the eurozone economy might remain weak for longer than experts had expected. Investors bought U.S. and European government bonds, which sent yields and interest rates lower and hurt banks. The S&P 500 index fell as much as 14 points early on.
The market turned higher after the Fed released minutes from its meeting in early May. Officials concluded that the Fed should be on track to keep raising interest rates gradually, and some said it wouldn't be a problem if inflation briefly went past the Fed's target rate of 2 percent. That suggests the Fed won't raise interest rates too quickly, a development that worries investors because it would slow down economic growth.
"Investors are sort of nervous around an overly aggressive Fed at this point in the cycle maybe throwing us into a recession," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management.
The S&P 500 index rose 8.85 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,733.29. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 52.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,886.81. The Nasdaq composite climbed 47.50 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,425.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 2.37 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,627.61.
Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged in early May and investors expect they will raise them in mid-June. The central bank's members discussed concerns such as rising wage pressures and possible negative reactions to the Trump administration's trade policies, but didn't change their overall views.
The central bank has said it expects to raise rates a total of three times this year and some experts believe it will raise rates as many as four times. Nixon, of Northern Trust, said she expects only two rate increases: she said the Fed might leave rates alone after June if it sees signs the economy is slowing down a bit as the effects of last year's tax cuts fade.
Tiffany sparkled in the first quarter as the jewelry company's earnings and sales blew past Wall Street projections. The company also said it's planning to buy back $1 billion in its own stock. The stock jumped 23.3 percent to $126.05. Also rising after its quarterly report was Ralph Lauren, which jumped 14.3 percent to $133.33.
Target slumped after its first-quarter profit fell short of expectations. The big box retailer said more customers came to its stores and sales improved, but it's spending a lot of money to try to reinvent itself to better compete with Amazon. Target plans to spend $7 billion through 2020 to update stores and open smaller locations in urban markets. The stock sank 5.7 percent to $71.17.
Home improvement retailer Lowe's had a mostly disappointing first quarter as harsh winter weather cut into the traditional spring sales season, but the company forecast stronger sales growth for the rest of the year. The stock surged 10.4 percent to $94.69. Lowe's stock and its sales have lagged behind Home Depot, but it made up ground on Wednesday.
The IHS Market purchasing managers' index, a broad gauge of business activity in Europe, fell to its lowest level in 18 months in May. While the European economy is still growing, investors had hoped for signs the doldrums were clearing.
Germany's DAX gave up 1.5 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 1.3 percent while the British FTSE 100 lost 1.1 percent. Investors bought European government bonds, pushing prices higher and yields lower in Germany, Spain, France and the U.K.
Bond prices climbed in the U.S. as well. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.99 percent from 3.06 percent. With interest rates in decline, banks lost ground.
Banks climbed Tuesday before Congress passed a bill that eases some of the regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. Real estate investment trusts, utilities, and other stocks that pay large dividends rose. Those stocks are often considered alternatives to bonds, and investors who want income often buy them when bond yields decrease.
Comcast said it is preparing an all-cash offer for Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment divisions, and said it plans to bid more than the $52.4 billion Disney offered. Comcast didn't disclose other details about its plans. Fox rose 1.6 percent to $38.77 while Comcast fell 1.9 percent to $31.88, and Disney slid 1.1 percent to $102.89
Benchmark U.S. crude lost 0.5 percent to $71.84 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 0.3 percent to $79.80 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline lost 0.4 percent to $2.26 a gallon. Heating oil rose 0.4 percent to $2.29 a gallon. Natural gas added 0.2 percent to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The dollar dropped to 110.07 yen from 111.02 yen. The euro fell to $1.698 from $1.1779.
Gold lost 0.2 percent to $1,289.60 an ounce. Silver fell 1 percent to $16.41 an ounce. Copper plunged 2 percent to $3.07 a pound.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.8 percent.

Full text: ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey called early elections for June 24, more than a year earlier than scheduled, in part to get ahead of tremors in the economy. But on Wednesday they caught up with him as the country's currency, the lira, took a steep dive, presenting a potential danger to his re-election campaign.
The lira fell close to five to the dollar on Wednesday, a 20 percent drop this year, according to Reuters, before the Central Bank stepped in to buck it up with a sharp increase in one of its primary lending rates, to 16 percent from 13.5 percent.
The turbulence was not only a sign of growing investor alarm at the state of Turkey's economy. The drop in the lira has also left some of Turkey's biggest businesses embattled, while eating deeply into the living standards of ordinary Turks, meaning voters.
In that regard, it could not come at a worse time for Mr. Erdogan, who officially opens an election campaign on Thursday that is expected to emphasize his economic achievements and impressive year-on-year growth over 15 years at the head of government.
Despite that record, business leaders and financial markets have shown increasing concerns over Mr. Erdogan's management of the economy as he has accumulated power, with the possibility that the June election for a newly enhanced presidency will give him still more swagger.
Financial analysts and political opponents say the latest plunge in the lira was set off by Mr. Erdogan himself, and by his overriding of his financial officials and the Central Bank, in particular his rejection of their calls to raise interest rates.
Turkey's inflation rate is over 10 percent, but out of a desire to maintain high growth rates, Mr. Erdogan has opposed raising interest rates, which financial analysts say is needed to ease the pressure on the currency.
The president set off the latest decline of the lira with comments in an interview with Bloomberg News on Monday, when he revealed his intention to take even greater control of the Central Bank if he wins the election to a new, more powerful presidency.
"From the moment we move to a presidential governing system, our effectiveness there will be very different," he said, referring to the Central Bank. "We're going to do this so we can be held accountable for the responsibility we've taken."
"When the people fall into difficulties because of monetary policies, who are they going to hold accountable?" he said. "They'll hold the president accountable. Since they'll ask the president about it, we have to give off the image of a president who's influential on monetary policies."
Opponents of Mr. Erdogan warn that an economic crisis is nearing.
"This rhetoric is extremely dangerous and will put Turkey in a dead-end street," Durmus Yilmaz, a former governor of the Central Bank who is running for Parliament, said of Mr. Erdogan's remarks in London. "Turkey did try the exact same thing in 1994 and that's how we ended up with a crisis."
The president's officials would have none of it. His deputy prime minister, Bekir Bozdag, cast the lira's fall as a foreign plot to damage Mr. Erdogan.
"Those who believe that by manipulating the dollar they will lead to results that will harm the nation and their pockets and change the election result, are mistaken," he told the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, speaking to the news channel NTV, blamed speculators.
"We have instruments that the necessary steps can be taken about monetary policies and the value of the lira," he said. "The relevant institutions have very strong instruments."
One reason for the pressure on the lira is that the United States Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates and drawing international capital away from emerging markets like Turkey. It can be remedied if Turkey raises interest rates, analysts say.
But Mr. Erdogan may have overreached. After 15 years of growth and easy credit, his country has accumulated a great deal of foreign credit that it is now struggling to finance, analysts say.
Turkey's corporate foreign currency debt has ballooned since 2009, and 80 percent of it is held by Turkish banks. With the slide of the lira, they are struggling to service the debt and are no longer extending credit to Turkish businesses.
Two of Turkey's biggest companies have recently entered discussions to refinance their debt. Yildiz Holding, a global confectionary and cookie business owned by Turkey's richest man, entered negotiations to refinance $7 billion of debt in March.
The credit crunch is affecting small and medium-size businesses, too, said Atilla Yesilada, an investment analyst. "Just look at the empty shops in the main streets," he said. "It has been the last three years, the currency depreciation continues and people are suffering."
Economists and financial analysts say the rot lies within Turkey, where crony capitalism and corruption have grown as the rule of law and an independent judiciary, essential bulwarks for foreign investors, have been eroded under Mr. Erdogan.
Foreign direct investment has declined to a third of previous levels. Credit rating agencies have downgraded Turkey's sovereign debt rating in recent months, citing a lack of economic structural reform and a removal of checks and balances by Mr. Erdogan.
At a campaign rally, Muharrem Ince, a physics professor who is the leading presidential challenger, called on Mr. Erdogan to cease interfering with the Central Bank and to stop listening to advisers who were feeding him false information.
He advised the president to reassure the nation that public fiscal discipline was a priority, rather than funding his mega-construction projects, and to quash rumors of currency controls.
"The economy is sinking," Mr. Ince told supporters. "We are about to crash into a wall. My beloved nation, the truck is about to crash into the wall."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Prominent Democrats -- stung by their eroding support from working-class voters but buoyed by the deficit-be-damned approach of ruling Republicans -- are embracing a big idea from a bygone era: guaranteed employment.
The "job guarantee" plans, many of them pressed by Democratic White House hopefuls, vary in scope and cost, but they all center on government-sponsored employment that pays well above the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage -- a New Deal for a new age, absent the bread lines and unemployment rates of the Great Depression. The most aggressive plans seek to all but eradicate unemployment and to set a new wage floor for all working Americans, pressuring private employers to raise wages if they want to compete for workers.
How such guarantees would be paid for is still largely unresolved. And criticism of the idea has emerged not only from conservatives who detect a whiff of socialism but also from liberals who say guaranteed employment is the wrong way to attack the central issue facing workers in this low-unemployment economy: stagnant wages.
But Democratic leaders hope the push will help their party bridge the growing political divide between white and minority workers, and silence the naysayers who accuse the party of being devoid of new, big ideas.
The employment plans, along with single-payer "Medicare for all" health care, free college, legalized marijuana and ever less restrictive immigration rules, are parts of a broader trend toward a more liberal Democratic Party in the Trump era.
"It's going to create a more competitive labor market where people are going to start getting living wages, not just minimum wage," said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who unveiled a job-guarantee plan in April. "Giving people the dignity of work, of being able to stand on their own two feet, there's such a strengthening element of that."
Many conservative economists, and some liberals, fret over the plans' often large costs, which some Democrats would cover by repealing pieces of President Trump's signature tax cuts. The plans could force private companies to compete with the government for workers, distort an already tight job market and push some firms out of business, they warn.
Most of all, they question the need for any government jobs program when unemployment has dipped below 4 percent.
"I don't know if the Democrats have noticed, but jobs are doing very well," said Larry Kudlow, the director of Mr. Trump's National Economic Council. He said the administration would oppose such plans.
Federal job guarantees are a throwback idea. President Franklin D. Roosevelt essentially called for them in his "Second Bill of Rights" speech in 1944, which held that Americans had "the right to a useful and remunerative job" and "the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation." The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. endorsed the idea in the 1960s.
A handful of liberal researchers have revived and promoted such a plan in recent years, including Mark Paul, William A. Darity Jr. of Duke University and Darrick Hamilton of the New School. Last year, the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank stacked with veterans of the Obama administration, released a job guarantee proposal that would employ an estimated 4.4 million Americans. Last Tuesday, the group released a follow-up plan that detailed how it would guarantee jobs to Americans who live in particularly distressed communities, urban and rural.
Mr. Booker's plan would create pilot programs to provide jobs to Americans in as many as 15 areas where the unemployment rate remains dismal. Its co-sponsors include three Democratic senators also seen as possible presidential candidates: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chairman, would fund "transitional" jobs lasting up to one year for workers who have been unemployed for six months or more. Representative Ro Khanna of California would provide federally subsidized employment, in the public or private sector, for anyone who wants to work, for a maximum period of two and a half years.
The most ambitious proposal, an outline from Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont and another possible White House hopeful, would promise a government job in areas such as construction, child care and park maintenance to anyone who wants one, paying a "living wage" and offering benefits on par with what current federal employees earn.
Behind the stampede is Democrats' desire for tangible programs to offer to working-class voters, which they could contrast to Mr. Trump's racially divisive immigration appeals to white workers.
"We are living in a world where Trump and Trumpism is trying to drive wedges between people," said Neera Tanden, a former adviser to President Barack Obama and to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, who is the president of the Center for American Progress. "It's important to the country and the progressive movement that we have ideas that matter in the lives of working people who are black, brown and white."
To win control of Congress this fall and defeat Mr. Trump in 2020, she added, "We have to have some answers for how to get good jobs with a decent living for people who didn't go to college."
Given the current state of the job market, the operative word there is "good." It has been a long time since jobs have been this easy to find in the United States. Unemployment fell to nearly a half-century low of 3.9 percent in April.
At the same time, wage growth has only sluggishly advanced. Real median household income is up only slightly from where it was in 2000. Critics from the left say a job guarantee will not adequately address that broad wage issue.
"It's kind of a very large hammer in search of a nail," said Anne Kim, the director of domestic and social policy at the Progressive Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington. "And it's the wrong nail. We really should be searching for solutions to the wage stagnation problem."
Advocates of the more targeted jobs plans say they are needed to help workers who are still stuck on the bad side of the improving national employment numbers.
"It's a strong argument in many parts of the country that, for folks who are out there committed to finding a job, we should create this transitional program to help them get on their feet," Mr. Van Hollen said. "You have a lot of Republicans right now who say they want to help people who are out of work by taking away their health care or other benefits, but are doing nothing to help them find a job."
Conservatives say the most sweeping job guarantee plans could ignite runaway inflation and impose a large degree of central planning on private industry. From the left, Ms. Kim said she worries the effort would create "a permanent class of underclass jobs" that some workers would not be able to move up from.
And then there is the cost. Mr. Sanders's office said his plan is not yet complete and thus cannot be assessed, for costs or for the benefits it would bring to the economy. Others estimate their plans would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade, but could be funded all or in part by rolling back some parts of the tax law that Mr. Trump signed in December, estimated to cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
Democrats' casual attitude toward cost is in part a reaction to the Republican tax bill, which was passed without much concern for rising government red ink. It also reflects a growing belief among many liberals that a clear lesson from Mr. Trump's victory is that Democrats need to go bold -- and spend big.
"The Republicans for the last 30 years have been running on supply-side economics," Mr. Khanna said. "You cut taxes, that's going to grow the economy, that's going to pay for deficits. Democrats need to change the script."

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- President NicolÃ¡s Maduro won a second term as president of Venezuela, a country in the midst of a historic economic collapse marked by soaring prices, widespread hunger, rampant crime, a failing health system and a large-scale exodus of its citizens.
Electoral officials declared Mr. Maduro the victor Sunday night, in a contest that critics said was heavily rigged in his favor.
In the capital and around the country, the turnout was extremely low, with more than half of voters not casting ballots, reflecting both a call from many opposition leaders for a boycott of the vote and the disillusionment of longtime government supporters.
Voting centers in pro-government strongholds and opposition areas alike often had no lines -- a significant change from previous presidential elections, and a sign that many Venezuelans repudiated the candidacies of both Mr. Maduro and the two opposition candidates.
Election officials said Mr. Maduro, the political heir of Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the leftist firebrand who led this oil-rich country until his death in 2013, received 5.8 million votes, with more than 92 percent of voting centers reporting. That was nearly 68 percent of the votes cast.
His main rival, Henri FalcÃ³n, a former state governor who was once an acolyte of Mr. ChÃ¡vez's but broke with him to join the opposition, received 1.8 million votes. A third candidate, Javier Bertucci, a political novice and an evangelical minister, received 925,000. Mr. Maduro's current term continues until the end of the year; his new term will last six years.
"So much they have underestimated the revolutionary people! So much they have underestimated me," Mr. Maduro said, addressing a cheering outdoor crowd in Caracas. "And here we are again, victorious!"
He scarcely mentioned the low turnout and said that the 68 percent of the vote he received was the highest percentage for a winner in a Venezuelan presidential election, calling it a knockout.
Despite his triumph, there is little relief in sight for Mr. Maduro or Venezuela.
The United States -- which condemned the election as unfair and anti-democratic even before it happened -- has threatened stricter sanctions. Also likely to increase pressure on Mr. Maduro's government even before his next term begins: He has largely been cut off from international financing, and the government-run oil industry, which provides virtually all of the country's hard currency, is in free-fall, with plummeting production.
Some may also point to the low turnout and vote totals and question Mr. Maduro's leadership. He received about 1.5 million fewer votes than when he was first elected in 2013. Mr. Maduro has shown no signs so far that he has the ability to solve the country's deep problems, and his response to the crisis has often been to crack down harder on adversaries -- including the traditional opposition as well as rivals on his side of the political divide.
The official turnout figure was given as 46 percent, compared to about 80 percent in the last two presidential elections.
Mr. FalcÃ³n accused Mr. Maduro's party of pressuring voters and said that he would not recognize the election results.
"We don't recognize this electoral process as valid," Mr. FalcÃ³n said, speaking at his campaign center before the official results were made public. "For us, there was no election. There must be a new election in Venezuela."
Mr. FalcÃ³n had defied a broad call to boycott the election over expectations of just the sort of unfairness that he denounced after the polls closed.
The United States and many countries in the region have said they would not recognize the results. Colombia and Brazil have received huge influxes of economic refugees from Venezuela.
Mr. Maduro's victory was certain to set off a new round of infighting and finger pointing within the opposition. Some accused Mr. FalcÃ³n of giving legitimacy to the president's re-election. Others asked if the opposition might have missed a chance to displace Mr. Maduro, given his falling popularity among his own supporters, many of whom failed to turn out.
Venezuela, which is estimated to have the world's largest oil reserves, is in the throes of one of the worst economic crises in recent history in the Western Hemisphere. The International Monetary Fund estimates that inflation this year could reach 13,000 percent, by far the highest rate in the world.
With soaring prices and shortages of basic goods of all kinds, many Venezuelans are malnourished. It is common to find families who eat just twice a day, and with little protein, fresh fruit or vegetables in those meals. Two pounds of chicken or beef costs as much as the monthly minimum wage package, which, including food coupons, is worth about $2.50.
That is hardly a recipe for a president to win re-election, but Mr. Maduro sought to give himself every advantage in Sunday's vote.
The electoral authorities banned the largest opposition political parties from taking part in the election, and key politicians were barred from running. Brutal repression of anti-government protests, and the arrests of many activists and leaders also weakened the opposition.
Electoral authorities also moved up the election to May, although it is traditionally held in December, allowing little time for the opposition to organize and campaign. They even eliminated the requirement that voters dip a finger in indelible ink, which is used to keep people from voting more than once.
In response, many opposition leaders called for an election boycott.
Mr. FalcÃ³n ultimately decided to break with the rest of the opposition and run against Mr. Maduro.
Mr. Maduro attributes the country's problems to what he calls an economic war waged against Venezuela by the United States. But most economists place the blame on poor government management, corruption and broken policies, like tight controls over foreign exchange, an overvalued currency and price controls on goods.
The government has responded to the crisis by providing people with boxes of food, including powdered milk and pasta, although most people say they arrive irregularly and do not contain nearly enough to sustain a household. The food boxes became both an incentive and a threat during the campaign, with many voters fearful that they could be cut off if they didn't support the government.
At many polling places on Sunday, people cast their vote and then visited a so-called Red Spot -- named for the ruling Socialist Party's color -- set up nearby.
At the Red Spot, voters presented the special identity card used to receive the food boxes and other services and gave their names to workers who were keeping lists of those who had voted. Workers at the Red Spots said that there was no effort to pressure voters or link a pro-Maduro vote to future food deliveries.
Mr. FalcÃ³n accused the government of violating campaign rules through the use of these Red Spots.
A woman waiting outside a polling station in a Caracas slum, La Vega, said she worked for a government agency and feared losing her job if she did not vote and report afterward at the Red Spot. The woman, who would not give her name out of fear of reprisals, also said that she felt compelled to vote for Mr. Maduro, even though she did not support him, because she was sure that government computers tracked people's votes -- a common notion here.
One of the most striking aspects of the day was the large number of voters who appeared to have stayed away.
"I'm surprised by the low turnout," said Loreima HenrÃ­quez, a National Electoral Council employee, who was overseeing a polling place in Dos Caminos, a middle-class area of Caracas. There were about 4,200 voters registered to cast ballots there, but by 1 p.m. only 313 had done so.
"We were aware of the calls to abstain from voting, but many fewer people than we expected are coming out," Ms. HenrÃ­quez said.
Rosa RodrÃ­guez, 50, a former ChÃ¡vez and Maduro supporter, said that this time she voted for Mr. FalcÃ³n and volunteered to work as a poll watcher.
"People are not voting on both sides and I think this is a silent message that they're giving the country today," said Ms. Rodriguez, who lives in a working-class area in the center of Caracas. "They have to realize that the people are protesting in silence. For me that says it all."
In a slum abutting the main airport outside Caracas, Marielis Idimas, a mother of two, said she had voted for Mr. Maduro despite the economic hardships -- but she showed more resignation than enthusiasm.
"My life is not good," she said, sitting at a small stand where she sold eggs for 60,000 bolÃ­vars each (the currency's devaluation makes that only about 6 cents although it is a vast sum for poor Venezuelans). "But who lives comfortably now?"
Another slum resident, MarÃ­a GarcÃ­a, 63, said that she had not voted because doing so would have been supporting a sham.
"I'm not going to be part of this," Ms. GarcÃ­a said. "I hate everything about this government and I don't want anything to do with them."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Why Was My Room Canceled? A Final Overwhelms Kiev

Full text: Maria Garcia-Mella Cid did not even know if Real Madrid, the team she calls her lifelong "obsession," would be playing in the Champions League final in Kiev when she began planning her trip from Miami to Ukraine.
She had booked the final leg of her journey -- a flight from Madrid to Kiev -- before the semifinal matchups had been revealed, and identified a place to stay in Kiev before the second leg of Madrid's semifinal against Bayern Munich was even played. She instructed her cousin to confirm the reservation the moment the final whistle confirmed Madrid's place, but in the excitement of Real's nail-biting victory, the cousin promptly forgot.
The next day, Garcia-Mella Cid took charge. She found an apartment in Kiev, paying for an extra night to make sure of the booking, and paid for the rest of her flights: Miami to Stockholm, Stockholm to Madrid.
She did not know for sure she had a ticket -- that would only be secured later through South Florida PeÃ±a, an official Real fan club -- but she knew she had to be there. She had made the trip to Cardiff last year, where Real beat Juventus to retain the Champions League trophy, and had every intention of seeing the team try to raise it for the third year in a row.
"Nothing compares to seeing your team in a final," she said.
Everything was in place -- a reward for Maria's being "super proactive" -- until it wasn't. The next day, Maria saw reports on Twitter of fans' having reservations canceled. She called Hotels.com, the online company through which she had made her booking and was assured everything was fine. The reservation had been paid, but if she wanted peace of mind, she was told, she could check with the apartment rental company in Ukraine. She sent an email. A few hours later, one came back, informing her the reservation had been canceled because of an error in the booking.
The apartment was now back on the market, she said, but for five times the price.
Hotels.com offered to pay the difference, but it was too late: the apartment, in the meantime, had been leased at the inflated rate to someone else.
Maria had flights, and a match ticket, but nowhere to stay. And Kiev was, by that stage, pretty much fully booked.
"I had this feeling of impending doom," she said. "It took all of the joy out of going to see my team in a final."
Hers was not an isolated case. In the two weeks since it was confirmed that Real would face Liverpool in Saturday's Champions League final, countless stories have emerged of the difficulties fans of both clubs are facing in making it to the game.
Hotels, of course, are always a problem. Prices skyrocket, driven not only by demand from ordinary fans -- each club was given a little more than 16,000 tickets, and will bring many more supporters to the city -- but because UEFA, the competition's organizer, reserves vast blocks of accommodations for its officials and sponsors.
That price inflation has happened in Kiev -- some rooms were listed at 10 times their usual value -- but worse still, as Garcia-Mella Cid experienced, were those who were told that their reservations had vanished, but were available to rebook at significantly higher prices.
Residents of Kiev have been so appalled by the situation that locals have been inspired to start Facebook groups offering fans free accommodation. Victor Kylymar, the founder of one -- Kyiv FREE couch -- told the BBC he was "shocked and ashamed" by the hotels' price gouging.
That kindness has been noted, of course, but just as difficult has been finding a way to the city at all. Real is subsidizing the travel of 1,000 members of its La Grada fan group, but, as Garcia-Mella Cid put it, "everyone else is on their own."
Regular flights into Borispol, Kiev's international airport, are fully booked, and have been for some time.
Dozens of aircraft have been chartered in both Liverpool and Madrid, but that has not solved the problem. Borispol's limited capacity means all the available charter slots are taken. So many fans are expected to pass through the airport that some have been warned to expect, on their way home from Kiev, a policy of "free boarding," in which fans are simply placed on the first available flight back as they arrive at the airport.
Fans, of course, try to find a way: some are flying in through Minsk, in Belarus, and then traveling overland, or even coming through Donetsk, in the east of Ukraine, in territory still afflicted by sporadic fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian separatists.
Many, though, have had no choice but to admit defeat. Real received only 25,000 applications for tickets from club members -- down from more than 40,000 for Cardiff -- wanting to go to Kiev, and reports in Spain over the weekend said that some 2,000 who were successful have had no choice but to hand their tickets back: The logistics were just too complicated. Privately, Liverpool fears some of its ticket holders will simply not be able to make it, either.
UEFA, the competition's organizer, has applied pressure to the authorities in Kiev to try to ameliorate the situation, but remains deeply frustrated.
In an interview with the Italian newspaper La Stampa last week, UEFA's president, Aleksander Ceferin, pointed out that it was precisely to avoid situations like the brewing one in Kiev that he made it a priority to change the way the host of the Champions League final, UEFA's showpiece event, is chosen.
Kiev -- like Cardiff last year -- did not have to go through a bidding process when it was selected two years ago: until Ceferin's reforms were instituted in 2017, cities simply lobbied to be awarded a final; often, the winner was chosen for political convenience as much as suitability. Sometimes that was not an issue -- Milan in 2016, Berlin in 2015, Lisbon in 2014 and London in 2013 all were well-equipped to host the event -- but Cardiff, like Kiev, seemed to struggle with the sheer scale of the final, and the influx of fans into a comparatively small city. Last year, for example, many fans had to stay in Bristol, an hour away in England, or catch special trains from Wales back to London.
Ceferin is eager to make sure that does not happen again. Madrid, which beat out Baku, Azerbaijan, for the 2019 final -- had to submit a full dossier, including details of its hotel infrastructure. Lisbon and Istanbul, which are vying to hold the 2020 final, have been required to do the same.
"Before, an executive simply said, 'I want to give you the game,"' Ceferin said. "Now you present a dossier and the most complete wins. Kiev is beautiful, yet you cannot even get a room under the stairs for hundreds of euros. I will propose in the future that hotel infrastructure is central to the decision, and that places where fans have to sleep in a garage are not chosen."
That, however, gives UEFA another problem. The organization has been conscious for some time that only a dozen cities in Europe, at most, have both a stadium of the size required and the necessary logistical capacity to host the final smoothly. UEFA does not, however, want to find itself simply cycling between the same places every few years, further reinforcing the impression that the Champions League is a competition available to only a handful of countries.
To alleviate that pressure, UEFA has privately discussed the idea of moving the final away from Europe occasionally: to New York, to Miami, to Doha. It even contemplated taking the annual Super Cup final outside of the continent as a trial run as early as 2020, but stepped back after objections from the organization's smaller member nations, who see that game as their only chance of hosting one of soccer's grandest occasions.
The two great hurdles of taking the Champions League final to the Americas or Asia would, of course, be the time difference -- Beijing and Tokyo most likely would be ruled out for that reason -- and the costs for traveling fans.
Those concerns have been powerful enough to see the conversation moved on to the back burner, but what has happened in Kiev this month may force it back onto the table. If fans are going to have to spend thousands of dollars supporting their team either way, does where they spend it matter?
Besides, UEFA has another pressing concern: FIFA's attempts to expand its Club World Cup. If UEFA wants to keep its elite clubs happy, and overcome the temptation of billions from a rival competition, it may need to tap ever greater revenue streams. Hosting the Champions League final in the United States or the Middle East could be one way to do that.
Garcia-Mella Cid, to her relief, has found a place to stay in Kiev: her story was eventually picked up by the Kiev Post, a local newspaper, and a journalist there has offered her and her friends lodging, free of charge. For her, a Real Madrid win on Saturday would make all of the stress worth it. What she and thousands of others have been through, though, has made it just a little bit more likely that there will one day be a Champions League final much closer to her home in Miami.

The Wealth Gap Hits Families Hardest

Full text: What does economic inequality really look like?
Income alone doesn't give a complete picture. Income inequality describes the gap between a six-figure salary and minimum wage. But the more alarming gap occurs in wealth -- a household's total assets minus debts. To understand how inequality is playing out in the United States, we need to look more closely at the wealth gap.
In a recent paper, we examined wealth among families with children and among the elderly. We focused on children and the elderly because they are considered the most vulnerable in our society and because so much social policy is geared to help them. According to our research, wealth inequality is much worse among families with children, and the gap has widened greatly over the past two decades, with consequences that may cascade through generations.
The extreme wealth inequality we have identified is a result of years of policies that have eroded both public spending and private income for families with children.
The demographer Samuel Preston warned in 1984 that the United States had made "a set of private and public choices that have dramatically altered the age profile of well-being," by devoting resources toward improving conditions for the elderly while neglecting to do the same for families with children. "The constituency for children in public decisions simply appears too feeble to fight back," he wrote.
We are seeing the consequences of these policies now, and they will follow today's children throughout their lives.
Unlike income, which can change quickly because of a booming economy or a rise in the minimum wage, changes in wealth usually happen slowly. The recently passed tax law, for example, may increase your take-home pay, but it's unlikely to increase the value of your house.
Wealth also matters because it has profound long-term effects. Parental wealth, in addition to parental income, plays an important role in college attendance and graduation. Bachelor's degree holders earn 56 percent more than high school graduates, the largest gap on record. So a parent's ability to, say, pay for college tuition may be crucial to enabling children to become economically self-sufficient.
Parental wealth is also a critical determinant of where children live and the quality of the schools they attend. It can affect the kind of job they have, if and when they marry, and whether they own their homes.
To understand how wealth and wealth inequality have changed among families with children and elderly households, we examined data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, a large survey conducted approximately every three years that catalogs the total assets and debt of American households.
The data we used comes from several thousand representative households in each of the nine survey years between 1989 and 2013. We examined the wealth of households headed by someone age 65 or older, and families headed by someone under age 65 and with children under age 18.
Our research shows that in terms of wealth, those over 65 have weathered the past quarter-century much better than families with children, despite two major recessions. The net worth of older people's households increased by 45 percent from 1989 to 2013. And for the past 25 years, the distance between the rich elderly and the poor elderly remained stable. The very wealthiest elderly households grew richer, but so did those of working-class and middle-class older people.
Families with children fared worse as a group. Overall, their wealth declined by 56 percent in the same period. More important, they also faced a wide and growing divide: Wealth inequality for these households grew significantly from 1989 to 2013. The top 1 percent saw their wealth increase by 156 percent, while parents in the bottom half saw their wealth shrink by 260 percent. About a third of all families with children in 2013 had no wealth, only debt.
In 2013, the top 1 percent of these families had a median wealth of $5.1 million, thanks to skyrocketing incomes, increasing home values and strong returns on stocks and investments. They have millions in savings and generous trust funds for their children.
Families on the bottom rungs live very differently. They may not even own a home, and if they face an unexpected expense, like a medical emergency, they don't have a cushion of savings or other assets to draw on. And when their children start college, some of these parents may still be paying off their own student loans.
Why are so many parents with children faring so poorly? In part, it's a result of long-term changes in employment. Over the period we studied, employment became more unstable, as companies replaced full-time jobs with part-time work and short-term contracts. These employment changes affected families with children more than the elderly, who are mostly retired. That means not only less income but also less money to save or invest in homes or other wealth-producing assets.
The other problem for families with children is debt: not credit card or car loan debt, which hasn't changed much since the late 1980s, but student loan and mortgage debt.
Education debt has been rising throughout the period in our study, in part because federal Pell Grants failed to keep up with rising tuition costs. Pell Grants now cover only 29 percent of the cost of a four-year degree at a public college, the lowest percentage on record. Even earning a two-year degree at a community college usually means taking on debt.
In the mid-2000s, housing debt also started to rise, especially as subprime lenders opened the housing market to more first-time buyers. After the collapse of the housing market, home prices were down one-third from their pre-recession peak. For many families, that wiped out the value of their main asset.
Why did older households fare better? First, older Americans' incomes were largely stable. Their primary source of income, Social Security, is indexed to inflation. With stable income, fewer older people dipped into savings to pay their bills, and they had more money to invest. Second, most of them bought their homes before the housing bubble, and third, they graduated from college before the era of high student loan debt. Thanks to these three factors, the median net worth of poor and middle-class older people rose by 70 percent from 1989 to 2013.
There are a few policy changes that may help. Increasing the purchasing power of Pell Grants and then indexing it to rising tuition costs would be a start. The government could also expand tax credits that benefit families, and compensate families who were victims of predatory lending practices.
But the magnitude of the problem is so great that these measures are not enough. The United States needs a fundamental rethinking of public policy priorities to improve the lives of the next generation of children.

Full text: CIUDAD GUYANA, Venezuela -- Julio Romero emerged from the flag-waving crowd as President NicolÃ¡s Maduro stood smiling on a stage, dancing to an election jingle.
Mr. Romero, 42, was in no mood to celebrate. He clutched the colostomy bag he has used since he was shot last September, when armed men stole his taxi and any chance he had of making a living. Though he had managed to attend the rally, Mr. Romero did not consider himself a supporter of the president.
He had come in search of food.
"I came here because I thought they would give me something to eat," said Mr. Romero, referring to the handouts often seen at government rallies.
Venezuela was once a country whose governing party used elections to speak about transforming society in revolutionary terms. It built homes and clinics and schools for the poor. Its ideas spread throughout the region, influencing leftist leaders throughout Latin America for more than a decade.
But years of mismanagement have scaled back those dreams, if not dismantled them altogether, in an economic collapse that is one of the worst in the Western Hemisphere in modern times.
This election, it seems, is in many ways about food.
Venezuela's inflation is already the worst in the world and is expected to hit a stunning 13,000 percent this year. Stores are empty and people sift through garbage for scraps. Many people call the country's malnutrition the "Maduro diet," laying blame for the gaunt figures that are common sights now on Mr. Maduro.
A large majority of Venezuelans are dependent on the government for subsidized groceries distributed by local councils loyal to the president. Food has even entered the election, potentially controlling the way Venezuelans will vote.
Many people receive their subsidies using a special identity card that is playing a big role in this election. For Sunday's vote, Venezuelans have been told to present these cards at stations run by Mr. Maduro's governing party at polling places -- so that party organizers can see who has voted and who has not.
"Everyone who has this card must vote," Mr. Maduro has said at his campaign rallies, directly linking government handouts to voting. "I give and you give."
Many see his words as wielding food as a tool to buy votes in the campaign -- or to intimidate hungry people who might consider voting against him.
"Maduro has put it clearly: It's an exchange of loyalty," said Margarita LÃ³pez Maya, a political scientist.
The election is a pivotal moment for Venezuela. The country's democracy has come under assault since Mr. Maduro won a special election in 2013 after the death of President Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
The big shift here began in late 2015, when Mr. Maduro's governing United Socialist Party lost control of the National Assembly. But before the new legislature could be seated, pro-Maduro lawmakers stacked the Supreme Court with loyalists, stifling the opposition's agenda.
Then in 2017, Mr. Maduro sidelined the legislature altogether, pushing through the creation of a new body, the Constituent Assembly, that had the power to rewrite the Constitution and effectively run the country. Mr. Maduro consolidated his power as the new group took over.
Now comes another major test for the country: a presidential vote that many international observers say has been engineered for Mr. Maduro to win a new term.
Many major international election observers have refused to monitor the vote on the grounds that it will not be fair. Most of the main opposition parties have been disqualified from running and their most popular potential candidates have been jailed or barred from holding office.
Those eligible to run have mostly called for a boycott. The date of the election is even a point of contention: The vote was called six months early, in what Mr. Maduro's rivals say was an effort to give them little time to prepare for it.
The United States and many countries in the region have said they will not recognize the winner of the election.
"They do whatever they want and put themselves above the law and above the interests of the people," said HÃ©ctor Navarro, who served for years as a minister in the government of Mr. ChÃ¡vez and is now part of a growing list of former top ChÃ¡vez officials who have become dissidents while still keeping their distance from the traditional opposition.
"In the history of Venezuela, every government has had its weaknesses and problems: murderous governments, thieving governments, incompetent governments, lazy governments, those have always been around," Mr. Navarro said. "But all at the same time? That has never happened before, a government with all of those traits."
It is the government's inability to feed its people that has stunned Venezuelans the most, even some of Mr. Maduro's fiercest supporters.
Isabela Romero, a 50-year-old schoolteacher, stood in the crowd of the president's supporters in Ciudad Guyana, once a growing industrial city whose wealth was fueled by iron, steel and aluminum. Many factories are idle, and lines outside of grocery stores have been endlessly long for years.
Two decades ago, Ms. Romero voted for Mr. ChÃ¡vez and saw the benefits of his reforms: She received a master's degree that his government paid for and a parcel of land that had been expropriated, she said.
Now her hopes have changed under Mr. Maduro. "He just needs to find a way to make an economic revolution, so we can eat once again," she said.
At his rally that day, the president sounded nearly contrite, saying he had made mistakes in the past and had "matured" -- a play on words using his last name. He promised big changes to get people to work once again, an "economic revolution" that would give people jobs and opportunities again. Mr. Maduro insists that the country's problems are the result of an "economic war" waged against it by the United States.
At a separate news conference, Mr. Maduro insisted that he was still a democrat. "Do they really think that people here are so stupid and submissive that they would put up with a dictator?" he said.
For some, the lack of food is just part of the desperation that has made many here receptive to the call for a boycott of the vote.
"People are very dispirited and they aren't prepared to go out and vote," said Miriam Bravo, a 40-year-old mother of seven with a 3-month-old baby in the sprawling Petare slum of Caracas, the capital. She said that her husband died in January from cancer, the victim of a health system in a free fall, with medicines scarce or nonexistent and adequate treatment often unavailable.
Ms. Bravo, a seamstress, said that before the crisis she and her husband used to take their children to the beach or to a park near the center of Caracas on weekends. Sometimes, they would treat themselves to a meal at McDonald's. Now she struggles to put food on the table even twice a day.
"I think that by voting I will just be supporting the government," Ms. Bravo said. "I don't think that the election should be carried out in these conditions."
While many opposition figures have called for a boycott of Sunday's election, the two main candidates who have defied that appeal to challenge Mr. Maduro are Henri FalcÃ³n, a former follower of Mr. ChÃ¡vez who later joined the opposition, and Javier Bertucci, a wealthy evangelical minister.
The question of abstention has weighed on the opposition, tearing apart what had been a unified front against Mr. Maduro in previous elections. His rivals faced a difficult choice: Participate in an election that many believed was rigged against them, or boycott the vote and assure a victory for Mr. Maduro.
On Thursday, those tensions were laid bare in Caracas outside the headquarters of Venezuela's intelligence agency, which contains a jail holding about 55 political prisoners, including opposition activists and a prominent opposition politician. The night before, many of those prisoners had begun a protest in which they occupied a section of the jail, sending out text messages and videos. The images showed a prisoner they said had been badly beaten on the orders of guards.
Outside the complex, family members of the prisoners and opposition activists gathered. Mr. Bertucci, the evangelical minister running against Mr. Maduro, showed up in what he said was an effort to draw attention to the prisoners' plight. But many of those present saw it as a campaign event for an illegitimate election.
"Get out!" they screamed, as he tried to speak to reporters. Someone threw water at him. "Bertucci is Maduro! I ask for democracy!" another shouted.
Mr. Bertucci remained calm. "Calling for abstention is not the way to free them," he said of the prisoners. "We have to do more than protest. I believe the only weapon is the vote."
DesireÃ© RodrÃ­guez, a volunteer cook at a Caracas soup kitchen, said that she intended to ignore calls for the boycott and would vote for Mr. FalcÃ³n.
Ms. RodrÃ­guez, 33, who has a 10-year-old son, said that before the soup kitchen opened in January, her family was short on food and often ate just twice a day. She recalled counting out the small potatoes she could afford to make sure there were enough for more than one meal, or carefully dividing up a ration of pasta to stretch it across two or more days.
"This is like an epidemic," she said. "Ask any poor person and they will tell you the same thing."
In a Caracas slum called La Vega, Iris Hidalgo, 50, struggled with the question of whether to vote on Sunday.
She said that she had always voted for Mr. ChÃ¡vez and then, in 2013, for Mr. Maduro.
"I regret it now," she said. "He destroyed the country."

Full text: SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Savannah's ocean ports feature skyscraping silver cranes that stand at attention on the water's edge. Container ships stretch the length of four football fields, with 40-foot containers stacked behind them like multicolored Lego bricks.
But an empty patch of freshly bulldozed dirt is the first spot at the sprawling Garden City Terminal that Griffith Lynch, the executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority, wants to show off.
That is the site of a new $127 million rail depot that will enable double-decker trains as long as the National Mall to be loaded right at the port. It is one piece of a larger vision that Mr. Lynch contends Savannah is uniquely positioned to achieve: Shippers here will be able to deliver goods to Midwestern cities in the time it takes other ports to finish heaving cargo off a boat.
The salesmanship is not just boasting. The nation's fourth-busiest gateway, the state-run Savannah port has tripled its traffic since 2000, bathing the region in tens of thousands of jobs. It has helped draw the manufacturing operations of foreign automakers to the region, and has a reputation for big ideas and nitty-gritty efficiency.
"I repeatedly hear that this is the best port in the country," said George T. Powers, president and chief executive of TradePort Logistics, who has been talking to scores of shippers as he scouts business for a new 100-door loading facility and a 650,000-square-foot fulfillment center he's building near the port.
That local confidence in the port's potential has apparently helped insulate some of Savannah's business leaders and workers -- whose livelihoods depend on global commerce -- from anxiety over rising tensions with trading partners.
When asked about the back and forth with key trading partners seeking exemptions from hefty steel and aluminum tariffs recently imposed by President Trump, hardly anyone at the port or the surrounding warehouses and transit points said they felt compelled to closely track the details.
Instead of a trade war, businesses talked of a trade hiccup.
"We feel very comfortable that this will just continue to grow," said Rebecca George Ogden, president of PortFresh Logistics, a 100,000-square-foot cold-storage and packing facility for produce that opened last year, contending that American appetites will carry the day. "The demand is so great. I really believe Americans are going to want their grapes in January and their citrus in June, this year-round availability that we're accustomed to."
The optimism is reflected in the shortage of industrial space -- a vacancy rate of 0.52 percent compared with the average 5 percent in a healthy market, according to Colliers International, a real estate services company. Tracts of land that the port puts on the market are "just gobbled up," said Clifford H. Dales, a principal of Colliers.
Whatever concern about tariffs exists, it has not had an impact on business, he said. "I really don't hear much about it," Mr. Dales said about local and out-of-town developers.
The port's fortunes have swung back and forth since the era when the world price for cotton was set in Savannah's trading post. Like other gateways up and down the East Coast, Savannah has bet heavily on attracting a hefty share of the supersize container ships routed through the enlarged Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. There is fierce competition for shippers, as well as for the additional millions of federal dollars needed to deepen waterways and create a speedy transportation network. But Savannah is poised to emerge as a winner.
"Savannah has become a magnet for containers," said Walter Kemmsies, an economist at Jones Lang LaSalle, who has advised more than a dozen American ports on development.
Savannah does have a few distinct assets, among them location. Its southern latitude disguises just how far west the shipping channel reaches -- far enough to catch a plumb line dropped from Cleveland.
Another is that in Savannah, unlike other major ports in the country that lease to different terminal operators, the ports authority runs the whole show.
That makes it easier to get containers from Point A to Point B. Truckers have a single check-in point when they enter and exit, and 9,700 feet of contiguous docking space. Several ships can dock on the same day, and the mechanics, crane operators and drivers working directly for the port can be quickly deployed where they are most needed.
In New Jersey, for instance, a trucker might make only one trip if the ship unloads at rush hour, Mr. Kemmsies said. In Savannah, warehouse owners said truckers can average four to six.
The result is that this southern port in a conservative, pro-business state -- home to the first city to outsource its entire municipal government -- has a competitive advantage that other ports lack. It is run solely by the government.
"A private owner would not have the same outlook," Mr. Powers of TradePort Logistics said. "The port's mission is not to create profit for themselves but to provide services and create jobs for the region."
This approach extends to the transportation hub, which is undergoing bridge, road and interchange modernizations designed to streamline port traffic. To finance the increased capacity on Georgia's roads, the state passed a gas tax indexed to inflation and fuel efficiency.
The port's coordinated investments are helping it lure ships away from the West Coast -- which is more vulnerable to trade tensions with China -- and nip at the heels of the Port of New York and New Jersey, its biggest rival in the East.
"Infrastructure drives jobs," said Ms. Ogden of PortFresh Logistics. "Georgia gets it."
Her company's warehouse, cold enough for workers to wear knitted ski masks, is 15 miles from the Garden City Terminal off Interstate 16 on a 182-acre parcel bought from the county and designated for port-related development. Aiming to double its building space within the next year, the company plans to expand its 120-person work force.
Nearby is a Mitsubishi Hitachi plant that makes gas and steam turbines. Its location six miles from the port was a key factor in the decision to set up manufacturing there, said Peter Mierke, the plant's general manager. The state and local governments paid for a rail spur to deliver the giant turbines directly from the warehouse to the docks.
The area has become a manufacturing powerhouse, and 10 of the 15 fastest-growing cities in the country are in the South.
"An enormous amount of foreign direct investment has been flowing into to the old Confederacy," said Jock O'Connell, an international trade adviser at Beacon Economics, a consulting firm based in Los Angeles. "The industrialization of the South and the population growth that has gone with it has created a market that is ripe for service by maritime trade."
Foreign car companies like Toyota, Mercedes and BMW -- the nation's largest auto exporter -- have set up factories in the Southeast in the last two decades, and their vast network of suppliers followed.
Kia opened a factory in Georgia in 2009. Part of the draw was the port, which was already knee deep in its infrastructure overhaul. The company was impressed, said Corinne Hodges, a spokeswoman for Kia, with "how quickly can a truck get in and out and how fast can freight get off the boat and get its way into the plant."
Savannah has also benefited from some unanticipated assistance. Labor troubles caused a monthslong slowdown at the nation's largest port complex in Los Angeles, stranding cargo on ships and frustrating retailers with tight deadlines. The episode pushed importers and shipping lines to diversify their points of entry and better acquainted them with the efficiencies of Savannah's port.
That may be why union leaders here emphasize that no matter what happens, they intend to keep the cargo moving.
"We don't think the administration is out to hurt anybody" with its trade policy, said Timothy S. Mackey, president of the 1,500-member Local 1414 of the International Longshoremen's Association. "Trump is a competitive guy, a businessman. He wants the best deal."
"But we'll do what we need to do," he said. "The world keeps moving."

Full text: Despite a choppy week of trading and a mixed finish for United States stocks, the market extended its recent streak of relative calm on Friday.
The S.&P. 500-stock index, the market's benchmark index, notched its 10th day in a row without a gain or drop of 1 percent or more. It was the longest stretch going back to Jan. 26, when the market broke four and a half months of calm with a 1.2 percent gain, which was also a record high.
Just one week later, the market entered an extended bout of volatility that included a rapid plunge of 10 percent in early February. That was the first "correction" the market had seen in two years.
Since then, the market has returned to quieter trading, even as American companies report fatter profits and investors grow anxious about rising interest rates and the threat of a trade war between the United States and China.
"Now it feels like investors are paralyzed trying to choose between a pretty solid economic picture and great earnings growth, and rising rates and ongoing geopolitical drama day to day," said Craig Birk, executive vice president of portfolio management at Personal Capital.
The S.&P. 500 index fell 7.16 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,712.97. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.11 points to 24,715.09. The Nasdaq composite lost 28.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,354.34.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 1.34 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,626.63, its third record high in a row.
The indexes finished the week in the red, but are still on track for gains this month, led by the Russell 2000.
After a strong start to the month, markets have been choppy this week as investors turned the page on the first-quarter earnings reporting season and weighed the implications of the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. The countries, which have threatened tariffs on each other, were holding discussions aimed at averting a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.
Traders have also been coming to grips with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note moving well past 3 percent. It hit 3.12 percent on Wednesday, its highest level in almost seven years.
"The issue of inflation is starting to rear its head again," said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment strategist for U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management. "That's got investors a bit nervous. And then we have the dollar strengthening and emerging markets weakening."
Even so, the S.&P. 500 has remained in a narrow trading range, keeping volatility largely under wraps, at least for now.
On Friday, shares of banks and technology companies were among the biggest decliners, offsetting gains by industrial and health care stocks. Energy company stocks also declined as crude oil prices closed lower.
Bond prices rose, sending yields lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.06 percent from 3.12 percent late Thursday. The pullback in bond yields, which affect interest rates on mortgages and other consumer loans, weighed on bank stocks. Citigroup stock fell 2.2 percent to $69.96.
Some companies' latest quarterly results or outlooks also put investors in a selling mood Friday.
Campbell Soup shares plunged 12.4 percent to $34.37 after the company lowered its profit forecast and said that its chief executive, Denise Morrison, was retiring effectively immediately. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500 and had its worst single-day drop since 1999.
Shares of the upscale department store chain Nordstrom tumbled 10.9 percent to $45.36 after the chain said sales at established stores, a key metric for retailers, showed meager gains in the first quarter.
Shares of the chip-making equipment maker Applied Materials slumped 8.2 percent to $49.51 after it forecast revenue for the current quarter that was below Wall Street's estimates.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 20 cents to settle at $71.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 79 cents to $78.51 a barrel in London.
The slide in oil prices was a drag on energy stocks. Shares of Range Resources slid 3.2 percent to $15.17.
Gold gained $2 to $1,290.20 an ounce.
The dollar fell to 110.71 yen from 110.77 yen on Thursday. The euro weakened to $1.1766 from $1.1793.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- If there is one thing that particularly irks Henri FalcÃ³n, it's the suggestion that you can't beat a dictatorship.
Mr. FalcÃ³n, a former governor, promises to defeat President NicolÃ¡s Maduro when Venezuela goes to the polls on Sunday. Few elections have been such a crossroads for democracy in South America in recent years -- and for the fate of one of its countries.
The daily hunger across Venezuela mounts, claiming the lives of infants and sending hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border. Inflation is mind-boggling, whittling the nation's minimum wage to the equivalent of $3 a month.
The International Monetary Fund predicts that Venezuela's inflation -- already considered the highest in the world -- will hit 13,000 percent this year, destroying the livelihoods of the poor and professional classes alike. The nation's currency, the bolÃ­var, now trades at more than 700,000 to the dollar on the streets of Venezuela, and is worth less with each passing day.
Amid the collapse stands Mr. Maduro, the country's president since 2013, who now rules with an authoritarian fist. Street protests against him have been met by deadly force. The legislature was effectively dissolved, replaced by a body of Mr. Maduro's loyalists called the Constituent Assembly in a vote that the government's own election software contractor denounced as tainted by manipulation.
Now the president has agreed to go up for re-election. But it comes with a catch: The most popular candidates among the opposition either have been barred from running or are jailed as political prisoners. After some opposition parties boycotted a previous election, the Constituent Assembly ruled that they would not be allowed to run in this one, either.
Enter Mr. FalcÃ³n, a former member of Mr. Maduro's United Socialist Party who campaigns as though the president's grip on power is an inevitable advantage for any opposition.
"In the history of the world, these governments always fall by decisive action -- by the votes of their own people," Mr. FalcÃ³n said.
"Chile under Pinochet came out toward democracy peacefully," he added. "And that's how power changed in Nicaragua, in Peru -- and even in Spain after Franco."
So Mr. FalcÃ³n, 56, has launched what most here see as a long-shot candidacy, but one that has already injected some measure of debate into an otherwise lopsided election. He pledges to rescue the country's economy by using the dollar as its currency, to open the country's oil sector to more foreign investment and to start paying workers a minimum of $75 a month.
In doing so, he is also taking on the opposition itself -- defying its boycott of the election. Not all opposition parties were banned by the government, but the biggest ones were. So a coalition of opposition parties joined together and boycotted the election in protest.
Now, many opposition politicians describe Mr. FalcÃ³n and his Progressive Advance party as traitors, calling on their supporters not to vote at all.
"Those that are participating today, like FalcÃ³n, they're collaborating with the regime," said Jorge MillÃ¡n, an opposition lawmaker who says he will not vote. "They're aiding Maduro, who is looking for legitimacy in this electoral farce."
Mr. FalcÃ³n dismissed that idea, saying the only way to win was to take part in elections.
"What do you gain from abstention?" said Mr. FalcÃ³n, arguing that the collapse of the economy created the exact conditions in which Mr. Maduro could lose.
Polling points to some wisdom in these words.
Independent polls show Mr. FalcÃ³n with a significant edge over Mr. Maduro, fueled by deep anger over the shortages of food, medicine and water that accompanied a drop in oil prices in recent years and decades of economic mismanagement. Mr. FalcÃ³n's campaign also seems to have kept his popularity intact even as the opposition's reputation tanked when it declined to put forward a candidate.
But the realities of Mr. Maduro's Venezuela may be hard to overcome.
Like his predecessor, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, Mr. Maduro has used the largess of the state -- even food, which the government controls -- to rally voters and mobilize them on Sunday. Even so, a large majority of voters, particularly in the opposition, is expected to heed the call to abstain. And with the opposition boycotting the vote, few auditors who are not aligned with Mr. Maduro will be reviewing the results.
Beyond that, many voters are simply gone. More than a million Venezuelans have recently fled the country and its collapsing economy, a diaspora that is deeply angered with Mr. Maduro but unlikely to vote on Sunday, analysts say.
"Is the vote fair? It's clearly not fair," said David Smilde, a professor of sociology at Tulane University who studies Venezuela. "But sometimes, even in unfair conditions, it's possible for the opposition to win."
Mr. FalcÃ³n likes to argue that he is best positioned to lead the divided country because he came from the very party he aims to defeat. After Mr. ChÃ¡vez was elected in 1998, Mr. FalcÃ³n helped rewrite the Constitution, then rose to become mayor of Barquisimeto, a large city, and governor of the surrounding state, Lara.
Accounts differ on why Mr. FalcÃ³n left the party in 2010. Most analysts say it was because Mr. ChÃ¡vez was sidelining him as a rising star. Mr. FalcÃ³n says he felt that the governing party's drive to nationalize private assets was leading it to an economic disaster.
Mr. FalcÃ³n continued on as governor as a member of the opposition, but lost his seat last year. He wasted little time in mounting a bid for the presidency and working out what he says is a remedy for the country's failing economy.
His first step would be to switch to the dollar.
Mr. FalcÃ³n argues that the country's most painful economic problems, such as low wages, stem from runaway inflation.
Francisco RodrÃ­guez, an economist on leave from the New York investment bank Tornio Capital who is advising Mr. FalcÃ³n, said that moving to the dollar would stem inflation almost immediately. Within three months, government workers would be paid at least $75 a month, he contends, widening access to food.
"With what they're paid now, you can't even get people to show up to work," he said.
Next, Mr. FalcÃ³n says, he would topple other tenets of the ruling party, such as price controls, which economists say have led to shortages by making items more costly to produce than to sell.
And in the meantime, Mr. FalcÃ³n says, he would release scores of political prisoners, while re-establishing ties to the United States.
It remains unclear how Mr. FalcÃ³n would govern, even if he does win and Mr. Maduro accepts the result.
The country's military has been loyal to the president, who has given top leaders control over lucrative parts of the economy. And the ruling party still runs the Constituent Assembly, the body created to sideline the legislature and rewrite the Constitution.
Mr. FalcÃ³n says he's willing to take that risk. On a recent day, he ticked off the miseries of his fellow citizens, offering each one as a reason to vote: "They are humble, poor people, people who have no food, people who have no medicine, people who have no services -- the water is gone, the light is gone."
Despite the obstacles, Mr. FalcÃ³n is counting on people like JosÃ© RodrÃ­guez, a 63-year-old pensioner whose monthly check does not cover the cost of food.
Mr. RodrÃ­guez waited for Mr. FalcÃ³n at a gathering in Barquisimeto, where the presidential hopeful had first risen as a politician. It was a crowd of just 200, but Mr. RodrÃ­guez had waited for three hours. There were few left in his home, he said: Both of his children had left the country, seeking jobs and food.
"I'm not leaving because I'm not young enough to leave," he said. "I'm here fighting."
Elsewhere, JosÃ© Manuel Vargas, a 22-year-old member of the party, denounced Mr. Maduro's management and wore a jacket with the colors of the Venezuelan flag.
Then for a moment his face changed and he looked regretful.
"I'm not going to lie," he said. "I have thought of leaving."
A few hours later, Mr. FalcÃ³n arrived, walking down a wide commercial street full of shuttered restaurants and businesses, not a customer in sight. He shook hands along the road and stopped a few times to hug people.
Some walked away smiling. Others didn't.
"That's the same as Maduro," said a woman nearby.
The crowd started to disperse. Mr. FalcÃ³n darted behind a corner and was gone.
"If we don't vote," he said, "we squander the great opportunity we have before us."

Full text: DURHAM, N.C. -- The nationwide teacher protest movement spread to a sixth state on Wednesday as thousands in North Carolina rallied at the Capitol for higher pay and more money for schools. It was the first mass walkout for teachers in the state.
In the months since the movement began, teachers have walked out in deep-red states and purple states; in states with booming economies and ones that are struggling; in states where school funding scrapes the bottom, and others where the numbers are closer to the national average.
Despite the diversity and seemingly endless energy, the movement has limits. Most states have schools that are funded more or less equally from state and local coffers, with voters making many financial decisions close to home. But North Carolina shares something with other walkout states: Its state government plays an unusually strong role in funding education and setting its priorities, often superseding the influence of school districts.
This strong-state model can include a larger-than-typical role for state governments in funding schools, a state-mandated salary schedule for teachers or efforts to equalize funding between poor and rich school districts.
Because of such policies, the states are, in a way, ripe for large-scale labor actions, despite having weak public sector unions. Unlike some Northeast states where teachers in one town can earn $20,000 more than those in a nearby city, low-income and middle-class districts in the states that have had walkouts have similar teacher salary and school funding challenges, building solidarity -- and political leverage -- across hundreds of miles.
In states where education financing is locally driven, teacher labor actions usually look more like the one-day strike that occurred in March in Jersey City. Several thousand union members, protesting rising health care costs, stayed out of work and later came to an agreement with the school board. The rest of the state was not affected.
In North Carolina, where teachers from across the state wore red and filled the streets of the capital on Wednesday, the state provides 58 percent of the funding. Raleigh sets a salary floor of $35,000 for beginning teachers. Districts can use local money, collected largely from property taxes, to add to that, with supplements varying between nothing and over $8,000 a year.
Teacher salaries across the United States have failed to keep pace with inflation since 2009, falling by an average of 4 percent, according to data from the National Education Association, the national teachers' union. The drop is steeper in the six walkout states -- Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia.
In North Carolina, inflation-adjusted salaries are down 9 percent since 2009. Teachers earned an average of $9,000 less than the national average of $59,000 during the 2016-7 school year, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics. North Carolina is also the top user of foreign teachers brought in via the J-1 temporary visa, a trend that has accelerated because of stagnant pay.
After Republicans took control of state government in 2013, North Carolina ended the estate tax and lowered corporate taxes as well as some personal income taxes.
The actions, plus the recession, meant schools took a hit. Since 2009, the budgets for supplies, textbooks and school technology have been slashed by about half, according to the Public School Forum of North Carolina, a nonpartisan research group. And a greater share of teacher compensation has been dedicated toward pensions and health care costs.
Symone Kiddoo, 27, is a school social worker in Durham. On Tuesday, she packed and distributed hundreds of donated meals to students at Southwest Elementary School and Forest View Elementary School. Ms. Kiddoo is the sole social worker for both schools, where over half of the 1,400 students come from low-income families. The food was for students to eat when school was closed for the walkout.
Ms. Kiddoo spends her days responding to behavioral incidents, like a student overturning a table, and counseling children through crises, like the death of a parent. She makes sure students who can't see the chalkboard get glasses, and she maintains a food pantry and a clothing closet for children in need.
She earns about $42,000 a year and works a second job as a pool attendant at the Y.M.C.A. She said she was participating in the walkout not primarily because of low pay, but for more mental health funding to hire social workers, school psychologists and counselors.
"We are scrappers," she said, able to get a lot done with few resources. Still, she said it would be easier if social workers were assigned to one school at a time.
As in Arizona, the last state to mount a widespread walkout, traditional public schools here have been challenged by the expansion of charter schools and private school vouchers.
When students leave a traditional public school, they takes their per-pupil funding with them. While the traditional school no longer has to provide them with instruction, other costs remain, like the repair of a roof or a heating system.
According to a 2016 state report, North Carolina schools had about $8 billion of facilities needs.
Proponents for traditional public schools worry that in many districts, charters and vouchers are attracting students who are whiter and more affluent than the overall student population, making it easier for some voters to reject tax increases to pay for education, thinking their own children will not be impacted.
"It's my biggest concern, that we've become more segregated," said Mark Jewell, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, the state's largest teachers' union.
Rhonda Dillingham, executive director of the North Carolina Association for Public Charter Schools, said she agreed that teachers should be paid more but would not be participating in the protest because of the negative rhetoric about school choice.
"I can't get behind the rally," Ms. Dillingham said. "As far as segregation, charter schools are open to all North Carolina students. I can't think of anything more segregating than a child's ZIP code and what a parent is able to pay for a house."
Conservatives see the walkout movement as partisan, with Democratic Party-aligned groups trying to fire up their base ahead of November's midterm elections. They acknowledge that teacher salaries could be higher and that more money is needed for items like textbooks, but point to the difficulty of balancing state budgets that must also pay for Medicaid and pension systems.
"The only discernible crisis for the organizers of the event is that Republicans still control the General Assembly," said Terry Stoops, director of education studies at the John Locke Foundation, a conservative research group in Raleigh.
Mr. Jewell, the union president, has been candid about wanting to change the makeup of the legislature. The walkout, which he calls a "day of advocacy," is "just the beginning of a long stretch that we're calling the six-month haul" toward the ballot box.
The Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, has proposed an average pay raise for teachers of 8 percent and wants to halt planned tax cuts for businesses and high-earners in order to dedicate more money to schools.
Republicans, who hold a veto-proof majority, say they can offer a 6 percent raise and smaller class sizes while maintaining tax cuts, and say additional raises should be tied to performance. Over the last several years, they phased out a program that paid teachers more for earning a master's degree and did away with most tenure protections.
In North Carolina, as in the other five walkout states, union membership is optional for teachers.
Mr. Jewell came to North Carolina from West Virginia, where he participated in a 1990 statewide walkout. This winter, when he saw rank-and-file teachers in his home state organizing on Facebook, he said he knew he wanted his own association to lead the way toward a mass labor action. "You have to get in front of the movement," he said.
What state could be the next to have a teacher walkout? There have been scattered rumblings of protest in Nevada and Louisiana. And there are at least five additional states that meet the major conditions for a statewide action: centralized governance and funding, and below-average teacher pay and per-student spending. The states are Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas and New Mexico.

Full text: Losses in technology and health-care companies helped pull U.S. stocks lower Tuesday, snapping an eight-day winning streak by the Dow Jones industrial average.
The broad sell-off followed a slide in bond prices, which sent the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in almost seven years. That paves the way for higher borrowing costs on mortgages and other loans.
The prospect of higher mortgage interest rates weighed on homebuilders, while the rise in bond yields sent shares in high-dividend paying stocks lower.
"We're of the view that we're not in a high-rate environment, we're in a less-low rate environment," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "So we're not too concerned at these levels, but that's definitely driving the market today."
The S.&P. 500 index fell 18.68 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,711.45. The Dow lost 193 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,706.41. The drop pulled the 30-company average to a slight loss for the year.
The Nasdaq composite dropped 59.69 points, or 0.8 percent, to 7,351.63. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks finished flat at 1,600.34.
The market slide comes in the midst of a strong May for stocks. The Dow is on track for a gain of 2.2 percent, while the S.&P. 500 is closing in on a gain of 2.4 percent. The Nasdaq is up 4 percent.
On Tuesday, the bond market appeared to hold investors' focus.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.07 percent from 3 percent late Monday. That is the highest level since July 2011 for the yield, which is used to set interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans.
The surge came after the Commerce Department said retail sales climbed 0.3 percent in April. The agency revised March sales higher to 0.8 percent from 0.6 percent. The retail sales data suggest that consumers are spending more after a weak first quarter. Bond yields tend to rise when investors expect faster economic growth and higher inflation.
The Federal Reserve has signaled that it will raise rates twice more this year, after having done so initially in March, and most economists foresee the next increase in June. Some Fed watchers have been cautioning that any lasting uptick in inflation or in economic growth might spur the Fed to pursue an additional rate increase before year's end.
"The stock market was due for a digestion of the gains that we've seen over the last eight trading sessions," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
The rise in bond yields pulled down shares in real estate investment trusts and other high-dividend paying stocks. Essex Property Trust fell 3.3 percent to $233.78.
It also put investors in the mood to sell their shares in homebuilders. Mortgage rates, which have been rising this year, tend to track the movement in the 10-year Treasury yield. Higher mortgage rates can make it harder for would-be buyers to afford to purchase a home. D. R. Horton slid 6.7 percent to $40.58.
Some banks got a boost from the higher rates, which make loans more profitable. Capital One Financial rose 1.6 percent to $94.65.
The home-improvement retailer Home Depot dropped 1.7 percent to $187.98 after reporting weaker-than-expected sales, partly because of inclement weather.
Technology and health-care companies took some of the worst losses. Chipmaker Nvidia fell 3.8 percent to $245.56. The drugmaker Celgene slid 3.9 percent to $81.98.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil reversed an early side, rising 35 cents to settle at $71.31 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oil, added 20 cents to close at $78.43 a barrel in London.
The dollar's gains weighed on precious metals prices. Gold fell $27.90, or 2.1 percent, to $1,290.30 an ounce. Silver dropped 38 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $16.27 an ounce. Copper slipped 4 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $3.06 a pound.

Bond Market Signals Doubt About Economic Goals

Full text: As a candidate, President Trump said he would increase United States economic growth to 4 percent annually -- and in one debate even added, "I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent."
Once he was in the White House, his administration revised those projections lower, saying its approach "means sustained 3 percent economic growth."
After the economy grew by 2.3 percent in 2017, investors in some of the world's largest markets are betting that the United States will continue to fall short of the White House goal.
The Federal Reserve has started raising short-term interest rates to reflect the economy's recovery, but longer-term rates -- over which the Fed traditionally has far less influence -- have not moved nearly as much. To many in the bond markets, that suggests investors think little has changed about long-term growth prospects.
"They're not expecting growth to move up to 3 percent on a sustained basis," said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives, an economic consulting firm. "They're not looking for inflation to break out in any meaningful way on a sustained basis. It's not ominous. But it does sort of confirm that investors are still seeing the world in that way."
That does not mean the United States is about to enter a recession. By most measures, the economy is in fairly good shape as the current expansion -- the second-longest on record -- stretches into its ninth year. At 3.9 percent, unemployment hasn't been this low since 2000. Corporate profits are strong. Manufacturing activity has picked up.
But with rates in Fed-sensitive short-term government bond markets rising while longer-term rates are relatively flat, the gap between them has narrowed. And the plotting of those data points, known as the yield curve, occupies an outsize space in the minds of those who consider the markets a crucial barometer of economic health.
The gap between short-term and long-term rates tends to shrink -- a phenomenon known as flattening -- whenever the Federal Reserve begins lifting interest rates, which the Fed started doing in December 2015. Over the last year, the gap between interest rates on 10-year and two-year Treasuries flattened from more than 1 percentage point to less than half a percentage point, its lowest point in more than a decade.
But as the yield curve flattens, long-term interest rates run the risk of falling below short-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. And when the yield curve inverts, as it did most recently in 2006-7, it amounts to an economic warning from the financial markets to watch out: Recession is on the way.
"We're not there yet, but we're getting progressively closer," said Steven Abrahams, head of investment strategy at the broker dealer Amherst Pierpont. "And I think we will get closer, faster than the market currently anticipates."
In a speech last month, the San Francisco Federal Reserve president, John Williams, described an inverted yield curve as "a powerful signal of recessions."
In part, that's because the yield curve is more than just an economic indicator. It actually helps determine decisions that are crucial to the health of the American economy. That's because a flattening yield curve makes banking -- basically the business of borrowing money at low short-term rates, and lending it at higher long-term rates -- less profitable. If the yield curve inverts, it effectively slams the doors on lending. And because debt is the fuel that drives the economy's engine, a recession often follows.
Mr. Williams emphasizes that he does not see an inverted yield curve, or recession, coming any time soon. And most economists agree. Over the next few years, private forecasters see United States economic growth peaking at 2.8 percent in 2018 before slowing to 2.5 percent in 2019 and 1.9 percent in 2020, according to Bloomberg data. That's a bit faster than the 2.2 percent growth rate of the United States economy since 2012.
But it's basically the same as the 2.6 percent average growth rate since 1980, suggesting that the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul signed into law by Mr. Trump in December is expected to have a negligible effect on long-term economic growth. Doing better would depend on increasing the supply of workers and raising productivity, a poorly understood process generally thought to depend on making large-scale investments in things like education, infrastructure and expensive equipment for companies.
Not everyone agrees that the bond market is sending a warning sign. For much of the last decade, the Federal Reserve and other central banks have been buying government bonds with the aim of pushing interest rates lower to support economic growth.
So the relatively low long-term rates partly reflect the large bond holdings of central banks, said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank. That means those low rates contain "much less of a signal about negative growth in the future," Mr. Luzzetti said.
But some view the flattening of the yield as a sign that the economy is weaker than it might appear.
Hoisington Investment Management, a bond investment firm based in Austin, Tex., has long held the view that long-term interest rates will go lower. Its chief economist, Lacy Hunt, ticked off a list of current trouble spots: slowing auto sales, skimpy inflation-adjusted wage growth, low savings rates and sluggish construction.
"There are signs out there, they don't receive much attention," said Mr. Hunt, whose firm manages more than $4 billion for insurance companies, nonprofit organizations and pension plans. "But the flattening of the yield curve is an indication that there is a body of people that do think the future outlook is not nearly as good as the current conditions."

Full text: When the next big recession comes, we'll be much better off if governments have established a new kind of bond tied to the ups and downs of the economy.
In fact, just such a financial innovation is almost ready for the marketplace.
The investment vehicle, called a G.D.P.-linked bond because it is tied to fluctuations in a country's gross domestic product, would be immensely valuable to cash-strapped governments when revenue fell and debt-service costs climbed. In those circumstances, payments on G.D.P.-linked bonds would decline. That's because the bonds automatically reduce debt payments as the economy weakens, a boon to governments but not obviously a good thing for investors.
In boom times, on the other hand, investors would profit as national economies grow and payouts on the bonds increase. If G.D.P-linked bonds had been on the market, global investors could have cashed in on the rapid growth of China's economy over the past few decades by buying the Chinese version of such bonds. This would not have been the same as investing in Chinese stocks, which would have represented a claim only on earnings of then-traded corporations based in China.
The idea behind these bonds may seem strange. But many financial innovations that are now commonplace also seemed strange at one time.
Consider the inflation-linked bonds known as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or T.I.P.S. They are standard, unexciting and very useful now. But that wasn't always the case.
In 1996, John Y. Campbell of Harvard University and I wrote a research paper about these bonds, as well as an op-ed piece in The New York Times, in which we argued that they be established, something that finally took place in 1997. At the time, a Treasury official told me jokingly that the bonds should be sold to members of the American Economic Association because economists seemed to be the only people who were interested in them.
Many people are interested in buying them now.
In December, T.I.P.S. accounted for 9 percent of the federal debt held by the public, or more than $1 trillion. While inflation is low now, people perceive that there remains a risk it could rise, which has sustained a strong market for those bonds.
I see a parallel with G.D.P.-linked bonds. Persuading people that we need such bonds is an uphill climb at the moment. No country has ever issued them (although there have been analogues in the form of warrants). And G.D.P.-linked bonds may be unappealing because, superficially, they, unlike T.I.P.S., seem to add risk to investor portfolios. But there is more to these proposed bonds than is immediately apparent.
Basically, once the market sets an appropriate price for G.D.P.-linked bonds, their benefits are straightforward.
From the Treasury's standpoint, the bonds would be helpful in a major financial crisis, when economic growth, inflation and tax revenue fall but conventional debt stays burdensome. Without G.D.P.-linked bonds -- or extraordinary intervention by government or multilateral institutions, as happened in the most recent global financial crisis -- a nation can find itself at risk of default.
In a crisis like that, investors would suffer as bond payments declined. In expansions, however, investors would benefit. In the United States, for example, bondholders can probably expect strong long-term growth in gross domestic product, which has risen 3.2 percent a year in real dollars, or 6.1 percent in nominal dollars, since 1929. Foreign investors should want such bonds to diversify their holdings.
Purchases of G.D.P.-linked bonds by investors outside the United States would be good for the American government because foreigners would be assuming part of this country's economic risks from all causes, including global warming.
Furthermore, if countries around the world issued G.D.P.-linked bonds, truly diversified global portfolios would be possible, allowing investors to share in risk and to benefit from growth. Modern finance tells us that this would lead to safer, not riskier portfolios.
Such arguments are gaining traction these days, with support for the bonds last year at the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, at the European Commission, and in recent meetings and working papers.
James Benford of the Bank of England, Jonathan Ostry of the International Monetary Fund and I have put together analyses from 20 experts on how to create G.D.P.-linked bonds.The results appear in a new open-source e-book, "Sovereign G.D.P.-Linked Bonds, Rationale and Design" available on the VoxEU website.
One section is a kind of cookbook with detailed instructions for how to build this new type of government bond. An ad hoc working group that included Allen and Overy, an international law firm based in London prepared specifications, which should be helpful for governments that want to create the bonds.
Some technical details still need to be worked out.
It is not clear, for example, how credit rating agencies would rate these new bonds. They do not rate equities today and might conclude that individual G.D.P.-linked bonds were too similar to stocks in their risk/return profiles to permit a bond rating.
One legal issue to be resolved is whether G.D.P.-linked bonds would come with provisions that allowed disputes to be settled by a vote of a supermajority of investors, who have come to expect this protection from so-called collective action clauses in other types of sovereign bonds.
There are also questions about the maturity structure of the bonds. At one extreme, they could be perpetual (unlike, say a 30-year bond, which is paid off in 30 years). My colleague Mark Kamstra of York University and I have proposed that national governments sell bonds called trills -- trillionth shares in gross domestic product, on a perpetual basis.
Specifically, a trill would pay an annual dividend equal to one trillionth of that particular year's G.D.P., and would do so without any end date. This would define the bonds in a transparent way, implying that they are natural extensions of stock markets, which are also perpetual. The trills would go even further because they encompass everything that goes on in an economy.
The remaining issues need not be major obstacles. In fact, an advanced country's government could issue G.D.P.-linked bonds now, setting an example for others to follow. Eventually, a vibrant market for the bonds could exist worldwide.
Once that happens, we can use G.D.P.-linked bonds as diversification tools, providing another way to protect vulnerable people and governments against economic fluctuations. One day, we may well take these bonds for granted, as if they had always existed.

Full text: A broad rally drove stocks in the United States solidly higher Thursday for the second day in a row, extending the market's gains for the week.
Technology companies, which have led the market this year, contributed the most to the rally. Health care stocks and banks also accounted for a big slice of the market's gains as investors sized up the latest company earnings and economic news. Crude oil prices rebounded after an early slide.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 25.28 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,723.07. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 196.99 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,739.53. The gain turned the Dow back to positive for the year.
The Nasdaq added 65.07 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,404.98.
The major indexes were moving higher from the get-go Thursday as investors sifted through the latest measure of inflation in the economy.
The Labor Department said that consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in April, a sign that broader inflation pressure remains muted. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices ticked up just 0.1 percent last month and 2.1 percent from April last year.
Slower growth in core prices may mean that the Federal Reserve will be less inclined to accelerate interest rate hikes. The Fed has signaled it will lift rates twice more this year, following an increase in March. Some expect that an uptick in inflation or economic growth might spur the Fed to add a third hike.
"It tells us that rates are going to continue to go higher, but maybe it starts to call into question: Are we really going to have four? Maybe three is enough," said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.
Bond investors appeared to interpret the consumer prices data as a sign that the Fed is not likely to speed up the pace of its planned rate hikes. Bond prices rose, pulling the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.96 percent from 3.01 percent late Wednesday.
Technology stocks extended their gains. The sector, up 11.1 percent this year, is ahead of all others.
On Thursday, Qualcomm led the sector, climbing 3.4 percent to $54.97 after the company's board approved a $10 billion share buyback.
Envision Healthcare was the biggest gainer among health care stocks. The company added 5 percent to $42.74. Cardinal Health also moved higher, adding 3.8 percent to $54.74 after The Wall Street Journal reported that experts think the Trump administration's plan to reduce drug prices will not have a big effect on costs.
Traders also had their eye on corporate earnings Thursday.
CenturyLink jumped 7.5 percent to $19.40 after the telecom company reported earnings that were much higher than analysts were expecting.
Booking Holdings slid 4.7 percent to $2,080.02 after its latest quarterly report card disappointed traders.
L Brands slumped 7.2 percent to $31.68 after the retailer said it expects to only reach the low end of its first-quarter profit forecast.
Benchmark United States crude oil reversed an early slide. It rose 22 cents to settle at $71.36 a barrel in New York.
The dollar fell to 109.37 yen from 109.72 yen on Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.1925 from $1.1847. The pound weakened to $1.3519 from $1.3555 after the Bank of England held off raising interest rates due to weaker economic growth so far this year.
Gold rose $9.50 to $1,320.80 an ounce.

Full text: CHICAGO -- Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is one of the most successful businessmen of all time. He has amassed an unfathomable fortune, reportedly $131 billion. This presents a predicament. Mr. Bezos commands far more money than any one person could possibly spend, far more than any one family dynasty could possibly spend. What should he do with all this money?
Unfortunately, Mr. Bezos appears to have come up with a terrible response.
"The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel," he said in a recent interview. He has founded a company called Blue Origin that builds reusable rockets. He wants to send tourists into space and envisions a future in which heavy industry -- and millions of workers -- will be based out there. Mr. Bezos called Blue Origin "incredibly important for civilization long term."
How much does Mr. Bezos plan to spend on this gonzo space adventure? He said he would start with $1 billion a year. He has every right to do that. I fear that he will go further and shoot much of his fortune into space. That would squander a staggering opportunity to serve humanity.
How big is this opportunity? Ignoring inflation, let's assume that the annual investment returns to his fortune are about 5 percent. He can spend more than $6 billion every year, pretty much indefinitely. Consider a few obvious ways this money could help people here on Planet Earth:
If Mr. Bezos wants to strengthen America's future scientific prowess, he could finance intensive math tutoring for about two million high school students every year -- forever. Randomized trials here in Chicago indicate that such programs bring large academic benefits. They also substantially reduce racial disparities in school performance, helping to create a fairer, more prosperous America.
If he wants to nourish the high-tech sector that enabled his fortune, he could endow eight M.I.T.-size universities around the world and still have billions left over.
If he prefers to improve global health, he would barely break a sweat providing $1.50 eyeglasses to a nearsighted Indian schoolgirl, a farsighted Nigerian truck driver and a billion others. Or he could buy a $2 mosquito net for everyone in Africa who needs one. On top of that, he could double the International Rescue Committee's annual expenditures to assist refugees, forever. He would still have enough left over to permanently double the budgets of World Health Organization programs that address communicable diseases, health emergencies, vaccinations and other global health threats.
If he wants to improve American health, he could permanently double the National Cancer Institute's budget. Or he could triple the National Institutes of Health spending on mental health, alcohol and drug addiction.
Maybe he wants to improve opportunities for young people. He could provide summer jobs for one million high-risk youth across America, every year, forever. And he'd still have enough left over to open a $1,000 individual development account for every infant born in America from now on.
Maybe he wants to focus on climate change. He could accelerate the march of progress by awarding large cash prizes for innovations in energy storage and other technologies.
There's no doubt that Amazon's customers and employees have benefited from Mr. Bezos's entrepreneurial success. But other than his admirable stewardship of The Washington Post, he has done conspicuously less to aid humanity than have many other tycoons, even those who command far less wealth. Mr. Bezos's comments and record regarding philanthropy reflect a surprising lack of creativity and strategic vision regarding what his fortune could accomplish.
If he doesn't want to be personally involved in such philanthropy, he can always outsource. He can simply follow Warren Buffett's example and write a huge check to Bill Gates, who lives barely a mile away and knows a few things about philanthropy.
Over the last generation, globalization, technological advancements and regulatory policies have allowed the richest Americans to accumulate unprecedented wealth. Hey, it's a free country. As long as they follow the law, billionaires have the right to do what they want with their wealth. Certainly Mr. Bezos is entitled to follow whatever personal quest catches his fancy. But if he's talking about investing in the future of civilization, he and every other fabulously wealthy person has an accompanying obligation to be methodical and evidence-based -- to do better at doing good.
Mr. Bezos will be remembered as a great businessman. It's up to him whether he will be remembered as someone who used his wealth and talent to make our world a better place for his children, and for ours.

Full text: Technology companies and banks helped power U.S. stocks to solid gains Wednesday, improving on the market's flat finish a day earlier.
Energy stocks led the gainers after the price of crude oil climbed back above $70 a barrel a day after the U.S. moved to withdraw from a nuclear accord with Iran. Gains in industrial and materials companies outweighed losses in safe-play sectors such as utilities and phone companies.
"The areas of strength that you're seeing today are encouraging," said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. "Energy, financials, materials and industrials. Those are more cyclical areas of the market, and that speaks to economic strength and a risk appetite on the part of investors."
The S&P 500 index rose 25.87 points, or 1 percent, to 2,697.79. The gain nudged the benchmark index into positive territory for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average posted its fifth gain in a row, climbing 182.33 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,542.54.
The Nasdaq added 73 points, or 1 percent, to 7,339.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 9.66 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,596.05.
The indexes are on track to end the week with solid gains. They were moving higher for much of the morning as investors weighed the latest corporate quarterly results.
Electronic Arts led a technology sector rally, climbing 5.7 percent to $131.01 after the video game maker's latest quarterly results beat forecasts.
TripAdvisor soared 22.8 percent to $47.62 after the online travel booking company reported earnings that were much higher than analysts expected. It also raised its annual forecast.
While technology companies helped drive the market higher, energy sector stocks racked up the biggest gain as crude oil prices rebounded a day after the Trump administration moved to withdraw the U.S. from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and reinstate sanctions on the country.
"We've had some noise from Iran, but some of the underlying (oil market) trends are probably still intact in terms of a recovering economy, high demand and higher inflation," Delwiche said.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil climbed $2.08, or 3 percent, to settle at $71.14 per barrel in New York. That's the highest level in nearly three and a half years. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, gained $2.36, or 3.2 percent, to close at $77.21 per barrel in London.
The pickup in oil prices sent energy stocks higher. Occidental Petroleum rose 5.4 percent to $82.40.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3 percent from 2.98 percent late Tuesday. The rise in yields pushed up interest rates, which allows banks to make more money from loans. Financial sector stocks rose. Bank of America gained 2.6 percent to $30.72.
Some companies' quarterly results put investors in a selling mood.
Monster Beverage slumped 7.5 percent to $49.11 after the energy drink maker reported disappointing sales in the first quarter and said its profit margins decreased.
Papa John's International dropped 3.7 percent to $56.55 after the pizza chain's first-quarter results fell short of analyst estimates.
Walt Disney's better-than-expected results also failed to impress traders, who took a dim view of the entertainment company's struggling ESPN network. Disney shares fell 1.8 percent to $99.97.
Walmart Stores slid 3.1 percent to $83.06 after the retailer agreed to buy a 77 percent stake in India's Flipkart in a $16 billion deal. The move is Walmart's biggest acquisition yet and reflects the retailer's focus on growth opportunities as it tries to narrow the gap with Amazon.com.
The dollar strengthened to 109.72 yen from 109.02 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.1861 from $1.1858.
Gold dipped 70 cents to $1,313 an ounce. Silver added 7 cents to $16.54 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $3.06 a pound.
In other energy futures trading, heating oil rose 6 cents to $2.22 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline added 6 cents to $2.17 a gallon. Natural gas gained a penny to $2.74 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Major indexes in Europe finished higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 gained 0.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 1.3 percent.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.4 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.4 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.3 percent. Stocks rose in Taiwan, Singapore and Indonesia, but fell in Thailand and the Philippines.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

President Repeats Inaccurate Claims in Critique of 2015 Agreement

Full text: President Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday and delivered familiar -- and not entirely accurate -- broadsides against the diplomatic agreement he has long called "the worst deal ever."
Here are some of his claims, fact-checked.
"In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium."
This is misleading.
The nuclear agreement does allow Iran to enrich uranium, but it limited enrichment capacity to less than one bomb's worth for 15 years.
Iran also gave up about 97 percent of its existing stockpile and two-thirds of its centrifuges. Under the deal, it can use no more than 5,060 first-generation centrifuges for a decade -- which The New York Times's Max Fisher has described as "so few, and such old models, and under constant monitoring, that it poses relatively little threat."
More advanced centrifuges were placed under monitored storage or can be used only for limited research purposes approved by the other signers of the deal.
The deal also sought to prevent the possibility of a plutonium bomb by rendering an existing reactor inoperable and prohibiting the construction of other heavy-water reactors for 15 years. Tehran also pledged to never produce weapons-grade plutonium.
"This disastrous deal gave this regime -- and it's a regime of great terror -- many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash."
This is misleading.
Mr. Trump has made a version of this claim at least a dozen times since taking office, and he made it dozens of times while running for president.
The nuclear deal released about $100 billion -- not $150 billion as he frequently claims -- in previously frozen Iranian assets. In other words, the money already belonged to Iran and did not come out of the pockets of American taxpayers, as some of Mr. Trump's supporters have erroneously inferred from the president's claims.
Much of the amount is also tied up in debt obligations, and estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.
And as The Times has previously reported, the cash payment Mr. Trump also mentioned refers to a separate matter:
The Obama administration did transfer $1.7 billion to Iran, but Mr. Trump's statement requires more context. The money -- delivered in cash, some on a plane -- was payment for a decades-long dispute and was indirectly linked to the nuclear deal.
Before the 1979 revolution, Iran's shah had paid $400 million for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, they were never delivered. The clerics who seized control demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35 years. An initial reimbursement was released after the Iran deal was implemented and to help secure the release of American hostages.
"Even if Iran fully complies, the regime can still be on the verge of a nuclear breakout in just a short period of time."
This requires context.
"Breakout" refers to the time it would take Iran to produce enough fuel for one weapon, and the agreement increased that time to at least a year from an estimated two to three months.
Since the deal limits Iran's enrichment capacity and stockpile to less than one bomb's worth for 15 years, Iran would not be "on the verge of a nuclear breakout" until 2030.
It's also worth noting that the agreement prohibits Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons permanently. "Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons," the first paragraph of the deal reads.
"In the years since the deal was reached, Iran's military budget has grown by almost 40 percent."
This is exaggerated.
The Iran deal was reached in June 2015, but went into effect in early 2016, when the United States and European nations lifted sanctions. Since then, Iran's military spending has increased by about 30 percent, from $10.8 billion in 2015 to $14.1 billion last year, adjusted for inflation, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
The Congressional Research Service has estimated that Iran's defense budget was about 3 percent of the gross domestic product, or $15 billion, in 2015 and about 4 percent of G.D.P., or $20 billion, in 2018.
"Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie. Last week, Israel published intelligence documents -- long concealed by Iran -- conclusively showing the Iranian regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons."
This requires context.
Mr. Trump is referring to documents shared by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel that Mr. Netanyahu said "conclusively prove that Iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons program."
As The Times has reported, much of what Mr. Netanyahu detailed was known before the diplomatic agreement was reached:
"But the Iranian program to design and build nuclear weapons was hardly a secret; its existence was the reason that the United States, under President George W. Bush and then President Barack Obama, moved to block it. Both presidents said publicly that Iran had a bomb project underway, and the United States mounted, with Israel, a vast covert program to undermine the Iranian effort with one of the world's most sophisticated cyberattacks."
American intelligence agencies said in a 2007 report that Iran had frozen its nuclear weapons program in 2003. International inspectors had published information on the program in 2011.
Mr. Netanyahu did not provide evidence that Iran had violated the Iran deal itself.

Full text: On its face, Wisconsin's development policy looks somewhat unhinged. The $3 billion it offered to attract Foxconn's $10 billion flat-screen-television plant to Racine, near the state's southeastern tip, is an outrageous price tag.

New Jersey's offer of $5 billion to lure Amazon to Newark -- which comes out at $100,000 for each employee the online retailer would bring to town -- is also pretty extravagant. Chicago's $2 billion in incentives seems sensible only by comparison.
Giveaways like these are often a waste of public money. Research on a program of corporate tax breaks in Texas found that 85 to 90 percent of the projects benefiting from such incentives would have gone forward without them.
Even when tax breaks work and spawn new jobs, local residents gain little if anything.
Timothy J. Bartik, an economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., estimates that eight of every 10 new jobs will be filled by outsiders. While the new workers will pay taxes, most of the revenue will be spent on public services for a growing population. And the incentives themselves will blow a hole in state and local budgets, draining resources that would be better invested in, say, public education.
So why does everybody do it? State and local government spending on tax incentives like those offered by Wisconsin and New Jersey has increased sharply since 1990, to about $45 billion in 2015, by Mr. Bartik's count. It amounts to roughly all the money that state governments collect from corporate income taxes.
Is this just about opportunistic politicians dipping into state coffers so they can be photographed cutting the ribbon at a spanking new factory? I wouldn't doubt it. But I would also suggest another, more troublesome motivation: desperation. Fiscal incentives are one of few tools for cities like Racine and Newark to create jobs.
Whether Racine or Newark, Indianapolis or Detroit, Decatur, Ohio, or Bethlehem, Pa., too many of the cities that built the United States into an industrial power through the first two-thirds of the 20th century still haven't figured out how to recover from the blow that knocked them over in the third.
Racine County, once a healthy manufacturing hub churning out household cleaners, radiators for Caterpillar rigs and the like, has spent a good part of the last 35 years in a funk. Since 1970 it has lost nearly a fourth of its factory jobs, while jobs over all have grown at less than half the national pace. Household incomes in the middle of the distribution have shrunk 14 percent, adjusted for inflation.
It has plenty of company. A study by Alan Berube and Cecile Murray of the Brookings Institution that I wrote about last week looked at 185 urban counties of at least 50,000 people where manufacturing in 1970 accounted for at least one-fifth of all jobs. It found that 70 of the counties had failed to adapt to the economic transformations since then, and 62 of them were in the Northeast or the Midwest.
Others have come to similar conclusions. In a report published on Tuesday, Mr. Bartik identifies 105 large labor markets of at least 200,000 people that rely heavily on manufacturing. Only 22 of them "succeeded" -- which means that job growth has been positive since 2000 and has exceeded the national pace since 2007.
In "Coping With Adversity: Regional Economic Resilience and Public Policy," Harold Wolman, an urban expert at George Washington University, and his three co-authors observe that much of industrial America has spent a good part of the last 40 years underwater.
Of the 45 metropolitan areas in the Northeast, 27 have experienced what they call "chronic distress" since the late 1970s, with much slower job growth than in the country as a whole for an extended period. In the Midwest, 33 of 90 metropolitan areas have suffered the same fate. And fewer than half of these distressed areas have managed to snap out of their stagnation.
This is a new problem for the American economy. Through the 1970s, the income gap between rich and poor regions narrowed significantly. It was rare to find areas of persistently high unemployment. Workers moved to high-wage areas. Investment flowed to poor places where wages were lower.
In the face of persistent stagnation across a broad swath of the country, economists are reconsidering their longstanding objection to place-based policies, directed at improving the conditions of a local economy.
Lawrence H. Summers, once a top economic adviser to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and two colleagues from Harvard University note in a new paper that the "Eastern heartland" -- roughly the states east of the Mississippi that are not on the Atlantic coast -- has consistently underperformed in terms of economic growth and employment.
Job growth has lagged, as has overall economic growth. "America appears to be evolving into durable islands of wealth and poverty," the authors conclude. And that raises a sort of intractable question: What is the appropriate policy tool to bring a decaying industrial island back to life?
There are places that have somehow managed. In last week's column I mentioned St. Cloud, Minn. Grand Rapids, Mich., also inspires optimism. As its auto-parts industry was falling apart, it pivoted to biotech, raising money from local philanthropists to attract the main campus of Michigan State University's College of Human Medicine to town.
Mr. Bartik argues that government initiatives can help to clean up environmentally damaged industrial sites, improve transportation infrastructure and train workers in the skills that local employers seek. So can offering technical assistance to help small businesses develop.
"You need to invest in services that increase local businesses' productivity," he told me.
Count me with the pessimists. I agree with Mr. Bartik's ultimate proposition. But I doubt that a new airport or a few new roads or some technical assistance for small businesses can achieve the productivity jolt that the Rust Belt needs. And no amount of training will work if there are no local jobs to be had.
"A variety of things can make things somewhat better," Professor Wolman told me, but "explicit policies don't have much to do with whether you are going to be able to claw your way out of chronic distress."
The grand solution -- of course -- is investing in human capital. Study after study finds that areas with more educated work forces perform better. They earn higher wages and are more nimble in adapting to economic change.
But "invest in education" is hardly a prescription that Racine can simply pick up and run with. Indeed, solutions are easier to state than to carry out.
"Chronically distressed regions need to regenerate through diversification, entrepreneurship and innovation," Professor Wolman and his co-authors argue. "But these are more aspirations than strategies or policies."
The old expectations of the industrial heartland -- about wages and benefits, about career ladders and job stability -- are no longer valid. The region's social contract, which promised a decent job to anybody who wanted one, has been ripped up. But nothing has yet been put in its place.
As decrepit industrial enclaves wait for some new deal to replace the yanked promises of their glory days, one might forgive the billion-dollar incentives with which they try to recapture their lost prosperity. As Professor Wolman put it, incentives might be a bad idea from the standpoint of overall welfare. But "if I were a state government," he said, "I would be trying like mad to attract Amazon."

U.S. Oil Tops $70 a Barrel As Deadline Nears on Iran

Full text: A cutback in world oil output, engineered by some of the biggest producers, has more than doubled prices from their ebb two years ago. Now, a looming decision by President Trump on the Iran nuclear agreement is pushing them even higher.
Benchmark prices for American crude oil closed above $70 a barrel on Monday for the first time since 2014 as traders factored in a prospective United States withdrawal from the accord, which eased international sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program.
Investors fear that a withdrawal would lead to new sanctions on Iran, the world's fifth-largest producer of crude oil last year, further curtailing a global supply that is already relatively tight.
Mr. Trump has threatened to pull out unless Britain, France and Germany agree to make wholesale changes to the agreement. Late Monday, the president said he would announce his decision on Tuesday afternoon.
"The market is watching nervously," Ann-Louise Hittle, an oil analyst at the market research firm Wood Mackenzie, said of the deadline.
Analysts estimate that reimposing sanctions on Iran could reduce the country's daily oil sales by 300,000 to 600,000 barrels, or perhaps as much as one million barrels. But imposing new sanctions would most likely take time. And if prices stay high, Iran could increase its earnings from oil sales in the short run.
"Our base case is the rollout of sanctions will be quite slow and messy," said Ben Cahill, an analyst at the market research firm Energy Intelligence.
"In the very short term," he added, "the price run-up could benefit" Iran.
That threat of a reduction in supply coincides with production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, one of the world's largest oil producers, that have helped drain a glut that was depressing prices. Their deal was reached in 2016 and began to take effect last year.

OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has a spotty track record of carrying out production cuts, but compliance has been strong this time. "I think we are where we are because OPEC got their groove back," said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
The flow of oil to the global market has been further constricted in recent years as a result of the political and economic crisis plaguing Venezuela, another major producer of crude.
The reduced global supply -- combined with the solid global economy -- has helped push oil prices higher since they fell below $30 a barrel in early 2016. The rising tide has lifted the price of the international benchmark, Brent crude, above $75.
"It is mostly a fundamentals-driven market, but the icing on the cake is the worry about Iran," said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a consulting firm.
A boom in production in the United States has helped offset some of the tightening in supply in recent months. But higher prices elsewhere have prompted American producers to sell on the global market, driving oil exports to record highs and pulling domestic oil prices higher.
That has benefited energy companies, as well as and oil-producing states like Texas. Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell recently reported quarterly profits comparable to what they generated four years ago, when prices topped $100 a barrel.
But for large swaths of corporate America, the higher prices mean a hit to profits. Airline stocks fell by more than 1 percent Monday as investors took fuel-price pressures into account.
Likewise, consumer incomes will be pinched by elevated gasoline prices. The national average price for unleaded regular has risen above $2.80 in recent days, according to AAA, and is up roughly 20 percent over the last 12 months. That far outstrips the 2.6 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly earnings through April.
As a larger chunk of workers' paychecks goes to fuel, less disposable income is left to be spent elsewhere, a potential problem for an economy heavily reliant on consumer spending. Consumer spending slowed sharply in the first quarter, when it inched up at a 1.1 percent annual clip.
Much of that had to do with a slowdown in auto sales after a surge in car-buying late last year to replace vehicles damaged by Hurricane Harvey.
Higher fuel prices could also weigh on auto sales. Low gasoline prices have shifted car purchases heavily toward pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles, which tend to be less fuel-efficient than passenger vehicles.
Automakers have adjusted their offerings to match the market, with Ford recently announcing it was phasing out the Focus, the Fusion and other sedans from its North American business. Ford's decision suggests that some carmakers think demand for S.U.V.s and pickups -- which are far more profitable -- is unlikely to be shifted by any short-term move in gas prices.
"I think you have to get $4 to $5 per gallon before you start having a psychological impact," said Joseph Amaturo, who covers the automotive industry for Buckingham Research.
Oil companies responded to the price crash that began in 2014 by cutting exploration and other spending and negotiating sharply lower rates from drillers and other contractors, who do much of the work in the oil industry.
As a result, oil and gas projects that are going forward tend to have sharply lower costs than those begun in the $100-a-barrel era. Jessica Uhl, Shell's chief financial officer, said recently that a United States oil field in the Gulf of Mexico that Shell was developing would break even at less than $35 a barrel thanks to a 70 percent reduction in its original projected capital costs. "By applying industry-standard designs, we simplified the scope," she said.
Lower costs, combined with higher oil prices, are likely to raise profits as long as these conditions hold. Of course, cost inflation may return to the industry, and the cash rolling in may eventually loosen spending discipline, as it did a few years ago.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
TRADE
A final push begins in the talks over Nafta.
Negotiators from the United States, Canada and Mexico will gather again in Washington on Monday to begin what government officials and industry leaders hope is the final leg of negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Although the countries continue to have significant differences of opinion about the deal, the Trump administration is pushing to have talks finalized soon to meet all the necessary deadlines to submit the deal for a vote in the current Republican-controlled Congress. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative charged with negotiating the deal, said last week that he aimed to wrap up talks in the next week or two. Ana Swanson
MEDIA
Disney reports earnings, but the big issue is Fox.
Disney is expected to report strong results for its fiscal second quarter on Tuesday. ESPN is sound (for the moment). The theme park business is going up, up, up. And Walt Disney Studios, which released "Black Panther" in the quarter, is the envy of Hollywood. Analysts expect per-share profit to increase about 12 percent, and revenue to climb about 6 percent.
But Disney's near-term performance is not what Wall Street cares about most right now -- not with Comcast positioning itself to upend Disney's pending $52.4 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets. If Comcast does make a renewed push for Fox, is Disney willing to go to war? What happens if Fox slips out of Disney's grip? Does Disney have a Plan B?
Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, will probably sidestep direct questions about the Fox acquisition on Disney's earnings conference call. But some tea leaves may emerge. Brooks Barnes
TECHNOLOGY
Google conference is expected heavily emphasize artificial intelligence.
Google is holding its annual conference for developers near its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters this week. The event open on Tuesday with a keynote speech by Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, who is expected to talk about its latest efforts around artificial intelligence -- a technology that the company believes will be instrumental to its future.
The conference comes as Google faces a growing backlash against its vast data collection practices in the wake of Facebook's scandal involving Cambridge Analytica. Dai Wakabayashi
Microsoft is expected to show off new initiatives at its Build conference.
One of the other centers of gravity in the technology industry, Microsoft, will hold its own technical conference for developers, Build, in Seattle through Wednesday.
There was a time no company was better at rallying developers to write software for its underlying technologies -- the Windows operating system, in Microsoft's case. But over the past decade, a lot of developer activity has shifted to mobile technologies from Apple and Google.
Build is expected to showcase a variety of Microsoft initiatives that have helped the company maintain its influence in the tech industry, including its Azure cloud computing service and tools for adding artificial intelligence to software. Nick Wingfield
ECONOMY
Bank of England seen as unlikely to increase rates.
The Bank of England, Britain's central bank, faces a tricky balancing act when its rate-setting committee meets on Thursday. With inflation still sharply above the bank's target, traders had been betting that policymakers would raise the benchmark interest rate.
But a recent run of poor economic data -- including disappointing growth figures and worse-than-anticipated results in the manufacturing sector -- has prompted traders to revise those expectations. Mark J. Carney, the bank's governor, has also played down the possibility of a rate increase. Prashant Rao
Inflation probably rose in April.
Friday's jobs report showed that the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent for the first time since 2000. That's good news for workers, but it may add to fears that the tightening labor market will lead to faster inflation. Data that is to be released by the Labor Department on Thursday could add more fuel to the fire.
Economists expect the report to show that consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in April and were up 2.5 percent from a year earlier, which would mark the fastest growth in more than a year. That acceleration would partly reflect higher oil prices, but inflation most likely picked up even setting aside volatile food and energy prices.
The Federal Reserve has already factored somewhat faster inflation into its forecasts, but an unexpected spike could force the central bank to raise interest rates more quickly than planned. Ben Casselman

Full text: The last time the unemployment rate fell below the 4 percent threshold was in 2000, during a period of frenetic activity remembered as the dot-com boom.
Nine years into a sustained, if less feverish, economic recovery, that milestone has been achieved again.
The Labor Department said Friday that the jobless rate in April fell to 3.9 percent, raising anew the question of just how tight the labor market can get, and for how long.
In the past half-century, only the late 1960s brought an extended period when the rate stayed below 4 percent.
"We've continued to add jobs routinely every month for so long, and the unemployment rate we have reached is amazing," said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.
President Trump crowed about the landmark on Friday, tweeting, "4% is Broken!"
The steady-as-she-goes economy has produced a record 91 straight months of job growth. That may represent a healthier foundation than the dot-com era, when pride -- or, as it was branded, "irrational exuberance" -- went before a fall.
But the banner number announced Friday did not resolve any of the broader questions that economists have about this unparalleled run.
The most prominent is a mystery that has proved impervious to easy explanation: why wage increases haven't been more robust, when the market continues to edge toward full employment.
Friday's report showed that hourly earnings went up by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. The subdued wage gains eased the prospect that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its plans to raise interest rates, helping to send stocks higher. But lagging pay also reflects how the economy of 2018 is fundamentally different from earlier eras.
"A 3.9 percent rate today doesn't suggest as tight a labor market as 3.9 percent in 2000 or 3.9 percent in the late 1960s," said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley's chief United States economist.
A lot has changed since the turn of the century. The share of working-age women in the labor force began to fall in 2000, after increasing for decades. Men have been dropping out for much longer. The upshot is that a smaller share of people are participating in the labor market, and it's easier to get low levels of unemployment when fewer people are vying for jobs.
In fact, a shrinking labor force in April is part of why the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent even as payrolls grew by a fairly routine 164,000 jobs.
The population is also older than they used to be, on balance. The baby-boom generation has moved steadily toward retirement over the last two decades. And those still working have not helped push wages up. Generally, workers climb the economic ladder fastest when they are young, and so an older work force may weigh on average wages, economists say.
In 2000, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Part of the problem now is that some 60 percent of the jobs added since 2010 have been in low-wage, service-sector jobs, according to Morgan Stanley.
Fifty years ago, there were plenty of factory jobs paying a decent wage, and unions held much greater sway. Manufacturing accounted for one in four jobs; today it's not even one in 10.
The tech explosion of the late 1990s gave rise to lucrative roles in companies based on new business models. The share of the economic pie going to workers rose steadily for the first time since the 1970s -- a feat not repeated since.
"No one is creating an e-commerce group out of nothing anymore," said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. Instead, companies are bulking up their warehouses to compete with Amazon, slotting in tens of thousands of relatively low-paid pickers, packers and stockers over the past several years.
Mr. Gimbel said he had seen a particular hunger for new bodies in call centers, which offer candidates the minimum wage to deal with consumers' complaints about the gadgets they ordered online.
More recently, Mr. Trump's flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the economic picture. The White House has provided little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.
Economists say it is too soon to tell how employers may change their hiring or expansion plans in response to the tariffs on Chinese goods, or to Beijing's retaliation. But there are signs that companies that buy metals are feeling the effects already. The Institute for Supply Management said this week that manufacturing activity grew in April at its slowest pace since July.
Uncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.
"A faster pace of wage growth would be great for households, but in a way that would create even more difficulty for policymakers," Ms. Zentner said. An acceleration could force Fed officials to raise rates more aggressively, which would raise the cost of car loans and credit card debt.
However mixed the blessing, Ms. Zentner said, the ever-tightening job market could soon force faster growth in paychecks. "We are getting closer and closer to that flash point, but we don't know exactly when it is going to happen," she said.
A wave of bigger raises has already reached Chandler Steffy's roofing company in Clive, Iowa.
Three years ago, Mr. Steffy could pay laborers less than $15 an hour. No longer. In March, the latest month measured at the state level, the jobless rate in Iowa was 2.8 percent, one of the nation's lowest. Mr. Steffy now pays roofers $25 an hour, including benefits.
His rate for subcontractors has been spiking. It went up 7 percent in March, and will rise another 7 percent in May. There will be bumps in June and August, too. It's all Mr. Steffy can do to keep himself in the game.
"There's a price war going on for labor," he said. He has had crews leave job sites before finishing a roof because they got a better offer from another contractor. "The next 18 months are going to be crazy," he said.

Full text: BUENOS AIRES -- Since his 2015 election, President Mauricio Macri has pushed to reconnect Argentina to the global financial system, after years of isolation.
His approach -- emphasizing lower tariffs, accurate economic data, trade pacts and the freer flow of capital -- was largely aimed at coaxing foreign investment back to Argentina and ending the economic exile that followed the country's default in 2001.
But over the last week, Argentina has been reminded that when capital is free to flow in, it can also flow out, creating profound economic implications.
With foreign investors pulling their money en masse, Argentina's central bank was forced to take drastic action to stabilize the country's currency. On Friday, policymakers lifted the benchmark interest rate to 40 percent after days of intervening heavily in financial markets.
While it helped settle the markets, the move will weigh on the prospects for the president's ambitious economic overhaul. It also has the potential to crimp growth, adding to political discontent.
The rate increase, a day after the Argentine peso fell 8.5 percent against the dollar, was the third in a week. The central bank said it would use "all the tools at its disposal" to slow inflation, which in March was up 25 percent from a year earlier, to 15 percent this year, a goal most analysts now see as unrealistic.
In parallel, officials announced that they would cut government spending, and reduce the primary budget deficit to 2.7 percent, from the earlier goal of 3.2 percent. Their decision was seen as a response to criticism from investors that Mr. Macri's government had not been cutting spending quickly enough.
Mr. Macri was sworn into office in December 2015. Argentina had been closed to international markets for more than a decade amid a long-running legal fight with bondholders that followed a default on its debt.
Early on, Mr. Macri's policies were greeted with widespread optimism by financial markets, which gobbled up the country's newly issued bonds.
In a show of market confidence, prices for the country's government bonds rose, pushing interest rates lower. Those lower rates helped to stimulate economic growth.
"There was overconfidence on the part of policymakers about how much could be done given the constraints they had," said Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist covering Latin American bond and currency markets for the Spanish bank BBVA.
But doubts about the government's speed to pushing through the changes have emerged in recent months. In January, Argentina's central bank cut interest rates and increased its inflation target, a decision interpreted by some as weakening the government's commitment to getting consumer prices under control.
"The central bank was cutting, with inflation expectations deteriorating," said Gabriel Gersztein, head of Latin American strategy at BNP Paribas. "And this was a wake-up call for international investors."
The global economic backdrop has also been changing. With the United States economy on solid footing, its short-term interest rates have been rising. That has put upward pressure on the United States dollar, and has resulted in a slide for the peso. That decline in the peso has accelerated in recent days, as foreign investors began to see their returns vaporized by the falling currency.
People moved to the exits, in part because of a new income tax on foreign investors. As more and more investors pulled out, Argentina was suddenly facing a currency run.
Argentine officials have struggled to shore up the currency. Since March, Argentina has spent more than $7.7 billion of its international reserves, with the pace speeding up late last week.
Governments have a few tools they can use to stem the outflow of capital. One of them is to sharply raise interest rates. Those higher rates translate into potentially stronger returns for investors. As such, they can attract money into an economy, which helps prop up a currency.
But it's a tricky play to pull off.
Brazil raised interest rates sharply to stop an outflow of capital in the late 1990s, ultimately pushing benchmark interest rates to roughly 40 percent. More recently, in 2014, Turkey suddenly ratcheted up a key central bank rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent in order to stop a sell-off in the lira.
That same year, the central bank of Russia pushed interest rates sharply higher -- to 17 percent from 10.5 percent -- to keep the ruble from collapsing in response to sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and a sharp drop in oil prices. Russia also has one of the biggest interest-rate jumps on record, when in 1998 its rates reached 150 percent in an effort to stem another impending collapse of the ruble.
But high interest rates have economic costs. They make it particularly difficult for businesses and consumer to borrow money. The lack of spending, in turn, can slow growth and ultimately spark a recession.
The key for Argentina will be to keep rates high just long enough to inspire confidence that policymakers have halted the currency run, but not so long that the increase drains the economy.
"This was done in order to stop the bleeding," Mr. Gersztein of BNP Paribas said. "It's like you have someone in the E.R. You need to take very short-term, bold decisions.
"Then once you stabilize the patient," he added, "you need to take different decisions in order to make the patient get better and recover."
Politically, it all puts Mr. Macri in a more precarious position.
In recent months, his popularity has declined. In an April poll of Argentines by Synopsis, a local consultancy, 43 percent said they had a negative view of the government, compared with 34 percent with a positive view. That was a sharp shift from November, when nearly 52 percent said they had a positive image of the government and Mr. Macri's allies did better than expected in midterm elections.
The president is now balancing the concerns of a restive population and the needs of international investors -- and they don't necessarily want the same thing.
International investors want assurance that Mr. Macri will continue to cut spending and stick with other parts of his plan. But those same efforts are frustrating certain constituencies at home.
Unions are worried that workers are losing purchasing power amid high inflation and a broad increase in public utility rates, part of the government's efforts to decrease spending by slashing subsidies. Hundreds gathered on Friday in downtown Buenos Aires outside the National Electricity Regulator for a union protest against recent increases in utility prices. Last month, thousands took to the streets to protest the hikes.
The higher utility costs are hitting the manufacturing sector hard, particularly companies that compete against imported goods.
Ancers, a tableware manufacturer in Buenos Aires, has seen its gas bill soar by 48 percent while electricity costs have doubled since the beginning of last year. During that time, the number of employees has declined by 25 percent, said Angel Vazquez, the company's founder and president.
"We may very well have to close soon," Mr. Vazquez said. "I don't know if we can hold out for another year."
What happens next with the economy may translate into whether Mr. Macri's coalition will win the presidential election next year or whether discontent will give rise to an interventionist government that will undo many of his changes. Although the economy as a whole is growing -- expanding 5.1 percent in February, on the year -- the latest measures are prompting some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.
"The government so far has not been able to show big victories, and it's obvious that if it is going to take unpopular measures, its popularity will suffer," said Fausto Spotorno, the chief economist at Orlando Ferreres & Asociados, a local consultancy. "But it has rushed many of the measures so that it can avoid bad news next year."

Full text: A late slump left U.S. stocks mostly lower on Wednesday as investors appeared to grow more concerned about the possibility of rising interest rates. Apple climbed after a solid quarterly report and a forecast for strong iPhone sales.
Brewer Molson Coors suffered its biggest one-day loss in 13 years after it said the U.S. beer industry got off to a slow start in 2018. Weak results from drugmaker Gilead Sciences and animal health company Zoetis weighed on health care companies. Smaller companies fared better. Apple did a bit better than Wall Street expected in its latest quarter and forecast better sales than investors feared. The tech giant also said it will spend some of its tax savings on a $100 billion stock repurchase.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, as investors and analysts expected, and said it expects to keep raising interest rates gradually. The central bank said inflation has approached its 2 percent target, but it didn't suggest it is overly concerned that inflation will strengthen more than that. Major indexes sold off in the last hour of trading. Steve Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments, said investors believe the Fed doesn't expect to do much to prop up the economy.
"The Fed views the economy as having improved and inflation has returned to normal," he said. "That environment, in the Fed's opinion, no longer justifies overly accommodative monetary policy."
One of the key debates on Wall Street is whether the Fed will raise rates three times as planned, or if it will raise them four times in response to more signs of inflation and faster economic growth. That question wasn't answered Wednesday and Wood said he thinks a fourth increase is possible.
The S&P 500 index fell 19.13 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,635.67. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 174.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 23,924.98. The Nasdaq composite slid 29.81 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,100.90.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 4.58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,554.92 as smaller technology companies and retailers advanced.
After months of concerns on Wall Street about weak iPhone sales, Apple had a slightly better fiscal second quarter than expected and investors were pleased with its projections for the current quarter as well. It's also giving its shareholders a lot of cash. Apple bought back almost $23 billion in stock in the first three months of the year and will spend another $100 billion on stock repurchases. It's also raising its dividend.
The Republican-backed tax package temporarily lowered the taxes that companies pay when they bring cash stashed overseas back to the U.S., which encouraged companies like Apple to bring that cash back to the U.S. Apple stock climbed 4.4 percent to $176.57.
The bond market had little reaction to the Fed's statement and bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.97 percent. The dollar weakened and fell to 109.73 yen from 109.81 yen. The euro fell to $1.1988 from $1.1993.
Molson Coors Brewing said cold weather may have prompted consumers to cut back on their drinking. The company's results fell short of analyst projections and it also said sales to wholesalers declined. Its stock shed 15.4 percent to $60.64. Coca-Cola and Pepsi continued to fall, with Coke down 1.2 percent to $42.06 and Pepsi sliding 1.9 percent to $97.23.
Xerox's CEO and most of its board will resign as investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason push the company to stop its sale to longtime partner Fujifilm. The duo called for Jacobson to resign in late January, shortly before Xerox announced a deal that will result in Fujifilm taking majority control of Xerox. Jacobson and five other directors are being replaced. Xerox said the new board will reconsider the deal with Fujifilm and could terminate or restructure Xerox's relationship with the company.
Xerox shares fell 9 percent to $29.38.
Snap skidded 21.9 percent to $11.03 after its first-quarter revenue fell far short of estimates. The company said its redesign, which some users have slammed, was one of the reasons for the slip.
After posting its highest growth in a decade during 2017, economic growth in the 19-country eurozone slowed a bit in the first quarter, largely because of temporary factors such as cold weather. Despite the slowdown, growth was higher than the equivalent in the U.S.
The DAX in Germany soared 1.5 percent and the French CAC 40 picked up 0.2 percent. In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.3 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude jumped 1 percent to $67.93 a barrel in New York, while Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.3 percent to $73.36 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline lost 0.4 percent to $2.08 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 percent to $2.12 a gallon. Natural gas fell 1.7 percent to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell 0.1 percent to $1,305.70 an ounce. Silver jumped 1.5 percent to $16.38 an ounce. Copper added 1 percent to $3.07 a pound.
Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2 percent and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong lost 0.3 percent. South Korea's Kospi gave up 0.4 percent.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and acknowledged rising inflation, but it gave little indication that officials are worried about a sudden, rapid escalation in prices or an abrupt slowdown in economic growth that could alter its gradual pace of rate increases.
The Federal Open Market Committee's unanimous decision not to raise rates so quickly after a March increase had been widely expected. The official statement from the committee gave no indication that Fed officials plan to raise rates faster than previously telegraphed.
Officials made only a few changes to the language they had used after their March meeting to describe inflation and growth. Most notably, they acknowledged that "on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent," which is the central bank's stated target for inflation.
The Fed is midway through what is meant to be a long and gradual push toward historically normal rates. It raised its benchmark interest rate in March to a range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Economic projections released at that meeting indicated that officials were split on whether they expected to raise rates a total of three or four times this year, with a narrow majority leaning toward three over all.
Economists overwhelmingly predict that the Fed will next raise rates in June, but after that, the consensus begins to break down. Some analysts say to expect four total rate increases this year given the strength of the economy, including a historically low unemployment rate.
Inflation has finally reached the Fed's target
Data released on Monday showed that wages and prices are now growing at 2 percent a year, according to the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the rate is 1.9 percent. Those levels indicate inflation is finally reaching the 2 percent target after six years of failing to meet that goal.
Officials acknowledged that increase on Wednesday, but the statement suggested that the Fed was not overwhelmingly concerned. The statement noted that annual inflation "is expected to run near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term." The inclusion of "symmetric" is a sign that the Fed could tolerate inflation running slightly above 2 percent for a period of time.
The language is a change from the March meeting statement, which said that inflation and core inflation rates "have continued to run below 2 percent" and that annual inflation is "expected to move up in coming months" and stabilize around 2 percent.
The statement on Wednesday also eliminated a line from the March statement that said "the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely."
"The Fed is telling markets that it won't overreact to a run of higher numbers" in inflation readings, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note after the meeting, "just as it didn't overreact to the run of five straight downside surprises last year."
Several Fed officials have raised concerns in recent weeks about the economy's "overheating" and publicly pondered whether the Fed may need to pour on some cold water with higher interest rates. The concern is that if the Fed does not raise interest rates quickly enough, wages and prices could begin to spiral up, forcing a sharp rate increase that could push the economy into recession.
If such a situation arises, "it's very hard to navigate that without having an economic downturn," Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in an interview last month. "My concern is that's much worse than just having slightly slower growth" from a slightly faster pace of rate increases.
No sign of concerns over economic growth
The chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, and other officials are broadly optimistic about the strength of the economy but have noted some risks on the horizon for growth -- most notably a potential drag from a trade dispute with other nations, like China. Some economists have also raised early concerns about slowing growth in Europe, which could affect the United States, and about other market metrics that could portend a slowdown, such as the rise in Treasury bond yields.
There were few hints of those concerns in this meeting's statement.
The statement declared that "business fixed investment continued to grow strongly" since the last Fed meeting, which was more bullish language than the March statement. It noted, as it did in March, that household spending growth had moderated since the end of last year. It eliminated a line from the March statement that declared "the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months," but did not add any new language about risks to growth.
Officials said that "risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced," a slight change from March, when they declared that "near-term risks" appeared roughly balanced.
Analysts read that as an endorsement of the economy's staying power. "By not referring to the slower G.D.P. growth in the first quarter or potential risks from trade policy, the committee is emphasizing that there are more signs of strength than weakness in the economy," Ben Ayers, senior economist at the insurance firm Nationwide, wrote after the meeting.
A 'stay the course' statement
The language in the statement, and the decision on rates, validated Fed watchers who had predicted few changes this month. In part, that's because there haven't been significant surprises in economic data since the last meeting.
"The F.O.M.C. notes boil down to 'steady as she goes,"' said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. "So, without the Fed trying to slow down the economy to head off a hot economy or rising inflation, we can expect the unemployment rate to continue dropping, and just as importantly, wages will be free to rise."

Full text: St. Cloud, Minn., might look at first blush like one of America's all-too-familiar ailing industrial cities, struggling to hang on to jobs as its companies skip town.
Electrolux's planned closing of its chest-freezer plant next year to consolidate its operations in South Carolina was the latest blow, costing some 900 jobs. As Tama Theis, local Republican state legislator, told The Saint Cloud Times, "Gosh dang it, that's a hard one."
And yet despite the loss of its fifth-largest employer, the sleepy city straddling the Mississippi 65 miles northwest of Minneapolis doesn't at all fit the tale of woe that spread across the Midwest over the last 50 years.
If anything, St. Cloud and nearby communities in Stearns County provide the setting for a counternarrative to the story of industrial America's protracted decline. Walloped by the forces that hit every old manufacturing enclave -- from globalization and automation to a rising demand for skills -- the area sustained its prosperity through a mix of the right investments, favorable geography and sheer serendipity.
Since 1970, manufacturers in the county have added 5,000 jobs, for a total of 11,600. Total employment has tripled, to 90,000. The population has grown by more than half. And the median income of the county's households rose 20 percent from 1980 to 2016, after inflation, to $57,728 -- a smidgen above the national median.
"When Electrolux announced it was leaving, other employers were saying, 'When can we get at that labor?"' said King Banaian, dean of the School of Public Affairs at St. Cloud State University. "There's a tug of war going on, and workers are getting higher wages and performance incentives and bonuses and so on."
The problem is that there are too few places like St. Cloud: Grand Rapids in Michigan's Kent County, where employment more than doubled since 1970; Green Bay in Brown County, Wis., where it almost tripled.
Formerly vibrant industrial cities across the Midwest and Northeast today present a landscape of high unemployment and opioid addiction -- stagnant communities of old-timers in the shadow of rusting industrial hulks, angry at a political system that has ignored them and at an economy that has left them behind.
Can they learn anything from places like Stearns County? Its experience may offer some tips for its struggling peers: Smart industrial zoning can give an edge to local companies; higher-education institutions can serve as anchors for economic development. But its most salient advantages come from its location and industrial mix, more to do with serendipity than policy. A lot of it, Mr. Banaian told me, may have been "plain darn good luck."
In a recent report, Alan Berube and Cecile Murray of the Brookings Institution counted the cases of success and failure: In 1970, there were 185 urban industrial counties with a city of at least 50,000 people where manufacturing made up at least a fifth of all jobs.
Using the mix of industries in each county, they projected how many jobs it would have today if employment in each industry had grown at the same pace as in the nation as a whole. Seventy of the original 185 had significantly fewer jobs in 2016 than they would have had if they had followed the national trend. The other 115 almost matched or outpaced the national trend.
This is an imperfect measure of success. In many successful counties that experienced employment growth, workers nonetheless suffered lower wages and declining living standards. Still, on the whole these places did much better in terms of productivity and household income growth, too.
Unfortunately for the laggards, their edge may be difficult to replicate.
The picture in the South and the West is brighter. Fifty-five of the 63 urban industrial counties that Mr. Berube and Ms. Murray counted in the South in 1970, as well as all 24 of those in the West, saw jobs growth that was at least about on par with the national trend over the next 46 years. But their experience is of limited use to the North and the East. In 1970, these counties were smaller and younger. They were building an industrial base as the nation's economic footprint was shifting from manufacturing to service, embracing technology and globalization.
Desegregation in the South and immigration in the West added a pool of productive workers, while investment flowed in to take advantage of their cheaper labor force and the virtual absence of unions. "Jobs were leaving Michigan, Indiana and Ohio and going to Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee," Mr. Berube observed. In the more successful industrial counties, construction employment doubled, on average, from 1970 to 2016, as they absorbed new populations.
The old industrial cities that developed around the Great Lakes in the first half of the 20th century have a different story. Population shrank on average. Construction employment did not grow. Only six of the 35 urban industrial counties scattered across the Northeast in 1970 held their own or gained employment compared with the national trend over the next 46 years. Of 63 urban industrial cities in the Midwest in 1970, only 30 managed the feat.
Macon County, Ill. -- home of Decatur, "the pride of the prairie"-- was an agribusiness hub and steel town that also housed mammoth production facilities for the likes of Caterpillar and Firestone Tire and Rubber. But it lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs from 1970 to 2016. Total jobs grew by less than half a percent over 46 years.
Employment in Racine, Wis., increased by 40 percent in that period. But had job growth followed national patterns it would have grown at twice that pace. Median household incomes fell a whopping 14 percent.
These older industrial cities that had helped build the American middle class were by 1970 riven by conflicts between management and labor, between cities and suburbs, and between blacks and whites. "The tension from segregation in the Midwest and North was a bigger deal," Mr. Berube told me.
On top of all that, their old, heavy industries were particularly vulnerable. For instance, 17 of the 22 counties in the Northeast and Midwest where steel accounted for a disproportionate share of jobs in 1970 stumbled on their way to the present.
Can Decatur or Racine learn from Green Bay, Grand Rapids or St. Cloud? Perhaps the best example to follow would be to invest in education. Places with better-educated workers were generally the ones that managed the economic transformation of the last 50 years more successfully. In 1980, 18.5 percent of adults over 25 in these counties had at least a bachelor's degree, compared with only 15.1 percent in the counties that stumbled. For Midwestern states like Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri, which are starving many of their public universities of funds, the takeaway would be: Stop.
Mr. Berube and Ms. Murray's analysis, like other research before it, also suggests that policies that reduce racial or economic segregation might add to economic growth. Smart industrial development policies can help, too.
Mr. Banaian noted how St. Cloud was smart to develop industrial parks along the transportation arteries connecting it to the rest of the country. Raw money may help, too. Electrolux is decamping to South Carolina from St. Cloud thanks, in part, to a tax incentive worth $73 million over 32 years, according to a state estimate cited by the company. Research by Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, and Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago suggests that for all policymakers' gripes about government subsidies to corporate investment, they can yield a high return to the local economy.
In the end, a lot comes down to luck. St. Cloud isn't just on the Mississippi. It is on Interstate 94, U.S. 10 and the BNSF Railway -- putting it within reach of many markets. What's more, it produces things like trailers, buses and snowmobile engines, which for some reason are not China's or Mexico's forte. Its service industries -- a growing part of its economic base -- thrive off the underserved rural towns in the western half of the state. Its medical center alone employs 10,000 people.
If the successful industrial counties of the Midwest have a lesson for their less successful peers, it must be that they can't stop evolving. "It is hard for communities to become something else," Mr. Berube said. That is precisely what declining industrial cities are being repeatedly called to do. And there is nothing to say that communities that successfully transformed themselves over the past 50 years will succeed again.
Right now, St. Cloud's main problem may be a labor shortage. But already Mr. Banaian is worried about the internet. St. Cloud has a large retail and hospitality industry. People in the western part of the state will come into town to shop and eat and perhaps stay for the weekend. The internet, however, is putting many retailers out of business. "That part is going away," Mr. Banaian said.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
CABLE TELEVISION
Closing arguments coming in AT&T-Time Warner merger case.
Arguments in the trial over AT&T's proposed merger with Time Warner will end on Monday. The Justice Department will sum up its position that the deal should be blocked by the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia because it believes the merger will harm consumers and competition. AT&T and Time Warner will defend the $85.4 billion agreement and say it would not harm consumers but create a stronger competitor to new entertainment rivals from Silicon Valley. The federal judge hearing the case is expected to take at least a month to reach a decision. Cecilia Kang
TRADE
A tariff deadline looms for six United States allies.
A crucial deadline will pass on Tuesday for six American allies who were temporarily exempted from President Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. The European Union, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Australia have been negotiating furiously to extend their reprieve from the tariffs, but it remains unclear whether the Trump administration will grant the countries further exemptions from tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. If the tariffs do go into effect, the European Union and other allies will most likely respond with tariffs of their own and challenges at the World Trade Organization. Ana Swanson
TECHNOLOGY
Apple will report its earnings.
Apple is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Tuesday. While all indications suggest its huge business continues to hum along, investors will be watching for the answers to two major questions. How much, if any, growth is left in iPhone sales? And now that Apple has repatriated most of the $252 billion it held abroad to comply with the new tax law, how much will it return to shareholders? Some analysts predict the company could send as much as $180 billion to investors through stock buybacks and dividend increases over the next two and a half years, on top of the $300 billion it has already authorized. Jack Nicas
ECONOMY
Estimate of eurozone economic growth expected.
The uncertain state of the eurozone economy may become clearer on Wednesday when the European Union statistics office releases an estimate of its economic growth in the first quarter. Recent indicators suggest that the economy, which had been exceptionally strong, is slowing. But most analysts expect growth from January through March to have remained solid, just not quite as vibrant as before. Jack Ewing
The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged.
The Federal Reserve will conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, probably by leaving interest rates unchanged. But analysts will watch the official statement after the meeting for signs of rising concern about inflation, and hints that the Fed might accelerate its pace of rate increases later this year. Jim Tankersley
U.S. Treasury to provide details on borrowing plans.
An announcement on quarterly borrowing that is expected on Wednesday will provide details on how the Treasury plans to finance increased deficits. The Federal government is expected to boost the amount it intends to borrow in the coming months, as the Treasury contends with declining tax receipts as a result of the recent corporate and personal tax cuts, as well as widening budget deficits and a Federal Reserve that is slowly reducing its own holdings of government bonds. When the Treasury increased borrowing in short-term Treasuries earlier this year, short-term interest rates rose significantly. Matt Phillips
AUTO INDUSTRY
Tesla will report earnings, and Model 3 production.
Tesla reports its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday and all eyes will again be on the production line rather than the bottom line. The electric-car maker is expected to post another loss, but key to its future is whether it can ramp up production of the Model 3, a battery-powered compact car that Telsa is counting on to fuel a dramatic rise in revenue. Tesla was able to produce 2,000 of the cars in the final week of the quarter, but will give an update on where it is now. Its chief executive, Elon Musk, has said he's hoping to increase output to close to 6,000 a week, although analysts are skeptical given the bottlenecks the company has run into. Neal E. Boudette
Criticism expected at Volkswagen shareholder meeting.
Volkswagen will hold its annual shareholders' meeting in Berlin on Thursday, and it is expected to face sharp criticism from investors angry that the company is still experiencing the repercussions of a diesel emissions scandal that erupted in 2015. Police raids on offices of Volkswagen's Porsche division in April targeted high-ranking managers, highlighting what critics say is the company's failure to adequately clean house. The shareholders' meeting will be the first for Herbert Diess, the former BMW executive who replaced Matthias MÃ¼ller as chief executive in early April. Jack Ewing
TRADE
Trump officials will travel to China to discuss trade.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will lead a delegation of top economic advisers to Beijing late in the week to begin negotiations between two nations that appear to be on the brink of a trade war. Mr. Mnuchin will be joined on the trip by Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, and potentially other Trump advisers as well. The prospect of a damaging economic confrontation between the world's two largest economies has loomed in recent weeks, as the Trump administration threatened China with steep tariffs and China promised to retaliate with similar trade measures. Ana Swanson
ECONOMY
An uptick is expected for April employment figures.
The Labor Department will publish hiring numbers for April on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Economists expect that employers added 195,000 jobs, according to Bloomberg. That figure would represent an uptick from the gain in March, which was muted partly because of bad weather on the East Coast. April's numbers may offer some insight into manufacturers' reaction to the escalating trade spat between the United States and China. Some forecasters expect to see weaker hiring numbers in the sector, as companies factor in the uncertainty around the cost of raw materials. Natalie Kitroeff
INVESTING
Berkshire Hathaway will hold its annual meeting in Omaha.
Tens of thousands of investors will descend on Omaha on Saturday for the annual meeting of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, an event known as the "Woodstock of Capitalism." Between bites of See's candies and sips of Cherry Cokes, Mr. Buffett and Charles T. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, will spend roughly six hours answering questions from investors. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger will probably face questions about succession, after Mr. Buffett promoted Ajit Jain and Greg Abel to vice chairmen earlier this year. Other topics likely to come up include Berkshire's decision to team up with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase to form a new company to lower health care costs; Berkshire's growing pile of cash and the environment for deal making; and the tax cuts passed late last year, which provided Berkshire with a hefty windfall.

Venezuela's Turmoil Is Testing Brazil's Limits

Full text: PACARAIMA, Brazil -- Hundreds turn up each day, many arriving penniless and gaunt as they pass a tattered flag that signals they have reached the border.
Once they cross, many cram into public parks and plazas teeming with makeshift homeless shelters, raising concerns about drugs and crime. The lucky ones sleep in tents and line up for meals provided by soldiers -- pregnant women, the disabled and families with young children are often given priority. The less fortunate huddle under tarps that crumple during rainstorms.
The scenes are reminiscent of the waves of desperate migrants who have escaped the wars in Syria and Afghanistan, spurring a backlash in Europe. Yet this is happening in Brazil, where a relentless tide of people fleeing the deepening economic crisis in Venezuela has begun to test the region's tolerance for immigrants.
This month, the governor of the northern Brazilian state of Roraima sued the federal government, demanding that it close the border with Venezuela and provide additional money for her overburdened education and health systems.
"We're very fearful this may lead to an economic and social destabilization in our state," said the governor, Suely Campos. "I'm looking after the needs of Venezuelans to the detriment of Brazilians."
The tens of thousands of Venezuelans who have found refuge in Brazil in recent years are walking proof of a worsening humanitarian crisis that their government claims does not exist.
They also constitute an exodus that is straining the region's largely generous and permissive immigration policies. Earlier this month, Trinidad deported more than 80 Venezuelan asylum seekers. In Colombian and Brazilian border communities, local residents have attacked Venezuelans in camps.
During the early months of this year, 5,000 Venezuelans were leaving their homeland each day, according to the United Nations. At that rate, more Venezuelans are leaving home each month than the 125,000 Cuban exiles who fled their homes during the 1980 Mariel boat crisis and transformed South Florida.
If the current rate remains steady, more than 1.8 million Venezuelans could leave by the end of this year, joining the estimated 1.5 million who have fled the economic crisis to rebuild their lives abroad.
As Venezuelans began resettling across Latin America in large numbers in 2015, for the most part they found open borders and paths to legal residency in neighboring countries.
But as their numbers have swelled -- and as a larger share of recent migrants arrive without savings and in need of medical care -- some officials in the region have begun to question the wisdom of open borders.
Ms. Campos said she took the "extreme measure" of suing the federal government because the influx of Venezuelans led to a spike in crime, drove down wages for menial jobs and set off an outbreak of measles, which had been eradicated in Brazil.
At least 93 people were killed during the first four months of this year, already exceeding the 83 violent deaths recorded last year, Ms. Campos said. And law enforcement officials say drug trafficking in the region has increased as destitute Venezuelans have been drafted into Brazilian smuggling networks.
The population of Boa Vista, the state capital, ballooned over the past few years as some 50,000 Venezuelans resettled here. They now make up roughly 10 percent of the population. At first, residents responded with generosity, establishing soup kitchens and organizing clothes drives.
By last year however, local residents in Pacaraima, the border town, and Boa Vista, the state capital, which is 130 miles from the border, felt overwhelmed.
"Boa Vista was transformed," said Mayor Teresa Surita. "This has started generating tremendous instability."
On a recent morning, squatters who took over the SimÃ³n Bolivar plaza, one of the city's largest, were preparing meals on small wood burning stoves. Some napped in hammocks while others stared blankly, having nowhere to go and nothing to do.
The mood was grim. A stomach bug had spread through the camp, leading to bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. Adding to their discomfort, neighboring residents, in an act of defiance, had burned a row of bushes near the plaza that the Venezuelans had been using to defecate.
As she watched smoke billowing across the campsite, Ana GarcÃ­a, 56, said she could scarcely believe her new reality in Brazil.
She was a homeowner who ate well and lived comfortably on a social worker's salary in the Venezuelan city of MaturÃ­n. But as her paycheck became worthless last year because of soaring inflation, she quit her job of more than a decade, hoping to get a payout large enough to go abroad.
Instead, she walked away with an amount that was so little it only enabled her to buy a small bag of rice, half a chicken and a banana. As food became increasingly scarce, Ms. GarcÃ­a set out on a nearly 600-mile journey with her 18-year-old daughter, hitchhiking most of the way.
The first night she slept in the plaza, Ms. GarcÃ­a said, she broke down in tears before crawling under a black tarp she now shares with her daughter.
"I never thought we could find ourselves in this situation. We're not used to living like indigents," Ms. GarcÃ­a said, her eyes welling. "But Venezuela is destroyed. People are dying of hunger."
As public spaces became increasingly clogged with Venezuelans, the federal government in February took the unprecedented step of tasking the military with assuming control of the response to the refugee crisis.
"There is no historical parallel for this," Col. Evandro Kupchinski, the spokesman of the task force, said as military personnel cleaned up a stadium that had been taken over by Venezuelans, preparing to turn it into an official shelter. "We're coming up with solutions as we go."
Since February, in collaboration with the United Nations, the Brazilian Army has been building temporary shelters with spacious white tents across the city. By the end of May, it hopes to have 11 shelters with a capacity for some 5,500 people.
Venezuelans who have been vaccinated and registered at one of the shelters may apply to be resettled in larger cities in Brazil via a military flight. But that process is off to a slow start because of funding constraints.
The United Nations recently asked international donors to pitch in $46 million to address the crisis during the remainder of this year, but so far it has only secured 6 percent of that goal.
On a recent morning, Mercedes AcuÃ±a, 50, said she felt blessed to have been among the first admitted into a shelter. She arrived in Brazil two months ago, rail thin, after an anguishing period during which she joined an ever-growing mob in the capital, Caracas, picking apart piles of garbage for bits and pieces of discarded food.
Ms. AcuÃ±a said she had nothing but gratitude for the Brazilians who have helped her, but she has come to agree with those who say it's time to shut the border.
"I realize we're all in need," she said. "But their country is being invaded."
At the General Hospital of Roraima, the director, Samir Xuad, says the daily patient population has surged from 400 per day to 1,000 over the past couple of years.
That requires working his employees so hard that some of them end up getting sick, too, said Mr. Xuad, adding that he had lost more than 20 pounds from the stress. Medical supplies as basic as syringes and gloves have run out, he said, and during particularly busy periods, patient gurneys line up in hallways.
"We try to make magic," he said. "But it's difficult."
Outside of work, he said, residents of Boa Vista have become fearful of crime and wary of the mobs of aggressive window washers who approach drivers at stop lights.
"Roraima was a place where you could sleep with your door open at night," he said. "That is no longer the case."
Throngs of Venezuelan prostitutes now work the streets of a residential area that has become an ever-expanding red light district.
On a recent evening shortly after sundown, three young women stood on a dark street corner, eyeing passing cars and motorcycles.
Among them was Camilla SuÃ¡rez, 23, who worked at a waxing salon in Caracas until a few months ago. As food grew scarce, Ms. SuÃ¡rez, who has a toddler, figured that she stood a better chance of providing for her child and her parents by working in Brazil.
"I knew Brazilian women liked getting waxed," she said.
But as she walked around Boa Vista during her first few days looking for work, doors slammed in her face everywhere she went, she said.
Soon, sex work became a last resort to stay afloat financially and manage, every once in a while, to send some money home.
"There are lawyers, nurses here among us," Ms. SuÃ¡rez said.
To steel themselves, she and her roommates have a ritual to endure the work they find soul-crushing.
"We band together to get into a strong mind frame," she said, "so we don't break down in tears."
On a good day, they return to the rented room they share with the equivalent of $90 each. That covers rent and food for a week, plus about $30 to send home.
"With that, my family can eat well for three whole days," she said proudly. "And I mean well. Breakfast, lunch and dinner."

Full text: U.S. stocks finished with a split decision on Friday after a wobbly day of trading. Amazon led a rally among retailers, but Exxon Mobil dragged energy companies lower to end an uneven week on Wall Street.
So far the first-quarter earnings season has been a strong one for American companies, but it hasn't thrilled investors. On Friday Amazon, Microsoft and Expedia all climbed after reporting earnings, but Exxon, Charter Communications and Starbucks all slumped. According to FactSet, about 80 percent of the companies on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index that have reported their results have announced a larger per-share profit than analysts expected.
High-dividend companies like utilities rose as bond yields slipped, but defense contractors fell. Asian stocks rose after the summit meeting of the leaders from North and South Korea.
This week investors worried that rising raw materials costs, as well as higher interest rates and wages, could eat into corporate profits. But they were pleased with strong results from Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and others. The S.&P. 500 finished the week almost exactly where it started.
Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist for Voya Investment Strategies, said investors haven't regained their confidence since the market plunge in February. But in her view, the economy continues to do well, and there are few signs that inflation or wages are about to rocket higher, an outcome that could dent corporate profits.
"There's reason to think things are very, very good, but not overheating. That's a great environment for earnings," she said. "The market is getting a little bit spoiled."
The S.&P. 500 gained 2.97 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,669.91. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 11.15 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 24,311.19. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.12 points to 7,119.80. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 1.66 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,556.24. Most of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange finished higher.
Amazon said its first-quarter profit more than doubled as consumers shopped more online and revenue from its cloud computing business continued to rise. The results were far stronger than Wall Street expected, and the stock jumped 3.6 percent to $1,572.62, adding to Thursday's 4 percent gain.
The United States economy grew 2.3 percent in the first quarter, better than experts had forecast. While consumer spending turned in the weakest performance in nearly five years, experts think it will pick up later in the year thanks to continued low unemployment and Republican-backed tax cuts.
Bond prices rose again. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.96 percent from 2.98 percent Thursday.
Even with help from climbing oil prices, Exxon Mobil's results still fell short of estimates, and its stock dropped 3.8 percent to $77.79. The cable company Charter Communications tumbled 11.7 percent to $263.33.
The pound fell sharply, to $1.3785 from $1.3924. The dollar slipped to 109.02 yen from 109.36 yen. The euro rose to $1.2121 from $1.2106.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 0.1 percent to $68.10 a barrel in New York.
Gold rose 0.4 percent to $1,323.40 an ounce.

Slowed Growth In the Economy May Be a Blip

Full text: The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the first quarter, the government reported Friday, offering a preliminary glance at how last year's sweeping package of tax cuts is affecting consumers and businesses this year.
During the first three months of 2018, the economy was whacked around like a pinball. The stock market took investors on a giddy up-and-down ride. President Trump imposed tariffs on allies and rivals alike, stoking fears of a trade war. And the revamped tax code shifted business incentives and started to put more money in workers' paychecks.
Still, the economy ended up puttering along just a bit above the average yearly growth rate that it had registered since the recession ended nearly nine years ago.
While the pace is equal to the performance for all of last year, it is below the 2.9 percent annualized rate recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, and short of Mr. Trump's goal of at least 3 percent. Most forecasters, however, expect quarterly growth to float around the 3 percent mark for the rest of the year.
"This is not too bad," said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist of Northern Trust in Chicago. "The 2.3 percent figure is moderately encouraging." Economists had expected economic growth to ease in the quarter.
"The rest of 2018 seems well assured given the substantial support that is going to come from government fiscal policy," Mr. Tannenbaum said, referring to the $1.5 trillion cost of the tax cuts.
He noted, however, that "longer term, the immediate benefits of tax reform will fade, and what we'll be left with is the bill."
Economists on Wall Street and in Washington have repeatedly warned that the economy's upward streak is unlikely to extend beyond the next year or two. The nation's debt has topped $21 trillion and is growing, a level many view as unsustainable. And if the Federal Reserve follows through on its plan to raise interest rates, the cost of paying off that debt will grow larger.
In the longer run, the Fed expects real annual growth in the United States to fall to 1.8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office's 10-year outlook comes to the same disappointing conclusion.
The Winter's Tale
Expectations about the first-quarter figure had fluctuated as pieces of the puzzle emerged. Imports fell and exports rose more than expected, narrowing the merchandise trade deficit for the first time in six months. Orders of durable goods remained sluggish, but revived somewhat as commercial aircraft orders surged in March. And although consumers continued to express a lot of confidence, they pulled back on their spending.
Holiday shopping in the final quarter of 2017 had revved up consumer spending -- which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity -- to 4 percent. Businesses responded by replenishing depleted inventories. But the shopping surge receded when the new year started; consumer spending grew only 1.1 percent in the first quarter.
Although the tax overhaul promised to increase take-home pay, its effects may have been blunted for several reasons, including the time it took for the Internal Revenue Service to produce updated withholding tables and for payroll managers to adjust their systems. A poll of registered voters done in April and released this week by Politico/Morning Consult found that only about a fifth of those surveyed were noticing more money in their paychecks.
"I think the fact that we didn't see a big spurt in spending after the tax cut suggests it's either too early in the game or consumers are going to continue to be a bit cautious," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief United States financial economist at Oxford Economics. Nonetheless, she added, "I think there is a legitimate question as to how much of the tax cuts get saved to pull down debt, and how much actually gets spent."
As for business spending, many of the tax incentives were aimed not at immediate investment decisions, but at those in the medium term. "It does take time for that to filter through," Ms. Bostjancic said. Some businesses may have also sped up their timetables for purchases at the end of 2017 in order to take advantage of bigger deductions before the tax changes went into effect.
For several years, first-quarter growth rates have been weaker than the longer-term trends indicated, only to rebound in later months. This year, the result could reflect a falloff in spending after an unusual surge that followed the havoc wrought by late-summer hurricanes. Severe winter weather could have also slowed consumption. But some analysts wonder if data adjustments are part of the problem.
Government economists try to account for seasonal changes, but the corrective measures may be only partially successful. "There's a little weakness in Q1 and then the other quarters are artificially inflated because of that," Ms. Bostjancic said.
Looking Ahead
In any case, the gross domestic product estimate released Friday by the Commerce Department is not the final word on the first quarter. The estimate will be revised twice in the next couple of months. In the past, the final number has been higher or lower by as much as a percentage point.
This G.D.P. report, though, is the latest that the Federal Reserve will have when its policymakers meet next week. At last month's meeting, Fed officials raised interest rates and affirmed that they expected two more increases this year. Their concern is that a tight labor market will push up inflation as employers increase wages to compete for workers.
The number of workers applying for jobless benefits last week fell to its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Salary and benefit costs to employers also increased, according to new figures released Friday.
For most Americans, who have seen little income growth in recent decades, though, fears of steeper inflation seem overblown. That is why some economists warn against raising rates too much and too fast, arguing that the increases will choke off the recovery.
At the conclusion of the March meeting, Jerome H. Powell, the new Fed chairman, said, "We're trying to take that middle ground."
Michael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics, said he did not expect the Fed's outlook to change much, regardless of Friday's report.
"The Fed already acknowledged some of the incoming data and that they think it could strengthen this year," he said. Last month, the central bank announced that it had raised its median estimate for annual growth this year to 2.7 percent, from 2.5 percent.

Era of Very Low Inflation and Interest Rates May Be Near an End

Full text: For years, the world economy has been trapped in a low-inflation, low-interest-rate rut. Yet the latest shifts in global markets suggest that this could, at long last, be ending.
The evidence isn't definitive. This could be a false dawn, of a type that has happened a couple of times in recent years. But let's put it this way: If the world economy was coming out of its low-inflation funk, this is probably what it would look like.
In recent days, the rate the United States government must pay to borrow money for two years has reached its highest level since 2008, and on Tuesday the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds rose above 3 percent for the first time in four years. As recently as September, that rate was near 2 percent.
You see a similar pattern in the bond prices of other advanced nations. For example, German 10-year yields rose to 0.64 percent Wednesday from 0.31 percent in September.
If this really is the start of a resetting of inflation and interest rates toward more historically normal levels, it will be mostly good news for the world economy. Central bankers have spent years trying unsuccessfully to get inflation to the 2 percent level many of them aim for.
In many ways the low interest rates of recent years have been a reflection of economic weakness around the globe. So as long as the moves don't go too far, increases in inflation and interest rates would be a sign the global economy is returning to a more prosperous equilibrium like the one that prevailed before 2008.
The shift looks to be driven mostly by a rise in investors' expectations for future inflation. In the United States, prices of inflation-protected bonds imply that investors currently expect consumer prices to rise 2.09 percent annually over the next five years, up from 1.65 percent expected in September.
That, in turn, partly reflects a sharp run-up in oil prices over the same period, which seems likely to push up consumer prices for gasoline and other fuels in the months ahead. But strikingly, inflation expectations for the period between five and 10 years from now have also risen, when the impact of the recent oil price rise should have long since passed.
A number of factors are involved in this shift. Economic growth is solid across almost all of the world's major economies for the first time in a decade, meaning there should be upward pressure on demand for all sorts of raw materials.
And with the United States closing in on full employment (or arguably already there), the Federal Reserve is looking more confident than it has in years in its intentions to keep raising interest rates.
Trump administration policies may also be playing a role.
New tax cuts and spending legislation will result in hundreds of billions of dollars more in Treasury bonds being issued in the years ahead than had seemed likely not that long ago. This means the government may need to pay higher interest rates to find buyers of that debt.
And if threats of a trade war with China or other countries turn into reality, this will tend to increase inflation, driving up prices both directly through new tariffs on imported goods and indirectly by encouraging less efficient production.
All of those forces are doing battle with longer-standing pressures in the other direction that have been in place since the global financial crisis a decade ago. This includes a chronic shortage of demand for goods and services and declining growth in the working-age population in many rich countries.
There have been fake-outs in bond and commodity markets on this front before, including in the second half of 2013 and in the months surrounding President Trump's 2016 election victory. This could be another one, and reverse itself soon enough.
But in the meantime, you can view the higher volatility in the stock market in the last couple of months as a consequence of this standoff between forces of inflation versus deflation, between higher interest rates and lower rates, and between a world economy straining against the limits of its capacity versus one that still is working through chronic oversupply.
On Tuesday, when long-term Treasury rates soared, the stock market fell, as investors tried to assess the consequences of this higher-rate environment for stocks.
After nine years of economic expansion and rising stock prices, the market is richly valued relative to earnings. Each $100 invested in the Standard & Poor's 500 currently generates only $4.78 in earnings at Tuesday's closing price. That low return might be tolerable when money invested in an ultrasafe Treasury bond -- or even in a savings account -- generates very low returns.
If higher interest rates are caused by higher economic growth, that's a dynamic stock investors would probably be fine with, in that more growth should translate into more corporate earnings. But if the rates are being driven by inflationary pressures, that's a different story, and suddenly the assumptions behind sky-high stock prices could fall into doubt.
As a reminder, stock market volatility skyrocketed in early February upon publication of new wage data suggesting that inflation pressures might be building, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster.
In the short run, markets can be shaped by all kinds of things, whether algorithmic trading or a run of bad news for a major company or a presidential tweet.
But in the longer run, economic fundamentals are powerful forces. And if this really is the turning point toward something more closely resembling the pre-2008 inflation and interest rate environment -- still a big if -- it will have an impact for nearly everyone, not just people with money to invest.

Full text: Stocks in the United States climbed Thursday as Facebook led a rally by technology companies. Most of the market moved higher as interest rates declined from the four-year highs reached over the last few days.
Facebook saw its stock price wither last month after its data privacy scandal, but shares surged Thursday as the controversy did not appear to affect the social media platform's business in the first quarter. Other big technology companies like Alphabet and Microsoft also rallied and reversed some of their recent losses.
Strong first-quarter results from companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill and O'Reilly Automotive helped retailers and other consumer-focused companies. Amazon surged and energy companies also climbed. Stock indexes rose and interest rates decreased after a Commerce Department survey showed business investment decreased in March for the third time in the last four months.
Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said investors were happy to see the decline in business investment because it might encourage the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a slower clip.
He said the biggest risk to the market is the Fed, "and the Fed hiking rates too much, given at least the level of economic growth we expect."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 27.54 points, or 1 percent, to 2,666.94. The Dow Jones industrial average added 238.51 points, or 1 percent, to 24,322.34. The Nasdaq composite advanced 114.94 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,118.68.
Since Jan. 26 the market has been hit by worries about inflation and a potential trade war between the United States and China, and big names like Facebook and Amazon have had a rough ride. The S.&P. is down 7.2 percent in the last three months, and the Dow has slumped 8.6 percent.
Facebook surged 9.1 percent to $174.16 after the company's advertisers appeared to shrug off the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. Facebook said its revenue jumped and there were few signs users or advertisers were abandoning the company.
Alphabet, Google's parent company and the only digital publisher larger than Facebook, rose 2 percent to $1,043.31.
Facebook has faced a backlash about how it collects and uses data since the revelation that Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm linked to the Trump campaign, had gained information on up to 87 million of its users.
Facebook stock is down 5.9 percent since then, and other technology companies have also stumbled as investors worried about the possibility that the government would start regulating them more harshly.
Amazon jumped 4 percent to $1,517.96. It rose another 6 percent in aftermarket trading as Wall Street was pleased with the online retailer's first-quarter results.
Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed after the company said sales improved in the first quarter, raising hopes that the chain is recovering from repeated food safety scares. The shares rose 24.4 percent to $422.50. They traded as high as $757 in mid-2015.
Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.98 percent from 3.03 percent.
Benchmark United States crude oil inched up 0.2 percent to $68.19 a barrel in New York.
Oil prices have surged in recent months, driving up fuel costs for many companies. Those expenses were a problem for airlines in the first quarter, as American said its profit fell 45 percent and cut its profit forecast for the rest of the year. Its stock lost 46.4 percent to $42.37.
Gold lost 0.4 percent to $1,316.30 an ounce.
The dollar rose to 109.36 yen from 109.34 yen and the euro dipped to $1.2104 from $1.2170.

Full text: Walmart is nearing a deal to acquire a majority stake in India's leading online retailer, a bold move that would open another front in its escalating war with Amazon.
The Indian company, Flipkart, is a start-up that sells everything from clothing to smartphones in the country's blossoming e-commerce market.
The two sides are in advanced discussions, and a deal could be announced soon, according to three people briefed on the matter. Exact terms are not yet final, and the talks are fluid, said these people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the negotiations were continuing.
Two of the people said that the deal would value Flipkart at about $20 billion and that Walmart was looking to acquire a stake of at least 60 percent.
The deal would be an aggressive and, some analysts say, risky foray by Walmart into one of the world's last great open markets for online retailing. Although India has a significant middle class, most of the nation's enormous population is still far too poor to afford much more than basic necessities. Flipkart has posted billions of dollars in losses while trying to build its business.
Still, Walmart missed out on China's e-commerce boom, and it does not want to make the same mistake with India -- especially with its rival Amazon already a strong player there. Only about 2 percent of India's retail sales are online now, but tens of millions of Indians are getting onto the internet every year via cheap smartphones and rock-bottom mobile data prices.
Amazon has committed at least $5.5 billion so far to building its India presence, fighting to gain market share among the country's young, increasingly tech-savvy shoppers. After starting an Indian site, Amazon.in, from scratch in 2013, Amazon blew past local players like Snapdeal and is now a close No. 2 to Flipkart in sales.
Walmart's interest in India is the latest extension of the retailer's battle with Amazon. Rooted for decades in its network of stores, Walmart has been trying to bolster its online offerings. In just the past few years, it has acquired the hip, largely online clothing brands Bonobos and ModCloth, started a higher-end mattress and bedding line sold exclusively online and expanded home grocery delivery to 100 American cities.
Based in Bangalore, Flipkart was founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. The two men, who are not related, worked briefly at Amazon's back-office operations in India before deciding to form their own company.
Like Amazon, Flipkart initially started selling books online before expanding into a vast array of products. On its way to becoming India's top online retailer, it successfully navigated problems such as customers' preference for paying in cash and the country's spotty roads and delivery networks.
While Walmart operates stores around the globe, India would be a relatively new frontier for the huge retailer. The company operates wholesale stores in India, but it has no public-facing retail or e-commerce presence.
Flipkart would be one of Walmart's largest acquisitions since it acquired Asda, a large British grocery chain, in 1999. That deal would be valued at about $16 billion today, adjusted for inflation.
Analysts point out that Walmart has made very few large acquisitions in its 56-year history and that some of those deals remain works in progress.
Walmart made a big splash in 2016 when it purchased the e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Jet, based in Hoboken, N.J., was supposed to be Walmart's answer to Amazon's appeal with higher-income, urban-dwelling millennials in the United States.
But there are signs that Walmart is still trying to fully integrate Jet into its larger e-commerce strategy. After reporting that its e-commerce sales growth had slowed in the fourth quarter, Walmart said it would focus on driving new customers through its main Walmart.com site, not through the Jet platform.
Acquiring Flipkart would give Walmart an instant leg up on Amazon in India, but it is still likely to face stiff competition from its primary rival. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, views India as his chance to make up for the company's failure to establish a major presence in China, just like Walmart. That likely means the online giant will double down on its investment there now that Walmart has come onto the scene.
"I don't think they should do it," Scott Mushkin, a retail analyst at Wolfe Research, said of Walmart's potential deal for Flipkart. "Amazon is like an A.T.M. machine. I wouldn't want to be competing with Amazon in India."
In addition to pouring billions into its Indian e-commerce site, Amazon is also investing in original content from Bollywood movie studios and has developed local versions of crucial products, such as its Prime video streaming and Echo voice-activated speakers.
Amazon's assault was so intense that a couple of years ago, some analysts were predicting that Flipkart would be crushed. Complicating matters, Flipkart was racked by management turmoil.
But Tiger Global, one of Flipkart's earliest and largest investors, pushed for the appointment of one of its own executives, Kalyan Krishnamurthy, as chief executive in January 2017. Mr. Krishnamurthy is credited with steadying the company and improving the customer experience.
SoftBank, a Japanese investment firm that has been making large bets in India over the last few years, also agreed to provide $2.5 billion in fresh capital last summer.
Walmart would bring an even larger potential source of funding to Flipkart as it tries to keep growing.
"For the ecosystem, this is good," said Satish Meena, a senior analyst in New Delhi for Forrester, a technology research firm. "There is more money and more expertise coming into the system. And customers will get more products at a lower price."
The e-commerce market in India, which includes categories like travel, was about $38.5 billion last year, and it is expected to grow to $50 billion in 2018, according to a recent study by Deloitte and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.
"The whole game now is scale," said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst at Susquehanna International Group.

Full text: A late round of buying erased early losses on Wall Street, leaving major indexes mixed at the close of trading. Stocks got off to a weak start as investors worried that growing costs for raw materials along with rising interest rates would hold back profit growth for U.S. companies.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 201 points in the morning as technology and health care companies declined and defense contractors stumbled following first-quarter reports from Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics. U.S. bond yields rose again and set four-year highs while oil prices, already at three-year highs, continued to move higher.
Later in the day, energy companies got a boost after Exxon Mobil said it is raising its quarterly dividend. Retailers and industrial companies also rose. Smaller companies ended lower, and most stocks on the New York Stock Exchange fell.
Stocks had tumbled on Tuesday after companies including Caterpillar, 3M and Sherwin-Williams said they seeing higher costs. On Wednesday Goodyear Tire & Rubber said higher raw materials costs and weaker demand hurt its business in the first quarter. Its stock fell 5.1 percent to $25.51.
Invesco Chief Global Market Strategist Kristina Hooper said investors are starting to worry that the market's best days are behind it. She noted that wages are rising, as unemployment has been at multi-decade lows for the last few years. That means costs for companies are up. Oil prices have also jumped and investors are worried that new tariffs will also drive up costs and affect company earnings in the months to come.
"I wouldn't be surprised if earnings peaked by the end of this year, but certainly they haven't peaked yet," she said.
The S&P 500 index added 4.84 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,639.40. Thanks to a big gain from Boeing, the Dow Jones industrial average snapped a five-day losing streak and rose 59.70 points, or 0.2 percent, at 24,083.83. The losing streak was its longest in more than a year. The Nasdaq composite dipped 3.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,003.74. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 2.81 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,550.47.
Stocks slumped Tuesday after heavy machinery maker Caterpillar said it doesn't expect to top its first-quarter earnings for the rest of this year. Company profits fuel the stock market, and when they are rising, stocks tend to do well.
Investors expected strong profit growth this year thanks to the growing global economy and the corporate tax cut President Donald Trump signed at the end of 2017. That optimism helped send stocks to record highs in January. Now investors are worrying about whether that growth will show up.
Aerospace company Boeing topped Wall Street's estimates in the first quarter and raised its forecasts for the year. Its stock gained 4.2 percent to $342.86 and railroad operator Norfolk Southern climbed 8.1 percent to $145.96 after it, too, surpassed analyst projections.
Investors also monitored rising interest rates, which tend to slow down economic growth by making it more expensive for people and companies to borrow money. Bond prices fell again Wednesday, sending yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note kept setting four-year highs as it rose to 3.03 percent from 3 percent.
Low interest rates have played an important role in the economic recovery of the last decade, and the yield on the 10-year note is a benchmark for many kinds of interest rates including mortgages. It's been climbing because investors expect higher economic growth and inflation. While investors expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates two more times this year, growing numbers of them now expect it to raise rates a third time after that.
Media conglomerate Comcast made a new offer to buy British broadcaster Sky, this time for $30 billion. Sky had accepted a $16.5 billion offer from 21st Century Fox. British regulators are investigating whether Fox's bid for Sky would give Rupert Murdoch and his family too much control over the country's news media.
Comcast also had a stronger first quarter than analysts expected, although it continued to lose cable subscribers. Its stock rose 2.7 percent to $34.26. Sky gained 3.9 percent in London. Fox rose 1.6 percent to $36.58, while Disney, which plans to buy most of Fox's overseas and entertainment assets, climbed 1.7 percent to $101.15.
Germany's DAX fell 1 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 both lost 0.6 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.1 percent and the South Korean Kospi lost 0.6 percent.
The dollar rose to 109.34 yen from 108.67 yen. The euro fell to $1.2175 from $1.2237.
Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 0.5 percent to $68.05 a barrel in New York. It's up 33 percent over the last 12 months and trading at its highest price in more than three years. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 0.2 percent to $74 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline fell 0.2 percent to $2.09 a gallon. Heating oil rose 0.4 percent to $2.14 a gallon. Natural gas rose 0.2 percent to $2.79 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell 0.7 percent to $1,323.70 an ounce and silver sank 1.1 percent to $16.52 an ounce.

Saying Hello to Amazon, and Higher Rents

Full text: When Amazon announced in January that Nashville had made the list of 20 finalists being considered for its second North American headquarters, city leaders cheered. They saw the project as the next step in Nashville's transformation from country-music capital into a regional and even national economic force.
To some locals, Amazon represented something else: more people, more traffic and, most of all, higher rents in a city where a rising share of residents were already struggling to afford a place to live.
"With the onslaught of new people, with the onslaught of higher-income earners, I just think it's going to further exacerbate what's already a crisis situation," said Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing advocate.
Ms. Coleman has reason to worry. A new analysis from the real estate site Zillow estimates that rents in Nashville would rise 3.3 percent per year if the city landed the Amazon campus, almost four times as fast as currently projected. After a decade, that could translate into Nashville residents paying $400 more per month in extra rent because of the project.
Other cities could also see big increases if Amazon picks them. Monthly rents in Boston and Los Angeles could jump by even larger amounts in dollar terms -- albeit from a higher starting point -- reflecting a shortfall in rental housing construction. Denver -- like Nashville, a midsize city that has seen brisk population growth in recent years -- could see its already rapid rate of rent increases hit nearly 6 percent per year, triple the overall rate of inflation.
"I definitely think it has the possibility of pushing us over the tipping point," said Felicia Griffin, executive director of United for a New Economy, a Colorado nonprofit that has opposed the Amazon project.
Some potential locations would be less severely affected. Atlanta and Chicago, big cities that have made it relatively easy to build new housing in recent decades, would see only a small rent increase if they won the Amazon project.
And Indianapolis, where population growth has been slow and housing is plentiful, would see no effect on its rents at all, according to Zillow's model. Even in those cities, however, neighborhoods near the Amazon campus would most likely see significant rent increases. (The study did not look at the effect on prices of owner-occupied homes.)
Amazon has provided few details about what it plans for the new campus, known as HQ2, other than that it could eventually be a base for up to 50,000 employees earning an average of about $100,000. The company hasn't said whether it prefers to build downtown, as it has at its current headquarters in Seattle, or will opt instead for a suburban office park -- a decision that could have significant implications for the project's effect on local housing costs. Though it mentioned the issue only in passing in its request for proposals last fall, Amazon says it will take such costs into account, and has met with affordable-housing groups in several of the finalist cities.
Zillow cautions that its estimates are rough, based on a simple model that looks at how rents in each city have responded to past influxes of workers. If the cities respond differently to Amazon's arrival -- for example, by building more housing -- the impact on rents could be smaller than Zillow's model estimates.
But there are also reasons to think Zillow's analysis could understate Amazon's potential impact. The model looks only at the effect of the jobs that the new campus is expected to create directly. If Amazon's presence draws other businesses to the area, rents could rise even faster.
That's what has happened in Seattle, where a mini-Silicon Valley has sprung up around Amazon's downtown campus. Facebook, Google and other internet giants have opened satellite offices nearby, and start-ups -- including Zillow itself -- have their headquarters there.
The boom has been good for Seattle's economy, which has experienced years of steady job growth, low unemployment and, unlike much of the country, strong wage gains. But it has also become a far less affordable place to live. Rents in Seattle now rival those in Boston and New York, and home prices are rising faster there than in any other big city. Amazon says it has contributed more than $40 million to affordable-housing projects in the city, as part of obtaining approval for its plans.
Whichever city wins the HQ2 sweepstakes will enjoy one big advantage over Seattle: advance warning. Aaron Terrazas, a Zillow economist who led the rent analysis, said Amazon's growth caught Seattle by surprise, and the city struggled to build enough housing to accommodate the influx of young, affluent tech workers. Whichever city is chosen, Mr. Terrazas said, needs to move quickly to build.
"What's so important is once a city is selected that they start to get ahead of the curve," Mr. Terrazas said.
So far, however, cities have been focused mostly on attracting Amazon in the first place. City and state governments have rolled out the red carpet for the company, offering tax incentives and other inducements. But the public response has been more lukewarm, particularly in cities where rising housing costs have already led to concerns about affordability and gentrification.
A recent Elon University poll of residents in the finalist cities found that while relatively few residents outright oppose Amazon moving to their city, only 43 percent strongly supported such a move. Residents in many cities said they were concerned that Amazon's arrival would increase the cost of living and opposed offering special incentives to attract the company.
In Nashville, the debate over HQ2 has gotten caught up in a broader discussion of gentrification, race and the consequences of growth. Residents long described Nashville as a small town disguised as a big city. But over the last decade, the city's tourism industry has taken off, and some of those tourists liked Nashville enough to stay. For years, the Nashville metropolitan area grew by more than 100 residents per day, with many of them moving into newly built downtown apartment complexes.
As in other cities that have experienced such booms, the growth has led to tensions. Longtime residents, many of them African-American, have been displaced, and the city's homeless population has grown. A recent study commissioned by the mayor's office found that the city had lost 18,000 affordable housing units since 2000. That gap could grow to 31,000 units by 2025 if current trends continue -- without taking Amazon into account.
"There are many neighborhoods in Nashville where the fight is lost," said James Fraser, a Vanderbilt University professor who has been active in the city's affordable-housing movement.
Adriane Harris, who leads housing policy for the Nashville mayor's office, said concerns about gentrification were legitimate. But she said there were two sides to the affordability equation: housing costs and income. Nashville's tourism economy depends heavily on low-wage service workers. The promise of HQ2 is that it could be the foundation of a new, more lucrative industry.
"If we're only addressing housing, then I don't think we're getting to the root of the issue," Ms. Harris said. "Wage growth is critical in this conversation."
Affordable-housing groups, however, worry that current Nashville residents won't be, for the most part, the beneficiaries of the high-paying jobs that Amazon promises. Fabian Bedne, a Nashville City Council member, said the city should ask the company to help mitigate its impact, perhaps by financing affordable-housing programs.
"We welcome technology, we welcome great jobs to the city, and I think people would even welcome Amazon, but it would have to be a trade-off there," Mr. Bedne said. "People don't want to sign a suicide pact."
Jenny Schuetz, a Brookings Institution economist who has studied housing policy, said cities would be wise to start planning for HQ2 even before Amazon announced its decision, which is expected this year. The good news, Ms. Schuetz said, is that the steps cities should be taking to prepare for Amazon are largely the steps they should be taking anyway, like improving transit systems and easing regulations that make it hard to build in the places people want to live.
Amazon, Ms. Schuetz added, should also take housing costs, traffic congestion and related issues into account. After all, she said, Amazon won't benefit if its workers can't find places to live, or if they are viewed by existing residents as a hostile force.
"It's going to be a long-term relationship," Ms. Schuetz said. "To retain good workers over the long haul, you should care about what housing costs could be."

Full text: With Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron visiting Donald Trump this week, much of the commentary has focused on how wildly different the staid German chancellor and the globally minded French president are from the mercurial American president. But the three do share one trait: They are all unpopular at home despite the good economic times.
This is new. For most of the postwar era, voters in the big democracies rewarded leaders for strong economies and punished them for policies that hurt growth. Now the link between good politics and good economics seems to have broken.
Last year, the global economy was finally accelerating out of the long torpor that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Unemployment hit lows not seen in decades, and inflation all but disappeared. Yet by January, my index of approval ratings for leaders in 20 major democracies showed their average rating hitting a new low of just 35 percent, down from a peak of more than 50 percent a decade ago.
President Trump is Exhibit A of this fraying connection between politics and economics. Surveys of consumer confidence show that Americans haven't felt this good about the economy since at least the height of the dot-com boom in 2000. Yet Mr. Trump's approval ratings have hovered around record lows for this point in any president's first term. Many commentators assume this is because Mr. Trump's divisive personality has overshadowed the strong economy.
But personality can't explain the struggles of Chancellor Merkel, who is as bland as Mr. Trump is controversial. Germany is enjoying a recovery even more surprisingly robust than the United States'. Yet in September Ms. Merkel led her party to its worst showing since 1949, and her approval ratings remain depressed.
The same decline has bedeviled Mr. Macron and other decidedly mainstream leaders like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and Shinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan. Yet none of these leaders comes close to matching President Trump for outrageousness. All three are seen as economic reformers who have produced relatively strong results, yet they all have approval ratings around 40 percent, just as bad as Mr. Trump's.
All politics is local, and maybe all of these leaders are suffering setbacks owing to domestic political issues. But that would be quite a coincidence. Something else seems to be at work.
Perhaps the most persuasive explanation is the rise of angry populism, built on a rejection of the established order and a growing focus on issues of culture and national identity, rather than practical economic outcomes.
In the past populism tended to rise in bad times and ebb in good ones, so you might have expected it to recede as the global recovery increased employment and wages over the past 18 months. But economic factors may no longer matter as much in a bitterly emotional political age, and leader approval ratings have continued to fall.
More people are getting their news from highly politicized arms of both traditional and social media, which can turn anything -- including the economy -- into a partisan issue. Until recently, party affiliation did not seem relevant to consumer optimism in the United States, but it does now. Before the 2016 presidential election, Democrats were more optimistic than Republicans, but that reversed immediately after Mr. Trump took office.
In this environment, the honeymoons granted newly elected leaders are now brutally short. Much of the recent decline in the approval ratings index is explained by the falling popularity of relative newcomers like Mr. Macron and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Of the 20 leaders in the index, five came to power over the past two years with positive approval ratings, and four of them fell below 50 percent within a year. Ms. May's approval rating has fallen into the mid-30s, worse than Mr. Trump's.
The changing nature and control of the news also helps to explain an even more unexpected disconnect between political and economic reality: the rare leaders who remain popular despite a faltering economy. In my index, which uses only polls independent of government control, there are just two -- both elected autocrats.
In Russia, President Vladimir Putin's 80 percent approval rating recently helped him win another six-year term in office, despite painfully bad economic conditions since the 2014 oil price collapse. He has remained popular by dominating the media, sidelining rivals and stirring up nationalism through actions like the conquest of Crimea.
Like Mr. Putin, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has used state control of media, nationalist conspiracy theories and foreign adventures (including the recent dispatch of troops into Syria) to maintain his popularity. Emboldened by his approval ratings, Mr. Erdogan has just called early elections for June even though Turkey has one of the world's highest rates of inflation -- a cancer that has ended many other political careers.
These trends are worrying. Good economics should remain good politics. Democracies work best when voters hold politicians accountable for economic results. If leaders sense that the economy no longer matters, they are free to push any policy that will energize their base -- which may explain Mr. Trump's recent nationalist threats against China and populist threats against big companies, both potentially bad economic policies.
And then there is this worrisome thought: If leaders embrace aggressively populist and nationalistic policies in good times, what will happen when the economy takes a turn for the worse?

Grumpy Investors Can't Find Anything to Like About the Market

Full text: The stock market is forward-looking. That's a problem when there's not much to look forward to.
Stocks sank for the fourth-straight day on Tuesday, as investors looked past a series of outwardly positive earnings reports and fixated on threats to the nine-year-old bull market.
Foremost among them is the Federal Reserve. Super-low interest rates from the central bank have fueled the rally, pushing up the prices of stocks and bonds since the Great Recession.
But that was then. Now, the Fed is slowly withdrawing some of its support. It is shrinking its portfolio of government bonds and lifting interest rates. As a result, a yearslong tailwind for the stock market is disappearing.
The new environment is evident in interest rates on government bonds, closely watched by many investors. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note touched 3 percent in trading early Tuesday. That benchmark interest rate -- which influences the price of borrowing for both consumer loans and corporate bonds -- has not been that high since early 2014.
Other pressures rattled the markets, and worries began to set in after 3M and Caterpillar reported a gloomy outlook.
The threat of a trade war, or even a real war, is unnerving investors. Oil prices have surged higher because of tensions in the Middle East, as well as President Trump's public musings about withdrawing the United States from its nuclear deal with Iran.
Those rising commodity prices represent something of a double worry for investors. For one, they feed into price inflation, making it even more likely that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates. (One of the Fed's main objectives is keeping prices stable.) At the same time, higher commodity prices eat into profit margins for companies, which is bad for their stock prices.
Last year, investors might have shrugged off those concerns, preferring to focus on the buoyant global economy and the prospect of a major reduction in American corporate tax rates.
That tax cut came to fruition in December, and it supercharged corporate profits, but that was a one-time event.
Investors were heartened by the tax cuts, said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. But their focus has shifted since then.
"The market's attention is rotating to other things, and one of those things is rising inflation and rising yields," Mr. Brown said. "One of those things is the potential for increasing trade tensions."
Other events are looming, and investors see little to be excited about. With congressional elections later this year, the prospects of pro-business legislation -- or any legislation, for that matter -- are dim. The biggest economic action out of Washington might be the Fed raising interest rates -- a clear negative for investors.
In short, it's up to companies themselves to give investors reasons to believe their shares can keep climbing.
Recent earnings reports suggest that is becoming harder to do. Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, dropped sharply Tuesday despite the company reporting Monday that quarterly profits rose 73 percent to $9.4 billion. Investors appeared concerned with a surge of spending at the company that hurt its profit margins.
Earnings reports also provoked a sell-off in the industrial firms 3M and Caterpillar. Investors were rattled by lower sales and profit forecasts and by sluggish demand for the products that 3M sells to auto body shops. Its shares sank 6.8 percent.
And investors, after initially applauding Caterpillar's first-quarter results, were unnerved when a Caterpillar executive told analysts that the first quarter might be a "high-water mark" for the year. The shares fell 6.2 percent.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 1.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.7 percent.
The decline in the S.&P. on Tuesday left the benchmark index down 1.5 percent for the year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

We Don't Need No Education

Full text: Matt Bevin, the conservative Republican governor of Kentucky, lost it a few days ago. Thousands of his state's teachers had walked off their jobs, forcing many schools to close for a day, to protest his opposition to increased education funding. And Bevin lashed out with a bizarre accusation: "I guarantee you somewhere in Kentucky today a child was sexually assaulted that was left at home because there was nobody there to watch them."
He later apologized. But his hysterical outburst had deep roots: At the state and local levels, the conservative obsession with tax cuts has forced the G.O.P. into what amounts to a war on education, and in particular a war on schoolteachers. That war is the reason we've been seeing teacher strikes in multiple states. And people like Bevin are having a hard time coming to grips with the reality they've created.
To understand how they got to this point, you need to know what government in America does with your tax dollars.
The federal government, as an old line puts it, is basically an insurance company with an army: nondefense spending is dominated by Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. State and local governments, however, are basically school districts with police departments. Education accounts for more than half the state and local work force; protective services like police and fire departments account for much of the rest.
So what happens when hard-line conservatives take over a state, as they did in much of the country after the 2010 Tea Party wave? They almost invariably push through big tax cuts. Usually these tax cuts are sold with the promise that lower taxes will provide a huge boost to the state economy.
This promise is, however, never -- and I mean never -- fulfilled; the right's continuing belief in the magical payoff from tax cuts represents the triumph of ideology over overwhelming negative evidence.
What tax cuts do, instead, is sharply reduce revenue, wreaking havoc with state finances. For a great majority of states are required by law to balance their budgets. This means that when tax receipts plunge, the conservatives running many states can't do what Trump and his allies in Congress are doing at the federal level -- simply let the budget deficit balloon. Instead, they have to cut spending.
And given the centrality of education to state and local budgets, that puts schoolteachers in the cross hairs.
How, after all, can governments save money on education? They can reduce the number of teachers, but that means larger class sizes, which will outrage parents. They can and have cut programs for students with special needs, but cruelty aside, that can only save a bit of money at the margin. The same is true of cost-saving measures like neglecting school maintenance and scrimping on school supplies to the point that many teachers end up supplementing inadequate school budgets out of their own pockets.
So what conservative state governments have mainly done is squeeze teachers themselves.
Now, teaching kids was never a way to get rich. However, being a schoolteacher used to put you solidly in the middle class, with a decent income and benefits. In much of the country, however, that is no longer true.
At the national level, earnings of public-school teachers have fallen behind inflation since the mid-1990s, and have fallen even more behind the earnings of comparable workers. At this point, teachers earn 23 percent less than other college graduates. But this national average is a bit deceptive: Teacher pay is actually up in some big states like New York and California, but it's way down in a number of right-leaning states.
Meanwhile, teachers' benefits are also getting worse. In particular, teachers are having to pay a rising share of their health insurance premiums, a severe burden when their real earnings are declining at the same time.
So we're left with a nation in which teachers, the people we count on to prepare our children for the future, are starting to feel like members of the working poor, unable to make ends meet unless they take second jobs. And they can't take it anymore.
Which brings us back to Bevin's unhinged outburst.
One way to think about what's currently happening in a number of states is that the anti-Obama backlash, combined with the growing tribalism of American politics, delivered a number of state governments into the hands of extreme right-wing ideologues. These ideologues really believed that they could usher in a low-tax, small-government, libertarian utopia.
Predictably, they couldn't. For a while they were able to evade some of the consequences of their failure by pushing the costs off onto public sector employees, especially schoolteachers. But that strategy has reached its limits. Now what?
Well, some Republicans have actually proved willing to learn from experience, reverse tax cuts and restore education funding. But all too many are responding the way Bevin did: Instead of admitting, even implicitly, that they were wrong, they're lashing out, in increasingly unhinged ways, at the victims of their policies.

Shares Lose Steam as Rising Yields Start to Steal Market's Thunder

Full text: Stocks could not hang on to an early gain and finished mostly lower on Monday as technology companies slipped. Bond prices continue to fall, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note drew closer to 3 percent, a level it has not reached since January 2014.
Investors once again focused on corporate deals on Monday as the utility company Vectren agreed to be bought by CenterPoint Energy for $6 billion, while the chief executive of Sears Holdings called for the company to sell more assets. Aluminum producers tumbled after moves to ease sanctions against the Russian aluminum company Rusal.
Stocks have faded over the last few days as bond yields have climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note continued to trade at four-year highs, rising to 2.98 percent from 2.96 percent. Bond yields have risen this year as investors have started to see signs that inflation is picking up and the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates. The 10-year yield stood at 2.40 percent at the end of 2017.
Since the global financial crisis of 2008-9, low inflation expectations and a bond-buying program by the Federal Reserve have helped keep bond yields low. That pushed stocks higher by making bonds less appealing by comparison. With the Fed no longer buying bonds and investors expecting greater inflation, analysts say higher yields could make bonds more attractive.
Duane A. McAllister, senior portfolio manager for Baird Advisors, says he does not think rising yields are a problem for the stock market. He said they were an opportunity for investors to diversify their holdings at a time of increased market volatility.
"Three percent is an important milestone on the continued trend toward higher interest rates," he said. "It shouldn't lead anyone, whether you're an individual investor or an institutional investor, to run for the hills."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.15 points to 2,670.29. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 14.25 points, or 0.1 percent, to 24,448.69. The Nasdaq composite index gave up 17.52 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 7,128.60. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks declined 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,562.12.
A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research survey of fund managers indicated this month that if the 10-year yield rises to 3.50 percent, investors will start buying bonds and sell stocks.
Aluminum companies fell sharply after the Treasury Department extended a deadline for American companies to stop doing business with Rusal. The department also said it could change its stance on sanctions against the Russian aluminum company if the billionaire businessman Oleg Deripaska gives up control.
Alcoa plunged 13.5 percent to $51.90, and Century Aluminum gave up 5.3 percent to $16.72. The stocks had rallied after the sanctions were announced.
The chief of Sears, Edward S. Lampert, called for the struggling retailer to sell the Kenmore brand and its home improvement business. ESL Investments, Mr. Lampert's hedge fund, said it might buy the home improvement assets and was willing to make an offer for Kenmore as well. Sears has been closing stores, cutting costs and selling brands as its sales fall. Its stock rose 7.6 percent to $3.24.
Benchmark United States crude oil rose 38 cents to $68.64 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 0.9 percent to $74.71 a barrel in London. Gold and silver prices tumbled. Gold fell $14.20 to $1,322.50 an ounce, and silver dropped 58 cents to $16.57 an ounce. Copper slid 2 cents to $3.11 a pound.
The dollar rose to 108.70 yen from 107.60 yen. The euro fell to $1.2207 from $1.2283.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
TECHNOLOGY
Some of biggest tech companies report earnings.
Five of the best known companies in technology will report their earnings this week, including Twitter, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Two of the tech giants that will share their financial results have been under political assault, but for very different reasons. Facebook has come under scrutiny by Congress and regulators for its data practices and role in the spread of misinformation, while Amazon has become a punching bag for President Trump, who has attacked it for not collecting enough taxes and its relationship with the United States Postal Service. It's not clear whether the financial results of either company were affected, but the attacks have nonetheless spooked investors in the past. Nick Wingfield
British panel hears testimony on Cambridge Analytica.
The researcher at the center of the Cambridge Analytica scandal will testify on Tuesday before a British panel investigating fake news and the use of social media in the weeks before the country voted to leave the European Union. The University of Cambridge researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, has been accused of improperly gathering personal data on millions of Facebook's users and sharing the information with the voter-targeting firm Cambridge Analytica. On Thursday, the same panel, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, will hear from Mike Schroepfer, Facebook's chief technology officer. Mr. Schroepfer can expect to hear about the frustration of committee members who have wanted Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify rather than lower-ranking executives. The committee has little legislative authority, but is working on a much-anticipated report that aims to shed light on the ways that political campaigns have manipulated social media to win over voters. Adam Satariano
TRADE
European leaders will discuss trade with Trump.
President Emmanuel Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, will arrive in Washington early this week for a state visit, and they will be followed closely by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday. Their discussions with Mr. Trump are likely to center on global security concerns but also on his administration's aggressive trade agenda, as an important trade deadline looms. On May 1, the exemptions that the United States granted several countries from steel and aluminum tariffs are set to expire, meaning the European Union and other close allies would to pay a steep premium to send metal into the United States. The Trump administration is hoping to use the tariffs as leverage in a trade negotiation, but European leaders have said they would not be bullied into concessions. Ana Swanson
AUTO INDUSTRY
Detroit automakers report earnings.
The three Detroit automakers all report first-quarter earnings this week, and most of the attention will focus on the struggling Ford Motor, which replaced its chief executive a year ago. Ford brought in Jim Hackett last May to reinvigorate earnings, cut costs and sharpen its strategy, but after 11 months on the job he's offered few specifics on a turnaround plan. At least some details on cost-cutting are expected when Ford reports on Wednesday. General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles both present their results on Thursday, and are expected to show solid performances, thanks to sales of high-margin trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Neal E. Boudette
ECONOMY
Stimulus is on the European Central Bank's agenda.
Have signs of a slowdown in Europe pushed back the European Central Bank's timetable for ending its emergency stimulus measures? That will most likely be the chief question when Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, holds a news conference on Thursday after a meeting of the bank's Governing Council. The central bank is not expected to make any changes to its monetary policy at the meeting. But it will probably discuss whether a downturn in some economic indicators signals a slowdown or is just the result of one-time factors, including an especially brutal flu season that kept many workers off the job. Jack Ewing
BANKING
Deutsche Bank's C.E.O. makes his debut on earnings call.
Christian Sewing, the new chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, will take part in its first-quarter earnings report on Thursday. Mr. Sewing (pronounced "saving"), who was named to replace John Cryan this month amid chronic losses at the bank, will face investors and analysts in an early morning conference call. They will most likely interrogate Mr. Sewing about the bank's strategy, which some investors complain is amorphous and unconvincing. Jack Ewing
ECONOMY
Initial estimate of domestic growth is released.
The Commerce Department will release its initial estimate for economic growth for the first quarter of 2018 on Friday morning. Many analysts have recently revised their forecasts, lowering their estimates of how much the nation's output increased on an annualized basis in January, February and March. The consensus is now 2 percent. Wall Street has cited slowdowns in residential investment and consumption along with the continuing trade deficit as the reason for the weakened outlook.
Still, while President Trump's combative and varying statements on trade and tariffs this year have created uncertainty and anxiety, economists remain optimistic that growth will pick up this year. During the last quarter of 2017, the economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.9 percent, adjusted for inflation. Patricia Cohen
MEDIA
Trump will skip the White House Correspondents' dinner.
President Trump will be a no-show at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday, making this the second straight year he has skipped out on the annual black-tie gathering of politicians and journalists. The last absentee president was Ronald Reagan in 1981 -- and he'd just survived an assassination attempt. (Mr. Reagan called in from the hospital anyway.) Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, will attend in his stead. See if she can keep a straight face during the comedy portion of the evening, which this year will include Michelle Wolf, a stand-up comic and "Daily Show" veteran whose Netflix series, "The Break," starts later this year.

Full text: The headlines may talk about growth, but we are living in a dark economic era. For most families, income and wealth have stagnated in recent decades, barely keeping pace with inflation. Nearly all the bounty of the economy's growth has flowed to the affluent.
And if you somehow doubt the economic data, it's worth looking at the many other alarming signs. "Deaths of despair" have surged. For Americans without a bachelor's degree, one social indicator after another -- obesity, family structure, life expectancy -- has deteriorated.
There has been no period since the Great Depression with this sort of stagnation. It is the defining problem of our age, the one that aggravates every other problem. It has made people anxious and angry. It has served as kindling for bigotry. It is undermining America's vaunted optimism.
So what are we going to do about it?
The usual answers -- technocratic changes to the tax code and safety net -- are not good enough. They don't measure up to the problem: an economy that no longer delivers a consistently rising standard of living. They also aren't very inspiring. In 2016, Hillary Clinton offered many thoughtful proposals, precisely none of which she got to implement.
This is a time for big ideas. One of the Trump presidency's only silver linings is its proof that our political discourse had been too narrow. Frustrated Americans don't feel bound by old rules. Almost 63 million of them voted for a man who had no political experience and made a mockery of politics as usual.
"Donald Trump's victory implies that people need to be more bold," as Ro Khanna, a Democratic congressman, has said. "People yawned at the smallness of American politics, at the stagnation of American politics, at the same faces, the same ideas, the same talking points." Or as Neera Tanden, who runs the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank, says, "Donald Trump has widened the aperture for policy discussions in the United States."
Some observers remain confused about all of this. They imagine American politics as a simple two-dimensional spectrum on which Democrats must move to the center. But every issue isn't the same. Yes, there are cultural issues, like abortion and guns, on which the country is classically divided. On these, moving to the center, or at least respectfully acknowledging our differences, can help Democrats. Representative Conor Lamb recently showed how to do it in Pennsylvania.
Economic policy is different. Most voters don't share the centrist preferences of Washington's comfortable pundit class. Most voters want to raise taxes on the rich and corporations. They favor generous Medicare and Social Security, expanded Medicaid, more financial aid for college, a higher minimum wage and a bigger government role in job creation. Remember, Trump won the Republican nomination as a populist. A clear majority of Americans wants the government to respond aggressively to our economic problems.
I think they're right about that, too. Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, has a nice framing. He says that the late 1960s and the 1970s should have moved a reasonable person to the right on economic policy, in response to rampant inflation, rising crime, sky-high top tax rates and breakdowns in Europe. The last 15 years -- with "widening inequality, financial crisis, zero interest rates, rising gaps in life expectancy and opportunity," as Summers notes -- should move that same person to the left. Different eras require different solutions.
Fortunately, policy experts have begun working on those solutions. One possibility is a federal jobs program, putting people to work earning $15 an hour on vital projects like infrastructure and child care. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who seems to be eyeing a presidential run, favors an ambitious version called a federal jobs guarantee.
Another option is a strong response to growing corporate power and consolidation. The Open Markets Institute and Roosevelt Institute have sketched out new antimonopoly policies. Other economists are talking about something called wage boards, where companies and workers would negotiate over industrywide pay. Such boards already exist in New York, California and Australia.
On health care, there are proposals to open Medicare to people younger than 65 (which could also reduce health spending). On child poverty, two senators have proposed a $3,600-a-year annual allowance for children under 6. On education, states and cities have created free pre-K or community college. And to help pay for it all, experts are studying how best to raise taxes on the wealthy -- who can certainly afford to pay more.
The details will be important. Done wrong, any of these ideas could fizzle. They could make people lose even more faith in government. Done right, though, the ideas could mimic the grand successes of government: Social Security, Medicare, the military, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the highway system, public universities, medical research and a Defense Department project that became the internet.
It's time to dream big again.

The Opioid Crisis Foretold

Full text: One of the more distressing truths of America's opioid epidemic, which now kills tens of thousands of people every year, is that it isn't the first such crisis. Across the 19th and 20th centuries, the United States, China and other countries saw drug abuse surge as opium and morphine were used widely as recreational drugs and medicine. In the West, doctors administered morphine liberally to their patients, while families used laudanum, an opium tincture, as a cure-all, including for pacifying colicky children. In China, many millions of people were hooked on smoking opium. In the mid-1800s, the British went into battle twice -- bombing forts and killing thousands of civilians and soldiers alike -- to keep the Chinese market open to drug imports in what would become known as the Opium Wars.
That history has either been forgotten or willfully ignored by many in the medical and political establishments.
Today's opioid crisis is already the deadliest drug epidemic in American history. Opioid overdoses killed more than 45,000 people in the 12 months that ended in September, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The epidemic is now responsible for nearly as many American deaths per year as AIDS was at the peak of that crisis.
Experts say that the death toll from opioids could climb for years to come. Millions of people are dependent on or addicted to these drugs, and many of them are increasingly turning to more potent, illicit supplies of heroin and fentanyl, which are cheap and readily available on the street and online. Yet only about 10 percent of Americans who suffer from substance abuse receive specialized addiction treatment, according to a report by the surgeon general.
WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE
As many as 313,000 people were addicted to injected morphine and smoked opium in the United States in the late 19th century, according to David Courtwright, a history professor at the University of North Florida who has written extensively about drugs. Another scholar, R. K. Newman, estimated that as many as 16.2 million Chinese were dependent on opium and smoked the drug daily.
In the United States today, about 2.6 million people suffer from opioid use disorder. But some experts say that data, which is based on a government survey, underestimates the number of pain patients who are addicted to their prescription pills because of how surveyors ask people about drug use; the actual number might exceed five million.
In the 19th century, like today, the medical community was largely responsible for the epidemic. Doctors did not fully appreciate the risks these drugs posed. In the 1800s, many doctors viewed morphine as a wonder drug for pain, diarrhea, nerves and alcoholism. In addition to getting homemakers, Civil War veterans and others addicted, many doctors became addicts themselves. The drug was overused in large part because there were few alternatives; aspirin, for example, didn't become available until the late 1890s.
In his 2001 book, "Dark Paradise: A History of Opiate Addiction in America," Mr. Courtwright notes that the use of morphine began declining as younger doctors who had been better trained started practicing medicine and as non-addictive pain treatments became available. He also notes that many local governments across the country set up clinics that sought to help addicts -- a forerunner of contemporary methadone clinics -- but a hostile federal government forced virtually all of them to shut down by 1923. It did so under the misguided idea that it was wrong to keep supplying drugs to people who had become dependent on them -- a view that is, regrettably, still widespread today.
Today's opioid crisis has its roots in the 1990s, when prescriptions for painkillers like OxyContin and Vicodin started to become common. Companies like Purdue Pharma, which makes OxyContin, aggressively peddled the idea that these drugs were not addictive with the help of dubious or misinterpreted research. One short 1980 letter to The New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Hershel Jick and Jane Porter said the risk of addiction was less than one percent, based on an analysis of nearly 12,000 hospital patients who were given opioid painkillers. That letter was widely -- and incorrectly -- cited as evidence that opioids were safe.
Federal regulators, doctors and others were swayed by pharmaceutical companies that argued for greater use of opioids; there was increasing awareness that doctors had become too unresponsive to patients who were in pain. Patient advocates and pain specialists demanded that the medical establishment recognize pain as the "fifth vital sign."
Mr. Courtwright says that this was not a simple case of historical amnesia. In the earlier epidemic, doctors "made mistakes, but it was a bad situation to begin with," he said. "There was no equivalent of Purdue Pharma flying you off to the Bahamas for the weekend to tell you about the wonders of these new drugs."
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?
The AIDS crisis might provide public officials some lessons for how to move forward. Like with opioids, the federal government responded to that epidemic by doing next to nothing for many years. But an organized movement led in part by people with H.I.V. and gay activists eventually forced Congress to create and fund new programs. For example, in 1990 Congress approved the Ryan White Care Act, a bipartisan bill that poured billions of dollars into providing treatment and support to people with H.I.V. By 1995, the federal government was spending $3.3 billion a year (about $5.4 billion today after adjusting for inflation) on AIDS efforts, not including billions spent through mandatory programs like Medicaid and Medicare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That was up from just $116 million in 1985.
Though slow to act, Congress eventually treated AIDS as a complex, multidimensional problem and tackled it by funding prevention, treatment, support services and research. Lawmakers provided money to make expensive antiretroviral drugs accessible to more people and allocated money to help house people infected with H.I.V., recognizing that they needed more than just access to drugs.
Lawmakers so far have fallen far short of such a vigorous effort when it comes to opioid addiction. Congress has taken what can be considered only baby steps by appropriating a total of a few billion dollars of discretionary opioid funding in recent years. This funding amounts to a pittance relative to what is needed: substantial long-term funding for prevention, addiction treatment, social services and research. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University, says at least $6 billion a year is needed for 10 years to set up a nationwide network of clinics and doctors to provide treatment with medicines like buprenorphine and methadone. Those drugs have a proven track record at reducing overdoses and giving people struggling with addiction a shot at a stable life. Today, large parts of the country have few or no clinics that offer medication-assisted treatment, according to an analysis by amfAR, a foundation that funds AIDS research.
Next, lawmakers need to remove regulations restricting access to buprenorphine, an opioid that can be used to get people off stronger drugs like heroin; its use is unlikely to end in an overdose. Doctors who want to prescribe the drug have to go through eight hours of training, and the government limits the number of patients they can treat. These limits have made the drug harder to obtain and created a situation in which it is easier to get the kinds of opioids that caused this crisis than to get medicine that can help addicts. France reduced heroin overdoses by nearly 80 percent by making buprenorphine easily available starting in 1995. Yet many American lawmakers and government officials have resisted removing restrictions on buprenorphine, arguing it replaces one addiction with another. Some of the same people have also stood in the way of wider availability of naloxone, which can help reverse overdoses, and opposed harm-reduction approaches like supervised drug consumption sites, where users can get clean needles and use drugs under the watch of staff who are trained to reverse overdoses.
To stem the number of new opioid users, lawmakers and regulators need to stop pharmaceutical companies from marketing drugs like OxyContin and establish stronger guidelines about how and when doctors can prescribe them. These drugs are often the last resort for people with cancer and other terminal conditions who experience excruciating pain. But they pose a great risk when used to treat the kinds of pain for which there are numerous nonaddictive therapies available. Doctors have been writing fewer opioid prescriptions in recent years, but even the new level is too high.
Some lawmakers have begun to take this epidemic seriously. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Elijah Cummings, both Democrats, recently proposed legislation modeled on the Ryan White Act that would appropriate $100 billion over 10 years for research, treatment and support. While that might seem like a lot, President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers said in November that the epidemic cost the economy $504 billion in 2015 alone.
Leaders in both parties are responsible for this crisis. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama and members of Congress did too little to stop it in its earlier stages. While Mr. Trump talks a lot about the problem, he seems to have few good ideas for what to do about it. As we've learned the hard way, without stronger leadership, the opioid epidemic will continue to wreak havoc across the country.

Full text: By a lot of measures, these are very good times for the global economy. Nearly every major region of the planet is enjoying solid growth and prosperity simultaneously for the first time in a decade.
Yet the world's top economic policymakers, who are gathered in Washington this week, are sounding awfully glum.
"The present good times will not last for long," said Maurice Obstfeld, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, as he released the fund's latest projections, which foresee a solid 3.9 percent expansion of the global economy in 2018.
Or as his boss, the I.M.F. managing director Christine Lagarde, put it, "The current global picture is bright, but we can see darker clouds looming."
The pessimism among policymakers -- who are attending spring meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank in Washington this week -- contrasts with financial markets. Despite a bumpy couple of months, stocks and most other financial assets are still priced at levels that suggest growth will continue apace for some time to come.
"Economists are paid to worry," said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former official at the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve. "We're paid to find problems and challenges. I think the markets, on the other hand, are pretty good at living in the moment."
What are these policymakers so worried about? Is this just a bunch of economists living up to their field's reputation as the dismal science -- or worse, letting their own policy preferences shape their forecasts? Or is the world economy, for all its apparent prosperity, actually in peril?
Let's look at the interrelated threats the economists see.
Trade War Worries
President Trump tweeted last month that trade wars are "good, and easy to win," but it is safe to say that leading economic policymakers do not agree. They instead see the risk of ruin in the administration's tariff threats -- a cycle of retaliation that could disrupt companies' supply chains and cause global commerce to falter.
Ms. Lagarde argued in a speech last week that the global trading system has had tremendous benefits in terms of reducing poverty and creating higher-wage jobs. "But that system of rules and shared responsibility is now in danger of being torn apart," she said.
For now, this remains more a theoretical risk than a cause of major disruption to economic expansion.
The Trump administration has threatened a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a steep tariff on steel and aluminum imports, and the intention to tax $50 billion (or maybe $150 billion) of Chinese imports. But it has then backed away, entering Nafta renegotiation, granting exceptions to the steel and aluminum tariffs to many countries, and delaying tariffs on Chinese imports.
Essentially the Trump administration pattern so far has been to pair belligerent language with comparatively restrained action. Trading partners have worked to find resolutions rather than let a full-scale trade war erupt. There is a tentative deal to renegotiate the United States' trade agreement with South Korea, for example, and Nafta negotiations are continuing.
A World of Financial Imbalances
Global policymakers are worried about more than conflict over trade. They also see an emerging series of financial imbalances and risks that could cause, or worsen, the next downturn.
For years, for example, some countries -- Germany, Japan and China prominent among them -- have persistently run current account surpluses, meaning they export more than they import and essentially export capital to the rest of the world. Others, including the United States and Britain, have run persistent current account deficits.
Over time, these patterns can create vulnerability to financial shocks; they helped fuel both the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 eurozone crisis. And the I.M.F. projects that they will worsen in the next couple of years, despite steady economic growth.
For example, Germany's current account surplus is set to rise from 8 percent of G.D.P. in 2017 to 8.2 percent in 2018 and 2019, according to the World Economic Outlook. The United States' current account deficit is forecast to rise to 3 percent of G.D.P. from 2.4 percent.
The tools to prevent those shifts are within each country's purview. Germany could spend more on domestic investment, and the United States could reduce its budget deficit, which might start to reduce those imbalances. Neither has much evident political appetite to do so.
At the same time, years of efforts by central banks to fuel economic recovery have left interest rates low worldwide and prices in financial markets relatively high.
The I.M.F.'s Global Financial Stability Report, released Wednesday, warns that "easy financial conditions risk fueling financial vulnerabilities that may put medium-term growth at risk."
So, for example, if inflation starts to perk up and the world's central banks raise rates to try to prevent it from taking root, there could be a cascading series of disruptions to financial markets that have become accustomed to cheap money.
High Debt, Low Rates and the Next Recession
Another worry: While the major economies look relatively strong right now, they may also prove brittle when the next shock arises.
Rather than using this period of stability and prosperity to pay down debts, some major economies are moving in the other direction -- including with rising public debt levels in the United States and high private debt levels in China.
"In the United States, the fiscal impulse is important, but that is something that at some point doesn't give you any more mileage in terms of growth," said AgustÃ­n Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements and former governor of the Bank of Mexico, in an interview Wednesday. "And China need to continue improving the quality of growth from the point of view of the dependency on credit."
That dependency on debt means that whenever the next economic downturn arrives, governments may have less leeway to deal with it by opening the floodgates of public spending.
And with interest rates still low across the entire advanced world, one of the normal tools for dealing with a recession still has limited power. For example, the Federal Reserve entered the last downturn with its short-term interest rate at 5.25 percent, before cutting to nearly zero by December 2008. Currently, that target rate is between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.
The European Central Bank has even less room to maneuver, with its policy rates still near zero.
In effect, a decade after the financial crisis, if another recession were to arise, both central banks and fiscal authorities may find themselves short of ammunition to fight it.
People Who Tend to Fret
There is surely an anthropological dimension to the kind of worrying that is emerging from conference halls in Washington this week.
The people who end up as central bankers or finance ministers or I.M.F. officials tend to worry a lot about what could go wrong. They also tend to place greater value than most on the kinds of international institutions that underpin the global trade system, of which the Trump administration is deeply skeptical.
But there's also no doubt that the largely good economic news of the moment comes with some warnings worth listening to. Even when enjoying sunny weather, it never hurts to know what you'll do if it starts to rain.

Full text: A steep slide in technology companies weighed on U.S. stocks on Friday, pulling the market lower for the second day in a row.
Losses among retailers, packaged food and beverage makers and other consumer goods companies also helped weigh down the market. Banks rose as bond yields continued to climb, reflecting increasing investor concerns of higher inflation in the wake of rising oil and other commodity prices.
The Standard & Poor's 500-index fell 22.99 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,670.14. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 201.95 points, or 0.8 percent, to 24,462.94. The Nasdaq composite index lost 91.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to 7,146.13. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 9.69 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,564.12.
For every stock that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, two declined. Still, the indexes finished the week with a gain.
Bond prices continued to slide as bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.96 percent.
The pickup in bond yields helped drive bank shares higher. When bond yields rise, they drive up interest rates on mortgages and other loans, which can translate into bigger profits for banks. Regions Financial gained 4.1 percent to $18.89.
Technology stocks were the biggest contributor to the market decline, adding to the sector's losses for the week. It's still up 4.4 percent this year. Apple finished lower for the third day in a row, losing 4.1 percent to $165.72.
Mattel was one of the biggest decliners among consumer-focused companies. The struggling toymaker slid 3.6 percent to $12.96 after announcing that its chief executive, Margo Georgiadis, is stepping down and is being succeeded by a company director and former studio executive.
Crude oil prices reversed early an decline prompted by news that representatives from OPEC nations and allied oil ministers were meeting in Saudi Arabia to discuss their agreement to maintain cuts to production in a bid to keep prices up. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 9 cents to settle at $68.38 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 28 cents to $74.06 per barrel in London.
The dollar rose to 107.60 yen from 107.41 yen on Thursday. The euro fell to $1.2283 from $1.2337. The pound weakened to $1.4023 from $1.4078 after the Bank of England's governor cast some doubts about the possibility of a rate increase next month.
Gold fell $10.50 to $1,338.30 an ounce.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The global economy is looking stronger than it has in years, but as world leaders gather here this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund, they will be particularly attuned to possible economic disruptions stemming from decisions being made just a few blocks away at the White House.
In a report released Tuesday morning, the International Monetary Fund said stronger business investment and trade were buoying the world's economy. Global growth is on track to reach an annual rate of 3.9 percent this year and next, propelled by the economies of Europe, Japan, China and the United States. That would be up from 3.8 percent in 2017, which was the strongest growth since 2011.
But the spring version of the World Economic Outlook, the fund's semiannual report card on the health of the international economy, outlined big risks -- including the growing likelihood of a trade war and government policies that could overheat the United States economy.
Though the report did not mention President Trump by name, some of the risks -- including a trade war -- are linked to his policies. Mr. Trump maintains that trading partners have not treated the United States fairly and that his administration must take tough action to level the playing field, including imposing tariffs on steel imports and products from China.
In a news conference detailing the report Monday morning, Maurice Obstfeld, the director of the research department, said there was a particular risk that fears of a trade war could dampen business investment and spark a sell-off in stock markets and other financial assets.
"I suspect if you keep poking at the economic expansion, it could turn around and bite you," Mr. Obstfeld said.
"There can be no doubt about it, the big elephant in the room continues to be trade policy," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.
Companies are already paying higher prices for materials such as steel and soybeans and are beginning to feel uncertain about how to plan for the future, Mr. Slok said. "This is hanging as a big dark cloud over the spring meetings this year," he said.
Mr. Trump's "America First" approach to economic policy has sometimes brought him into conflict with international organizations, which he has criticized as ineffectual. The I.M.F. cautioned Tuesday that the multilateral, rules-based trading system of the World Trade Organization was "in danger of being torn apart."
Another risk is Mr. Trump's tax cut which, along with other budget changes, is expected to boost the United States economy by 1.2 percent by 2020, according to the I.M.F. There is concern the tax cuts could cause the economy to overheat, spurring inflation, which in turn could prompt the Federal Reserve and other central banks to raise interest rates. That could derail future growth and cause financial problems in fast-growing, but risky, emerging markets.
In the short run, the I.M.F. expects the tax cuts to help lift economic activity. It forecasts the United States economy to grow by 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.7 percent in 2019 -- up from 2.3 percent in 2017 and faster than the fund's previous projections.
Speaking at a rally in Hialeah, Fla., on Monday, Mr. Trump cheered the effects of the tax cut and the strength of the economy. "This could be one of the greatest booms ever," the president said. "Congratulations, enjoy your money."
Outside the United States, global growth is roaring along, lifted by surging exports to China and strong consumption in India. Prices of commodities are going up after two years of declines, and that is good news for countries, like Brazil and Russia, that are big exporters of oil, gas, metal and agricultural products.
As it did in earlier reports, the I.M.F. emphasized that the prolonged period of economic growth would eventually end and that policymakers needed to act now prepare for the next downturn. The fund urged governments to make tough adjustments to increase their economic productivity now, while growth remained strong.
"The present good times will not last for long, but sound policies can extend the current upswing," Mr. Obstfeld said.

With Falling Dollar, Look Abroad (Carefully)

Full text: Since the start of last year, the dollar has lost more than 12 percent of its value against a basket of foreign currencies. During that same stretch, stock funds that invest abroad have gone from being laggards to leaders.
"Foreign investments tend to do better when the dollar is weak," said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for Cresset Wealth Advisors. That's because "when you invest in foreign stocks, you're actually buying two things -- the foreign equities, but also the foreign currencies needed to buy them," he said.
And as those foreign currencies strengthen against a weak dollar, the returns on foreign investments held by Americans get a lift.
Over the last year, European equities have largely been flat when measured in their local currencies. But when translated into dollars, European equities have returned nearly 18 percent over the last 12 months for Americans.
Many market observers think the dollar could weaken further, especially as inflationary fears build in the United States. "The dollar is still fundamentally overvalued against a number of currencies, particularly in the emerging markets," said Thomas Clarke, a portfolio manager of the William Blair Macro Allocation Fund.
Does that mean investors should continue to look overseas? The short answer is yes, market strategists say. But it's complicated.
The falling dollar is a double-edged sword for Americans investing abroad, said Harry W. Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management.
"On the one hand, if the dollar is weakening versus the euro or the yen or the Swiss franc, the value of your foreign investments is going to go up just on the currency alone," he said. "But there's another impact you cannot ignore."
While the foreign funds held by American investors benefit from a currency tailwind, the international companies held within those funds face headwinds as they try to compete against United States businesses whose goods are cheaper because they're priced in dollars.
Mr. Hartford notes that companies in the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe, Australasia and Far East Index (known as the MSCI EAFE) generate roughly 15 percent of their revenue in the United States and an additional 10 percent in emerging markets, where many currencies are at least partially linked to the dollar.
"The benefits investors will have seen from the decline in the U.S. dollar could be offset by the translation effect on company revenues," he said.
This doesn't imply that American stock investors should avoid foreign exposure, however.
Regardless of how the dollar trades from here, shares of foreign companies are more attractively priced, on average, than domestic stocks.
Domestic blue-chip equities, for example, are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 32, based on 10 years of averaged profits. That's twice as expensive as they've historically been, according to Research Affiliates.
By contrast, shares of foreign stocks based in developed economies such as Europe and Japan have a P/E of 17.5, which is a 30 percent discount from their historic median. Emerging market stocks are trading at a P/E of 15.
"I look on Europe as a bargain and the emerging markets as a bargain," said Robert D. Arnott, chairman and chief executive of Research Affiliates. "I'm perfectly happy about nondollar investments because they are cheap and the U.S. stock and bond markets are not."
Still, to benefit from the gains a weak dollar produces while avoiding potential problems, investors may want to focus on specific types of companies -- those domiciled abroad but whose profits are not going to be affected by any further decline in the currency.
"One place to look is international small caps," said Mr. Ablin said, referring to shares of small companies domiciled abroad with a market value of around $3 billion or less. "These companies are denominated in foreign currencies. But because they are smaller, they tend to transact most of their business in their home markets."
The MSCI EAFE small-cap index tracks such stocks, and an investor can buy an exchange-traded fund that mirrors the index, like the iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap E.T.F.
One company included in the index is Orpea, which has nursing homes, rehabilitation hospitals and home-care operations throughout Europe.
Last year, 93 percent of the health care company's revenue was generated in the eurozone and 99 percent in Western Europe, with a majority of sales based in its home country of France.
Another example is the German real estate company LEG Immobilien. It owns more than 130,000 residential apartments, nearly all of which are in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
Beyond smaller names, investors can also turn to foreign companies with commodity-based businesses.
One important factor is inflation, which has bolstered commodity prices and is a big part of the explanation for the dollar's fall in the first place, said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.
Mr. Paulsen points out that the dollar fell last year even though the Federal Reserve had been raising rates. Higher rates typically tend to attract more cash flows and lift a currency's value, but rising "inflation destroys the value of the U.S. dollar," Mr. Paulsen said.
Commodities, as well as other "real assets" like real estate, are viewed as an inflation hedge and tend to outperform in periods of dollar weakness. "They're joined at the hip," Mr. Paulsen said.
One good example of a foreign commodity play: Royal Dutch Shell, the multinational oil and energy giant.
Though headquartered in the Netherlands and incorporated in the United Kingdom, Royal Dutch Shell reports its earnings in dollars, because oil is priced in that currency.
"Because they are reporting in U.S. dollars, then you as a U.S.-based investor should be indifferent to what the exchange rate does, whether it goes up or down," said Mr. Hartford of Causeway Capital Management, whose fund, Causeway International Opportunities, counts Royal Dutch Shell among its top holdings.
If the dollar is falling because inflation is picking up in the United States earlier than in other parts of the world, then emerging market stocks ought to benefit. Many parts of the emerging world -- such as Latin America -- are dependent on commodities. Moreover, emerging economies are more tied to manufacturing than consumption compared with the developed world, and rising inflation often squeezes consumer companies first.
Since the dollar began to sink in January 2017, emerging market equity funds are up 37 percent, nearly twice the gains of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during that time. And in an earlier stretch in which the dollar was weak -- from 2002 to 2008 -- emerging market funds trounced those focused on the United States by nearly 20 percentage points a year for six years.
"A weaker dollar is beneficial to international investments relative to the U.S.," said Mr. Paulsen. "And that's more true for the emerging markets."

Full text: The long calm in the stock market has been broken by confirmation that the Federal Reserve intends to combat inflation aggressively and by signs of a trade war that could threaten global economic integration and the prosperity it has helped engender.
What happens from here may hinge on the speed and severity of Fed interest rate increases and the speed and severity with which the United States and China impose tariffs on each other's goods.
At their most extreme, investment advisers warn, each factor could subdue growth, and protectionist policies could do much worse. Until signs emerge that economic damage will be limited, they say, stocks could remain under pressure.
"We're dealing with a more toxic issue than we've had to deal with in this bull market," said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. "There's the potential for causing a global recession, and that's something investors are worrying about."
They seemed not to have a care in the world as 2018 began. Stocks recorded a string of record highs as Wall Street contemplated the benefits from reduced corporate and personal income tax rates that had just been enacted. But Treasury bond yields rose steadily through January as indicators of economic strength, particularly the persistently low unemployment rate, raised the prospect of rising inflation.
Around the same time, President Trump began to impose tariffs intended to protect American industries from foreign competition. Solar panels and washing machines were his first targets. Then came steel and aluminum.
Tariffs may or may not help the targeted industries, which in these cases are not significant segments of the economy, anyway, and the taxes are almost universally viewed as harmful to consumers, who have to pay more for the affected goods. And then there's the impact of tariffs imposed by foreign governments in retaliation, which came swiftly from China, the main target of the trade war that Mr. Trump has threatened to wage.
The potential impact of the back-and-forth trade moves, and the ones that yet may come, helped send stocks on one of the swiftest plunges on record starting in late January -- 11.8 percent in less than 10 trading days for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
That was followed by a rally that recouped most of the loss, and then another decline that took the index close to a fresh low, leaving it down 1.2 percent in the first three months of the year, the first quarterly decline since 2015. The early days of April have been rocky as well.
If a trade war really has begun, some household names in corporate America could become casualties, Andy Rothman, an investment strategist at Matthews Asia, warned.
"There are already a lot of U.S. companies doing really well in China," he said. "G.M. sells more cars in China than in the U.S., Boeing sells more planes in China than in any other market, and Apple derives 20 percent of its revenues in China. Those are big listed names."
The impact would go beyond sales in China, he added. American companies that obtain parts and supplies there could see that conduit disrupted.
As for the Chinese economy and stock market, Mr. Rothman said, they are mostly immune.
"Very few listed Chinese companies export stuff to the United States," he said. "Even if Trump disrupts U.S.-China trade, the impact should be negligible."
A trade war, therefore, "will hurt us more than them," he said. That's why he expects the president's protectionist tendencies to be reined in.
"The odds of a full-blown trade war are extremely low," Mr. Rothman said. Not only is the Chinese leadership eager to avoid one, but "Trump must be coming under a lot of pressure not to do this for the damage it will do to the U.S. equity market."
Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citi Research, also foresees limited damage to the economy and stocks from an unraveling in trade relations. He pointed to the exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs offered to big trading partners like Canada and Mexico, and he expressed hope that Mr. Trump's words and actions merely reflected his penchant for eccentric deal making.
"Trump has a unique negotiating style," Mr. Levkovich said. But "if he takes it further, it could be a problem and hurt growth in a more meaningful way." As for the impact of the president's tactics on investments, he added, "it doesn't help."
Mr. Yardeni said he thought a trade war could be forestalled, although the mere prospect of one could depress the stock market. He agreed that "this could be Trump's art of the deal -- take an extreme negotiating position and wait for people on the other side to say, 'Let's talk about this."'
Tighter monetary policy is a more run-of-the-mill concern. But investors should not underestimate the potential it has to harm their portfolios with valuations elevated across the board and inflation threatening to return.
"Prices across just about every asset class look high historically," said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the asset management firm GMO. "What they all have in common is that when you squint, they make sense if you assume cash rates are going to stay low for some time. If inflation is up, then you need significantly tight monetary policy. That's bad for bonds and also stocks."
Mr. Inker is concerned about a trade war, like many other investors, but he emphasizes the risk of higher prices on goods -- inflation -- that it might cause.
"The nightmare scenario is a general rise of economic nationalism and the mercantilist view that trade has winners and losers," he said. "Then you get a retreat from globalization, which has helped the economy grow without experiencing significant inflation."
When stocks fall, so usually do yields on high-quality bonds, sending prices higher in a so-called flight to safety. But one ominous development during the first leg of the decline in stocks, from Jan. 26 to Feb. 8, was that the yield on 10-year Treasury securities rose to 2.85 percent from 2.66 percent. Yields were steady during the second wave of selling in stocks, but they rose overall during the first quarter, to 2.74 percent from 2.4 percent.
That means that bond prices, as well as stock prices, fell.
Terri Spath, chief investment officer of Sierra Investment Management, warned in a note to clients that the traditional balanced portfolio, split 60/40 between stocks and bonds, might not provide the protection through diversification that it used to if the bond bull market that began in the early 1980s is over, as she believes.
"Tightening Fed policy, inflation, rapidly growing deficits and their impact on rates can sometimes move bond prices violently," Ms. Spath wrote. "July 2016 marked the lowest level in rates I will likely see in my lifetime," with the 10-year Treasury yield reaching 1.33 percent. "If interest rates continue the climb up from that level, traditional bonds and the 60/40 will continue to die, as foreshadowed during the first correction of 2018."
Ms. Spath is not alone in disdaining bonds. The latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of global fund managers, released in late March, showed bonds to be the second-least-favorite of 22 asset classes -- behind only British stocks -- relative to how managers have rated them throughout the survey's 17-year history.
Bond funds and domestic and international stock funds all fell in the first quarter, though not by that much. The average taxable bond fund declined 0.5 percent, according to Morningstar, led lower by portfolios specializing in longer-term issues.
The average domestic stock fund fell 0.4 percent, with consumer defensive and natural resources groups faring worse than most and technology being one of the few clear winners, up 6 percent. International funds declined 0.3 percent, although specialists in China and Latin America recorded gains.
With interest rates rising, stock market valuations still high and protectionist impulses threatening to ignite a full-blown trade war, advisers encourage investors to indulge protectionist impulses of a different sort when it comes to their portfolios. They recommend keeping less money in stocks or being more selective about the ones investors own.
"You're better off investing pretty much anywhere other than the U.S.," Mr. Inker said about stocks, although he prefers Treasury bonds to foreign bonds.
The only type of investment he recommends outright, rather than in comparison to others that he deems even worse, is "the cheap half of emerging" markets, in particular technology stocks in places like Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia.
"Other than emerging market value, we don't see assets that deserve to go up a lot," he said.
Citi's analysts prefer emerging markets and Europe, where stocks are cheaper and central banks are doing more to prop up the markets. Mr. Levkovich counters that stocks are cheaper abroad for good reasons: American businesses have higher returns on equity, and American benchmark stock indexes are heavier in technology and lighter in the financial industry.
Mr. Levkovich recommended that investors prune their portfolios to enhance return prospects. In particular, he would be cautious on tech and usually defensive areas like utilities, consumer staples and telecoms, and emphasize traditional industrial companies and the materials industry, including chemical producers.
Mr. Yardeni remains optimistic about stocks, but he's in no hurry to buy.
"You have to recognize that if you're thinking of buying stocks, you're not exactly getting in early," he said. "We could have a shakeout here until we get clarity on protectionism."
His advice is to be patient in the likelihood that stocks can be bought at lower prices. When the time feels right, he said, he would look at exporters and other companies that would be on the front lines in a trade war, which he expects to be averted.
"You're probably going to find some good opportunities in blue-chip stocks with exposure to tariff issues," Mr. Yardeni said. But for now, he cautioned, risks in the market have risen.
"This probably will turn out to be a panic attack, like before," he said, "but it has the potential to be a more serious correction than we've had in some time."

Full text: It was a rough first quarter for bonds, which fell in value amid fears that inflation, the archnemesis of fixed-income investors, was coming back into the picture.
The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund and the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond fund each lost 1.5 percent in the quarter. Much of the loss occurred at exactly the wrong time.
Instead of rallying when stocks were falling -- typically the case for the last three decades -- bonds merely managed to lose less than stocks. When the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 10 percent from late January to early February, the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate U.S. Bond index fell more than 1 percent.
And then there was the latest bond-bashing from Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. In his annual shareholder letter in early March, Mr. Buffett said the assumption that bonds were a worthy risk damper for long-term investors was "a terrible mistake." In 2012, he wrote: "Today's bond portfolios are, in effect, wasting assets." And in 2011, the message was: "Right now bonds should come with a warning label."
It's not profitable to argue with Mr. Buffett about the markets. He is right, of course. The return prospects for bonds aren't particularly appealing today. That's because low bond yields reduce the odds that you will earn a return that keeps pace with inflation in coming years. And with the Federal Reserve pushing its target interest rate higher, bond prices are likely to suffer. (When rates rise, bond prices fall. A bond fund's total return is the sum of the interest paid plus changes in bond prices.)
But Mr. Buffett is a singular investor, one with deep pockets and an extremely long-term perspective, and he has an excellent track record of exploiting market sell-offs. Most people aren't like that.
"While Warren Buffett might be able to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy, most of us just follow the herd," said Allan Roth, founder of the Wealth Logic financial advisory firm. "Bonds provide liquidity and courage when stocks are falling."
Bonds can be a boon for any investor who needs help in the courage department. "You own bonds to reduce volatility, not to earn a return," says Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer at the Gerstein Fisher financial advisory firm.
Moreover, what concerns Mr. Buffett are the poor prospects for long-term bonds, especially given their current low yields. He routinely points out that a 30-year Treasury bond is the wrong place to be when rates are rising, as they have been lately.
"Pensions and institutions that need to match their long-term liabilities with an asset use 30-year bonds. But most investors don't have that problem. Nobody owns them," said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.
According to Morningstar Direct, $59 billion is invested in long-term bond funds and exchange-traded funds (defined as portfolios with average durations above six years). But that total is dwarfed by the more than $1.5 trillion invested in intermediate-term portfolios (3.5- to six-year average duration), which include core bond funds hewing to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index. Another $431 billion is invested in short-term portfolios (one- to 3.5-year average duration).
Duration is a measure of sensitivity to changing interest rates; the longer the duration, the more the price of a bond will fall when rates rise. For example, Dodge & Cox Income fund, with a duration of around four years, lost 0.9 percent in the first quarter. Vanguard Long-Term Bond Index fund, with a duration of more than 15 years, lost 3.75 percent.
Ms. Jones points out that from a low yield of 1.38 percent in July 2016, the 10-year Treasury note now yields nearly 3 percent. "We are in a bond bear market," she said. But that's nothing like a stock bear market.
Since July 2016, the average intermediate bond fund has managed to post flat performance as higher yields have offset price declines. Shorter-term portfolios have eked out a small gain. On an inflation-adjusted basis, bond funds have negative returns over that stretch. A stock bear market, by contrast, doesn't begin until stocks have fallen at least 20 percent.
Still, core bond funds' struggles have been unsettling. And with a strong-enough economy spurring the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, bond investors may need to reduce expectations.
Last quarter may well have been the start of bad times for bonds. Peter Chiappinelli, a member of the asset allocation team at GMO, points out that bonds moving in the same downward direction as stocks "has happened before and will happen again. That bonds are a dampener is not preordained by God," Mr. Chiappinelli said. "As we saw in the '70s and '80s, there are times when stocks and bonds can have a positive correlation," he said, meaning those assets can move in the same direction.
At the same time, the benchmark Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate is ratcheting up its risk. The duration of the index has increased from around 3.5 years in 2008 to six years today as the composition of the index shifted in response to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Treasury bonds, which tend to have longer durations, now represent more than one-third of the index compared with 22 percent in 2007. And corporations have spent the last decade issuing longer-term bonds to take advantage of low interest rates.
Mr. Chiappinelli said investing in a portfolio that is increasing its duration when interest rates "were at historic lows is the exact opposite of prudence."
Moreover, Treasuries are quite sensitive to rate increases, and Ms. Jones found that the credit quality of the corporate bonds in the index had decreased since the financial crisis.
"We tend to talk about owning the aggregate index as a core, and then adding some risk around it. Well, now might be a time to keep your core but add some less risky bonds," Ms. Jones said.
Funds that own high-quality bonds with shorter durations, such as Fidelity Short-Term Bond, can help reduce your portfolio's sensitivity to rising rates. Or you might want to consider a wholesale shift to shorter duration funds.
"Shorten up your entire bond portfolio to two or three years and you could probably afford to own fewer bonds and increase your stocks," Mr. Fisher said. His expectation is that the overall volatility of a portfolio 30 percent in short-term bonds and 70 percent in stocks is going to be on par with one that is 40 percent invested in a fund tracking the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index and 60 percent in stocks.
Mr. Roth recommends owning a laddered series of federally insured five-year certificates of deposit as a bond proxy. Online banks now offer five-year C.D.s yielding 2.5 percent or more.
Ms. Jones favors funds that hold floating-rate bonds -- whose yields adjust when interest rates change -- as a way of coping with the current environment. Ms. Jones suggests sticking with floating-rate funds that invest in high-quality bonds, such as the iShares Floating Rate Bond E.T.F. It has an average duration of less than one year and yields nearly 2 percent.
To combat inflation, you might want to add a fund that invests in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, such as Vanguard Inflation Protected Securities.
"I don't know what the return of bonds will be, and I am not suggesting it will be as good as the past 17 years, but I do expect the volatility of bonds relative to stocks to stay the same," Mr. Roth said.
Unless you are as patient and prescient as Mr. Buffett, owning a slug of less-volatile bonds can help you stick to a long-term investing strategy when stocks fall.

Fed Expresses Concerns Over Trade and Tax Cuts

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board policymakers raised concerns at their March meeting about the prospect of the United States heading into a global trade war, zeroing in on potential harm to American farmers such a clash would cause, according to minutes of the meeting released by the Fed on Wednesday.
The officials also expressed uncertainty about how newly enacted tax cuts would affect the economy, partly because the cuts are expected to exacerbate the swelling of federal budget deficits, and because some of the cuts are to expire in the years ahead. Policymakers also expressed unanimous, increased confidence in the strength of the country's economic recovery, even accounting for trade and tax uncertainties.
The minutes of the meeting, on March 20 and 21, provide more detail into the concerns being raised by the farm industry about the potential domestic impact of President Trump's plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
"Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook," the minutes read, "but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation."
Fed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output "a significant boost" in the next few years.
However, the minutes reflect officials' uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers "suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook."
The meeting was the first under the Fed's new chairman, Jerome H. Powell. At the session's conclusion, officials announced that they would raise interest rates for the sixth time since the end of the Great Recession, in the range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Officials released economic projections indicating that they expected to raise rates three times next year, more than the two increases in 2019 that they had forecast in December. The Fed said at the time the economy was continuing to get stronger and that the central bank remained on track to keep raising rates gradually. Mr. Powell echoed those sentiments at a news conference after the meeting.
The minutes suggest that decision on interest rates generated little controversy: "All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months," and that they expected the annual inflation rate to rise in the months to come.
But the minutes say that a "couple of participants" suggested the Fed would benefit from holding off until a future meeting to raise rates, in order to wait for more data to confirm evidence that the rate of inflation was approaching the Fed's target of 2 percent annual growth.
Officials also debated the benefits of the economy's running hot -- with unemployment very low and growth above forecast trends -- for a prolonged period of time, weighing the potential for drawing more workers back to the labor force against the risk of financial instability and "significant" inflation growth.
Officials seemed to shrug off the increase in stock market volatility in February, attributing it in part to Labor Department reports that the suggested growth in wages -- and, with it, inflation -- was gaining steam, which could force the Fed to raise rates faster than expected. "Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month's turbulence in stride," the minutes read.
The official statement released immediately after the March meeting did not mention trade policy concerns, which roiled financial markets after the Trump administration announced its plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as on some other Chinese goods. Mr. Powell acknowledged those concerns at his news conference, saying that trade policy had begun to worry business leaders who speak with Fed officials. Still, he played down any immediate threat to growth.
"There's no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook," Mr. Powell said at the news conference, adding that could change if a global trade dispute escalated.
In a speech in Chicago last week, Mr. Powell elaborated on the Federal Open Market Committee's concerns during a question-and-answer session.
"The discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now," he said. "And people really don't see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don't know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be."
Any negative effects from tariffs could put the Fed in a bind, forcing policymakers to break what Mr. Powell and his predecessors have repeatedly characterized as a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and job creation, and holding inflation to the target growth rate. Economists generally view tariff fallout as stagflationary, meaning it hurts growth and also feeds inflation. Taxes on imported goods raise prices for businesses and consumers, pushing up the inflation rate, while also dampening consumption and economic growth.
The minutes suggest that Fed officials are worrying more about that possibility than they have acknowledged publicly: "Most participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk," the minutes say.

Full text: Companies including banks and technology and health care firms fell Wednesday after U.S. stocks had surged the day before. Oil prices hit a three-year high after President Donald trump tweeted that the U.S. will launch missiles at targets in Syria.
Other than energy companies, stocks were slightly lower for most of the day. Banks slipped along with interest rates while health care and technology companies gave up some of the big gains they made on Tuesday. Trump said the U.S. will respond to the recent suspected chemical attack and Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles fired by rebels in Yemen. Fighting in the Middle East could restrict oil supplies and push prices higher.
The Federal Reserve released minutes from its meeting in March. Some policymakers felt the central bank may have to increase rates more quickly in response to faster economic growth and rising inflation, and it might have to focus on slowing the economy to keep inflation under control. The market didn't react dramatically to that development, but stock indexes trailed off in the afternoon.
Simona Mocuta, senior economist for State Street Global Advisors, said it's a challenge for investors to respond to events like possible strikes in Syria because it's not clear what the outcomes will be.
"There is so much uncertainty about the geopolitics that it's hard for the market even to price on a day-to-day basis," she said.
The S&P 500 index fell 14.68 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,642.19 after it surged 1.7 percent Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 218.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 24,189.45. The Nasdaq composite lost 25.27 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,069.03. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 3.36 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,546.70, and most of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange finished higher.
Facebook stock continued to rise as CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress for a second day. The stock surged Tuesday afternoon at the beginning of Zuckerberg's testimony. It rose 0.8 percent to $166.32 Wednesday after a jump of 4.5 percent Tuesday, its biggest gain in two years.
Daniel Ives, head of technology research for GBH Insights, said Facebook rallied for two reasons. One is that Zuckerberg did well in his testimony after investors had their doubts about how he would perform on Capitol Hill. The other is that Wall Street felt many members of Congress weren't very tough on Facebook because they don't grasp some of the relevant issues. As a result, investors grew less worried that the government will crack down on Facebook and other technology companies.
"A lot of the regulators and politicians don't really understand Facebook and its (business) model, so how can you expect that regulation is going to be a near-term issue?" he said. "The political theater and grandstanding has actually worked to the benefit of Facebook and Zuckerberg rather than to its detriment."
Facebook's stock is still down 10 percent since the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal broke in mid-March. Other social media companies also rallied over the past two days. Snap, the parent of Snapchat, rose 2.2 percent, to $14.80. Twitter slipped 0.5 percent to $29.39 after a 5.4 percent gain Tuesday.
Energy companies rose as benchmark U.S. crude climbed 2 percent to $66.82 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 1.4 percent to $72.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices jumped more than 3 percent Tuesday as investors got more optimistic about a possible resolution to the U.S.-China trade spat.
Overseas markets mostly fell following their gains the day before. Germany's DAX lost 0.8 percent and the CAC 40 in France dropped 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.1 percent lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index lost 0.5 percent and the Kospi in South Korea declined 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 0.6 percent.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.78 percent from 2.80 percent. That put pressure on banks. When bond yields fall, it forces interest rates on mortgages and other kinds of loans lower, meaning lower profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.7 percent to $110.62 and Bank of America declined 1.9 percent to $29.90.
Medical and security imaging equipment maker Analogic agreed to be bought by Altaris Capital Partners for $84 a share, or $1.05 billion. That was much less than investors had hoped for and the stock dropped 13.2 percent to $83.35. Analogic spiked from about $84 in March to as much as $96 a share Tuesday. Analogic noted that the stock price was lower than that when the company announced it would consider a sale.
The dollar dipped to 106.95 yen from 107.17 yen. The euro hardly budged as it rose to $1.2362 from $1.2361.
In other commodity trading, gold rose 1 percent to $1,360 an ounce. Silver also rose 1 percent to $16.77 an ounce. Copper lost 0.6 percent to $3.12 a pound.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1.3 percent to $2.07 a gallon and heating oil added 1.4 percent to $2.09 a gallon Natural gas edged up 0.7 percent to $2.68 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text: Russia paid a price in the financial markets on Monday for its standoff with the West.
Investors dumped Russian stocks, bonds and the ruble in the face of new American sanctions and signs of cracks in the relationship between President Trump and Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's president.
The sell-off left Russian stocks down more than 8 percent and sharply raised borrowing costs for some of the country's most important companies. The ruble dropped more than 4 percent against the dollar, and the price of government bonds fell.
The combined effect is that life will be at least a bit more expensive for Russian companies and consumers.
It was one of the worst days for Russia's markets since its 2014 annexation of Crimea, and the rout underscored a simple fact: While Mr. Putin has been able to reassert his country as a force to be reckoned with on the world political stage, it is economically isolated and faces risks to its long-term prosperity.
"We're still dealing with an economy that is run by an authoritarian regime that is very dependent on global oil and oil prices," said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "There's a lot of downside, and most of it is geopolitical."
Of course, none of this is a grave threat to the Russian economy, or to Mr. Putin, as long as oil prices -- up roughly 25 percent over the last year -- remain relatively high.
Since Russia's military involvement in Ukraine four years ago, relations with the West have corroded to their worst level since the Cold War.
Late last month, the United States joined with European Union members to expel scores of Russian diplomats in a coordinated response to the poisoning of a former Kremlin spy in England. Britain blamed Moscow for the attack, which potentially exposed more than a hundred people to a nerve agent in the city of Salisbury.
On Friday, the United States imposed sanctions on seven of Russia's richest men as well as 17 government officials, taking aim at the oligarchs who dominate the economy. The sanctions were a response to a series of aggressions, including interference in the 2016 presidential election.
Then on Sunday, after a deadly chemical attack, Mr. Trump took a rare swipe at Mr. Putin for his support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.
"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. "President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad."
A tweet might appear minor, but it signaled to investors that Russia is likely to remain at risk of further sanctions.
"Anyone who had hopes that sanctions might be lifted, it's not happening," said William Jackson, the senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
Despite Moscow's rancorous relationship with the United States and Europe, investors have tiptoed back into Russian stocks and bonds over the last year, as the economy proved resilient to the raft of sanctions in recent years.
Inflation, which surged after the sharp drop in the ruble in 2014, has declined. After shrinking in 2015 and 2016, the Russian economy grew a modest 1.5 percent last year, thanks to rising global prices for oil. (The oil and gas sector accounts for an estimated 25 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Goldman Sachs.)
The new round of sanctions jeopardizes those gains.
Companies targeted by the latest round of American sanctions suffered some of the sharpest drops Monday. The shares of United Company Rusal, one of the world's largest aluminum producers, fell more than 20 percent. The company was included in the Treasury Department's sanctions.
The stock sell-off spread to large Russian banks, with Sberbank tumbling 17 percent and VTB 9 percent.
The widespread nature of the rout -- battering companies not directly controlled by the Kremlin and roiling the normally resilient bond markets -- is a sign of how nervous investors suddenly are about Russia's prospects, especially the possibility of sanctions targeting a wider range of people and companies.
"It is very hard to evaluate who is going to be included on the list in the future, if this happens again," said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets in Moscow. "Russia country risk has increased quite substantially."

After delay, release of annual U.S. budget forecast.
The Congressional Budget Office will release its annual Budget and Economic Outlook on Monday afternoon, revealing 10-year projections on a variety of economic indicators including growth rates and the national debt. The report was delayed by several months because of the tax cut legislation approved by Congress late last year. The budget office needed additional time so that it could more accurately assess the effects of the new law.
The figures from the budget office will be closely watched and compared with the economic projections that have been made by the Trump administration. Most economists have concluded that Mr. Trump's projections are overly optimistic, and the report from the nonpartisan budget office will most likely underscore that point. Alan Rappeport
ECONOMY
China's president will speak on economic reforms.
China's president, Xi Jinping, will address the Boao Forum in the southern Chinese island province of Hainan on Tuesday. Mr. Xi is expected to unveil new reforms, including economic measures, something he has highlighted as a priority. The forum, which has positioned itself as an Asian rival to Europe's World Economic Forum in Switzerland, will include panels and discussions with business leaders like the Indian tycoon Ratan Tata, of Tata Sons, and Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba. A handful of foreign leaders will also be there, including Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, and Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong. The forum, with the theme, "An Open and Innovative Asia for a World of Greater Prosperity," begins on Sunday and finishes up on Wednesday. Alexandra Stevenson
TECHNOLOGY
Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress.
Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, will face two days of congressional hearings over the company's mishandling of user data. Facebook said the sensitive data of an estimated 87 million of its users had been improperly harvested by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which was connected to the Trump campaign. Mr. Zuckerberg's marathon testimonies on Capitol Hill will begin on Tuesday at 2:15 p.m. with a joint hearing by the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees. An estimated 44 members of those committees will take turns asking questions of the 33-year-old executive. Then on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee at 10 a.m. for further questions. Cecilia Kang
ECONOMY
Meeting minutes will reveal Fed's thinking.
The Federal Reserve last month raised interest rates for the sixth time since the financial crisis 10 years ago. On Wednesday, the Fed will provide a clearer picture of what led to that decision when it releases minutes from its March meeting, Jerome Powell's first as Fed chairman. Investors will be looking for hints that policymakers have become more concerned about inflation, which could lead the Fed to raise rates faster than currently expected. The minutes could also reveal how Mr. Powell and his colleagues view recent trade tensions, although the meeting preceded the most recent round of tariff announcements. Ben Casselman Inflation probably rose in March.
The unusual combination of tax cuts, government spending increases and low unemployment has touched off fears in recent months that the American economy may begin to overheat. So far, those concerns have been largely theoretical -- inflation has mostly stayed below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Data released by the Labor Department on Wednesday, however, will most likely show that consumer prices rose 2.4 percent in March from a year earlier, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That increase would result partly from a decline in prices last March. But it could nonetheless rattle investors who are already jittery after last week's market turmoil. Ben Casselman
GOVERNMENT
Mick Mulvaney faces questions on consumer agency.
Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget as well as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday, taking questions from members of both the House and the Senate. He will be discussing his work at the consumer bureau, where he has been moonlighting since late last year. The questions from Democrats are expected to get testy, because Mr. Mulvaney is a longtime critic of the consumer bureau. He has been conducting an extensive review of all of its rules, essentially bringing much of the agency's work to a standstill, while calling on staff to enforce regulations with "humility." Alan Rappeport
TRADE
Trump hopes to bring early Nafta deal to summit.
President Trump will travel to the Summit of the Americas, to be held on Friday and Saturday in Lima, Peru, where he was expected to meet with heads of state from Canada and Mexico. Some Trump administration trade advisers have indicated that they hope the three countries can announce a preliminary deal on the North American Free Trade Agreement at the event, though that outcome would hinge on continuing talks among the countries. Ana Swanson
BANKING INDUSTRY
Big banks start reporting first-quarter earnings.
The first three of the country's biggest banks will report quarterly earnings on Friday, giving the public its first look at the big banks' business since President Trump's tax reforms became law. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo will reveal their results, which analysts think could reflect a boost from the wild swings in the prices of stocks and other assets in February and March.

London Is on Track to See Its Highest Level of Violence in More Than a Decade

Full text: LONDON -- One teenager was caught in the crossfire of a drive-by attack. Another was shot in the face. They died within 24 hours of each other.
Two days later, another teenager and a burglary suspect were fatally stabbed and a man was beaten to death in what appeared to have been a late-night brawl outside a betting shop.
On Thursday, five teenagers were stabbed in an hour and a half before sunset, including a boy of 13.
All these attacks took place in London over the past week, part of an apparent spike in violence in the British capital. After a long period of steady declines in violent crime, the city has averaged in excess of three killings a week so far this year.
More than 50 people have been killed in London since the start of 2018. The total for all of 2017, a year when the city suffered multiple deadly terrorist attacks, was 116.
Criminologists have expressed caution about drawing conclusions from only a few months' figures, but if the uptick continues, it will amount to London's highest level of violence in more than a decade.
A year with 200 homicides, for a city of more than 8.5 million people, would be far from a shocking high in the United States. New York City, with a roughly comparable population size, had 292 murders last year, according to the 2018 Police Commissioner's Report, and that was a record low. In Britain, however, the prospect has been enough to alarm politicians and command newspaper front pages.
Analysts say that the surge in violent crime has been driven by several factors, including rivalries between drug gangs, cuts to youth services and social programs, and even the ease with which teenagers can now taunt and provoke one another on social media.
"It is difficult to address the causes of violence without addressing important social questions about the choices facing young people in terms of opportunities," said Roger Grimshaw, the research director at the Center for Crime and Justice Studies in London.
David Lammy, a lawmaker for the north London district of Tottenham, which has been hit hard by violent crime in recent weeks, said there was not one single cause for the surge, but that drug gangs were a major factor.
"What drives the gangs and the turf wars is an 11 billion pound cocaine drugs market," he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's "Today" program. Eleven billion pounds is about $15.5 billion.
"Drugs are prolific," Mr. Lammy added. "They're as prolific as ordering a pizza. You can get them on Snapchat, WhatsApp. That, in the end, is driving the turf war; and it's driving the culture of violence."
He suggested that the police had lost control of the drugs market, which he said was largely controlled by Eastern European gangs. Gangs increasingly use children and teenagers to carry drugs around the country, making them potential casualties in fighting between groups.
Most of the killings in London so far have been stabbings, most apparently carried out by young people. A majority of the victims were in their 20s or younger, and many have been black or from ethnic minorities.
Mr. Grimshaw warned that sudden increases in crime could cause a type of "contagion" among communities. "If a sufficient number of people feel frightened, they can look on knife-carrying as a way to make themselves feel safe, but it actually makes them less safe," he said.
Knife crime in Britain rose by 21 percent last year, and stabbings in London were at their highest level in six years, according to figures released in September by the Office for National Statistics, which compiles an authoritative survey of crime in England and Wales.
A current government poster campaign in some parts of London promotes the virtues of "living knife free," linking to a website with a "quick close" button for those ashamed or afraid to be seen viewing it.
This past week, the Metropolitan Police promised a new task force of specially selected, dedicated police officers to focus on "violent crime, weapon-enabled crime and serious criminality."
"You will see us being even more proactive out on the streets," the force's leader, Commissioner Cressida Dick, said in a statement. "We will have a greater presence in the hot spots of violence and a focused effort, including intelligence-led stop-and-search and the use of specialists in covert tactics."
Commissioner Dick told Sky News on Friday that 300 more officers would be deployed each day on the streets of London.
The increased use of stop-and-frisk tactics, reduced in London and elsewhere in Britain in recent years, has been a frequent demand of some Conservative lawmakers and other critics in the face of shocking crime reports.
But some community workers and politicians argue that would be counterproductive, damaging trust in the police in deprived areas without necessarily finding many weapons.
"Random stop-and-search has poisoned relationships between the police and the community," Diane Abbott, the home affairs spokeswoman of the opposition Labour Party, told the BBC. "In the end, we need the cooperation of the community to deal with the issues."
Some experts say that increased police patrols are also unlikely to deter crime, although they may help to reassure communities.
The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has blamed central government cuts in the policing budget for the rise in crime; police budgets in England and Wales have been cut by an average of 20 percent, accounting for inflation, since 2010.
"Since 2014, we have seen an increase in violent crime in London and across the country," Mr. Khan said in an interview with the Press Association news agency. "Since I first became mayor, I have been saying to the government that it's not sustainable to make the level of cuts they have been making to London."
Steve O'Connell, the chairman of the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee, said that while the Metropolitan Police deserved better funding, it still had the resources to deal with the recent spate of violent crime.
"They are taking this very seriously, but it's much more complicated that just arresting people," he said in a phone interview. "We need to get to the root cause of why so many young men use knives to settle their differences and why they are willing to inflict serious damage on people."
"Once we understand this," he continued, "we need to make sure these people are taken off the street and put away for a long time."

Full text: The rapidly escalating trade conflict with China has upended the prevailing economic dynamic of falling unemployment and faster growth, leaving policymakers and investors scrambling to figure out the way forward.
The threat of a trade war loomed over Jerome H. Powell's inaugural speech as Federal Reserve chairman on Friday in Chicago, even as he tried to focus attention on the fundamental strength of the American economy. Financial markets fell Friday morning after President Trump's latest salvo against China, then tumbled further after Mr. Powell indicated that the Fed saw no imminent need to adjust its outlook. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the day down 2.2 percent, closing a turbulent week.
And there was uncertainty in Washington, where lawmakers, lobbyists and even White House officials struggled to discern how much of Mr. Trump's move was policy and how much was bluster.
The president acknowledged that the trade friction could take a toll. "I'm not saying there won't be a little pain," he said in a radio interview on Friday. "But we're going to have a much stronger country when we're finished."
The concern over trade was evident at Mr. Powell's appearance before the Economic Club of Chicago. The Fed chief did not mention tariffs in his speech, but in a question-and-answer session afterward, they were the first topic raised.
The Fed chief, who took his post in February, said it was "too early to say" what impact the dueling trade measures would have. "We don't know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be," Mr. Powell said. But he made it clear that the Fed would watch closely for any sign that the trade dispute was knocking the recovery off course.
The trade tensions complicate what was already a tricky task for the Fed. Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts and spending increases risk fueling inflation, as do wage pressures from a robust labor market. The government's monthly jobs report on Friday, while more subdued than in recent months, still pointed to a healthy employment picture.
Yet policymakers are wary of acting too aggressively to slow the economy at a time when wage growth has been tepid. The Fed's response has been gradual interest-rate increases.
A trade war could act as a drag on economic growth, forcing the Fed to be even more cautious. But tariffs could also raise consumer prices by limiting cheap imports from China and other countries. That could increase the risk that the Fed will lift rates too quickly, choking off the recovery.
"There's an immediate, knee-jerk reaction to tighten policy more," said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley.
The latest escalation between the United States and China came Thursday evening, when Mr. Trump said he was considering tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese imports. That came on top of the tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed last month and those on $50 billion in Chinese goods that he proposed in recent days. China has responded with its own new tariffs.
It is not clear whether Mr. Trump will make good on his latest threats. Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump's new top economic adviser, has sought to portray the tariffs as an opening bid in a negotiating process with China, and he told reporters on Friday that "there are all kinds of back-channel discussions going on."
But Mr. Trump's Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, indicated that tensions had reached a more combustible level. "There is the potential of a trade war," Mr. Mnuchin said Friday on CNBC. "There is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war."
The trade upheaval threatens to undermine an American economy that is at its strongest point since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. Employers have added jobs for 90 consecutive months, by far the longest streak on record; the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000.
"The labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong," Mr. Powell said on Friday, referring to the Fed's policy group.
Wage growth, weak for much of the recovery, ticked up in March, and Mr. Powell said he expected the gains to continue in the months ahead. And while workers would, without a doubt, like to see their pay rise more quickly, the gradual pace is comforting for some investors, who have been watching for any hints that the economy is overheating.
In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw "other signs of economic strength," citing "steady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence," which he said would continue to support consumer spending.
Other economists agreed, saying that the recently passed tax and spending measures give the economy added momentum. A full-blown trade war might be enough to short-circuit the recovery, they said, but isolated tariffs -- even large ones -- most likely are not.
Certain categories are more vulnerable. Among the retaliatory moves announced by China are new tariffs on soybeans, which could hurt American farmers already struggling with low prices for their crops.
The nation's factories, a sector that Mr. Trump has championed, have become a bright spot in the recovery -- a development Mr. Powell underlined on his Chicago visit by touring an incubator for industrial start-ups. But Mr. Trump's tariffs could force manufacturers to pay more for materials, and China's countermeasures could hurt their overseas sales.
Just the prospect of tariffs -- even before they begin to take a direct bite -- could hurt the economy if it makes corporate executives reluctant to invest.
Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm, said she was already hearing from clients that they are more hesitant to commit to major projects, at least until they see whether this week's skirmishes develop into an all-out trade war.
"We're not seeing the impact directly of tariffs yet, but we would say there's pretty broad conservatism as a result," she said.
Mr. Powell said Fed policymakers, too, were conscious of concerns from corporate executives.
"We did hear from a number of business leaders around the country that changes in trade policy had become a bit of a risk to the medium-term outlook," Mr. Powell said in the question-and-answer session.
Continued turmoil in financial markets could begin to hurt spending, especially among higher earners, who are more likely to own stocks. Ms. Zentner said surveys suggested that some high-income consumers had already become more pessimistic as markets have become more volatile.
"It's starting to affect those groups, whose spending is more tied to the stock market," Ms. Zentner said. "If they simply pause their spending or become more prudent in their spending because of market volatility, it drags down consumer spending in the aggregate."
The effect of all this on the Fed's thinking won't be clear until the next policy meeting on May 1 and 2. Fed officials raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at their most recent meeting, in March, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Officials indicated that they considered the economy and labor market healthy, and that they expected to raise rates twice more this year and three times in 2019.
Mr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. But he also cautioned that policymakers could change course if necessary.
"Our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook," Mr. Powell said. "If the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans -- one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation."

Full text: Although an American college degree remains a good investment on average -- the higher earnings for most graduates justify the cost -- millions of borrowers are in default on their loans.
Policy analysts generally agree on a need for reform, but not on which path policymakers should take. Can America learn anything from other nations? We gathered experts with a range of perspectives, from the United States and abroad, and asked them to compare the systems in Australia, Britain, Sweden and the United States.
We chose this grouping of nations because they highlight important differences both in loan repayment systems and in related policies such as tuition and loan limits, not necessarily because they all belong among the best systems in the world. In the spirit of March Madness, we devised a bracket-style tournament, seeding the countries so that those with more similar systems would meet in the semifinals.
Sweden vs. United States
Sweden and the United States differ in whether the monthly loan payment remains the same over time and in the number of years borrowers can repay their loans.
The average American borrower with a bachelor's degree leaves college with $28,400 in debt. Students can borrow for both tuition and living expenses, although loan limits make it hard for an undergraduate to borrow more than $45,000 over four years.
In Sweden, average debt levels are similar -- the equivalent of around $21,000 -- even though students borrow only for living expenses (Swedish universities do not charge tuition). Interest rates are also very low; the current rate is 0.6 percent.
In the United States, borrowers are required to begin making payments six months after leaving college. By default, payments are set so the whole principal and interest, which is tied to the market rate at the time the loan is made (currently 4.45 percent), will be paid off in equal monthly installments paid over 10 years.
American borrowers can opt into alternative repayment plans, including plans that tie payments to income or that start lower and increase over time. Income-based plans offer forgiveness of any remaining balance after 10 to 25 years, but enrolling in these plans requires making a request to the servicer and filing paperwork annually. If you miss the paperwork, you are put back into a 10-year repayment schedule, but can ask to re-enroll. There are a large number of plans that are hard for borrowers to navigate, especially in times of financial stress.
Swedish borrowers, on the other hand, pay off their loans over a much longer period. Borrowers can be in repayment for up to 25 years, with the typical borrower paying for 22 years.
In Sweden, payments are automatically set so they increase by 2 percent each year. Borrowers can ask to reduce their payments to as low as 5 percent of income in cases of financial hardship, and any remaining debt is forgiven at age 68.
Our pick: Sweden (11-0)
Panelists generally saw Sweden's extended repayment window as an advantage.
"The shorter term in the U.S.A. means that low-earning graduates will always struggle and be at risk of default," said Lorraine Dearden, professor of economics and social statistics at University College London and a fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
Some panelists who chose Sweden noted that the automatic 2 percent annual increase in payment size in effect functions as an income-based system. "Borrowers pay less in the early years of their careers, when earnings are lowest and most variable," said Judith Scott-Clayton, an associate professor of economics and education at Teachers College, Columbia University.
Other experts appreciated the simplicity of Sweden's repayment system, especially compared with that of the United States.
"Sweden's system, while maybe costlier than necessary, offers a simpler and more manageable repayment process for students," said Kevin James, founder and chief executive of Better Future Forward. "In contrast, U.S. federal student loans offer a mishmash of subsidies and repayment plans that provide wholly inadequate protections to students relative to the money spent."
Some panelists did point out that Sweden's repayment policy benefits from the country's tuition-free college and low interest rates. This could, however, be a problem for larger goals of equity.
"The downside with Sweden actually lies outside the student aid system, in the way they charge zero tuition to a student body which is heavily tilted to the children of the upper middle class," said Alex Usher, president of Higher Education Strategy Associates in Canada. "With more targeting on fees, Sweden would be perfect."
Australia vs. Britain
In these countries, students take out loans in name only. The loans have principal and interest like regular loans, but must be repaid only if the borrower makes above a certain amount.
In both countries, payments are collected automatically through the tax system and adjust automatically with income -- similar to tax withholding in the United States. Students can also choose to pay for tuition up front, but 85 percent to 90 percent instead take out an income-contingent loan.
Most English universities charge the maximum-allowed tuition of the equivalent of about $12,900, and students can also borrow for living expenses. The average debt load after leaving a degree program is more than $60,000.
Australia has lower tuition levels, which range up to the equivalent of $8,300 per year depending on the course of study, and lower average borrowing ($23,500). Australian students are also limited to borrowing only for tuition, not living expenses.
In Britain, borrowers start making payments once they earn at least the equivalent of $29,000 a year, at which point they pay 9 percent of their income above this threshold. (This threshold is set to rise to $35,000 beginning this month -- subject to parliamentary approval.)
Australian borrowers do not start making payments until their income exceeds the equivalent of $44,000, although this threshold is set to fall to about $35,000 in 2018-19 to reduce the burden on the government and taxpayers amid warnings of rising costs. The percentage of income paid ranges from 4 percent to 8 percent depending on income, and it applies to all income, not just the amount above the threshold. The top rate may increase to 10 percent in 2018-19.
British borrowers pay an interest rate set at the inflation rate plus up to 3 percent, depending on income, whereas Australia sets the interest rate at the inflation rate for all borrowers.
Britain collects payments for up to 30 years, after which any remaining amount owed is forgiven. The typical borrower spends about 27 years in repayment. Australia collects payments as long as the borrower is living and making a sufficient income, but the typical borrower spends only nine years repaying the loans.
Our pick: Australia (8-3) [Sandy Baum, Mr. James and Ms. Scott-Clayton voted for Britain]
Simplicity is Britain's main advantage, according to several of our experts. Those who preferred the British system also cited the forgiveness provision and the ability to borrow for living expenses as important factors.
"The English system has the advantage of providing students with loans for living expenses, not just tuition," Ms. Scott-Clayton said. "This is an important feature for promoting equitable access to higher education."
Nicholas Barr, professor of public economics at the London School of Economics, who ultimately picked Australia, summarized the trade-offs, arguing that the "U.K. design is better in principle but the system in Australia works better in practice."
Mr. Barr pointed to some good design elements -- Britain's above-inflation interest rate and repayment based on income above a threshold -- but noted that the system is politically unpopular because of the high loan amounts.
Ms. Dearden thought Britain's interest rate was too high and likely to "disproportionately hit middle-earning graduates rather than rich graduates."
Panelists generally liked Australia's sliding-scale approach to the percentage of income paid toward student loans even though it adds a bit of complexity.
"If the Australian system is able to convey to potential students that the loan is income-contingent even though the exact repayment calculation is more complicated, then you're less likely to distort labor market decisions while still getting the benefits of using loans to increase access," said Bridget Terry Long, Saris professor of education and economics at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "Also, students finish repaying their loans a lot faster."
As in the first matchup, panelists also looked beyond repayment to the loan systems and the amount students are expected to borrow. "English tuition charges are excessive, and this contributes to the very large subsidies in that system, because a lot of the debt doesn't get repaid," said Bruce Chapman, professor of economics at Australian National University, as he cast his vote for Australia.
Sandy Baum, a fellow at the Urban Institute who ultimately chose Britain based on the availability of forgiveness and the use of an above-inflation interest rate, said, "In England, debt levels are too high, but that is about the pricing system and the lack of payments up front, not the loan repayment system."
Mr. Usher's conclusion echoed Mr. Barr's: "The U.K. system is exquisitely designed according to rationalist principles, but it commands almost no public respect."
Australia vs. Sweden (our pick: Australia, 11-0)
In unanimously choosing Australia, panelists agreed that automatic collection of income-based payments is a critical ingredient of a well-functioning loan system. "When borrowers have the choice to repay through their employer, this cuts out much of the red tape and the distorted incentives of middlemen," said Rohit Chopra, a senior fellow at Consumer Federation of America.
But that does not make the Australian system perfect. "The inability to borrow for any living expenses might lead to higher-cost credit card debt," Mr. Chopra added.
Lessons for the U.S.
Many of our panelists could not evaluate a loan repayment system without also considering the price of tuition or questions of access. There are big differences among the four countries beyond how students repay loans. Rethinking repayment is a start, but bigger changes to how students pay for college may be necessary.
Our panelists agreed that the best student loan repayment system is one that is simple, that is based on students' incomes, that spreads loan payments over longer periods and that's able to collect payments automatically through the tax system.
Such a system is a far cry from what's in place in the United States. In Australia, student loan default is rare. In the United States, the number of borrowers in default rises every year, even if the default rate falls, because defaulted borrowers are unlikely to return their loans to good standing. Beyond the individual pain this can cause, it has negative consequences for the economy.
In its recent spending bill, Congress passed a one-time $350 million forgiveness fund to smooth problems for some borrowers. The government has made strides over the years with income-based repayment plans, but the plans are so complicated that Mr. Chapman, our panelist from Australia, once tried to fill out applications as an experiment and "couldn't do it."
Democrats and Republicans share blame for a system that seems broken, and major reforms don't seem near. Maybe the first step is acknowledging that possible ideas for improvement don't stop at the border.
We're interested in what you have to say -- whether you're an American, or whether you've attended college abroad. In the comments section, tell us the best or worst feature of your country's system. And what advice would you give Americans?

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Steven Spielberg aced his test.
"Ready Player One," a nostalgia-soaked science-fiction adventure that marked a high-wire attempt by Mr. Spielberg, 71, to return to his crowd-pleasing roots, arrived to $53.2 million in ticket sales over the four-day Easter weekend in North America. Overseas audiences chipped in an additional $128 million, with Chinese ticket buyers turning out in particular force.
Those results, boosted by IMAX and other premium-priced, large-format screenings, easily make "Ready Player One" the No. 1 movie in the world. Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow spent at least $155 million to make the movie, which carried more than $100 million in global marketing costs.
Going into the weekend, box office analysts had feared that "Ready Player One" might arrive to as little as $38 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada. Its stars, Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, are not household names. Its story line -- teenagers in a dystopian future search for treasure inside a virtual-reality world called the Oasis -- was exceedingly difficult to explain in marketing materials, especially without resorting to spoilers.
And, as a non-sequel or remake, "Ready Player One" did not have a built-in fan base beyond readers of the 2011 novel by Ernest Cline from which it was adapted.
That essentially left "Ready Player One" resting on Mr. Spielberg's shoulders, a risky proposition even for a filmmaker of his stature: The original blockbuster king had not delivered a true blockbuster in a decade, not since "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" roared into domestic theaters in the summer of 2008 with $118 million in opening-weekend ticket sales, after adjusting for inflation.
Although Mr. Spielberg has found box office success in recent years with historical dramas like "The Post" and "Bridge of Spies," his would-be crowd-pleasers, including the motion-capture fantasies "The BFG" and "The Adventures of Tintin," have been ticket-selling disappointments. Even "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" was widely viewed as a misfire; longtime fans loathed the story, leaving that whip-cracking franchise on wobbly footing.
In contrast, "Ready Player One" drew the most positive audience response for any fantasy or science-fiction movie directed by Mr. Spielberg since "Minority Report" in 2005, according to Rotten Tomatoes, which boils down reviews from critics and ticket buyers into "fresh" or "rotten" scores. Critics also gave "Ready Player One" high marks, although some were annoyed by the source material's reliance on 1980s pop culture.
Paul Dergarabedian, a senior analyst at comScore, noted that ticket-buyer surveys conducted by PostTrak, a service operated by comScore and Screen Engine, showed "really, really high marks" for "Ready Player One" from teenagers and people in their late thirties. "This film has momentum," he said.
"Ready Player One," rated PG-13 and produced by a team that included Donald De Line, Kristie Macosko Krieger and Bruce Berman, was the first movie directed by Mr. Spielberg to arrive in the less-competitive spring since "The Sugarland Express" in 1974. Warner had initially scheduled "Ready Player One" for release in December but moved it to a safer spot after Disney unexpectedly dropped "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" on the same winter date.
Mr. Spielberg's godlike status in Hollywood was cemented long ago. He is, perhaps, the only director (or star) whose career is no longer impacted by ticket sales -- good, bad, mediocre. But the robust response to "Ready Player One" is meaningful for him nonetheless. If ticket sales continue to hold up in the weeks ahead -- and they should, given school spring breaks -- Mr. Spielberg will have given Warner Bros. what it wants most: a new franchise.
Mr. Cline is notably working on a sequel to his novel.
For the weekend in North America, "Tyler Perry's Acrimony" (Lionsgate) was second, collecting $17 million, a sturdy total for one of Mr. Perry's movies that does not feature Madea, his gunslinging granny. "Acrimony," a thriller starring Taraji P. Henson, cost less than $15 million to make.
Third place went to "Black Panther" (Disney), which took in about $11.3 million, for a seven-week domestic total of $650.7 million. "Black Panther" has taken in $1.27 billion worldwide.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: SILVER SPRING, Md. -- With forecasters expecting the unemployment rate to sink further this week, the chorus of complaints about worker shortages -- from custodians to computer prodigies -- has swelled.
Yet companies that turn to labor recruiters like Ray Wiley tend to have an especially tough time: The jobs they offer are in out-of-way places; the work is low-paid and disagreeable; and native-born Americans, particularly white men, are generally not interested.
"We have employers call us all the time," said Mr. Wiley, who primarily works with meat-processing plants and lumber mills that have trouble retaining workers even when the jobless rate is well above its historically low level of 4.1 percent.
The economy is on solid footing in the ninth year of the recovery, and even entry-level workers have more options. So in Atlanta, San Diego and other cities, Mr. Wiley's company, East Coast Labor Solutions, finds workers, primarily refugees from war-ravaged countries who don't speak English. Other candidates include Puerto Ricans discouraged by the island's lack of jobs, as well as immigrants -- here legally, he emphasizes -- who have no problem passing a drug test.
"If you told me there's 1,000 refugees who need work and want work, I could find them work this month," said Mr. Wiley, whose distinctive drawl pays tribute to his Georgia roots. Employers like refugees, he said. There is no question about their legal status, he noted, and they are generally more motivated and work harder, if only because their situation is more dire.

"I'm ready to go right now," said Ronald Johnson, 37, who showed up one afternoon with two friends at Labor Solutions' bare, second-floor office in Silver Spring, Md. He had heard from others in his community of Sierra Leone refugees that this agency could immediately place anyone willing to move to a nearby state. "I want to go where they pay the most money and charge the least for rent."
Within an hour, all three men agreed to move to a rural town they had never heard of, to take a job they had never done before.
Citing the need to protect national security and jobs, however, President Trump has moved to sharply limit legal immigrants and refugees, capping the number of refugees at 45,000, the lowest yearly total since the program began in 1975. The actual pace of admittance has so far fallen below that level, which could make it even harder for meat processors and similarly situated industries to fill their ranks.
"I appreciate what Trump is doing in trying to create more jobs for Americans," Mr. Wiley said, in response to the president's argument that immigrants are taking work from native-born Americans. "But for some lower-paid jobs that are undesirable, a lot of Americans don't want to do those jobs."
Of course they might, if the pay were good enough. When meatpackers were unionized and located in cities like Chicago, hourly wages averaged $20 an hour in today's dollars, plus generous benefits. In the 1960s, though, packers began moving to rural areas, bringing workers to where the animals lived instead of the other way around. The shift enabled companies to cut wages drastically, escape the pressures of collective bargaining and speed output.
The move from high-wage locations to low-wage ones has become commonplace as the economy globalized, upending stable middle-class communities.
In the international arena, companies like Carrier and Rexnord recently closed factories in the United States and moved operations to places like China, Vietnam and Mexico where labor could be found at cut-rate prices.
But long before complaints about the North American Free Trade Agreement or steel imports from China commanded headlines, a domestic version of this pattern was already playing out in some industries. And as the pay decreased, so did the face of the work force, once dominated by white males. Women, immigrants and people of color now hang chickens on hooks or hack them into parts on an assembly line. They are paid about half of what their counterparts earned four decades ago (after taking inflation into account), and have fewer benefits and protections. Such conditions don't foster long-term stability. In some plants, employers have to replace up to 70 percent of their staffs every year.
Reducing that churn has become harder as the unemployment rate has dropped and several cities have raised the minimum wage.
That's where Mr. Wiley comes in. His recruits come from parts of the globe like Africa and Mexico that President Trump has repeatedly disparaged. Some are new arrivals sleeping on a relative's couch; others are longtime residents struggling with low pay, high rents, long commutes or just a stretch of hard luck. He typically finds work for a few dozen a month.
"I'll take any job," said Suleiman Kabba, 42, who came to the Labor Solutions office in Silver Spring, a Washington suburb, with Mr. Johnson. He had recently moved to Maryland and was down to his last few dollars. He needed to save up to replace stolen identity documents and buy airline tickets to bring over his two children, still in Sierra Leone. He removed a pair of tinted glasses and pulled at the collar of his U.S.A. T-shirt to show the scars from a bullet that had traveled through his eye and out the left side of his neck when his family was attacked during the civil war there.
Haimonet Demcasso, the recruiter, explained, in two languages, the broad outlines of the jobs. The poultry-plant work pays roughly $11 to $13 an hour in small towns in Virginia and West Virginia. Labor Solutions would transport the recruits, find apartments for them to share, help fill out paperwork, and advance them the money to cover their travel, the first month's rent, the security deposit, heavy work boots and home essentials. They could pay it back out of their paychecks with no interest at a rate of $60 a week.
They are paid the same as other plant workers, but they are employees of Labor Solutions for up to a year, until they've repaid their loans.
More details about the job itself would come once they went through orientation at the plant, Ms. Demcasso said.
For Mr. Johnson, who had recently lost his job as a van driver and was already dodging calls from debt collectors, upfront money made the difference. "For me to rent an apartment, I need a boatload of money," he said.
His wife, Elizabeth, was more skeptical when she heard about the deal. An apartment and two jobs just waiting for them? Money up front? There were plenty of unscrupulous recruiters who made all kinds of promises and deceived trusting job seekers -- a cruel and sordid side of the industry that Mr. Wiley acknowledged is all too common.
"I was dragging my feet," Ms. Johnson said. But after coming up for a day to check the area and the classrooms her two children would attend in Woodstock, Va., she was convinced. "I loved the school just by looking at it," she said. Most important, she saw no signs of the drugs, violence and bullying that plagued the White Oak neighborhood of Silver Spring, where they were temporarily doubled up with family. "And there's no roaches and mice or rats."
Mr. Wiley said that when he started working with refugees, mostly Burmese, in 2008, he didn't offer money and support, but he soon realized that the job placements wouldn't last without it. Resettlement agency assistance was temporary and many job seekers didn't speak English. So he hired case managers to translate, help with school enrollment, drive recruits to the supermarket, find English classes and more.
Berhane Teklay, who once hung live chickens upside down in a plant, handles the 30 or so workers Mr. Wiley has placed in Woodstock.
Originally from Eritrea, Mr. Teklay arrived after winning a visa in the 2011 diversity lottery -- a program that the Trump administration recently vowed to shutter. This year, he became a United States citizen.
"You need somebody to help you get into the system," Mr. Teklay said, and that's what Labor Solutions does. For refugees who can't speak English well or drive a car, he said, a job in a meat-processing plant is about the best they can do.
Fluent in Arabic, Amharic, Tigrinya and English, Mr. Teklay acts as interpreter, administrator, real estate agent, loan office, complaint bureau and overall fixer.
For a year, he helped Waleed Kanuo, Elfadil Daoud and Ali Hamid, refugees from Sudan, settle into an apartment in Woodstock and navigate the system, until they transferred to working directly for the poultry-plant operator. Gathered in the living room of the sparsely furnished apartment they share, all three said they were saving money and grateful to Labor Solutions for finding them a job.
For others, the experience is more mixed.
Mr. Kabba, for instance, said he had not known that he would have to pay an additional $25 every week for the daily mile ride from a co-worker to and from the plant. Nor did he understand that he would be working for Labor Solutions and not the processing plant directly, which he said makes it more difficult to switch departments, and means he is not yet eligible for the health benefits or 401(k) plan.
At the same time, plant conditions are regimented and unforgiving, with 30 minutes for lunch and two 10-minute bathroom breaks that workers said don't include time to change out and into cumbersome protective garb. And small infractions can lead to firing.
But as a friend of Mr. Kabba's says, that's the way it is in America: They tell you all the sweet stuff, and not the salty. "It's a job," Mr. Kabba said of the $11.70-an-hour work, which pays a $1-an-hour bonus if he's on time every day of the week. "You can't pick and choose." And he loves Woodstock's quiet.
Teddy Marchant, 32, a former housemate of Mr. Kabba's, did not. Within a couple of days, he realized that the small town, without so much as a movie theater, wasn't for him. He needed the cash, he said, but "if I had my way, I don't think I'd be here." He soon left.
Ms. Johnson had time to check out the place but not the $11-an-hour job she was promised. "I had no idea of what I was going to see," she said.
When she walked into the plant, it was a shock. "Oh, my God, I saw chickens -- lots and lots and lots of chickens, 350,000 chickens a day," she said, still shaking her head at the looping conveyor belts crowded with birds. "If you scratch your face or bend down, you might miss a couple of chickens."
She clocked in at 5:30 a.m. and rotated hanging up the dead chickens, cleaning out guts and cutting off legs, wings and backs to ready the meat for packaging, she said.
It is physically demanding, repetitive and smelly, Ms. Johnson said.
A smell that her husband noted was also "the smell of money."
Mr. Johnson, who was born in Libya and lived in Sierra Leone before moving to the United States 16 years ago as a refugee, was initially the most enthusiastic about the job. In November, he was jogging with his children in the morning, thinking about getting a second job to build up savings, and dreaming about a music studio where he could compose and record the music that played endlessly through his head.
But by January, he was out of a job for a violation of the processing plant's policy. A couple months later, Ms. Johnson also left the plant after finding another local job.
The work is not for everyone, Mr. Wiley concedes. But he maintains that for many refugees, including Mr. Teklay, his Woodstock branch manager, it provides a foothold.
"They want the American dream, and they don't mind starting off on the bottom," he said. "There's a lot of unskilled work in the U.S. that Americans will not do, and these people are doing it."

What to Expect in Housing Market This Spring

Full text: This spring's home sales season is shaping up to be the most interesting one in years.
The housing market will depend on which opposing force proves more powerful: long-term fundamentals of supply and demand, or near-term ripples emanating from Washington and Wall Street.
Most evidence suggests that fundamentals will prevail over time and push sales and prices higher, especially at the lower and middle tiers of the market. But the opposing forces could mean a period of uncertain dealmaking. Higher mortgage rates and a new tax law will affect several elements of home buying.
Mortgage Rates Are Higher
This is the simplest to calculate. In mid-September, according to Freddie Mac, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.78 percent; in the most recent reading it hit 4.45 percent. It rose because global bond markets, which ultimately determine the rates on longer-term loans, judged that larger budget deficits and a faster-growing economy would result in higher inflation and more interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.
For a family resolving to pay $2,000 a month for a home mortgage and not a penny more, the math works out that they can afford to borrow $397,000 today, down from $430,000 in September.
The math around affordability is a little more complicated than that -- you must also consider the potential tax deductibility of mortgage interest and how much cash a buyer has available for a down payment.
The psychology around a rise in rates isn't necessarily straightforward either. A survey for the online brokerage Redfin -- involving 4,000 people who bought or sold a home last year or tried to do so -- found that 25 percent of respondents said a mortgage rate rise to 5 percent would have "no impact" on their home-buying plans.
Twenty-one percent said they would search with more urgency, fearing that prices would rise faster, while 27 percent said they would slow their search and wait to see if rates came back down. Only 21 percent said they would seek to buy a less expensive house.
"If shortage of inventory is a headwind for housing, mortgage rates are a gentle breeze by comparison," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.
The Tax Law Is Messy
The United States tax code subsidizes homeownership in ways large and small. (Whether those subsidies encourage greater homeownership or just drive up prices is a different matter.) But the tax law enacted in December reins in several of those advantages.
Most directly, the law reduces how much mortgage debt will benefit from tax-deductible interest payments; that number was previously $1 million and is now $750,000. Also, property taxes previously had no limits in being deductible against federal income tax, but now the deduction of property and other state and local taxes is capped at $10,000.
Both provisions will most affect upper- and upper-middle-income families in states with relatively high housing prices and high state and local taxes: Think Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California.
For example, a married couple in Connecticut with a $300,000 annual income aiming to borrow $1 million toward a $1.2 million house would be able to deduct about $33,000 in mortgage interest in the first year of their loan, compared with about $44,000 under the previous law. Because they would be in the 24 percent federal marginal tax bracket, buying that house would cost them about $2,650 more in the first year of the mortgage after taxes than under previous law.
Moreover, that family's state income tax obligations would push them over the $10,000 deductibility limit on their own, meaning the family would effectively lose the ability to deduct property taxes of around $22,000 a year, depending on the jurisdiction. That represents another reduction of this family's tax advantage from homeownership by about $5,000 a year.
(Our hypothetical family may not be losing out as much as those numbers suggest because they would have faced the alternative minimum tax under the old tax system -- evidence of just how complex these calculations can be.)
Even people whose mortgages are well below $750,000, or who are in lower-tax states, may find the tax law could shift the incentives for buying compared with renting. The new law roughly doubles the standard deduction that all households can take, to $24,000 for a married couple, which means that more households will find that they get no net tax savings from taking on a mortgage. They are better off just taking the larger standard deduction whether they buy or rent.
Over all, Moody's Analytics estimates that the tax law will reduce home transaction prices by 4 percent, a number that reflects both the direct impact of tax changes and higher interest rates caused by larger deficits.
But Mark Zandi, the company's chief economist, emphasizes that this reduction should play out over a couple of years, and that it is more likely to slow the rate of price gains rather than cut prices outright. For example, if prices were on track to rise 5 percent a year in 2018 and 2019, they might instead rise 3 percent a year.
"The tax law change and higher mortgage rates should moderate the prices buyers are able to pay," Mr. Zandi said. "I think the rate of house price growth will soften."
Supply and Demand Are Mismatched
Those developments on interest rates and tax policy seem likely to be drags on home buying. But they come amid a housing boom rooted in a major imbalance between the number of people looking to buy, especially in cities with strong job growth, and the inventory available.
On the demand side, the peak year for births in the millennial generation was 1990, meaning they are turning 28 this year. Many members of that large generation are now in their 30s, marrying and having children.
In their 20s, this group was forming new households at lower rates than earlier generations because of a scarcity of jobs in the aftermath of the financial crisis, large student debts and perhaps a cultural shift in attitudes toward homeownership. That appears to be changing as they get older.
But the rising demand has not been accompanied by increase in supply.
Builders started work on 1.3 million new housing units in 2017, which is up a lot from the depressed levels of the 2008 recession but still below the 1.5 million average between 1959 and 2007.
There was overbuilding relative to demographic trends in the mid-2000s housing boom, but the opposite has been true for a while.
The home-building industry attributes this to the constraints it faces.
Many of the metropolitan areas with the strongest rates of job creation -- and hence housing demand -- have restrictive zoning laws that make finding suitable land a challenge. The housing bust drove some construction firms out of business and their workers out of the industry, meaning a shortage of building capacity years later. Tighter immigration enforcement has limited labor supply in some markets, and prices of many building materials have risen faster than overall inflation.
"Longer-term demographics are telling us that every year there are going to be more people entering the stage of life where they want to get married, have kids and buy a home, and they're going to be looking for housing to accommodate that stage of life," said Skylar Olsen, a senior economist at Zillow. "The fundamentals are pushing up against the reality of so much pent-up demand."
In other words, as long as there are more families looking for a place to live than new homes in place to accommodate them, the pressure on prices and sales will be upward, no matter what happens as the market adjusts to higher mortgage rates and tax changes.

Full text: Donald Trump has a boatload of problems. Ann Coulter, the author of a 2016 book titled "In Trump We Trust," is now one of them.
A week ago, when he signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill with nothing for his promised border wall, her frustrations with him, expressed frequently in her syndicated columns, turned into fury. "Congratulations, President Schumer!" she tweeted to more than 1.9 million followers. She also fantasized on Twitter about his impeachment.
During an appearance at Columbia University on Tuesday night, she referred to him as a "shallow, lazy ignoramus." And during a long conversation with me at The Times on Thursday afternoon, she sent him a warning about the wrath he'd face if the wall doesn't rise: "The Former Trumpers should keep Donald Trump awake at night."
Coulter isn't just any Trump critic. She was one of his earliest, most prominent -- and fiercest -- advocates. He came down that escalator and ranted about Mexican rapists and she swooned. Understandably: His diatribes against immigrants were cribbed from her 2015 best seller, "Â¡Adios, America!: The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole." It was published around the time of his campaign announcement. She had sent him an advance copy.
"Perhaps no single writer has had such an immediate impact on a presidential election since Harriet Beecher Stowe," David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, later observed in The Atlantic.
So Coulter was Trump's muse. She was also his oracle, predicting his nomination and election back when most others still dismissed him as a joke. And she's a barometer of, and tribune for, some of his core supporters, including her good friend Matt Drudge.
It's for that reason that I pressed her to visit The Times. We spoke for about an hour. We could have clashed over an array of issues and recent statements of hers. But the agenda was her relationship with Trump and his political bind: He is pleasing neither her nor swing voters in the suburbs. That has implications not just for 2020 but also for the November midterms.
Her agreement to talk hinged in part on our history. I have been discussing politics with her for almost two decades. I remember vividly a dinner in early 2016 when she laid out for me how Trump would prevail. She mentioned Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. I thought she was delusional. Then came Nov. 8.
What follows is a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation.
Frank Bruni: Over the last few days you have become one of Trump's fiercest critics. What happened?
Ann Coulter: What was great about him being a coarse vulgarian was that he didn't care about the opinions of Manhattan sophisticates, so when they come to him and say, "Oh, no, you can't say you want to build a wall, that's such a gauche opinion, that's held by the people in the outer boroughs." Anyone else would say, "Oh, no, I'm sorry, was anyone watching? Oh, I didn't mean Mexicans are sending their rapists. I meant they're sending their Nobel Prize winners. They're sending their absolute best here. That's what I meant." That's what any other Republican would have done -- instantly gone cowering. He never did that.
But something switched Nov. 8. Suddenly it was: "Please like me, Goldman Sachs."
Bruni: The $1.3 trillion spending bill that he signed last week sent you over the edge.
Coulter: Yes. This is a different category you're seeing now: Former Trumpers. That should be terrifying to the president. Maybe he'll actually keep his promises. Unlike Marco Rubio. Unlike the rest of them. Unlike Mitch McConnell. We have been betrayed over and over and over with presidents promising to do something about immigration. If he played us for suckers, oh, you will not see rage like you have seen.
Immigration should be a bipartisan issue. I wish Trump would give something like a fireside chat. That's what he should have done the day of his inauguration: Sit in the Oval Office and say, perfectly somberly and kindly: "I said some wild things during the campaign, it sounds like it's divisive and angry, but now we need to bring the country together. We can disagree on other things, but one thing that ought to unite us is that we want to protect the people already here." It's a perfectly bipartisan issue.
Bruni: I don't want to debate immigration policy.
Coulter: But that is the issue of the Former Trumpers. We are voting on the issues, not the man, and I think that is how you get away from tribal politics.
Bruni: When you say you don't care about the man, I immediately flashed on Stormy Daniels. You had a tweet just the other day in which you said: "Stormy says she and Trump had sex only once. I guess if you want the guy to screw you repeatedly you have to be one of his voters." Does the Stormy Daniels story -- does his behavior -- bother you?
Coulter: The fact that he's totally walked away from his central campaign promises does change your opinion of things like that and how you evaluate them. I said throughout the campaign, "This is a one-time pass for a two-time divorcÃ©."
Bruni: You came to prominence going after Bill Clinton for behavior like Trump's, right?
Coulter: No, that was quite different. That's perjury and obstruction. You can't have a legal system if people can just take an oath and just lie. It wasn't just the philandering.
In general, my sense of all of the claims about Trump and the women and the sexual misbehavior is that it is not true. I actually think he probably is a gentleman and is home at night at 9 p.m. sitting in bed eating cheeseburgers.
Bruni: So many women have come forward and said he made advances that were unwanted.
Coulter: That was very close to the election and they had many years to do that.
Bruni: So you don't believe them?
Coulter: I tend to discount almost all of them. The Stormy Daniels case, you can go either way.
Bruni: One more Stormy thing, another tweet of yours, you must have been watching the interview, and you picked out the quote, "You remind me of my daughter." Please expand on why you tweeted that.
Coulter: I was watching it live. I was in the gym so I could watch the basketball games. And I emailed it to about 100 of my friends before tweeting it, thinking, "Don't tweet it, don't tweet it." And I just said, "Screw it, I've got to tweet it." It's just creepy.
Bruni: He didn't get the money for the wall. Tell me quickly what else is wrong with that spending bill.
Coulter: I don't know what more horrible thing you could come up with than violating your central campaign promise that became the chant and the theme of the campaign that he promised at every single rally. I mean, implementing the principles of "The Communist Manifesto" wouldn't be more of a betrayal than that. It's totally secondary to me, but it's kind of hilarious that more money is being given to the Department of Health and Human Services than Barack Obama even requested in his budget.
Bruni: I don't think people understand what an intellectual godparent of Trumpism you are. Tell us about the beginning of Ann Coulter and Donald Trump.
Coulter: This is a much happier part of the interview. First of all, much like trade, immigration wasn't an issue that Trump just latched onto. Back in 2013, when Rubio was pushing his total-betrayal amnesty bill, Trump was tweeting like mad and I was re-tweeting him -- and put the tweets in columns -- saying: "G.O.P., what are you doing, this is going to destroy the country. You don't know who you are amnestying. You don't know how many there are." He had great tweets on the issue.
"Â¡Adios, America!" came out two weeks before Trump came down the escalator. The book hadn't even come out yet and I get an email from one of Trump's people saying, "Mr. Trump would like a copy of your book." I Fedexed it to his office. I have avoided seeking or requesting credit on this. His instincts were very good. I think he should take credit. His instincts are amazing.
Bruni: At an Iowa campaign rally for Trump in August 2015, you said, "Since Donald Trump has announced that he is running for president, I felt like I'm dreaming." Why?
Coulter: Every day, you'd wake up and they'd be arguing about anchor babies and sanctuary cities. We never saw that before, not on Fox, not on MSNBC. You never saw people talking about it.
Bruni: You have a strange dreamscape. My dreams don't include anchor babies, but that's just me. You've told me before that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were nowhere to be found until Trump's poll numbers rose. That's your prompt to talk about two of your least favorite people in the administration.
Coulter: They're lovely people but, boy, I think Trump voters can say this was a bait-and-switch. There was no intimation during that 18 months of the most magnificent campaign I've ever seen that, "Don't worry, I won't go to the White House without Jared and Ivanka and I'll be setting policy to make sure they lose no friends in the Hamptons." I always suspected they were back in New York denying they were related to him.
I've met Jared. He's very nice. But if a relative of mine suddenly bought Ivanka's fashion company, I wouldn't demand to be the one put in charge of designing the clothes and figuring out if they are going to be made in Macau or India. Not my area of expertise.
Bruni: So the two of them have no business being in the advisory roles, and in the proximity to him that they are.
Coulter: Yeah. And I'm not telling tales out of school: As was accurately reported in Michael Wolff's book, "Fire and Fury," I've told the president this and I've tried to get everyone else around him to tell him this.
There were all these rumors about how he was bringing his kids. They were there during the transition. Wait a second. A, they know nothing about politics. B, as far as we know, to this moment, they've been liberal Democrats. They're very nice people but Bobby Kennedy was a nice person -- and he knew a little bit more about politics -- and when J.F.K. made Bobby his attorney general, the press pulled its nose out of J.F.K.'s butt just long enough to criticize him for that. We don't like nepotism. We're Americans. This is third-world behavior. Which is what I told the president.
Bruni: You told him this directly?
Coulter: I've leaked nothing from my conversations, interactions, ever. This one was leaked by someone else, and since there was only one other person on that phone call .... It was me and the president and this was during the transition.
Bruni: And he said what in response?
Coulter: First of all, I had tried to get this to him through, I think, Corey Lewandowski. Definitely Steve Bannon. Stephen Miller. Peter Thiel. I said, "You've got to tell him you can't hire your kids." And every one of them said, "That's above my pay grade." So when I talked to him, I said, "Apparently no one else will tell you this, but you can't hire your kids." And I went on quite a bit longer than that, that he was looking like Evita PerÃ³n.
He does listen, contrary to what people say. He said, "You're right, nobody else would tell me that." So at the Wolff book party -- and I didn't leak anything to him -- I said to Wolff, "I didn't tell you anything, how did you know I had told him this? It had to be the president or someone the president told." And he said: "Oh, yeah, it was the president. He was storming around the Oval Office, saying, 'And then Ann Coulter told me ...."' So, yeah, he listens.
Bruni: You implied that Trump was governing so that Jared and Ivanka wouldn't lose their friends in the Hamptons. But he went for the Muslim ban. He backed out of the Paris climate accord.
Coulter: That was in the first week. But from mostly, probably, the reporting of Maggie Haberman -- she does seem to have an excellent pipeline to the Oval Office -- it was Jared's idea to fire James Comey. It was Jared's idea to hire Anthony Scaramucci. At any point, does it dawn on someone, "Every time I take this guy's advice, disaster ensues?" It doesn't seem to be hitting home. Why? Because it's a relative.
Bruni: One of the things that most stunned me as his administration came together was he spent so much time during the campaign railing against Wall Street, fashioning himself as a populist. This was the richest cabinet, I think, in history.
Coulter: I was terrified and I told them so. Is Trump the only person who didn't know that generals are so P.C.? They are suck-ups. He's not getting Patton. He's getting Chihuahuas. He used to say, "I want General Patton." Well, it's not Patton anymore.
Bruni: One month into Donald Trump's presidency, you said, "So far, I give him an A-plus."
Coulter: Oh, I liked his tweets.
Bruni: You were giving Donald Trump an A-plus on his presidency because you liked his tweets?
Coulter: I think so.
Bruni: By then he had hired a cabinet that you found abhorrent. By then he had brought Jared and Ivanka to Washington. But he's still getting an A-plus? Even Harvard doesn't have grade inflation like that.
Coulter: I believe my columns gave more thoughtful reviews. I think I was being a little ironic and cheerleading there because I was obviously attacking him immediately in the columns.
Bruni: What's his grade today?
Coulter: We're halfway through the semester and he's failing. He could still get ahead. There's still a shot for extra credit.
Bruni: Let me guess: It involves a wall.
Coulter: There is one thing he promised every single day for 18 months. Don't act like I'm the nut wanting a wall. That was the chant at every rally. I didn't make this up.
Bruni: But let's be adults here. Was Mexico ever going to pay for it?
Coulter: No. 1, his voters absolutely do not care.
Bruni: He promised that as often as he promised the wall.
Coulter: I know, but it was like me giving him an A-plus. It was just a fun chant. I promise you: We want a wall, we don't care who pays for it. But it's very easy: In 10 years, if we just stopped giving Mexico foreign aid, we'd pay for it.
Bruni: Are you a Former Trumper?
Coulter: He can still come back. If he builds the wall, he'll be the Emperor God again. I'll throw a huge party. I'll start a committee to put him on Mount Rushmore. But right now, if I were a betting woman, I don't think we're getting a wall.
Bruni: What the hell does Donald Trump believe in? What is his compass? I used to think it was applause, but now I think it's incoherence. You're the scholar of Donald Trump. Tell me what he believes in.
Coulter: I really think in his heart of hearts he does believe in the #MAGA agenda. I think his Achilles' heel is that he wants to be liked. For 18 months he didn't want to be liked by cafe society, but starting Nov. 8, he just wants applause from The New York Times. It's very odd how he's always running to New York Times reporters and writers and not particularly giving interviews to the people, the broadcasters and the radio hosts, who supported him. Why is he calling it fake news when it's all he wants to be on?
Bruni: You told me he was going to prevail in the primaries and the general election. Look into the future now. When and how does this presidency end?
Coulter: I really don't know. He still could come back. He can build the wall. He's commander in chief. Will he do it? I wouldn't bet on it right now.
Bruni: Will he be impeached?
Coulter: That I don't know. Things aren't looking good for holding the House.
Bruni: Will Republicans hold either the House or Senate?
Coulter: Senate math suggests Republicans hold the Senate. If it is a blue wave, the Democrats take the House. I think they might not impeach him. They may think they can get more from this guy than they would under Hillary Clinton.
Bruni: They may think he's better taken advantage of than impeached?
Coulter: Yeah. If they impeach him, I think Republicans might want to get rid of him. I think they might rather deal with Mike Pence and not have to be constantly asked by reporters about this and that tweet.
Bruni: Does Trump have anywhere, politically, to go? Look at his loss of the popular vote. We're talking about 77,000 votes in three states. I could argue it's a fluke he was elected. If he pleases those who elected him, I'm not sure that he gets re-elected, but if he moves as far away from you as you say he has, I still don't think he can get the people in the middle. Does he really have a political path to survival?
Coulter: That's a really good point. The hate for him on the left is visceral. Graydon Carter is never going to say, "Well, I have to admit he's done something right." The only way he has to go is to go back to the #MAGA agenda.
Bruni: But I don't think that's enough either.
Coulter: I disagree. I think it would be. A, it's his only chance, although it may not help Jared and Ivanka be popular in the Hamptons. B, I think he can win independents over. He has not been a fascist. When a court unconstitutionally says he can't ban immigrants on the basis of national security or what's good for the county, he complies.
Bruni: We have heard and we have written endlessly about Never Trumpers. What are Former Trumpers? If he loses you Former Trumpers permanently, what's he left with?
Coulter: This is not Never Trumpers. It was very easy to brush aside Jeb Exclamation Point. Charlie Sykes. Bill Kristol. The Former Trumpers are the ones who would die for Trump, who would defend him from anything, who did defend him and blew off the "Access Hollywood" tape -- blew off everything. We kept coming back. He could sell Ivanka Trump merchandise from the Oval Office if he would just build the wall.
If he doesn't have us anymore -- that's what he should be worried about, because, you play those people for suckers? The ones who stood by him through thick and thin and thought this was finally something different? Former Trumpers should put the fear of God in him.

Full text: Wall Street struggled to find direction on Wednesday, eventually closing with a loss for the second straight day.
The drop was modest compared with the market's plunge on Tuesday, but technology stocks led the losses in both sessions. Shares of Amazon, Netflix and other consumer-focused companies also weighed on the market on Wednesday. Energy stocks fell in tandem with crude oil prices.
Those losses outweighed gains by drugstore chains, health care companies and other stocks.
Despite a crop of strong company earnings and reassuring deal news, traders wrestled with the implications of negative headlines swirling around several big-name stocks, including Amazon and Facebook.
"The news continues to be volatile and the markets are just highly sensitive to it in a way that they weren't sensitive to it last year," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments. "We've forgotten that this is more like the way things are, that markets do react to news that comes in."
The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,605. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.29 points, or 0.04 percent, to 23,848.42. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 59.58 points, or 0.9 percent, to 6,949.23.
Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 2.78 percent.
The major stock indexes wobbled between gains and losses for much of the day as investors weighed developments from some of the market's biggest names.
Facebook's shares, which have taken a beating in recent days over privacy concerns, reflected the market's broader movement, dipping into the red at times before eking out a small gain. Facebook said early Wednesday that it would give its privacy tools a makeover. The move is a response to criticism over its data practices and the prospect of tighter European regulations. Its stock gained 81 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $153.03.
The software company Red Hat was the technology sector's biggest decliner, sliding $8.22, or 5.3 percent, to $146.20.
"Tech has had such a tremendous run-up and has outperformed some of the other sectors," said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. "There may be other areas now that are more attractive, and we've seen some strength recently in some of the more defensive-oriented sectors."
Investors also fretted about Amazon after Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported that President Trump had wondered aloud if there was a way to "go after" Amazon with antitrust or competition law.
Shares in Amazon fell $65.63, or 4.4 percent, to $1,431.42.
Netflix shares also declined, shedding $14.92, or 5 percent, to $285.77.
Benchmark United States crude lost 87 cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $64.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 58 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $69.53 a barrel in London.
The dollar rose to 106.88 yen from 105.54 yen Tuesday. The euro fell to $1.2313 from $1.2402.
Gold fell $17.80, or 1.3 percent, to $1,324.20 an ounce. Silver dropped 29 cents to $16.25 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $3 a pound.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Egyptians Trudge to the Polls, Bribed or Bullied

Full text: TANTA, Egypt -- The woman in a long black shawl bustled up to a stall on a back street in the crowded Nile Delta city of Tanta, 50 miles north of Cairo.
"Where's my subsidy box?" she demanded. "My brothers and sisters in Cairo have already received theirs. When do I get mine?"
The woman, Soad Abdel Hamid, a housewife, was referring to boxes of subsidized food -- cooking oil, rice and sugar, mostly -- promised to voters in many poor areas in return for casting their vote in Egypt's presidential election.
With no real opponent to provide drama in his re-election bid, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is relying on the sheer enthusiasm of his supporters to generate a credible turnout. And where fervor isn't enough, he has other means of enticing -- or pushing -- voters to the polls.
Some voters said they had been paid, from about $3 to $9, to vote. In several areas, government officials promised voters improved services, like electricity or sanitation, if they cast their votes. In Marsa Matrouh, on the Mediterranean coast, a group of businessmen offered to send 500 voters on a pilgrimage to Mecca.
Carrots were reinforced with sticks. The state news agency reminded Egyptians that failing to vote was an offense punishable by fines of up to $28, a threat rarely acted upon in previous elections. In Assiut and Minya provinces, police officers went door to door urging people to cast their ballots.
Retirees, and an official at the state airline, EgyptAir, said they were warned that their April payments would be docked if they failed to vote.
The three-day vote, which ends Wednesday, is shaping up to be a predictably low-watt and joyless affair, the antithesis of the youthful passions driving the Arab Spring in 2011, when Egyptians ousted their longtime ruler, President Hosni Mubarak.
Turnout was light in many parts of Cairo. Reuters, citing an official in the National Election Authority, said about 13.5 percent of 59 million eligible voters had cast ballots on Monday.
In Tanta, posters for Mr. Sisi were plastered all over the main thoroughfares of the city, which is famed for its mashabek, a sticky yellow swirl of sugar and flour, and its magnificent Sufi mosque. It was hard to find a single image depicting his challenger, Moussa Moustapha Moussa, an obscure politician drafted at the last minute to prevent the embarrassment of a one-horse race.
Mr. Moussa, who has ties to the security services, accused the United States this week of fomenting the Arab Spring with the goal of destabilizing the Middle East. "This huge U.S. project was implemented by the team of Condoleezza Rice," he told Russia's Sputnik news agency, referring to the former secretary of state.
But many voters in Tanta failed to remember Mr. Moussa's name, much less register their intention to vote for him.
And the effort to increase turnout with promises of food seemed to be working. Behind a phalanx of soldiers and scowling intelligence officials, about 50 yards from the stall where chits for food baskets were being handed out, a presiding officer reported a healthy turnout.
In some respects, the vote felt familiar to Egyptians, who endured manipulated elections during Mr. Mubarak's rule from 1981 to 2011. His government also paid people to vote.
A spokesman for the Sisi campaign did not respond to queries about its electoral tactics. But the ease with which Mr. Sisi has steamrollered Egypt's fractured opposition is a product of even harsher repression.
Mr. Sisi has outlawed the opposition Muslim Brotherhood, jailed thousands of opponents, and in the early stage of the election jailed or sidelined any candidate who might have posed a significant electoral threat. Journalists have been arrested, and a British reporter was expelled last month.
To Mr. Sisi's supporters, though, he is a bulwark of stability in a region buffeted by violent chaos and political turmoil. In Ganzour, a small town six miles south of Tanta, a Sisi campaigner named Ibrahim Soliman wielded a megaphone at the gates of a polling station.
"Do you want your women to be violated as they were in Syria, Iraq and Libya?" he shouted as a trickle of voters filed through the gate.
Moments later a group of musicians and young men appeared -- playing pipes, turning a jig and dancing on the roof of a vehicle. Mr. Soliman announced that a Western reporter was watching. "Let's show him that we are a united country!" he said.
Another man grabbed the microphone from him. "You're not voting for Sisi," he exhorted the gathering crowd. "You're voting for the Egyptian state."
The results are due by Monday. In the last presidential election, in 2014, Mr. Sisi won 97 percent of the vote, although that was a time when he enjoyed broad public support. A year earlier, Egyptians filled Tahrir Square for a second time to demand the resignation of the elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, paving the way for the military takeover that brought Mr. Sisi to power.
His popularity has been hit by a string of terrorist attacks in Egypt's main cities and a stinging economic downturn that has inflicted deep pain on the country's poor. Online satirists often mock his lengthy speeches. Although the economy has picked up this year, poor Egyptians are still reeling from soaring inflation.
"Sisi restored security to our country," said Ahmad Tawakol, an iron merchant in Tanta. "Now I want him to lower the price of food."
Down the street, as we walked away, a man who had been watching on a street corner said, "There is no democracy." When we stopped to speak to him, the Sisi supporters gathered around.
The man declined to give his name and denied he had said anything.

Full text: When William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announced that he planned to step down, progressives and pro-labor groups saw a rare opportunity to influence an important economic policy appointment over which President Trump has no say.
Almost immediately, they drew up a list of demands. They wanted someone who would focus more on promoting employment than on fighting inflation. They wanted a candidate who reflected diversity and who understood the New York region. They wanted a tough regulator who was independent of Wall Street. And they wanted an open search process that would give the public a voice.
Instead, the New York Fed's board appears to be close to appointing John C. Williams, a Fed insider with little regulatory experience and no close connection to New York. He is also, like everyone to hold the job in the bank's century of history, a white man.
"It's like Exhibit A of how incredibly out of touch the Fed is with what is important and what's happening in this country," said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that has pushed for stricter financial regulation.
Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist and an influential policymaker whose research has drawn praise even from some people critical of his possible selection. He has helped push the Fed to rethink its approach to monetary policy after the financial crisis, and has argued for policies that could lead the central bank to act more aggressively in the next crisis.
Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman whom Mr. Williams succeeded as president of the San Francisco Fed, called Mr. Williams a leader on the central bank's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, known as the F.O.M.C.
"He's a tremendous contributor to the Federal Reserve and the F.O.M.C., and has done influential research on monetary policy," Ms. Yellen said.
But Mr. Williams's possible appointment -- which isn't yet final and could still change -- drew swift criticism from a variety of Democratic lawmakers, progressive groups and left-leaning economists. They raised concerns about his record as a banking regulator and as a policymaker, and also criticized the search process for a lack of transparency.
"The New York Fed should go back and restart their search now," said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist who spent 20 years at the Fed.
A New York Fed spokesman declined to comment. But in a statement this month, the leaders of the bank's search committee said they had solicited comment from a variety of groups and had interviewed a range of candidates.
In recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices. The effort has scored some notable victories, including the appointment last year of Raphael W. Bostic in Atlanta as the first African-American president of a regional Fed bank.
Mr. Dudley's announcement last fall that he would step down represented the movement's greatest opportunity yet. The president of the New York Fed, unique among the heads of the 12 regional banks, has a permanent vote on the F.O.M.C. and serves as the committee's vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a crucial role in carrying out the Fed's policies, and in overseeing many of the country's largest financial institutions.
Those pushing for change had reason to hope their voices would be heard. In the past, the selection of Fed presidents has been heavily influenced by the financial institutions that are formally the stockholders of the Fed's regional banks. But the regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis removed the banks' representatives from the selection process. One of the two leaders of the search for Mr. Dudley's successor is Sara Horowitz, who runs the Freelancers Union, a labor organization. The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.
In early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed's headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers' interests. Standing outside the Fed's imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could "make history" by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.
"The New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick," Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.
Mr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects. He has spent nearly his entire career inside the Federal Reserve system and, unlike Mr. Dudley, the former chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he has never worked in the finance industry.
But Mr. Williams does not have extensive regulatory expertise, and the experience he does have may not help him. He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is partly under the local Fed's supervision, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers' knowledge.
In a statement Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Williams's record in San Francisco "raises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks." She said the Fed's Board of Governors, which must approve appointments, shouldn't do so for Mr. Williams unless he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which has no formal role in the selection process.
Fed insiders said Mr. Williams played at most a limited role in the supervision of Wells Fargo, which is primarily overseen by regulators in Washington. Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York. But Donald Kohn, who served as vice chairman of the Fed's Board of Governors during the financial crisis, said Mr. Williams would hardly be the first president without substantial regulatory experience. Mr. Dudley's predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, for example, served in a variety of government roles before joining the Fed, but had never supervised banks.
"He's been sitting in all these Open Market Committee meetings where increasingly financial stability issues are being talked about," Mr. Kohn said of Mr. Williams.
But critics said selecting Mr. Williams would be a missed opportunity to bring in a new perspective. In a commentary for Bloomberg View on Monday that never mentioned Mr. Williams, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, noted that the New York Fed has never had a woman or a person of color as its leader.
"If we're serious about creating an inclusive and sustainable economy, no one should be left on the sidelines," Mr. Booker wrote.

Full text: First, some good news: In recent decades, students from modest backgrounds have flooded onto college campuses. At many high schools where going to college was once exotic, it's now normal. When I visit these high schools, I see college pennants all over the hallways, intended to send a message: College is for you, too.
And thank goodness for that message. As regular readers of this column have heard before, college can bring enormous benefits, including less unemployment, higher wages, better long-term health and higher life satisfaction.
Now for the bad news: The college-graduation rate for these poorer students is abysmal. It's abysmal even though many of them are talented teenagers capable of graduating. Yet they often attend colleges with few resources or colleges that simply do a bad job of shepherding students through a course of study.
The result is both counterintuitive and alarming. Even as the college-attendance gap between rich and poor has shrunk, the gap in the number of rich and poor college graduates has grown. That shouldn't be happening.
The chart here -- based on a new study in the journal Demography -- shows how strange a combination this is. Lines that seem as if they should move in tandem don't do so. The surge in poorer students going to college hasn't led to any meaningful change in the number of college graduates from poorer backgrounds. Among children born to low-wealth families in the 1970s, 11.3 percent went on to earn a bachelor's degree. Among the same category of children born in the 1980s, only 11.8 percent did.
The picture is very different for people who grew up in the wealthiest one-fifth of families, according to the study, by Fabian Pfeffer of the University of Michigan. The number going to college fell slightly over the same time period (which may just be statistical noise, given how high their attendance rates already were). But many more of them emerged with degrees.
This growing gap has big consequences, because the benefits of college come largely from graduating, not merely attending some classes. Graduation allows students to complete a program and be prepared for a job. Graduation has intangible benefits, too.
You can think of college as adulthood's first obstacle course. People who complete it learn how to overcome other obstacles as they go through life. People who don't finish suffer a blow to their confidence. They also typically have to repay college debt without the extra earning power of a degree. It's the worst of both worlds.
If anything, the consequences of failing to complete college seem to be increasing, as the economy becomes ever more technologically advanced. Since 2000, the average inflation-adjusted wage of workers with some college credit but no degree has actually fallen, by 2 percent, according to a recent report by the Economic Policy Institute. The average wage of college graduates is up 6 percent.
There are surely multiple reasons that the college-graduation gap is growing. For one thing, neighborhoods have become more economically segregated, which probably increases gaps in the quality of K-12 schools -- and, by extension, academic preparation. Many colleges that serve poor and middle-class students have also suffered cuts in state funding. And tuition has risen.
Whatever the causes, the gap makes the United States a less fair country. Thousands of students who work hard, overcome tough neighborhoods or family situations and do well in school are nonetheless falling by the wayside. They're not failing so much as the rest of society is failing them.
Doing right by them would require a lot of changes, in tax policy, housing policy and other areas. The Trump administration clearly has no interest in these changes. Instead, it's pushing an agenda that will worsen inequality.
But improving college graduation rates does not, for the most part, depend on the federal government. It's an area where people who want to help fix our economy -- people in the nonprofit sector, in state and local government and, obviously, on college campuses -- can play a meaningful role.
Already, some colleges have started to make impressive changes. Georgia State has raised its six-year graduation rate sharply. A network of 11 universities, including Kansas, Michigan State and the University of California, Riverside, are working together -- imagine that -- to share student-success strategies. In New York, community colleges in the CUNY network have created a program that nearly doubled graduation rates.
I'm convinced that the college-graduation problem is one of the big barriers to economic mobility -- and yet also one on which we can make real progress. In the coming months, I will be telling some of the unknown success stories in higher education. I'll also look at campuses that should be doing better.
There are few things I find more inspiring than listening to teenagers from difficult backgrounds talk about their future, usually with optimism and ambition. The rest of us owe them a little urgency.

TECHNOLOGY
Apple aims to take back the education market.
In a bid to take back some of the education market from Google, Apple on Tuesday plans to introduce new hardware and software for schools and students. But Apple has fallen to third place, behind Google and Microsoft, in the battle to own America's classroom. So the new items may not move the needle much. Natasha Singer
FINANCE
Saudi officials will meet with company executives in America.
A delegation of Saudi officials including the country's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is in New York this week to schmooze with United States chief executives. The centerpiece of their visit is the Saudi-U.S. C.E.O. Forum, a daylong gathering on Tuesday with speakers like Andrew Liveris, the forum's co-chairman and the chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. JPMorgan's leader, Jamie Dimon, is popping in, along with other financial chief executives. At the end of the week, the Saudis are expected to go to Seattle, where the agenda includes a meeting with a Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, and a stop at a Boeing plant. Emily Flitter
AUTO INDUSTRY
The S.U.V. will dominate the New York auto show.
The 2018 New York auto show opens to the media on Wednesday and to the public on Friday, and while electric cars have been in the spotlight lately, it is roomier sport-utility vehicles that will dominate the stage at the Javits Center. Ford's Lincoln brand will roll out a redesigned version of the Navigator, a seven-passenger behemoth, while General Motors will counter with a new smaller S.U.V. to be called the XT4. On the sidelines of the show itself, Waymo, the self-driving car division of the Google parent company Alphabet, will come to New York to lay out its vision for driverless cars. Neal E. Boudette
ECONOMY
The tax cut probably boosted incomes in February.
Millions of Americans got a bump in their paychecks last month thanks to the newly passed Republican tax plan. Data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday should reveal whether they're spending the extra cash or saving it. Last month's report showed that Americans' after-tax incomes jumped in January because of the tax plan, but those gains were mostly theoretical -- companies didn't actually begin withholding less money from employees' paychecks until February. As a result, consumer spending slumped in January. The report on Thursday should show another increase in incomes, but the outlook for spending is less certain, despite the tax changes: An earlier report found that retail sales fell in February. Economists will also be watching this week's data for signs of an increase in inflation, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than it currently plans. Ben Casselman
FINANCIAL
Markets will close in observance of Good Friday.
American, British and Australian markets will close in observance of Good Friday, but some Asian exchanges will remain open. It is not a federal holiday in the United States, so American government offices and services will operate as usual. Passover also begins on Friday at sundown. Zach Wichter

Top Pick Said to Be Near For New York Fed Job

Full text: John C. Williams, an economist and longtime Federal Reserve official, is a top candidate for president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to two people familiar with the search process.
Mr. Williams, 55, now leads the San Francisco Fed, where he has been president since 2011. If he is appointed, Mr. Williams would succeed William Dudley, who announced in November that he planned to retire this summer after nine years in the job.
Leading the New York Fed would be a significant promotion: The position is one of the most influential within the Federal Reserve system, and arguably the most significant economic policy position not controlled by President Trump.
The president of the New York Fed, uniquely among the leaders of the 12 regional reserve banks, has a permanent vote on the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee and serves as the committee's vice chairman. The bank also plays a crucial role in overseeing many of the country's largest financial institutions.
Mr. Williams's selection is not yet final. By law, the president is chosen by a subset of the New York Fed's board of directors and must be approved by the Fed's Board of Governors in Washington. A person familiar with the search process said neither group had formally voted on Mr. Williams, and cautioned that the situation could change. Representatives for the New York and San Francisco banks declined to comment. In mid-March, the New York Fed said it had narrowed its search to "a handful of final candidates."
News of Mr. Williams's likely selection was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Williams and Mr. Dudley have similar rÃ©sumÃ©s in some respects: Both have doctorates in economics and held advisory roles in the Federal Reserve system before rising to their current positions. Mr. Dudley, however, also spent time on Wall Street as chief economist for Goldman Sachs. Mr. Williams, by contrast, has spent nearly his entire career at the Fed and has never worked in the finance industry.
Left-leaning economists and activist groups have criticized the New York Fed for having too cozy of a relationship with big banks and have urged the search committee to look for candidates who would be independent from Wall Street. Nonetheless, progressive groups were sharply critical of Mr. Williams's reported candidacy.
"It's deeply disappointing and a missed opportunity," said Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which advocates policies that promote full employment. "This process began with a lot of talk from the Federal Reserve about diversity -- diversity of background and diversity of experience."
Mr. Williams's regulatory record will be important, given the New York Fed's role in Wall Street oversight. One of the major banks in Mr. Williams's backyard, Wells Fargo, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in millions of accounts being opened without customers' knowledge. The San Francisco Fed has recently pushed for major structural changes to Wells Fargo, and the Fed last month announced tough penalties on the company.
On monetary policy, Mr. Williams has been an influential voice at the Fed, where he has recently pushed for the central bank to rethink its 2 percent inflation target and to consider a new system in which policymakers would sometimes allow prices to rise more quickly to make up for periods when inflation was lower. Had such a policy been in place during the most recent recession, the Fed might have been even more aggressive in its efforts to stimulate the economy.
But at the Fed's meeting last week, Mr. Williams voted along with his colleagues to hike interest rates for the sixth time since the financial crisis, and he has generally supported the Fed's current policy of gradually raising rates to keep a lid on inflation. He has repeatedly said that the United States is at "full employment," meaning that joblessness is as low as it can get without triggering inflation over the long term. Liberal economists argue that weak wage growth and strong hiring suggest there is room for the labor market to improve further.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street closed lower on Friday, ending the worst week for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in two years, as investors weighed a brewing trade war between China and the United States that could hobble an otherwise healthy global economy.
Markets in New York tumbled through the afternoon. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed 2 percent lower, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost about 1.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite -- hurt by falling share prices in a number of technology companies -- lost about 2.4 percent.
Fears of a trade war -- fueled by tariffs announced by President Trump and in Beijing -- caused markets worldwide to shudder.
Benchmark indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt closed lower on Friday. Losses in Asia were much greater. In Tokyo, major exporters like Toyota and Sony helped to lead a 4.5 percent drop in the key index. Shares in Shanghai closed down 3.4 percent. South Korean stocks fell 3.2 percent.
Oil futures jumped more than 5 percent, the biggest gain in eight months.
Overall, the S.&P. fell 6 percent over the week.
"Investors are rattled about the economic and inflation impacts of tariffs and a potential trade war," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. "This nine-year bull market has been sustained by a growing economy in a low inflation, low interest rate world. Now those conditions are called into question."
Traders in particular have focused on the risks to the global economy from tit-for-tat restrictions announced by the United States and China, along with increasingly protectionist moves by Washington elsewhere, as well -- the United States has brought in tariffs on steel and aluminum, albeit with exemptions for key allies, and marginalized the World Trade Organization.
"This can turn ugly on a global scale very quickly," Robert Carnell, chief economist for the Dutch financial services group ING Asia, wrote in a note to clients.
Europeans, in particular, took only small comfort from the Trump administration's decision to exempt the European Union from the steel and aluminum tariffs. Business managers and political leaders fear that Europe could be caught in the crossfire of a trade war between two economic superpowers.
The United States is Europe's largest trading partner, but European countries also have deep ties with China, which is one of the largest buyers of European cars and machinery, and a major source of investment in Europe. Shares of the German automakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen all declined Friday morning, reflecting the importance of the Chinese market to their sales.
And by securing an exemption from the tariffs, Europe could be perceived as taking sides with the United States against China, said Gabriel Felbermayr, an economist at the Ifo Institute, a research organization in Munich.
"Instead of a trade war with the United States, Europe now faces the threat of a trade war with China," Mr. Felbermayr said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank provided an example of how uncertainty caused by the Trump administration measures could cause chain reactions that would affect other industries.
On Thursday, Deutsche Bank sold shares in its DWS Asset Management unit on the stock exchange. But on Friday, declines in global stocks pulled DWS shares below the initial public offering price. Shares of Deutsche Bank, which retained an 80 percent stake in DWS, then fell more than 4 percent before recovering slightly.
Markets in the United States fell on Thursday, as Mr. Trump announced $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports. That appeared to be the opening salvo of a trade war, as Beijing announced its own retaliatory tariffs on more than 100 items, including American pork and wine.
The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump's "America First" agenda, and they were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were to come into force.
For Europeans, the reprieve announced by the Trump administration from the protectionist measures could be brief.
The exemptions will expire on May 1 unless the allies are able to negotiate "satisfactory alternative means" to address what the administration calls the threat to national security resulting from the United States' current levels of steel and aluminum imports. The exempted group also includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea.
In addition, the White House said it might impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.
Tensions escalated on Friday as Beijing responded to Washington with its own tariffs and a warning to "avoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation."
Some American businesses in China also voiced concern. "Our members do not want to see a trade war," said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai. "The stakes are too high and there would be no winner."
But he added that American businesses in China wanted "fairer treatment and improved market access in China. The Chinese government has the ability to deliver against that reasonable expectation."

Full text: Dropbox, the file-sharing company and Silicon Valley darling, had a strong market debut Friday, a reassuring sign for the technology industry and for the investors who have billions locked up in other highly valued but privately held start-ups.
Shares of San Francisco-based Dropbox, which had sold 36 million shares at $21 each on Thursday night, rose 36 percent in the first day of trading. That pushed Dropbox's market value to $11.2 billion, above where it had been valued in the private markets.
The initial public offering arrived at a dicey time. Stock markets have been on a roller coaster, with investors anxious about the threat of inflation, possible trade wars and geopolitical risks. The technology industry in particular has been buffeted by the prospect of tougher government regulation.
Giant tech companies helped drive another sharp sell-off Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 2 percent, with both Facebook and Amazon falling more than 3 percent. The S.&P. is down more than 3 percent this year.
But the strong reception for Dropbox, which sells subscriptions to software that lets users collaborate and share files online, suggests that the public markets remain willing to offer a crucial exit point for early-stage investors in the largest private Silicon Valley start-ups, even amid broader concerns about large tech companies.
"I think the success of Dropbox's I.P.O. shows that great companies that are built to last can still access the I.P.O. window, despite a week of incredible volatility and distraction about global trade," said Bryan Schreier, a Dropbox board member and partner at Sequoia Capital, the large venture capital firm that was one of Dropbox's early investors.
Tapping the large amounts of capital in the public markets is becoming more important to such investors.
Over the last decade, hundreds of billions of dollars have poured into the venture capital industry. Those funds were then invested into a variety of young companies in the hope of finding the next Facebook or Google among a sea of flops.
The influx of cash fueled the tech economy. Between 2006 and 2016, the last year with available data, economic output in the metropolitan area that roughly corresponds to Silicon Valley rose more than 5 percent a year, while the average growth rate in American metro areas was 1.2 percent.
And venture capital money meant that highly valued start-ups -- "unicorns," in Silicon Valley parlance -- were able to remain private for longer without turning to the public markets for fund-raising. That posed a risk for venture capital firms and other investors, whose stakes had gained large amounts of value on paper but weren't easily liquidated.
There are 236 unicorns with a combined private market valuation in excess of $800 billion, according to CB Insights, a market research firm. They include some of the highest-profile young companies in American business -- names such as Uber, Airbnb and Elon Musk's SpaceX.
Given the huge values attached to those companies -- Uber alone is valued at roughly $68 billion -- access to the capital available in public markets has become all the more important. The public markets enable the companies to raise money to accelerate growth and, sometimes just as important, to provide a way for their early investors to cash out.
Since 2014, the "exits" by companies backed by venture capital, either through initial public stock offerings or acquisitions by other companies, have slowed.
As a result, the offering for Dropbox -- along with the successful recent initial public offerings of other young companies -- is good news for investors with large gains locked up in private companies.
Founded in 2007 by two Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science students, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox was backed by prominent venture investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia and Accel Partners. It has never turned an annual profit, but strong sales growth in recent years has pushed revenue above $1 billion annually.
"Today is the result of a lot of long-term investments paying off," Mr. Houston said. "We were able to get funding and achieve a lot of the goals where you formerly had to be a public company to do it."
Dropbox's solid performance in its inaugural day of trading adds momentum to what has already been a strong start for the I.P.O. market this year. Roughly $12.9 billion had been raised in 43 offerings listed in the United States through Thursday, the strongest start since 2014, according to the market research firm Dealogic.
Another hotly awaited offering is the music-streaming service Spotify. The company has filed to sell shares on the public markets on April 3. And last week, shares of an internet security company, Zscaler, another unicorn, soared more than 100 percent on their first day of trading.
Such first-day pops aren't uncommon. The investment banks that lead I.P.O.s often try to engineer those leaps in order to generate positive publicity about the company's prospects. The favorable reception on the first day doesn't guarantee a promising future for any company, even a highly valued Silicon Valley offering.
Last year, shares of Snap, the company behind the popular Snapchat app, surged 44 percent on the first day of trading. Since then, it has struggled to stay above its offering price of $17 a share. Another highly valued start-up, the meal-delivery company Blue Apron, went public at $10 a share in June and is now trading at roughly $2.

Full text: Global markets shuddered on Thursday as investors began to take seriously the prospect of a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Stocks in the United States fell for a second-straight day, as President Trump announced $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports, and concerns about growing trade tensions mounted.
After wobbling throughout the day, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index turned decisively lower in the last hour of trading, closing down by 2.5 percent. That put the index into negative territory for the year.
The trade measures against China were the latest demonstration of Mr. Trump's "America First" agenda, and were announced a day before tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports were expected to take effect.
The potential ripples of the trade actions have unsettled investors.
In Asia, markets opened on Friday to heavy selling as investors across the region reacted negatively to the news from Washington. In Tokyo, where the market opened first, shares fell 3.5 percent in early trading. In Seoul, the heavy selling followed, with shares on the main Kospi index down more than 2 percent.
Chinese investors reacted with panic, sending shares of companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen down by 2.5 percent. In Hong Kong, where many Chinese companies choose as a first port of call to list outside of China, stocks were down 2.8 percent.
Large exporters, whose fortunes could be harmed by a trade war, were hit especially hard on Thursday. Shares of Boeing, one of the country's largest exporters, and Caterpillar, which counts China as an important market, both fell by more than 5 percent.
Shares of large technology companies, which already have been reeling in anticipation of tougher government oversight, also took a hit. Facebook, which has been contending with a crisis over data privacy, slumped by more than 2 percent. Alphabet, Google's parent company, dropped by more than 3.7 percent.
Amid the dip in stocks, money flowed to government bonds as investors sought safety, briefly driving yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below 2.8 percent. Yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Commodities heavily geared toward global growth also fell. The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil, the American benchmark, slipped 1.2 percent. Copper, an important industrial metal, dropped 0.9 percent.
Thursday's decline is the latest in a series of jolts to stock markets in the past two months.
After more than a year of calm, in which stock markets glided to one record high after another, a wave of volatility is suddenly cresting. There have been many causes of the turbulence this month and last. Investors initially were fearful that the economy was getting too strong, and that rising wages might cause inflation, which would push the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates faster than investors previously had expected. Those concerns have partly faded as recent economic data showed that inflation remained in check.
More recently, market anxiety has shifted toward worries about geopolitics.
A growing public backlash against technology companies has increased the chances that lawmakers and regulators in the United States and elsewhere will intensify their scrutiny of them. Shares of those companies have helped propel markets to record highs, and their recent declines have led markets lower.
Now, the prospect of a trade war between China and the United States, the two largest economies, has added to the gloomy sentiment. Among the concerns is that protectionism poses a risk to the health of the world economy. On Thursday, for example, the Bank of England warned that the erection of international trade barriers could have a "significant negative impact" on global growth.
Stock markets around the world have reflected the worries. A leading European index, the Stoxx 600, fell more than 1.5 percent on Thursday. In Germany, whose economy is dependent on exporting products all over the world, the DAX index dropped 1.7 percent.

The Fed's Tricky New Path

Full text: When Jerome Powell presided over his first policy move as chairman of the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, it was against a backdrop of very good economic news: Unemployment is low and falling; inflation is low and stable; financial markets remain buoyant.
That is also the bad news.
That's because there are a lot more ways for the economy to get worse than to get better. Mr. Powell faces the tricky task of trying to keep growth going, and his success as the nation's most powerful economic policymaker will depend on his ability to judge the various risks to the current expansion.
Within the announcement that the Fed will raise its interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent, there are signs that Mr. Powell and his colleagues think they can lead the nation to even greater prosperity while keeping the inevitable risks created by that growth -- inflation and financial bubbles -- under control.
If all goes according to plan, this would imply that the United States economy in 2019 and 2020 will be the healthiest it has been in half a century. Fed officials project the lowest unemployment rate since 1969, paired with more modest inflation than was experienced that year.
To use a common monetary policy metaphor in which a central banker is the driver of a car that represents the economy, Mr. Powell expects to be able to keep going at high speed, even as he taps the brakes harder, and all without the engine overheating.
Mr. Powell delivered crisp answers in his first news conference, which at about 45 minutes was 15 minutes shorter than the sessions typically held by his Ph.D. economist predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke (Mr. Powell has a law degree). He said at one point he seeks to take a "middle ground" on policy.
"One risk is we wait too long" on interest rate increases "and have to raise rates quickly and that foreshortens the expansion," Mr. Powell said. "We believe that the middle ground consists of continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate," which is the short-term rate the Fed targets.
The written materials published Wednesday about the rate increase -- which signal the views of Mr. Powell and the entire policymaking committee he leads -- included new language that "the economic outlook has strengthened in recent months."
And, consistent with that view, the policymakers' economic projections represent meaningful upgrades from those officials' expectations in December. The median Fed official now expects gross domestic product to rise 2.7 percent this year and 2.4 percent next year, up from the previous projections of 2.5 percent and 2.1 percent.
They now expect the jobless rate to decline to 3.6 percent from the current 4.1 percent, and stay there through the end of 2020. Even in the boom of the late 1990s, the jobless rate reached 3.8 percent for only a single month and never fell below that level.
In the Fed's projections, this would be accompanied by inflation that rises to -- and just temporarily above -- the 2 percent target the central bank has set. The Fed has long asserted that it is just as dissatisfied when inflation comes in below the number as above it. But investors have been skeptical; with the median forecast of 2.1 percent inflation in 2020, Fed officials have put their projections where their mouths are.
Those economic projections signal that Mr. Powell and his colleagues believe they can keep running the economy a little hot with mainly good results.
But they seem to believe that a more aggressive shift toward higher interest rates will be needed to keep that benign future intact. This very rosy vision for the economy in 2020 depends, if you take their projections and comments at face value, on the Fed's stepping up its rate increases.
Just focusing on the median of Fed officials' forecasts for interest rates, as Mr. Powell emphasized in his news conference, can mask the degree of the shift.
In December, the "central tendency" of Fed officials' projections was for an interest rate target of between 2.4 percent and 3.1 percent at the end of 2019; that range has now shifted up to 2.8 percent and 3.4 percent.
In effect, Mr. Powell seems to be rejecting ideas recently put forward by various economic pessimists.
For those who argue that the economy is hurtling toward overheating caused by a tax-cut-induced sugar high, the Fed's message is that rapid growth is more sustainable than pessimists suggest. For those who argue that rate increases will choke off an expansion that is only now starting to provide broad benefits to Americans, the Fed is signaling confidence that the labor market will keep improving despite faster rate increases. For worriers about financial bubbles, the Fed is signaling that it believes the risk is low and manageable.
There's another old metaphor that compares being a central banker to the driver of an automobile: The job that Mr. Powell and his fellow policymakers face is like driving a car by looking only in the rearview mirror.
That is, you can really know only what happened in the past, while making decisions about what will happen in the future. And by the time the data gives you definitive evidence of what is happening, it will probably be too late to act on that knowledge. He's barely a month into the job, but we'll soon find out just how skilled a driver Mr. Powell really is.

Full text: Peter G. Peterson, the billionaire financier and philanthropist who combined a spectacular career in industry and Wall Street with public policymaking and dogged advocacy of government fiscal prudence, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
His family confirmed the death in statement.
Mr. Peterson was one of the few captains of business whose reach extended into the public sphere. Forbes magazine described him as having "one of the most distinguished rÃ©sumÃ©s in America." He was secretary of commerce under President Richard M. Nixon, led government commissions and advisory bodies and for 22 years was chairman of the influential Council on Foreign Relations in New York, succeeding the banker David Rockefeller, who died last year, also on March 20.
As a fiscal watchdog, he created a well-financed foundation that addresses a spectrum of fiscal issues and holds conferences that draw America's top financial and political leaders.
He wrote a half-dozen books laying out his vision for economic prosperity while critiquing, and criticizing, entitlement spending, the Social Security system and the impact on the economy of partisan politics in Washington.
And in 1992 he joined Senator Warren B. Rudman and former Senator Paul Tsongas in founding the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan citizens group that sought to build a constituency for budgetary responsibility.
His career in business and finance gave weight to his voice in the national discourse. Starting out as a whiz kid in the advertising industry, Mr. Peterson, while still in his 30s, went on to head the Bell & Howell Corporation, a Chicago maker of cameras and audiovisual equipment.
He made his biggest mark as the rescuer of the giant investment firm Lehman Brothers, long before it went under in 2008 as the global financial crisis spread.
Then, in his late 50s, he launched a new career as a founder, with Stephen A. Schwarzman, of the Blackstone Group, which pioneered a new breed of financial engineer. Blackstone would become a major player on Wall Street and provide the means for Mr. Peterson, the son of a once-penniless immigrant, to earn a fortune. Forbes put his net worth this year at $2 billion.
Peter George Peterson -- Pete to almost everyone who knew him -- was born on June 5, 1926, in Kearney, Neb., one of three children of George and Venetia Peterson, who had come from southern Greece. (An uncle had changed the family name from Petropoulos.) Peter's younger sister, Elaine, was only a year old when she died of croup.
His father had arrived in the United States at 17, speaking no English and without any money. He took a job as a dishwasher for the Union Pacific Railroad, working, eating and sleeping in the caboose.
In 1923 the elder Mr. Peterson opened a Greek diner named the Central CafÃ© in Kearney, a small city in south-central Nebraska, and operated it for 25 years. Young Peter began working the cash register at age 8. He grew up in Kearney, nearsighted and colorblind. He graduated from Longfellow High School at the top of his class and won admission to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
At M.I.T. he found he had no aptitude for engineering and shortly transferred to Northwestern University, from which he graduated summa cum laude in 1947.
Corporate Chief at 34
Mr. Peterson began his business career at Market Facts, a Chicago research company. In 1951, he received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business before returning to Market Facts as an executive vice president.
For a while, Mr. Peterson was a lecturer at the University of Chicago, where he encountered the economists Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler, both of whom would win Nobel Prizes, as well as George P. Shultz, who was dean at the time. Mr. Shultz later held three cabinet posts under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan and was instrumental in bringing Mr. Peterson to Washington.
McCann-Erickson, the large advertising agency, hired Mr. Peterson in 1953 as director of marketing services; a year later, at 27, he became a vice president. He eventually turned down the McCann-Erickson presidency to become executive vice president at Bell & Howell. There, under Charles H. Percy, later a senator from Illinois, he helped the company regain ground from its arch-competitor, Eastman Kodak.
At 34, Mr. Peterson was named president of Bell & Howell. (He recalled that when his mother witnessed the crush of photographers around him after he was named president, she asked him -- calling him "Petey" -- "Why put up with this craziness when you could go back to Kearney and own your own business?" She was referring to the family diner.)
Inexperienced in manufacturing, Mr. Peterson used neighbors and himself as guinea pigs for company products, helping to develop the zoom lens in the Bell & Howell camera that Abraham Zapruder used to film the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
At 36 he was named chairman and chief executive, succeeding Mr. Percy. He held both positions until 1971.
Before then, in 1969, he had been recruited to be chairman of the Commission on Foundations and Private Philanthropy, a private body that was organized in response to populist attacks on philanthropies as parsimonious institutions that are mainly interested in self-perpetuation while enjoying favored tax status.
Years of marketing coups at Bell & Howell, including sponsorship of "CBS Reports" and other public-service television programming, brought Mr. Peterson to the attention of President Richard M. Nixon, who invited him to Washington. There he served as a presidential assistant on international economic affairs before becoming commerce secretary in 1972.
That job lasted only a year. Mr. Peterson was an outspoken liberal Republican who enjoyed socializing with journalists and Democrats, and when the Nixon White House began suspecting his loyalties he left town, concluding, he said, that he had not passed a White House loyalty test.
"My calves were so fat, I couldn't click my heels," he was quoted as telling friends. He later said he had been fired.
Mr. Peterson was soon peppered with two dozen job offers. He chose the chairmanship of Lehman Brothers, seizing a long-deferred chance to work in finance.
'The Real Money'
"I always wanted to get into Wall Street and do what I am doing now -- invest," he said in an interview for this obituary in 2007. "I was experienced enough to realize that the real money was made on investments rather than in selling your body by the hour."
Lehman was flirting with bankruptcy, however, and Mr. Peterson encountered hard times as he set about restructuring the firm and drawing on his corporate contacts to win new business.
His turnaround efforts resulted in five straight years of record profits and a merger with Kuhn, Loeb.
After 11 years, however, a senior rival, Lewis L. Glucksman, with whom he had had a fruitful relationship as co-chairman, suddenly insisted on becoming the sole No. 1. Mr. Peterson decided to leave rather than fight a battle for control that he said he was told he could have won, but at a high cost to the firm.
The episode was the subject of a 1986 book, "Greed and Glory on Wall Street," by Ken Auletta.
In 1980, Mr. Peterson married Joan Ganz Cooney, the founder of the Children's Television Workshop, producers of "Sesame Street." She was his third wife and survives him. His first two marriages -- to Dorothy Krengel (known as Kris) and Sally Hornbogen -- ended in divorce.
Besides Ms. Cooney, Mr. Peterson is survived by five children from his second marriage, John, Jim, David, Holly and Michael Peterson; a brother, John; and nine grandchildren.
Mr. Peterson and Mr. Schwarzman, a Lehman managing director working on mergers and acquisitions, teamed up to create Blackstone in 1985, starting with nothing more than two assistants, $400,000 of their own capital and two Rolodexes.
Blackstone -- the name was created by translating the first part of Mr. Schwarzman's name from the German and Mr. Peterson's name from the Greek -- grew rapidly from a modest boutique to a world-class manager of more than $88 billion by the time it went public in 2007.
That offering was notable not just for its size -- more than $4 billion -- but also because it seemed at odds with the firm's so-called private equity business of buying up companies and reselling them. Blackstone had contended that targets would benefit from the absence of shareholder scrutiny.
The prospectus for the sale disclosed that Mr. Peterson had been paid $212.9 million in 2006.
The deal also helped inspire an unsuccessful move in Congress to increase taxes on the profits from private equity investments. Mr. Peterson retired from Blackstone in 2008.
Although Mr. Peterson's business career, particularly on Wall Street, often overshadowed his intense focus on public policy, he campaigned for decades to restore what he regarded as America's lost fiscal integrity.
He was the founding president of the Concord Coalition and in 1994 was appointed by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform.
Targeting Both Parties
In evident frustration with a lack of progress on these fronts, Mr. Peterson again tackled tax reform and government entitlements in 2004 by writing "Running on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About It," a best-selling, politically evenhanded indictment of Democrats for overspending and Republicans for excessive tax-cutting.
"I remain a Republican," he told Businessweek that year, "but the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party, not troubling with evidence."
He contended that the decision to index Social Security benefits for inflation and to increase those benefits substantially would come to be regarded as one of Washington's biggest fiscal mistakes.
Mr. Peterson also wrote "Will America Grow Up Before It Grows Old: How the Coming Social Security Crisis Threatens You, Your Family and Your Country" (1996) and "Gray Dawn: How the Coming Age Wave Will Transform America -- and the World" (1999), both dealing with the fiscal implications of aging societies.
He also wrote a memoir, "The Education of an American Dreamer: How a Son of Greek Immigrants Learned His Way From a Nebraska Diner to Washington, Wall Street and Beyond" (2009).
"I've always been involved with causes of various kinds," Mr. Peterson said in the 2007 Times interview, "kind of a closet, second-rate intellectual, I guess you'd say -- very analytical."
He was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2000 to 2004 and chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1985 to 2007.
"It may well be that Pete's most important contributions will not be in foreign policy but in his urging of sound fiscal policies," said Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, as Mr. Peterson stepped down from the New York chairmanship.
Mr. Peterson increasingly turned to philanthropy and fiscal advocacy in later years.
In 2006, his financial support transformed the Institute for International Economics into the Peterson Institute for International Economics. And after Blackstone went public in 2007, he created the Peter G. Peterson Foundation to raise public consciousness about long-term "politically untouchable" national challenges involving entitlements, foreign borrowing, health care costs, national savings, education, energy and nuclear proliferation.
One emphasis of the foundation has been to reach young people through the internet and social media. It also holds conferences that draw America's top financial and political leaders.
In starting it, Mr. Peterson committed $1 billion and bequeathed much of his remaining estate to it.
"I'm in a business where you wonder how much enough is," he said of his charitable motivation. "I know the meaning of enough."

Worrying What Lurks In Shadows Of Recovery

Full text: Americans have spent much of the past decade wondering when the economy would recover from the crippling Great Recession. Now, they are considering another question: When, and how, will that recovery end?
This month is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns, the first stirrings of what became a global financial crisis. Next month, in another milestone, the current recovery will become the second-longest American economic expansion on record.
There is no sign that the rebound will end anytime soon. Unemployment is low, job creation is strong and the overall economy seems to be gaining momentum, not losing it. Most economists expect the expansion to continue well into next year, which would make it the longest ever. Many think it could last for years, raising the possibility that President Trump could run for re-election amid the most sustained economic growth in a generation.
Even the Federal Reserve's intention to impose three interest-rate increases this year -- with the first expected on Wednesday -- has done little to cloud the outlook.
But many economists also argue that the seeds of the next crisis are being sown today, even if it is several years before they poke above the surface. Good times are meant to give governments an opportunity to get their fiscal houses in order and address long-term challenges. Instead, the United States is piling on debt and adopting policies -- immigration restrictions, increased trade barriers, looser financial regulation -- that many economists view as counterproductive.
"We're adding to the structural issues," said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank. "This is the thing that's the most disconcerting. We're not just not addressing it, we're adding to it."
Investors may be starting to worry about whether the recovery could be, if not ending, at least entering a riskier phase. In February, markets tumbled after a report showing unexpectedly strong wage growth revived long-dormant fears of inflation. The markets rebounded but have remained volatile, dropping again this month when Mr. Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum that are expected to take effect this week.
Economists said that any fears investors had would not be unfounded, but might be premature. It is possible that the tightening labor market -- the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000 -- could force companies to pay higher wages. That could lead to inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly than planned, and the tighter credit for businesses and consumers could cause a recession.
The likelihood of such a chain of events may have increased in recent months with the Republican tax bill's passage and the adoption of a big spending package in Congress, which together could pour hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus into the economy. Mr. Trump's tariffs could also increase consumer prices by limiting cheaper imports from abroad.
"We already had a tight economy, and then you add fiscal stimulus, and then you add on top of that trade protections," said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. "It's close to the perfect storm coming together with these risks of overheating."
So far, the threat remains hypothetical. Inflation has crept up but remains below the Fed's 2 percent target, and wage growth remains anemic -- even the surprising figure for January was later revised down. If inflation does pick up, it will not result in a recession overnight.
The impact of a potential trade war is harder to assess. The tariffs announced by Mr. Trump so far are small and unlikely to have much effect on the overall economy. But if he pursues broad-based tariffs against China -- something he is reportedly considering -- and prompts retaliation by the European Union or other trading partners, the consequences could be much greater.
"We know from history that's lose-lose," said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank. "It reverberates throughout the U.S. economy."
Beyond the issue of trade, most experts see few threats likely to derail the recovery in the short term. That is partly because it would take a fairly substantial shock to knock the economy off course. Tax cuts and spending increases may raise the specter of inflation, but they also provide extra insulation against such a shock. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 14 percent.
"I think we're going to go gangbusters for the rest of this year," said Martin N. Baily, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.
Economists are famously terrible at predicting recessions. Few saw the last one coming. And although the current expansion has been durable, it has not been particularly strong. Quarterly annualized growth in gross domestic product has averaged just 2.2 percent since the recession ended, compared with 5 percent for the typical recovery since 1950. The economy has basically experienced a long smolder rather than the kind of rapid conflagration common in the past.
"You can look at it with time as your metric and say, 'Wow, this is really long,"' said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. "Or you can look at output and say, 'It's actually surprisingly weak."'
Some parts of the country have experienced little recovery at all. And many families are still earning far less than they were before the recession. As a result, some economists, especially on the left, argue that policymakers should be less worried about the economy overheating than about the recovery ending too soon.
"You just see a pervasive attitude in markets that says, 'Oh, no, workers are starting to get a piece of the pie, time to take it away,"' said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, said there was evidence that the economy could keep growing without faster inflation. Even a little more inflation, Mr. Summers said, would not necessarily be a bad thing.
"A strong, fully employed economy -- where firms looking for workers is a larger issue than workers looking for firms -- is the best social program we know," he said. "It is shortages of labor that induce firms to figure out how to train felons, to move beyond their traditional prejudices, to figure out how to skill unskilled workers, to reach into distressed or depressed communities."
That argument puts economists like Mr. Summers and Mr. Bernstein in odd political company. Mr. Trump's economic advisers -- including the incoming head of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow -- have played down the threat of inflation, and Mr. Trump has indicated in the past that he would like the Fed to keep interest rates low. That could pay electoral dividends: If the Fed allows the economy to accelerate, it could bolster Mr. Trump's re-election chances, even if it raises the risk of a recession in his second term.
So far, the Fed does not seem inclined to cooperate. Jerome H. Powell, the newly appointed Fed chairman, has said he plans to continue the policy of gradual rate increases adopted by his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But Mr. Powell hinted in recent congressional testimony that the central bank could be forced to move more quickly if the economy continued to gain strength.
"Some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds," Mr. Powell told lawmakers last month.
In any case, research has found that economic expansions do not "die of old age." Rather, they end because something -- a policy mistake, an asset bubble, an outside shock -- causes them to.
Nellie Liang, who led the Fed's financial stability efforts after the financial crisis, said the United States had stayed out of trouble since then partly because regulators learned lessons that made banks and other financial institutions far stronger.
But Ms. Liang said that after years of low interest rates and steady gains, investors could be caught off guard when the economy hits a speed bump.
"Recessions don't have to come every 10 years or so," Ms. Liang said. But avoiding them, she added, requires vigilance.

A Working-Class Remedy That Hasn't Worked Out

Full text: Tupelo fell hard for Donald Trump. The blue-collar enclave in northeastern Mississippi -- birthplace of Elvis Presley and the American Family Association -- was once home to a vibrant business in upholstered furniture. But as Chinese imports flooded in, the local economy buckled.
There are fewer jobs in Tupelo today than there were at the millennium. Middle-income families are making almost 20 percent less, after inflation, than they did then. Mr. Trump's offer to build a wall against Chinese imports was just what Tupeloans wanted to hear.
Republicans could not lose in this deep red enclave in the buckle of the Bible Belt. Still, in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump carried Lee County, where Tupelo sits, by a 38-percentage-point margin over Hillary Clinton -- nine percentage points more than Mitt Romney's lead over Barack Obama four years before.
And yet it's not working out great for the working men and women of Tupelo. Indeed, President Trump's first big trade barrier -- tariffs against steel and aluminum imports -- is, again, threatening to undermine their livelihood.
For every job in Tupelo producing steel or aluminum, there are 200 jobs in industries that consume them that could be put at risk as tariffs push up the prices of these metals, according to research from Jacob Whiton and Mark Muro of the Brookings Institution.
This is true across the country. The lesson the White House has yet to figure out is that the tariffs meant to protect the businesses that make these metals will end up hamstringing the industries that rely on them.
The United States has been here before. When President George W. Bush imposed emergency tariffs on imported steel in 2002, prices of steel shot up. According to a survey by the International Trade Commission, almost one in five furniture and hardware producers, as well as a third of electrical appliance makers and one in ten auto-parts suppliers responded by relocating production abroad. Another study found that industries that use steel industries lost 200,000 jobs. That is more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself.
All sorts of industries use aluminum and steel. There are cutlery makers and producers of railway cars; furniture manufacturers and pickled vegetable canners; tire makers and wire makers and manufacturers of all sorts of auto parts. Mr. Whiton's and Mr. Muro's research underscores just how big a footprint the steel- and aluminum-consuming industries have compared to steel and aluminum producers.
Steel- and aluminum-producing industries employ some 95 workers in the Tupelo commuting zone -- an area centered on Tupelo that comprises Lee and a clutch of five smaller counties, according to Mr. Whiton and Mr. Muro's analysis.
By contrast, 20,294 people in the area -- almost one in four -- work in industries that consume either metal. There are the workers assembling lawn mowers at the MTD factory and the workers at Jesco, a steel fabrication plant that serves the construction industry. There are the workers slapping together Corollas at the Toyota plant in Blue Springs a few miles northwest, and their colleagues close by at Toyota's auto parts manufacturing plant.
An analysis from the Council on Foreign Relations concluded that Mr. Trump's tariffs could kill up to 40,000 jobs in the auto industry alone.
What's particularly ironic is that the blow from the new tariffs will be felt most acutely by workers who voted for Mr. Trump. No place in Virginia swung for the president more than Bland County, where 82 percent of voters chose Mr. Trump. The county supports 11 steel- and aluminum-producing jobs, according to Mr. Muro's and Mr. Wilton's data. Steel- and aluminum-consuming industries, by contrast, employ 468.
In Mercer County, Ohio, another Trump stronghold, consuming industries employ eight times as many workers as producers. Then there is Macomb County, stretching northeast from Detroit. After voting twice for Barack Obama, Macomb's voters gave the county -- and arguably the state of Michigan -- to Mr. Trump. He won the county by 48,348 votes. His margin in the entire state was only 13,107.
Mr. Trump's campaign strategy was almost custom cut for Macomb's overwhelmingly white and blue-collar voters. His appeal to protect the homeland from foreign goods resonated in this hub of the auto industry, where robots have replaced much of the working class. Since 2000, Macomb has lost a third of its jobs in manufacturing, the industry that is still the county's biggest employer.
The problem with Mr. Trump's remedy, as far as Macomb's workers are concerned, is that this manufacturing industry uses lots of steel. According to the Brookings data, almost 16 percent of the jobs in the county are in industries that consume steel and aluminum, while 0.2 percent -- 478 jobs -- depend on producers.
The demand for protectionism from Mr. Trump's voters comes from real pain. Macomb and Tupelo have lost much of what they called the middle class when good jobs in manufacturing industries disappeared.
Seminal work by David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson at the University of California, San Diego, shows that workers in counties whose industries were exposed to competition from China lost jobs and suffered declines in wages.
For instance, the surge of Chinese furniture into the United States between 1990 and 2007 amounted to more than $43,000 per each American worker toiling in the business. In the Tupelo commuting zone, where one in five workers made furniture, it hurt.
Professors Autor, Dorn and Hanson estimated that, in total over the period, Tupelo's workers suffered a $14,120 "China shock" -- $14,120 worth of goods per worker that, with other things remaining equal, would have been made by the area's labor force had they not been imported from China. On average, every $1,000 worth of "shock" reduced the household wage and salary income for working-age adults by about $549 per year, they estimated.
These workers are right to be angry. Policymakers of both parties have long ignored their plight, espousing "free trade" on the grounds that it enhances overall economic growth, while doing next to nothing to help those on the losing side.
And still, protectionism is the wrong tool to improve workers' lot. It will do nothing to stop automation, for one. Critically, while perhaps protecting some workers in one, narrow industry, it will probably hurt many others.
To paraphrase Paul Krugman, if China is a truck that ran roughshod over the workers of Tupelo, Mr. Trump's protectionism amounts to putting the truck's gear in reverse and running them over again.

Full text: Stocks tumbled on Monday, dragged down by shares of technology companies, which until recently had propelled the nine-year bull market ever higher.
Facebook was at the heart of the sell-off. Its shares closed down 6.8 percent after news emerged over the weekend that a political data firm with links to President Trump's 2016 campaign had harvested private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles.
The news reports could open the door to greater government scrutiny and potential regulation of the technology sector. Already, government officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have been demanding tougher oversight of the world's largest tech companies. That, in turn, could erode the industry's profits and potentially force some companies to adjust their business models.
Facebook's decline on Monday was the stock's worst single-day fall since 2014, and it weighed on the other tech giants. Google's parent company, Alphabet, fell more than 3 percent. Amazon and Microsoft dropped more than 1.7 percent. And Apple, the largest American company by market capitalization, sank 1.5 percent.
The falling tech stocks pulled down the overall market, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index down 1.4 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 1.8 percent.
The turbulence in the tech industry adds to the recent market turmoil. After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected.
Since the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns -- including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid -- of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market. In 2009, the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S. & P. 500. Today, that figure is more than 25 percent, meaning that a swing in tech stocks has a big effect on the broader market.
A few giant companies have been the driving force behind the rally. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google's parent company -- often referred to in the markets by the shorthand FANG -- have become a favorite combination for stock investors.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced on Monday that it was broadening sanctions against Venezuela, blacklisting four government officials and banning a digital currency President NicolÃ¡s Maduro created last month to circumvent financial sanctions on his economically strapped nation.
The White House said the new measures were intended to send a message to Mr. Maduro's government, which it has accused of corruption and repression, that the United States remains focused on the economic devastation in Venezuela, and holds the president and his associates directly responsible for creating the conditions there. The nation is in the throes of food and medicine shortages and a collapse of the health system as well as other government services, circumstances that have prompted hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee.
The intensification of sanctions comes as President Trump prepares to attend the Summit of the Americas next month in Lima, Peru, where the crisis in Venezuela will be a central issue. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver a speech this week at the Organization of American States in Washington, where he plans to call out "the Maduro regime's lawless actions," according to a spokeswoman, and urge swift action to address the humanitarian situation and restore political order.
The sanctions also come just two months before Mr. Maduro is to stand for re-election in a race he is expected to win given his control of Venezuela's political and judicial machinery. The United States is among the countries that have declared they will not recognize the results.
"President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis," Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement announcing the newly blacklisted individuals. Mr. Mnuchin cited the individuals for "economic mismanagement and corruption" and blasted an attempt by the Maduro government to evade sanctions through the creation of a new digital currency known as Petro.
"Instead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency -- a ploy that Venezuela's democratically elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid," he said.
The sanctions brought an angry response from Mr. Maduro, who issued a statement that the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington "rejects and strongly condemns the alleged and unilateral new sanctions of the Donald Trump regime against the Venezuelan people and our financial and economic system."
The administration's announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation's vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolÃ­var, and quadruple-digit inflation.
Senior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.
Whether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.
"It's part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government," said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Wilson Center's Latin American Program. "But it's usually the case that governments dig in their heels all the more when they feel that sanctions are aimed at removing them from power instead of producing a change in behavior, and what this will do is certainly increase the suffering and the shortages that are happening now."
Mr. Mnuchin, who is attending a gathering of finance ministers in Argentina, said he and his counterparts had discussed "how to achieve our shared objectives of restoring Venezuelan democracy, combating the kleptocracy of the Maduro regime, and responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by Maduro's economic policy."
"We urge Maduro to distribute humanitarian aid and stop blocking much-needed foreign assistance to the suffering people of Venezuela, and we again call upon the Venezuelan military to respect and uphold the Constitution," Mr. Mnuchin said.
The four people sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Monday are current and former officials who played key roles in Mr. Maduro's government and political network. AmÃ©rico Alex Mata GarcÃ­a is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro's presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.
The four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.
The sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.
One Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.
Venezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could "expose U.S. persons to legal risk."
The executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.
Risa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela -- the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro's grandiose claims, she said -- the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.
"It's more symbolic," Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday's measures. "The Trump administration's desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite," both in Venezuela and in the United States.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
Regulation
Europe to proceed with tech tax.
The European Commission is expected this week to unveil a plan for revamping how technology companies are taxed on their digital revenue. The proposal is the latest push in a campaign by Brussels to more strongly regulate the titans of the tech industry -- particularly dominant players like Amazon and Apple that have drawn scrutiny for their efforts to maximize profits by recording earnings in lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg. The move comes as criticism persists that the European Union unfairly focuses on American companies, an accusation that Brussels denies. Prashant S. Rao
Technology
Drop it like a stock.
Investors will be watching to see whether the online file storage company Dropbox successfully goes public this week. If it does, they'll want to see what Wall Street's response says about the prospects for other so-called unicorns, the start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far financed their growth. Although privately valued at $10 billion, Dropbox recently set an initial price range for its shares at $16 to $18, for a value of $7 billion to $7.9 billion. One question is whether Dropbox, and others that may follow it to market, can avoid the fate of Snap, the company behind the Snapchat app, which has struggled to stay above its $17-a-share offering price since going public a year ago, and the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June and is now trading well below that.
Economy
Jerome Powell's first meeting as Fed chairman.
Federal Reserve policymakers are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss interest rates, the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank's new chairman. With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year. After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.
Trade
Deadline looms for duties on imported metals.
The steep tariffs ordered by President Trump on imported aluminum and steel are to take effect on Friday. Like much else coming out of the White House these days, how strict that deadline is -- and to which countries the tariffs will apply -- is a somewhat open question. Mexico and Canada have already been given exemptions from the duties while negotiations continue over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the Trump administration wants to alter significantly. Mr. Trump has hinted that Australia and other nations with close ties to the United States could also get a reprieve, setting off a rush by other nations as well as foreign companies and their American partners, for similar treatment. Those favorable arrangements could be worth billions of dollars.

Central Bank In China Set For a Change In Leadership

Full text: China plans to name a new leader for its central bank on Monday in a move signaling that Beijing will continue an ambitious -- and, some say, much needed -- financial shake-up to get the country's debt under control and keep its economy growing.
Yi Gang, an American-educated economist, is set to succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, the central bank's governor for more than 15 years, two people familiar with the decision said. The choice of Mr. Yi, a protÃ©gÃ© and deputy of Mr. Zhou, almost guarantees continuity in Chinese policy.
The leadership change follows a broader pattern as President Xi Jinping consolidates power and pushes through his economic agenda. In recent months, Beijing has been more outspoken about dealing with the country's debt problems and forcing deeply indebted private sector companies to sell assets and pay off some of their loans.
The central bank chief will play a major role, trying to ensure that just the right amount of credit flows to the economy. But Mr. Yi will not likely carry the same clout as his predecessor, an important architect of China's considerable yet incomplete transition from central planning to a market-oriented economy.
That is because Mr. Yi will have a boss with an equally deep background in economics and a strong political backing: Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to the president, who joined the Politburo in October. Mr. Liu is widely expected to be named on Monday as one of China's four vice premiers, with particular responsibility for overseeing the financial sector and industrial policy.
The post is not new, but the man who has held the job for the past five years, Ma Kai, is a longtime central planner who appeared to spend most of his time on issues involving state-owned enterprises.
In financial policy, "one thing that is very clear is that Liu He will play a more important role than Ma Kai" did, said Jianguang Shen, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Mizuho Securities, a Japanese investment bank.
The rest of the world will be watching what happens. China's continued use of economic planning and ongoing support for state-owned companies has prompted pushback by global leaders. President Trump's new tariffs on steel and aluminum are aimed, in part, at China's own protectionist policies.
David Malpass, the Treasury Department's under secretary for international affairs, said before the Group of 20 finance ministers gathering in Argentina on Sunday that China had reversed its path toward more open markets, in favor of greater subsidies of its industries and more shoring-up of state-owned enterprises.
"China's gone in a different direction, really, from the rest of the world," Mr. Malpass said.
He also noted it was "worrisome" that President Xi had done away with term limits, leaving him free to rule indefinitely, and that the United States' longstanding economic discussions with China had stalled.
As Mr. Xi has sought to extend it leadership, he has brought more centralized control to the country's main policy levers.
The government has just approved a plan to combine China's banking and insurance regulators, as a way to bolster oversight. The agencies will relinquish some policymaking responsibilities to China's central bank.
Last summer, Mr. Xi created a Financial Stability and Development Committee to coordinate all financial regulation, and Mr. Liu is widely expected to lead it. The new committee, while small, has the power to resolve differences among the People's Bank of China and the agencies that oversee the regulation of the banking, insurance and securities industries.
In 2013, the president also made Mr. Liu the director of the Communist Party's powerful Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs. A few months later, Mr. Liu named Mr. Yi as one of his deputies at the group, the state-run news media reported at the time.
The rapid rise of both men once again show the president's willingness to dispense with the conventions of China's bureaucracy when he wants to promote someone he may perceive as especially competent, especially loyal or both. Mr. Liu was promoted several rungs overnight to the Politburo last October despite having been only the deputy director of a ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission.
Similarly, Mr. Yi has not followed the traditional path to a top financial position, like a stint running a big state-owned bank or overseeing one of the lesser regulators. (Mr. Zhou did both before running the central bank.)
Mr. Yi worked his way up the ladder at the People's Bank of China, where he has been since 1997. The current central bank chief, who is retiring, has lately given considerable visibility to Mr. Yi by sending him to international meetings and encouraging him to answer questions at important news conferences.
Mr. Yi is also among the rare officials to reach the top ranks after spending considerable time overseas. He earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and then taught economics at Indiana University in Indianapolis for eight years. Mr. Liu studied at Seton Hall University and Harvard.
The job of running the People's Bank of China has become much more technical in the past several years as it has shifted away from simply mandating the interest rates that banks can charge for loans and pay for deposits. Instead, the central bank increasingly relies on open-market trading in bonds and other securities to influence interest rates, much as the Federal Reserve does in the United States.
Mr. Yi has an extensive academic background in monetary policy and has overseen much of the trading in recent years. But he will face a big challenge in managing the central bank, including shifting political priorities.
Through the central bank and other institutions, China tightly controls how its currency, the renminbi, is used and valued. That means limiting the amount of money that Chinese citizens and companies, both foreign and domestic, can send across its border.
China has also long used its banking system as an economic throttle, unleashing waves of loans when the government wants growth and ratcheting back when debt looks out of control. The system has kept China stable in times of global economic distress. But as China's economy has matured, cracks have begun to show.
Previous efforts to juice the economy led to a startling rise in corporate debt. The system has long supported bloated, inefficient state-owned industries that many economists say are slowing down China's development.
Mr. Zhou, an urbane English speaker who frequently hobnobs with world leaders in places like the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has worked to gradually change China's dependence on debt and its control of its currency. Under his administration, the central bank somewhat loosened China's grip on the value of its currency. And he has championed programs that allow money to cross borders more easily.
He has also been a vocal, if diplomatic, critic of some Chinese economic policies -- a rarity in a country that values consensus. "In recent years, nonperforming loans have risen, eroding bank capital and risk resilience," he said in a statement posted on the central bank's website on Nov. 4.
But the direction of China's economic policy ultimately comes from the top, so Mr. Liu and Mr. Yi will take their cues from the president. It's an agenda that emphasizes stability and growth, meaning they will most likely focus more on China's priorities than those of the global markets.
After an exodus of capital, China tightened its limits on money flows outside the country over the past two years to bolster the value of its currency. It undermined Mr. Zhou's efforts to loosen the reins.
Now debt is a paramount focus. The central bank will need to provide just enough credit to keep the economy running but not so much that debt keeps rising and inflation eventually becomes a problem.
Mr. Yi's earliest well-known article for an economics journal, published in 1990 in the China Economic Review while he was still an assistant professor at Indiana University, had a turgid title that might prove especially useful: "Inflation and Price Instability: An Empirical Study of the People's Republic of China."

Full text: The Affordable Care Act needs help. After scores of failed repeal attempts, Congress enacted legislation late last year that eliminated one of the law's central features, the mandate requiring people to buy insurance.
Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act is widely known, isn't in imminent danger of collapse, but the mandate's repeal poses a serious long-term threat.
To understand that threat and how it might be parried, it's helpful to consider why the United States has relied so heavily on employer-provided insurance -- and why it has not yet adopted a form of the universal coverage seen in most other countries.
First, some basics on private insurance: It works well only when many people, each with a low risk of loss, buy in. Most homeowners buy fire insurance, for example, and only a small fraction file claims annually. A modest premium can therefore cover large losses sustained by a few.
But because of what economists call the adverse-selection problem, this model can easily break down for private health insurance. People typically know more about their own health risks than insurers do, making those most at risk more likely to purchase insurance.
This drives premiums up, making insurance still less attractive to the healthiest people. That, in turn, causes many to drop out, producing the fabled "death spiral" in which only the least healthy people remain insured. But at that point, private health insurance may no longer be viable, because annual treatment costs for serious illnesses often exceed several hundred thousand dollars.
Most nations have solved this problem by adopting universal coverage financed by taxes. The United States probably would have followed this approach except for a historical anomaly during World War II. Fearing runaway inflation in tight labor markets, the American government imposed a cap on wages.
But the cap didn't apply to fringe benefits, which employers quickly exploited as a recruiting tool. Employer health plans proved particularly attractive, since their cost was a deductible expense and they were not taxed. Before the war started, only 9 percent of workers had employer-provided insurance, but 63 percent had it by 1953.
To be eligible for favorable tax treatment, companies were required to make their plans available to all employees, which mitigated the adverse-selection problem. People would lose insurance if they lost their jobs, which inhibited labor mobility, but since employment relationships were relatively durable in the postwar years, this arrangement worked well enough.
But after peaking at almost 70 percent in the 1990s, employer coverage began declining in the face of stagnating wages and rising insurance costs. By 2010, only 56 percent of the nonelderly American population still had workplace health plans.
Even so, because more than 100 million Americans still had such plans and were reasonably satisfied with them, the Obama administration opted to build health reform atop the existing system. In addition to allowing people to keep their existing employer coverage, Obamacare expanded eligibility for Medicaid and established exchanges in which people without employer plans could buy insurance.
At the outset, Obamacare had three central features:
Insurers could not charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions.
Those without coverage had to pay a penalty to the government (the "mandate").
Low-income people would be eligible for subsidies.
The first two provisions were necessary to prevent the death spiral, and government couldn't mandate insurance purchases without adding subsidies for the poor.
Despite a bumpy rollout and some frustrations over shrinking choices and rising prices at health care exchanges, Obamacare was working remarkably well by most important metrics. Program costs were much lower than expected, and the uninsured rate among nonelderly Americans fell sharply -- from 18.2 percent in 2010 to only 10.3 percent in 2018.
This progress is now imperiled.
The mandate -- by far the program's least popular provision -- was repealed as part of tax legislation passed in December 2017. And because economists predict that its absence will slowly rekindle the insurance death spiral, we're forced back to the policy drawing board.
The most common response has been to call for a variant of the single-payer systems employed by most other countries, which promise dramatic reductions in health costs.
The United States spends far more on health care than any other nation, yet gets worse outcomes on most measures. In part this is because administrative and marketing expenses are much lower under single-payer plans. But by far the most important source of savings is that governments are able to negotiate much more favorable terms with service providers. Virtually every procedure, test, and drug costs substantially more here than elsewhere.
An American hospital stay, for example, costs more than twelve times as much as one in the Netherlands. The single-payer approach also sidesteps the thorny mandate objection by covering everyone out of tax revenue.
A June 2017 poll showed that 60 percent of Americans said the government should provide universal coverage, and support for single-payer insurance rose more than one-third since 2014.
Yet a move to a single-payer system faces the same hurdle that shaped Obamacare: Millions of Americans would resist any attempt to take their employer-provided plans away. And although single-payer health care would be far less costly overall, it would be paid for by taxes -- the most visible form of sacrifice -- rather than by the implicit levies that underwrite employer coverage.
From a purely economic standpoint, the increased tax burden is irrelevant. It's a truism that making the economic pie larger necessarily makes it possible for everyone to get a larger slice than before. And because the gains from single-payer insurance would be so large, there must be ways to make everyone come out ahead, even in the short run.
The Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker, for example, has proposed the introduction of Medicare Part E (Medicare for Everyone), which would allow anyone to buy into Medicare, regardless of age. The program's budget would be supported in part by levies on employers that don't offer insurance.
The cost savings inherent in this form of single-payer coverage would lead more and more firms to abandon their current plans voluntarily. Gradually, the age for standard Medicare eligibility also would fall until the entire population was covered by it. The Center for American Progress has now introduced a similar proposal.
It's critical to realize that there are attractive paths forward. In no other wealthy country do we see people organize bake sales to help pay for a neighbor's cancer care. We can avoid this national embarrassment without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Long before Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, Larry Kudlow was selling his future tax plan.
Mr. Kudlow spent the years leading up to the 2016 election trying to convince every potential Republican candidate that by slashing corporate tax rates, America's rate of economic growth could double. His arguments foreshadowed Mr. Trump's pitch for the tax cuts he would sign as president in late 2017.
"The single group that benefits the most from a lower corporate tax is the middle-class wage earner," Mr. Kudlow said in a February 2015 interview, "and every study shows that."
Several studies dispute that, but they do not deter Mr. Kudlow, whom Mr. Trump picked this week to head the National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow is not an academic economist. He is a Wall Street economist, a polished television host and, most of all, an evangelist for supply-side economics, which espouses that cutting taxes on businesses and the rich will rain down benefits on everyone else in the country.
Mr. Kudlow believes that limiting the federal government will unleash Reagan-level economic growth, and he derides the "highly flawed econometric models" of economists whose forecasts do not share his optimism, including those at the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's economic scorekeeper.
His zeal has led him to issue some predictions that beat consensus and others that were wildly wrong, including twice denying the existence of recessions while they were already underway during President George W. Bush's administration. ("Despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas," he wrote in December 2007, right as the worst recession in a generation was beginning, "the resilient U.S. economy continues moving ahead.")
But his preaching is consistent, effective and entertaining. Mr. Kudlow's admirers say it might be just what Mr. Trump needs right now, at a time when the economy is humming but Americans aren't giving the president or his party much credit for it.
"He's a great guy to have in a bull market, freewheeling economy," said James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a regular guest on Mr. Kudlow's syndicated radio show. "He was made to be a spokesman for an administration in that kind of economy."
Mr. Trump is confident that the economy is roaring and that he deserves credit for it, as evidenced by his announcement of Mr. Kudlow's appointment Thursday on Twitter.
Americans are similarly confident in the economy's performance, but that is not translating into widespread approval for Mr. Trump or his signature economic policies. A survey of 10,089 adults conducted this month for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that consumer confidence was strong, and remained at its highest point since Mr. Trump took office.
But only 44 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Trump's performance in office, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.
The poll found support dipping slightly for Mr. Trump's signature tax law: 49 percent of respondents approved of the bill, down from 51 percent in February, while 46 percent disapproved. That drop signals a potential ceiling of support for the new law, which had gained popularity after Mr. Trump signed it. In a worrying sign for conservatives, "strong" approval of the bill among Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents fell to 46 percent from 52 percent.
Promoting the tax law did not prove to be an effective strategy for Republicans in a special congressional election this week in Pennsylvania.
After flooding the airwaves of a district that Mr. Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016 with tax-themed advertisements, Republicans shifted strategy for their closing argument, apparently judging the message to be ineffective. Their nominee, Rick Saccone, lost the race narrowly to Conor Lamb, a Democrat.
Mr. Kudlow, though, sees the tax law as a boon for the country and a powerful messaging weapon in the midterm elections this fall. He told his longtime colleagues at CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that one of his roles in the administration will be helping Mr. Trump persuade more Americans to see the law similarly.
"The president likes me as a media communicator," Mr. Kudlow said, "so I will be more than happy to oblige."
Most recent directors of the National Economic Council have not been academic economists, but the role has traditionally demanded more policy advice than salesmanship. The director is in effect the point person in the White House for economic issues, coordinating advice from across the cabinet and the West Wing. Mr. Trump's advisers generally agree on tax issues, but they often diverge on trade, with warring factions between the traditional free-market group and a more populist group that reinforces Mr. Trump's own inclinations and campaign talk.
Mr. Kudlow is a longtime advocate of free trade, seeing it as critical to America's economic growth. He criticized Mr. Trump's recent plan to levy global tariffs on aluminum and steel, but has since endorsed a slightly more tailored version of the tariffs that Mr. Trump announced this month. His predecessor, Gary D. Cohn, announced that he would step down after losing the battle over those tariffs.
Wall Street researchers were skeptical that Mr. Kudlow could persuade Mr. Trump to back away from his anti-trade agenda.
"We expect that the president and Mr. Kudlow will be at odds over trade policy," analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote on Wednesday, "but that the president's view will prevail."
In the CNBC interview, Mr. Kudlow distilled the economic philosophy -- including his love of tax cuts -- that has animated him for four decades.
"I believe, first of all, the greatest and most important thing for this or any other country is rapid prosperity for everyone," Mr. Kudlow said. "If you keep tax rates minimal, if you keep regulations and government spending minimal, if you keep the dollar sound and steady, you are going to have a terrific economy."
He also emphasized how he, like Mr. Trump, viewed the stock market as a barometer for economic success. "Look, I love the stock market," he said. "I love wealth. I think rising stocks help everybody."
Faith in those principles has at times led Mr. Kudlow to better his peers in economic forecasting, most notably in the late 1970s, when he bet against Wall Street's consensus predictions that inflation would remain low. Mr. Kudlow also cites economic growth during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and what he calls the five-year "boom" that followed the permanent tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law in 2003, as evidence of the power of the supply side policies he preaches.
But Mr. Kudlow has been off on other predictions.
Like many conservatives, he warned in 2010 that the Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to help prop up the economy, risked stoking rapid inflation, which did not happen.
He said in 1993 that President Bill Clinton's "across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy's long-run potential to grow." Several booming years later, in 1998, he was telling conservatives to cut taxes and expect a surge of new federal revenue to follow for years to come. It did surge, briefly, but large budget deficits returned in the mid-2000s and have hung around.
Critics worry that Mr. Kudlow could miss the warning signs of another recession, or advise against government action to help pull the country out of any economic dip that might occur.
Liberal groups criticized Mr. Kudlow this week for dismissing concerns about inequality and the pay gap between women and men, and for his critiques of expanded safety net programs -- which he has said discourage work and contributed to slow growth under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama. He has also expressed opposition to the federal minimum wage.
Those critics who have jousted with him on air for years also say that Mr. Kudlow is, almost uniquely in the spirited world of economic debate, an engaging and curious adversary.
"There's probably nobody I disagree with more, and like as much," said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who advised Mr. Obama.

In New Term for Merkel, Compromises Pose Threat

Full text: The German economy could hardly be in better shape as Angela Merkel formally began her fourth term as chancellor Wednesday. Unemployment is almost nonexistent, stock prices are at record highs, and there is almost no inflation.
But the political compromise that allowed Ms. Merkel to remain in power could bring that boom to an end. She had to bend to demands from her party's junior coalition partner, and agree to roll back deregulation that, since 2005, has unleashed the country's economy.
Now, with Europe's economy gaining momentum after a prolonged slump, Germany -- the Continent's economic powerhouse and de facto leader -- risks heading in the opposite direction.
Ms. Merkel, who finally took the oath of office Wednesday along with her cabinet, faces the same political quandary afflicting many industrialized nations, including the United States. Life should feel great, but to many people, it doesn't. Their wages haven't budged, their jobs seem less secure, and they believe the good times have passed them by.
In Germany, where unemployment is only 3.6 percent, many angry voters in last year's election deserted the two centrist parties, Ms. Merkel's Christian Democrats and the left-leaning Social Democrats, in favor of minority parties, especially the far-right Alternative for Germany.
"People are less confident," said Stefan Sachs, a leader of a local chapter of the IG Metall union in the state of Hesse. "From one day to the next, you can be fired."
To get reluctant Social Democrats to eventually sign up for a coalition government after several months of coalition negotiations, Ms. Merkel made concessions that critics say would take Germany back to a time when the country looked more like France, with rules that protected workers from dismissal, provided a broad safety net -- and squashed entrepreneurship and growth.
The power-sharing agreement gives the Social Democrats more influence over policy than in their previous coalition, which ruled until elections last year.
In particular, Ms. Merkel ceded the Finance Ministry and control of the purse strings to the left-of-center party, which is likely to relax the strict fiscal discipline that prevailed under Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble. Mr. SchÃ¤uble, the finance minister from 2009 until he resigned last year, was a dominant figure not only in Germany but throughout Europe, where he enforced the austerity imposed on crisis countries like Greece and Portugal in return for eurozone aid. Austerity measures in the wake of the financial crisis largely involved shrinking government spending, by trimming pensions and cutting social programs, as a way to rein in budget deficits.
He also pushed those countries to emulate Germany's reforms, in particular relaxing restrictions on hiring and firing. Many countries complied, at least to a degree, helping joblessness in the eurozone fall to 8.6 percent in February, down from more than 12 percent in 2013.
Yet now, some critics believe Berlin is on the verge of refusing its own medicine. Without Germany serving as an example, leaders in other eurozone countries would have even more trouble negotiating the politically hazardous terrain of reform.
"The coalition is undoing all the reforms that turned Germany from the sick man of Europe into the locomotive," said Holger Schmieding, chief economist of Berenberg, a German bank.
Mr. Schmieding predicted that Germany's relative decline would pave the way for France to take over as the eurozone's driving force.
France is roughly where Germany was at the beginning of the 2000s, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has begun his own, albeit fitful, reform drive.
Although the two countries appear to have divergent narratives, Germany remains by far the eurozone's biggest economy, and Mr. Macron will need Ms. Merkel to fulfill his regional priorities, like overhauling the European Union's creaky machinery.
Indeed, the increased power of the Social Democrats -- who have advocated greater investment spending and are resolutely pro-European -- could serve to support Mr. Macron, even if Germany backtracks on economic reforms, according to Hans Stark, a professor at the Sorbonne University who studies Franco-German relations.
"It is in Germany's interest for Mr. Macron to succeed with his reform plans," Mr. Stark said.
Domestically, the promises exacted by the Social Democrats during difficult negotiations with Ms. Merkel would make it easier for workers at small firms to organize, allow greater increases in pensions and put limits on companies' use of temporary workers.
That last provision is of particular concern to automakers and companies that have relied on workers with short-term contracts to deal with fluctuations in demand. Unlike permanent employees, temporary workers can be laid off without big severance payments and lengthy negotiations with labor representatives.
BMW, for example, was able to quickly react to a slump in car sales in 2008 and 2009 by cutting temporary workers. More recently, the automaker has hired workers on short-term contracts to meet a jump in orders for an S.U.V. model produced at a factory in Regensburg, Germany.
It is a tool that companies here have used liberally -- temporary workers account for 9 percent of the German work force and 19 percent of workers 35 or younger.
Proponents say the system helps younger or less-qualified workers get a footing in the job market, helping them get hired full time.
But labor representatives accuse employers of abusing the system, creating a cohort of second-class workers living from one six-month contract to the next. Temporary workers are more at risk of slipping into poverty and are less likely to be married or have children, according to a study by the Hans BÃ¶ckler Foundation, which is financed by German labor unions.
Ogur Ãzalp, a 32-year-old from the town of Schwalmstadt, about 70 miles north of Frankfurt, worked on temporary contracts for six years at an auto industry supplier, where he inspected brake parts. But, according to the IG Metall union, Mr. Ãzalp was fired on a pretense just before the company would have been required to hire him full time.
Under the coalition program, workers like Mr. Ãzalp could not make up more than 2.5 percent of a company's work force, with some exceptions. Businesses would have to offer permanent jobs to workers on short-term contracts after 18 months, instead of 24 months under current rules. Contracts could be renewed only once rather than three times.
It remains to be seen how much of the coalition pact becomes law, and the economic effects may be milder than economists predict. Many experts warned that the government would kill job creation when it introduced a minimum wage in 2015. Unemployment continued to fall.
But there are already signs that business leaders are worried about what they see as a drift toward the sclerotic Germany of old, led by an unpopular government bereft of new ideas.
Surveys of business optimism have slipped in recent months after four years of nearly uninterrupted gains. Such pessimism can become self-fulfilling, discouraging businesses from expanding and hiring.
For the moment, Germany's economy is so strong that few people remain unemployed for long. Still, people like Mr. Ãzalp often feel stuck in an endless series of insecure jobs.
He quickly found a position at another parts maker -- unemployment in the region where he lives is only 4 percent. But the new job pays less, and he has a contract for only six months, he said, which may or may not be renewed.
It has all had a profound impact on his personal life. "We wanted to get married, buy a house and build a future," said Mr. Ãzalp, who lives with his fiancÃ©e. "Now that's all up in the air."

Full text: NEW YORK -- A seven-day surge in technology stocks ended Tuesday after President Donald Trump blocked Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom's effort to buy Qualcomm. Trump said he opposed the $117 billion deal because it could have been detrimental to national security.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed as much as 197 points in early trading after investors were pleased with a Labor Department report that showed inflation remained in check last month. But the gains soon faded.
Technology stocks were at record highs after a recent rally. While Qualcomm had rejected all of Broadcom's offers, investors are now wondering if other deals might also be blocked or if companies will hesitate before making bids for overseas competitors.
"I don't think we've started to price in protectionism on a broader level," said Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist for Bloomberg Intelligence.
The S&P 500 index lost 17.71 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,765.31. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 171.58 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,007.03. The Nasdaq composite fell 77.31 points, or 1 percent, to 7,511.01, its first decline after seven straight gains. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks sank 9 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,592.05.
Qualcomm is one of the biggest makers of processors that power smartphones and other mobile devices. The deal would have been the largest in the history of the technology industry and Broadcom's offer came as other countries are also getting ready to build faster "5G" wireless networks.
Trump's decision followed a recommendation from the Committee for Foreign Investment in the U.S., which said Broadcom might cut back on research and development spending.
Qualcomm slid $3.11, or 5 percent, to $59.07. Broadcom rose more than 3 percent early on but finished with a loss of $1.62 to $261.22. Intel, a competitor, added 26 cents to $51.78. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Intel wanted to stop the deal and might try to buy Broadcom to make that happen.
Trump also cited national security risks this month in announcing tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, and investors appeared to be wondering if at least one other deal will face new obstacles. In November Bermuda-based chipmaker Marvell Technology Group agreed to buy competitor Cavium for $6 billion. Cavium lost $4, or 4.4 percent, to $86.95 while Marvell lost $1.43, or 5.9 percent, to $22.94.
The U.S. government has blocked deals by Chinese companies in the last few years under both Barack Obama and Trump, but Adams, of Bloomberg Intelligence, said investors are more focused on the issue now.
"We no longer have tax reform dangling in front of us," she said. "It's adding to an environment in which the market is a bit more nervous."
The government said prices paid by consumers rose 0.2 percent in February, matching estimates. Excluding food and energy costs, prices have risen 1.8 percent in the last year. Prices had jumped in January. Over the last month investors have worried about the prospect of faster inflation, but Tuesday's price report and the monthly jobs report on Friday suggest inflation isn't moving any more rapidly than it did in the recent past.
"If you put the two of them together it paints a very clear picture of an economy that's operating at a very high level, that's showing some inflation, but not overheating inflation," said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income.
Rieder said that in general, service costs are rising and the costs of goods are falling, although clothing prices have bounced back a bit recently.
With investors expecting slower gains in rates, bond yields headed lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.85 percent from 2.87 percent. Faster inflation would likely result in the Fed raising interest rates more quickly. Investors feared that could significantly slow the economy and the market's gains.
Lower yields mean lower interest rates, and that weighed on bank stocks. Bank of America fell 48 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $32.36.
Companies that are considered bond proxies, like utilities and real estate investment trusts, did better than the rest of the market. They often move in the opposite direction of bond yields because investors seeking income buy them for their big dividend payments.
Benchmark U.S. crude slumped 65 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $60.71 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 31 cents to $64.64 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.89 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.87 a gallon. Natural gas gained 1 cent to $2.79 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold added $6.30 to $1,327.10 an ounce. Silver rose 9 cents to $16.63 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $3.14 a pound.
The dollar rose to 106.61 yen from 106.35 yen. The euro rose to $1.2397 from $1.2336.
Germany's DAX shed 1.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 lost 1.1 percent while the CAC 40 in France slid 0.6 percent.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index gained 0.7 percent and the Kospi of South Korea added 0.4 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng was unchanged.

Full text: At El Pampero psychiatric hospital in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, barely any drugs were available to control the afflictions tormenting patients.
People with schizophrenia were locked into isolation cells and tied to beds during psychotic episodes. Food and hygiene supplies were in short supply. Eleven patients starved to death.
"May God have mercy on us," said Evila GarcÃ­a, the head nurse, whom I met as part of a yearslong exploration of the economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela.
Though the country has the largest known oil reserves in the world, years of government corruption and failed economic policy have plunged it into chaos. Venezuelans now scrounge for food and medicine, and struggle to survive amid strict water and electricity rationing, soaring violent crime and government repression.
Public hospitals like El Pampero have been crippled by the shortages: More than 85 percent of medicines are either impossible or very difficult to purchase. Hundreds of children have starved to death, and thousands more are severely malnourished.
Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to voice their outrage. Riots have convulsed the country, with people setting government buildings on fire and looting grocery stores until shelves were bare.
Despite the shortages, President NicolÃ¡s Maduro refuses to accept international aid; he has denied responsibility for the crisis and vowed to continue using force against those who dare oppose him.
I regularly take a motorbike out before dawn to photograph queues of people outside grocery stores and pharmacies. The lines snake through the streets, and people wait for 10 hours or more to buy coffee, rice or butter.
Inflation rose more than 2,600 percent last year, making these staples unattainable even for fully employed professionals. In one poll, more than 90 percent of Venezuelans said they did not have enough money to buy all of the food they needed. Nearly three in four of those said the crisis had caused them to lose weight -- on average, nearly 20 pounds each.
Kenyerber Aquino MerchÃ¡n was 17 months old when he died. He weighed just 8.8 pounds -- the size of a large newborn. Family members decorated his tiny coffin with angel wings cut out from a government food-ration box.
When I returned to visit the family six weeks later, the only food in the house was a single lime and half a bag of salt.
Kenyerber's mother, MarÃ­a Carolina MerchÃ¡n, had wilted to 66 pounds by skipping meals so that her four surviving children would not have to. She worried that her 6-year-old daughter, Marianyerlis, would follow her brother into the grave.
"I close myself in my bedroom to cry and cry because the children have not eaten," Ms. MerchÃ¡n said, "and there is nothing I can do about it."
Photograph E The state-run psychiatric hospital in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, has long been a forgotten place, filled with forgotten people. But with Venezuela suffering from a severe economic crisis, this mental institution has little food and almost no drugs to control the afflictions tormenting its patients. Omar Mendoza is one of many undernourished patients. (F7); 1. Protesters waved the flag of the Venezuelan state of TÃ¡chira after seizing control of the main highway through Caracas.; 2. JosÃ© Villarroel waited for hours in an emergency operating room at Luis Razetti Hospital in Barcelona, Venezuela, after suffering a stab wound. The hospital, which did not have the needed scanning equipment, eventually directed him to a private clinic to have a scan done before treatment.; 3. Venezuelans lining up at a soup kitchen in Los Teques. A report by the United Nations and the Pan American Health Organization found that 1.3 million people who once could feed themselves in Venezuela have had difficulty doing so since the economic crisis began three years ago.; 4.

Markets Are Mixed as Tech Sector Gains While Industrials Remain Rattled by Tariffs

Full text: Stocks in the United States were split Monday as technology companies continued to climb, but Boeing and other industrial companies gave back some of the ground they won on Friday.
Companies like Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, and chip-makers including Micron Technology have led the market's recovery in recent weeks. Retailers including Amazon and Starbucks also made headway. The market was coming off its biggest gain in a month following the February jobs report, which showed strong hiring and moderate growth in wages.
Inflation has been the market's dominant concern, and two more measuring sticks of inflation will be reported this week as the Labor Department discloses data on consumer prices Tuesday morning and producer prices on Wednesday. Prices paid by consumers jumped in January and so did producer prices, which measure the cost of goods before they reach the consumer.
The Federal Reserve is gradually raising interest rates to keep inflation in check, and it expects to boost rates at least three times this year. JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said investors are looking at a lot of data but are really asking one question.
"If you think about the sell-offs that we've had, they've all been about, 'Are we going to get a fourth rate hike or aren't we?"' he said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,783.02. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 157.13 points, or 0.6 percent, to 25,178.61. Almost all of that loss came from three industrial stocks: Boeing, Caterpillar and United Technologies.
The Nasdaq composite finished at another record high after it added 27.52 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,588.33.
Most of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange ended the day higher.
Optical communications company Oclaro surged after it agreed to be bought by optical networking company Lumentum Holdings. The deal values Oclaro at $9.99 a share, or $1.69 billion, and its stock gained $2.16, or 27.5 percent, to $10.01. Lumentum also rose $3.03, or 4.4 percent, to $72.
Late Friday The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel might try to buy rival Broadcom. Broadcom is trying to buy a third chip-maker, Qualcomm, for $117 billion, and the Journal said that if that deal appears to be moving forward, Intel will consider responses that could include an attempt to buy Broadcom. It could also attempt a smaller deal.
Broadcom jumped $9.06, or 3.6 percent, to $262.84 while Intel fell 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $51.52. Qualcomm gave up 22 cents to $62.81.
Industrial companies like aerospace and defense firms and machinery makers lost about half of what they gained Friday. Boeing shed $10.33, or 2.9 percent, to $344.19, and Lockheed Martin lost $7.39, or 2.2 percent, to $333.10. Caterpillar dipped $3.75, or 2.4 percent, to $154.50.
Industrial companies have bounced around since President Donald Trump said he would order tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. That will mean higher costs for companies that use those metals to make machinery, and their sales could be hurt if other companies respond by placing tariffs on goods made in the United States.
Goldman Sachs said David Solomon will become its sole president and chief operating officer, clearing the way for Mr. Solomon to become the firm's next chief executive.
Goldman's stock gained $2.61, or 1 percent, to $273.38.
Benchmark United States crude declined 68 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $61.36 a barrel in New York.
Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.87 percent from 2.90 percent.
Gold dipped $3.00 to $1,319.40 an ounce.
The dollar slid to 106.35 yen from 106.77 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.2337 from $1.2305.

Are Wage Gains Speeding Up or Stalling? Both, Apparently

Full text: When the Labor Department reported last month that average hourly earnings had jumped 2.9 percent in January, it looked as though the long, steady recovery in the American job market might at last be translating into faster wage gains for the nation's workers.
Then came Friday and the latest jobs report, which showed that wage growth was weaker in January than initially reported and that the gains in February were weaker still, up just 2.6 percent from a year earlier.
The muddled data on wages was a potent reminder that even the strongest job market in a generation has not been robust enough to reverse a longstanding pattern of lagging pay.
But the mixed messages also highlight the challenge of trying to figure out where wages are headed: Not only are the sources of the data volatile, but economists say they may also be declining in quality.
In recent months, different sources have told sharply diverging stories about how quickly companies are raising employees' pay. Wage growth may be slowing drastically after a period of strong gains, or it may be picking up after an extended slump. Or it may be stuck at more or less the same plodding pace that workers have become accustomed to for much of the economic recovery.
"We have trouble measuring any of these things," said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University and for the job-search site Indeed. "This is definitely one of those situations where you can feed in the data and get out whatever response you're looking for."
The problem is not new. It has, however, risen in importance as wage growth -- why it has been slow, and when that might change -- has emerged as a pre-eminent issue in Washington and on Wall Street. Congressional Republicans, their eyes on the fall elections, are seeking evidence that their recently passed tax cuts are making an impact on paychecks. Federal Reserve policymakers are looking for signs that the tightening labor market is causing inflation.
Financial markets tumbled a month ago after the data showing strong wage gains heightened fears that inflation would pick up, forcing the Fed to hasten interest-rate increases. The report released on Friday had the opposite effect: Stocks rallied on the prospect that strong job growth could continue without causing the economy to overheat.
Robin Brooks, chief economist for the Institute of International Finance, an industry group, said the market volatility over wages a month ago was "way premature."
"Markets are completely overreacting," he said. "We basically have steady-as-she-goes mediocre wage inflation."
All economic figures come with significant uncertainty. It is common for different measures to disagree about the pace of job growth, consumer spending and other key indicators. But wages pose a particular measurement challenge. Surveys, the source of much economic data, can be unreliable because people often err in recalling the details of their income, or they may decline to answer questions about it. Companies, for their part, track how much they pay their employees but not necessarily how many hours they work, at least for those who are salaried.
The measure that tends to get the most attention from investors and the media is average hourly earnings, a figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of each month's jobs report. The figure, based on a survey of employers, is timely and easily understood: simply the total amount that companies paid workers in a given period, divided by the hours those employees worked.
Despite the familiarity of the average hourly earnings figure, however, economists say that it is among the least reliable indicators, especially in the short run. The monthly data is prone to distortions because of bad weather or quirks of the calendar (even an oddly timed holiday can skew the numbers). The measure is also affected by trends like the retirement of the baby boom generation, rising health care costs and the spread of contract work -- long-run shifts that affect average earnings in subtle but significant ways.
Other measures try to account for at least some of these issues by, for example, factoring in the cost of benefits or by controlling for the changing mix of industries in the American economy. But these indicators have their own problems, including smaller sample sizes. And almost all are released at a significant delay.
"The problem is that there is no perfect measure of wage growth," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm. "There is no right answer; there never will be a right answer."
The best way to deal with the conflicting signals, economists say, is to look at a range of indicators -- or to average them together -- and to ignore short-term fluctuations in favor of longer-term trends. Taken together, the various measures suggest that wage growth has been weak but has crept upward gradually as the economy has improved.
Focusing on the long run, however, does not solve another problem that increasingly concerns economists: signs that data about Americans' earnings and income is getting less reliable. Most government statistics, for instance, have failed to adapt to the rise of the so-called gig economy and other trends that are changing the relationship between companies and workers. The hourly earnings measure in the monthly jobs report excludes Uber drivers and similar contractors.
"I don't think any of these measures do very well with nonstandard work arrangements," said Katharine Abraham, a University of Maryland economist who recently led a government commission that studied how data might inform public policy.
Moreover, Americans are increasingly refusing to respond to government surveys. The response rate to the monthly Current Population Survey, the data source that underlies the unemployment rate and many other key statistics, has eroded in recent years. Of the households that do respond, about a third refuse to provide information about their earnings, a rate much higher than for most other questions. Similar problems have affected other government and private-sector surveys.
"Every measure of data quality that we look at seems to have declined over time," said Bruce D. Meyer, a University of Chicago economist who has studied falling response rates.
Economists who have studied the issue say that aggregate statistics, like the overall median hourly wage, remain reliable. But falling response rates are a bigger problem when it comes to studying high or low earners, or specific demographic groups. And the shrinking sample sizes make it harder to distinguish between true patterns and statistical noise.
Government statisticians are trying to find ways to improve the data, perhaps by supplementing surveys with records from Social Security records, tax filings or other sources. But such records pose logistical and potentially legal hurdles, and often are not available on a monthly or even quarterly basis.
The private sector, too, is looking for solutions. The payroll processing firm ADP recently began releasing a quarterly report on earnings based on data it collects from 330,000 American employers.
"To really get down to the details with surveys is hard," said Ahu Yildirmaz, who heads the ADP research group that produces the report. "This is where the private data comes into the picture."
Independent economists said that data from private sources like ADP showed promise, but could not replace government statistics. And because they are relatively new, it is not clear how they will respond when a recession hits or the economy changes in other ways.

Full text: It seemed like an epic blunder: United Airlines announced that it was replacing a standard bonus with a lottery that would give nothing to most of its roughly 90,000 workers while awarding lavish prizes, like $100,000 in cash and Mercedes-Benz sedans, to a few lucky winners.
United had hoped the sweepstakes approach would "build excitement and a sense of accomplishment." But after workers deluged the company with hostile comments, the airline said last week that it was "pressing the pause button on these changes."
The fiasco pulled back the curtain on the widespread use of gamelike techniques for motivating employees.
While employers have relied on such practices for decades, the methods have become increasingly sophisticated in an age when companies can collect more data about employee behavior than ever before, and as video game technology has proliferated.
Recent studies show a rapidly growing market for so-called gamification software, some of which allows workers to earn points and badges by completing certain tasks or performing well.
Defenders say such practices can be useful -- if they are designed to make employees feel more engaged and invested in their work, not to save money. But to skeptics, the United program illustrated a deeper problem with gamelike motivational methods.
"Shareholders and management get the monetary rewards, and 'meaning' and 'excitement' are consolation prizes that go to workers," said Caitlin Petre, an assistant professor of media studies at Rutgers University who has examined similar practices at media companies. "This is very much in line with my understanding of how the gamification trend in workplaces operates."
Whatever one thinks about the ethics of workplace games, few question their potential to influence workers in certain circumstances. A pile of psychological research has shown that they can be cheaper and more effective at motivating workers than straight cash.
An experiment published in 2012 in the American Journal of Health Promotion showed that a far higher proportion of employees completed a health-risk assessment when they got a modest chance to win up to $125 in a lottery than when they would receive a $25 gift certificate.
"Lotteries in general may be more effective than fixed payments, as people tend to overweigh small probabilities in making decisions," the paper noted.
Other studies have shown that simple compliments and recognition, which gamification software frequently incorporates, may be more effective than cash in motivating workers. An experiment at a semiconductor plant, published in 2014, showed that workers' productivity rose more if they were rewarded with a note thanking them for their "hard work and great achievements in yesterday's shift" than if they were given a cash bonus worth about $25.
In principle, there is no moral problem with seeking cheaper ways to motivate workers. Compensation and motivation are two distinct concepts, and a company could decide to pay its workers fairly -- or exceedingly generously -- then deploy lotteries and praise to motivate them to perform better.
"There are two things to consider," said Kristen Berman of the behavioral consulting nonprofit Irrational Labs. "One is pay -- what do people get paid, what should they get paid, what do they expect to get paid. The second is motivating people to do things we want them to do in the workplace."
That distinction is often easiest to enforce when the tasks that employers link to gamelike rewards are narrow, and not central to a worker's job description.
Charlotte Blank, the chief behavioral officer of Maritz, which designs employee motivation and incentive programs, said lotteries could be an effective way to pique interest among salespeople in a new product but should not replace crucial components of pay.
In practice, however, many companies appear to have a hard time resisting the urge, as United did, to blur the lines between wages and motivation -- to shift from paying workers in cash to paying them with less cash and more psychic income.
"Why wouldn't they?" said Karen Levy, an assistant professor in the department of information science at Cornell University, who has studied gamelike incentives. "It's the structure of the corporation" to want to minimize labor costs.
Perhaps most prominent, so-called gig economy companies like Uber have frequently used gamelike incentives as a cheaper alternative to traditional bonuses.
Uber's operations managers have sometimes cut back on straight cash bonuses and hourly guarantees in favor of raffles and other contests, for which the prize could be a few hundred dollars or tickets to a sporting event. The goal was to get drivers onto the road during high-demand periods at a lower cost.
More traditional companies have relied on similar tactics. For example, T-Mobile sometimes puts in place short-term gamelike incentives on top of its standard bonus program. In its Wichita, Kan., call center this month, agents who hit certain performance targets receive a scratch-off ticket with a dollar value attached to it, redeemable for a variety of prizes. The company has previously rewarded agents for certain achievements with time inside a "money machine" that blows around certificates redeemable for prizes, which they try to grab.
"It sure saves them money to do this instead of pay increases," said Justin Smith, a T-Mobile customer service agent.
Mr. Smith said that the company's wage increases for his job category had barely kept up with inflation and that T-Mobile effectively reduced compensation for high performers in his department last year when it changed its standard bonus from a flat monthly payment to one tied to the number of hours they work.
"They tried to make it seem like this is the best way to do it," Mr. Smith said. But, he said, "Even if you worked every hour scheduled, it would still be 15 to 20 percent less than the old system."
A T-Mobile spokeswoman said: "We offer market-competitive base pay, one-of-a-kind stock grants and bonuses. On top of that, our leaders periodically recognize performance in other ways that best resonate with their teams."
Often companies don't actually lower compensation but push workers to do more for the same pay by using games and gamelike incentives. To motivate thousands of employees to flag translation errors in foreign-language editions of Windows, Microsoft once set up a game that allowed the employees to advance to different levels by reviewing screenshots, then displayed each worker's level on a leader board.
"Not only did they do it above and beyond their work responsibilities," wrote Kevin Werbach, a University of Pennsylvania business professor, and Dan Hunter, then a professor at New York Law School, in a book on gamification, "but a large number of them described the process as enjoyable and even addicting."
Other employers, including the Walt Disney Company and Gawker, have used scoreboards and leader boards to drive up productivity by giving workers constantly updated performance information that compares them with one another.
"In effect, that is lowering compensation," Ms. Petre said. "It has the effect of driving more and more output as people's competitive instincts kick in."
In the end, what may have set United apart was not that it tried to replace a portion of traditional compensation with "excitement" but the company's openness about the trade-off.
In the gig economy, said Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at the Data & Society Research Institute who is the author of the forthcoming book, "Uberland," non-monetary rewards that rein in labor costs, or incentives aimed at individual drivers, can work because drivers rarely have enough information to piece together the larger picture -- sometimes even their own bottom line.
"But in the United case," Ms. Rosenblat said, "everyone knows what they're earning."

Full text: The sugar industry and its various offshoots, like the soda industry, have spent years trying to trick you.
Big Sugar has paid researchers to conduct misleading -- if not false -- studies about the health effects of added sweeteners. It has come up with a dizzying array of euphemistic names for those sweeteners. And it has managed to get sugars into a remarkable three-quarters of all packaged foods in American supermarkets.
Most of us, as a result, eat a lot of sugar. We are surrounded by it, and it's delicious. Unfortunately, sugar also encourages overeating and causes health problems. As confusing as the research on diet can often seem, it consistently points to the harms of sugar, including obesity, diabetes and other diseases.
Virtually the only way to eat a healthy amount of sugar is to make a conscious effort. You can think of it as a political act: resisting the sugar industry's attempts to profit off your body. Or you can simply think of it as taking care of yourself.
I'm one of those people with a raging sweet tooth. I consider ice cream to be a gift from the gods, and I stash small chocolates in too many drawers. A couple years ago, I realized that I needed to cut back. If the ice cream and chocolates were going to stay, other sweeteners had to go.
So my wife and I went cold turkey for one month: no added sweeteners. No sugar, no honey, no corn syrup, no stevia. It wasn't easy, but it worked. We discovered which sugars we missed and would go back to eating -- and which had needlessly snuck into our diets. Along the way, we also ate fewer processed foods and more vegetables, fruit, eggs, nuts, meat and fish.
In a column last year, I described this "month without sugar," and I'm still hearing from readers who have done it themselves or are considering it. I highly recommend it. But I have also heard from readers who want to consume less sugar without first going cold turkey.
Fair enough. The sugarless month is just a means to an end, and there are other means. Working with experts and colleagues, I've now put together an online guide to cutting back on sugar without spending more money or losing the pleasure of eating. That last part is important. Done right, a less sweet diet can be more enjoyable than a sugar-packed one.
Our overarching suggestion is to choose a couple of simple rules. Don't agonize over the sugar content of every single thing you eat. You'll make yourself miserable and you will probably give up before too long. Instead, decide on two or three systemic changes, and stick to them. You can add more changes later.
Your rules should revolve around added sweeteners, rather than the natural ones in fruits, vegetables and dairy. It's not that the added ones are so much worse (despite what you may have heard about high-fructose corn syrup). Many researchers believe that sugar is sugar. But people don't generally overeat natural sugars. Have you ever inhaled five apples in one sitting?
The online guide has many more details, but here are a few rules to consider:
Fix your breakfast. It's the most sugar-packed meal, and it doesn't need to be. Eggs, fruit, nuts, plain yogurt, plain oatmeal and traditional pita bread are delicious -- and free of added sugars. If you're pressed for time, boil a dozen eggs, refrigerate them and grab one or two in the morning. A sign of a good breakfast plate: It has an array of natural colors.
Redo your pantry. Steer clear of staples -- like sauces, crackers and breads -- with unnecessary sugars. There are plenty of unsweetened alternatives, like Victoria's pasta sauces, French's Yellow Mustard, Maille Dijon mustard, Saltines, Triscuits and some Trader Joe's tortillas. Once you spend a little time reading ingredient lists, the unsweetened staples can become your defaults. Trader Joe's is an especially good place to shop, but supermarkets work, too.
Eliminate soda. Just get rid of it. Soda and sports drinks are essentially liquid sugar, and are the largest source of added sweeteners in the American diet. Switch to flavored seltzer or, if you must, diet soda. The health effects of diet soda still are not clear, but it seems considerably less bad.
Whip portion inflation. Restaurant desserts are often family-size servings marketed as individual portions. The marble-loaf cake at Starbucks, for example, has more sugar than most adults should eat in an entire day. Your grandparents didn't eat desserts like this. When you eat out, think of every dessert as a serving for two. It's better to put some in the garbage than on your waistline.
The best news about sugar is that Americans are finally catching on. Sales of regular soda are plunging. Some food brands are starting to brag about not adding sweeteners. For a long time, we didn't even realize what Big Sugar was trying to do us. Now we do -- and we can fight back.

Inflation? Bring It On. It'll Be Fine.

Full text: After many years of slow growth, the economy is now humming along at a healthy pace. The unemployment rate is at 4.1 percent, its lowest level since 2000, and wages are edging up.
But, as is too often the case when workers finally start to see some of the benefits of growth, economists are warning that higher wages will lead to inflation, and they're calling for the Federal Reserve Board to hit the brakes by raising interest rates.
What if we tried an experiment and waited until inflation actually began to rise substantially before raising interest rates too quickly? Even if prices did rise, my hypothesis is that the benefits, especially for those who haven't gained from economic growth in recent years, would exceed the costs of higher inflation. The only way to know this for sure is to allow labor markets to tighten until the pressure is just too much.
Granted, there are some risks to doing this. Economics textbooks tell us that when the unemployment rate falls below standard measures of full employment (4.7 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office) the "wage-price spiral" starts to take effect: Companies start paying more to find scarce workers, those higher wages necessitate higher prices and inflation soon becomes a nasty problem.
But recent experience has shown us that the economy can operate at low levels of unemployment -- even lower than "full employment" -- without inflation becoming a serious problem. Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred measure, has mostly remained well below its target of 2 percent since 2008.
It's not exactly clear why prices haven't risen very much. It may be because greater international competition keeps prices down; because the decline of union contracts means that fewer companies give automatic cost-of-living adjustments; because consumers can compare prices so easily on the internet; because oil prices have fallen recently; or simply because, after years of low inflation, people expect price increases to be limited.
Even if inflation does creep up above 2 percent, we shouldn't be too worried. The Fed's inflation target is not a ceiling; it's a desirable average. Having operated below it for many years, the economy may not be harmed if it runs for a few years above that target.
In fact, a high-pressure economy, with wages and prices a little higher than we've become used to, might actually do a lot of good for the people who need it most. Working families need a tight labor market -- and higher wages -- to get ahead. It would be a costly mistake to raise rates too much or too soon.
We are in the midst of a big fiscal and monetary experiment. And as with any experiment, the consequences are unknown. What we do know is that the costs of the Great Recession were enormous -- at least $4 trillion in lost income, or about $30,000 per household, according to my calculations. The biggest losses were experienced by those in the bottom and middle portions of the income distribution who lost jobs and saw much of the equity in their homes destroyed.
They are the ones who stand to gain the most if unemployment continues to fall and wages keep rising. Businesses, desperate for workers, reach deeper into the ranks of those who are still jobless, do more training to get those workers up to speed, and pay higher wages as they compete to hire or retain their work force. Discouraged workers -- the millions who've left the labor force -- might actually re-enter it, and workers could find their shrinking share of national income rise again.
Besides, economists are not sure when super-low unemployment will set off inflation. The Congressional Budget Office's current estimate for full-employment, 4.7 percent, is down from around 5.7 percent in 2012. And models used by the Fed and the budget office have failed to identify the point at which further total spending growth in the economy will bump up against a ceiling and bring not just a little more inflation but possibly an unsustainable spiral of ever-rising price growth.
It may be that the United States economy's "potential" -- estimates for what gross domestic product could be if all of our country's resources, including unemployed labor, were utilized -- is much larger than we think. A recent paper by economists at the University of Texas and the University of California, Berkeley, argues that official estimates of potential are too pessimistic.
Moreover, it's possible that letting a high-pressure economy run over a longer period will actually increase that potential by pushing firms to improve productivity and draw more workers into the labor market. The evidence is mixed but can't be dismissed.
Of course, higher growth alone may not be enough to improve the lives of those left behind over the last few years. The recent tax bill's benefits are skewed and temporary, and people do need stronger safety nets and other help to pay for the rising costs of housing, health care and college.
But a stronger economy might help the left behind as much as, if not more than, any of these specific measures. The old models don't seem to be working, and the downside risks of this experiment are limited. Let's run a truly high-pressure economy and see what happens.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead:
ECONOMY
Big sale week ahead for Treasury debt.
The supply of government bonds hitting the market has been increasing this year as budget deficits rise in the wake of the Republican tax cuts. At the same time, inflation concerns could prompt investors to ask for higher interest rates from Uncle Sam, when the Treasury auctions $21 billion in 10-year notes and $13 billion in 30-year bonds on Monday and Tuesday. Weak demand for Treasury debt at auction would push government borrowing costs up and could reverberate throughout financial markets. Matt Phillips
AUTO INDUSTRY
Volkswagen may be pressed on diesel experiments.
Volkswagen's management board will hold its annual news conference on Tuesday in Berlin. Matthias MÃ¼ller, the carmaker's chief executive, will probably want to focus on new products like the Vizzion, a roomy battery-powered sedan that Volkswagen plans to begin selling in 2022. But reporters are sure to quiz him on less pleasant topics, like experiments on monkeys that Volkswagen and other German carmakers commissioned in a botched attempt to prove that diesel fumes are benign. Jack Ewing
ECONOMY
Inflation probably slowed in February.
Last week's jobs report showed strong hiring but sluggish wage growth. That cheered investors, who have been worried that the tightening labor market could lead to faster inflation. Still, those fears haven't gone away. On Tuesday, investors will get another chance to weigh inflation risks when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases data on consumer prices in February. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the report to show that inflation cooled a bit last month after picking up unexpectedly in January. Another surprise uptick could spook markets. Federal Reserve policymakers will be watching closely, too: Tuesday's report will be one of the last major data releases before the central bank's March meeting, Jerome Powell's first as Fed chairman. Ben Casselman
Draghi may signal European bank's next steps.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will be the keynote speaker at a gathering on Wednesday in Frankfurt of economists and analysts who specialize in monetary policy. In the past Mr. Draghi has used the annual conference, known as "The ECB and its Watchers," to explain and justify central bank policy. Attention on the central bank is intense because of uncertainty about when it will end the bond purchases it has been using to hold down market interest rates and stimulate the eurozone economy. Jack Ewing
RETAIL INDUSTRY
February consumer spending expected to bounce back.
The Census Bureau is scheduled to report February's retail sales data on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for consumer spending to bounce back after an unexpected slump in January. One area of weakness, however, could come in the auto sector where car companies showed signs of a slowdown last month. Michael Corkery

Full text: Some birthday.
The bull market turned nine on Friday but any celebration was decidedly subdued.
On sheer numbers alone, the market seems to deserve much more. Born on March 9, 2009, in the depths of a major recession, this epic stock rally is now the second longest in modern history, turning $1 in stock investments into about $5 through its last peak on Jan. 26.
But that was then. The market has been erratic since late January. Already this year, it has moved up or down at least 1 percent on 17 days, most recently, with a gain on Friday. That's twice the tally for 1 percent moves for all of 2017.
From the standpoint of many investors, President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on aluminum and steel has made matters ever so much worse.
While the president's actual tariff announcement on Thursday wasn't as severe as it could have been, it still puts the country on a dangerous road, analysts said. "The odds of a really destructive trade war actually happening have ratcheted up quite a bit in the last few days," said David A. Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. It can't be eliminated as a possibility."
Inescapably, anyone familiar with basic economics and the history of the Great Depression needs to worry about the possibility of a trade war, said Edward Yardeni, an independent stock market analyst.
Mr. Yardeni, the author of a coming book, "Predicting the Markets: A Professional Autobiography," tried, gamely, to handicap the probability that trade tensions would turn virulent conflict and seriously damage the economy and the markets.
"This trade stuff isn't good in the short term, we can say that for sure," he said. "Beyond that, I can't predict very much with certainty because I don't really know how far the president is going with this and I'm not sure that he knows either."
That uncertainty puts investors in an awkward position.
It's not that the specific actions taken by President Trump -- tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum -- will wreak global havoc. Steel and aluminum may not be important enough for that: They accounted for only 2 percent of American imports last year, or 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, as The Economist has pointed out.
Furthermore, on Thursday, Mr. Trump carved out exceptions even to this particular trade restriction. He said that for now, at least, he would not impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, two of America's closest allies, pending renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and might not impose them on Australia, either.
Still the president has begun what, if it continues, would be a colossal shift in longstanding United States policy. Instead of relying on multilateral institutions that have been pillars of world trade -- and American power -- since World War II, the president vowed to revise America's approach, stressing bilateral costs and benefits, and national security, very narrowly defined.
The Trump tilt has left many people flabbergasted.
Michael Froman, who served as United States trade representative in the Barack Obama administration, said he was troubled by this possible shift. "I don't really know what it means to enter a global trade war" as government policy, he said on a conference call at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is a distinguished fellow.
Serious people, he said, have tried to devise ways to "exit trade wars," not start them. Mr. Froman pointed out that foreign governments -- including close allies -- have already prepared lists of American exports targeted for retaliation.
The European Union, for example, says it might begin with American products like Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and blue jeans, and go on from there. Once such a process begins, it could spiral downward, with the tit-for-tat tariffs between America and its trading partners during the Great Depression a vivid historical lesson.
The implications are chilling, in the view of many strategists.
On Wednesday, for example, Marco Pirondini, head of United States equities at Amundi Pioneer in Boston, declared in a note to investors that President Trump had begun a "dangerous" and "risky" second phase of his economic agenda. The first phase, he said, "focused on tax cuts and deregulation" with "extremely positive" results for corporate earnings, many taxpayers and investors in the stock market.
Now, however, with the resignation of Gary D. Cohn, the president's top economic adviser, who opposed Mr. Trump's shift on trade, it is clear that Mr. Trump "is focused on changing trade relations as a means of reducing trade deficits and incentivizing U.S.-based production," Mr. Pirondini said.
Many global companies will suffer, he said, adding that Mr. Trump's policy is likely to be accompanied by "increasing inflationary pressures and margin pressure for corporations, and more volatility for equities."
In an interview, he added that Mr. Trump was using "theatrical" methods to improve his negotiating position. That could have unforeseen negative consequences.
Mr. Pirondini said he did not expect that the president would actually embrace a full-scale trade war -- which he defined as a contraction in global trade that exceeds any associated economic contraction. But he said Mr. Trump's policy tilt might ignite a series of conflicts with America's trade partners, to say nothing of the Asian giant that appears to be the real focus of Mr. Trump's ire: China. Until trade tensions are resolved, he said, the stock market is likely to endure episodes of heightened turmoil.
As if the market needed more drama this year. Mr. Rosenberg of Gluskin Sheff says stocks have entered "a late-stage bull market." Factors like rising interest rates, soaring debt loads, incipient inflation and stretched valuations have made equities vulnerable, he said.
The stock market is already in what, in Wall Street jargon, is correction territory: By Feb. 8, stocks had declined more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 peak and haven't recovered all their losses.
"There is a very good chance that we will have another 10 percent correction, below the trough that the market hit in February," Mr. Rosenberg said.
By some definitions, a decline of 20 percent or more would end the bull market. That may be semantics, however. A bear market, in Mr. Rosenberg's view, would be associated with a "pernicious and protracted decline." Because the economy is reasonably strong -- and stimulus from the recent tax cut has not had its full effect -- stocks could rebound quickly, he said.
Whatever you call it, Mr. Rosenberg counsels prepare for a coming decline by raising the cash portion of their portfolios.
Many other strategists are more sanguine.
Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist with Ned Davis Research Group, said that a technical analysis of the market showed that it had "retested" important support levels. "Market breadth isn't what we'd want to see," he said, "and if the market remains choppy for a very long time, that will be a concern. But so far, so good."
Laszlo Birinyi, an independent analyst who has weathered decades of crises, said, "I don't think we will know how important these trade issues are for a long time, so it's best not to pay too much attention to them. Many big events in the news -- Brexit, the November election -- set off panics but turn out to be fine for the stock market."
Mr. Yardeni points to the benefits of the new tax law, which has nearly doubled Wall Street's expectations for the earnings growth rate of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, to 19 percent from 10.
"That hasn't all been factored into stock prices yet," he said. "We may have to get through these trade issues first. But I don't think the bull market is over yet."

Economy, in Sweet Spot, Adds 313,000 Jobs. It May Get Sweeter.

Full text: There are 39 pages in the Labor Department's February report on the employment situation in the United States, but they can be summed up in four words: The economy is humming.
The 313,000 jobs that the nation added in February are far more than are needed to keep up with population growth and continue a surprising burst of job creation to start the year. In the first two months of 2018, the economy has added an average of 276,000 jobs a month, a big step up from 182,000 on average in 2017.
This is not the kind of data you expect in an expansion that is nine years old, or out of a labor market that is already at full employment. It suggests that employers are filling jobs not merely from people they've poached from competitors, but also from more people who have entered the work force. And other data in the latest report matches that idea.
The number of adults not in the labor force fell by a whopping 653,000 people, as the participation rate -- the proportion of adults who either have a job or are looking for one -- rose a healthy 0.3 percent to 63 percent. The proportion of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) who are working is at its highest level since 2008.
For a couple of years now, there has been a vigorous debate over just how close the American economy is to full capacity, a discussion that has particularly big implications for how the Fed manages the economy. On one side are those who worry about overheating: Given the 4.1 percent jobless rate (that number was unchanged in February), if the economy is allowed to boom, it will create inflation rather than improvement in real living standards.
The other side of this debate might be called the "let it run" camp, who argue that a lot of good things might happen if the Fed and other policymakers move patiently and see whether some of the damage done by the 2008 recession might repair itself in a sufficiently hot economy.
Friday was a good day for the "let it run" folks. The huge gain in the number of people working is a prime example of the kind of good thing that they've been predicting might happen if the economy had more room to improve than that 4.1 percent jobless number might suggest.
Wall Street has been particularly focused on wage growth as an indicator of which story is more compelling -- and more to the point, which story the Fed chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the Fed will find more persuasive. And here, too, the February numbers are in a sweet spot.
In January, when the year-over-year rate of growth in average hourly earnings rose to 2.9 percent, it even set off a mini-panic in the stock market, contributing to a broad reassessment of inflation risks in the economy.
Never mind. Average hourly earnings growth fell back to 2.6 percent in February. The data on wages is a little better than that number would suggest despite the softness in the year-over-year data. Since October, average hourly earnings are up more than 1 percent, which if annualized comes to 3.2 percent, meaning that despite a soft February number this winter has been a time of acceleration in wage growth.
For those who want a robust recovery, it's a delicate balance on wages. On one hand, now that most people who want a job have one, higher pay is the way most Americans would hope to see a reward from a hot economy. But as stock investors correctly concluded last month, if wages start rising too fast given weak gains in worker productivity, it would probably prompt Mr. Powell and his colleagues to tap the brakes on the economy a little harder (that is, raise interest rates more than they would otherwise).
But the February numbers are a delicious sweet spot for the economy. Many more people are working, including people who hadn't even been in the labor force. If that trend continues -- and it's worth adding the usual caveat that each month's jobs numbers are subject to revision and statistical error -- there's no reason to think this expansion is reaching its natural end.
Yes, it would be nice to see paychecks rise faster, but the saving grace of the fact that they aren't is that it allows the Fed a little more room for patience, strengthening the arguments of the "let it run" faction inside the central bank.
Nine years into an economic expansion, jobs reports don't get much better than this.

Full text: Wall Street got exactly what it wanted from Friday's jobs report: solid hiring, moderate wage growth and continued low unemployment. Investors sent stocks sharply higher, particularly their recent favorites, technology companies.
American employers added 313,000 jobs in February, more than forecast, and wages didn't rise as much as investors had feared. The Labor Department also said January's rise in wages was a bit smaller than it originally thought. It made for a happy ninth anniversary for the current bull market.
A month earlier, an increase in wages got investors worried about inflation and set off a stock market swoon, giving the benchmark S.&.P 500-index its first 10 percent decline in two years.
Bond yields also moved higher as investors anticipated that the solid jobs survey portends more steady growth in the American economy.
The Nasdaq composite regained the last of its February losses and closed at a record high. Banks also rose as interest rates increased, and industrial and health care and basic materials companies also climbed. Those sectors tend to do better when the economy is growing quickly.
The S.&P. 500-index climbed 47.60 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,786.57. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 440.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 25,335.74. The Nasdaq composite jumped 132.86 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,560.81. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 25.18 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,597.14.
Apple rose $3.04, or 1.7 percent, to $179.98, and Microsoft climbed $2.11, or 2.2 percent, to $96.54. Both finished at record highs. Technology companies have led the market's rally since early 2017, and they have led the recovery from its recent lows as well.
The S.&P. 500 is still 3 percent beneath its latest record high close, which came on Jan. 26. None of the other major S.&P. sectors have recovered all of their February losses, as technology has.
Bond prices dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.90 percent from 2.85 percent. Banks advanced, but high-dividend stocks like utilities and phone companies fell. Those stocks are often compared to bonds, and they tend to fall when yields move higher, as higher yields make them less appealing to investors seeking income.
Stocks initially declined last week after President Trump said he would place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. They have recovered their losses after he granted exemptions to Canada, Mexico and potentially to other countries.
Netflix rose $14.44, or 4.6 percent, to $331.44 after The New York Times reported that the streaming service was negotiating with former President Barack Obama to have him and his wife, Michelle, produce shows. The two sides have not confirmed that they are in talks. Daniel Ives, an analyst for GBH Insights, said a deal with the Obamas would be "another major win for Netflix" as it tries to create more and more original shows.
Toymakers fell after news reports that Toys "R" Us is getting ready to liquidate its American operations. The chain, which filed for bankruptcy protection, has been unable to find a buyer or restructure its debt. Despite its struggles, it is still a major retailer of toys. Hasbro dropped $1.92, or 2.1 percent, to $91.46, while Mattel sank $1.13, or 7.1 percent, to $14.84.
Energy companies climbed as benchmark U.S. crude added $1.92, or 3 percent, to $62.04 a barrel in New York, while brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.88, or 3 percent, to $65.49 a barrel in London.
Elsewhere, wholesale gasoline added 4 cents to $1.90 a gallon. Heating oil rose 3 cents to $1.89 a gallon. Natural gas lost 4 cents to $2.73 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose $2.30 to $1,324 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $16.61 an ounce. Copper increased 6 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $3.14 a pound.
The dollar rose to 106.77 yen from 106.24 yen. The euro rose to $1.2313 from $1.2306.

Full text: Whether you work on Wall Street or in a warehouse, behind a cash register or on a construction site, the jobs report released by the government on Friday offered some good news.
A winning combination of hefty job creation and a swelling work force signaled the economy's fundamental strength. At the same time, modest wage growth defused concerns that competition for workers was driving up salaries and igniting inflation.
In all, the nation added 313,000 jobs in February, the most since July 2016, with impressive gains across low-, middle- and high-wage industries.
For the fifth month in a row, the jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. And hundreds of thousands of people streamed into the job market, confounding analysts who have insisted that the pool of potential workers has been depleted.
"I love it," said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "We were able to create enough jobs to accommodate new seekers and keep the unemployment rate steady."
And on Twitter, President Trump relayed the news in capital letters: "JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!"
For workers, the modest 0.1 percent rise in average hourly earnings was disappointing. Since October, year-over-year wage growth had been shooting up at a much faster monthly rate compared with the characteristic plodding increases that have whittled down the standard of living for millions of low- and middle-income Americans.
Some of those gains were reversed in February, leaving the 12-month average at 2.6 percent, higher than last year's average, but still below what many economists think a tight job market should yield.
For Wall Street, the overall report was a dream.
The sizable jump in average hourly earnings in January was widely cited as causing a market sell-off last month over speculation that the Federal Reserve might raise rates more aggressively than it has planned. That could put a damper on lending, hiring and business expansion.
Instead, the report seems to keep the Fed on course for three increases of a quarter-point in the benchmark interest rate this year, starting when it meets this month for the first time under its new chairman, Jerome H. Powell.
"A strong jobs report with less wage inflation tells the market that current concern about the wage issue is overblown," said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse. "The market has to think that is terrific."
Stocks were up strongly in Friday's trading after the report was released.
R. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary, credited the recent tax bill for continuing to "boost economic confidence."
Mr. Golub, however, doubted the tax cuts should get much credit for this report, noting that the synchronized global recovery has been strong since the middle of 2016.
Other administration policies could make February's report particularly significant, however. With Mr. Trump's move to put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and growing talk of a trade war, last month's numbers could establish a baseline to measure the impact of trade restrictions and retaliation over the coming months. Manufacturing job gains, for example, totaled 31,000, more than twice the January figure.
"We need to hire 300 people in the next 90 days," said Brian Krenke, president of KI, an employee-owned furniture maker based in Green Bay, Wis. "It's different from years ago, when people were lining up for jobs."
The company employs roughly 2,800 workers in its six factories. Mr. Krenke said he was looking for both entry-level and skilled workers, aggressively recruiting people graduating from high school and technical colleges. "It's stressful," he said, because "other companies are all doing the same things."
Just as businesses focus on the customer experience, Mr. Krenke said employers must pay more attention to the worker experience. "We want them to walk away from the interview saying this is really an organization we want to work for," he said. "You really need to be much more flexible and accommodating these days."
In some sectors, the competition for workers has become fierce.
Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said she had heard reports of trucking companies paying drivers six-figure salaries, plus $20,000 signing bonuses to lure them from competitors. Companies are also offering to train new drivers -- even though many end up being poached by other companies.
"For years and years, the trucking companies said they couldn't find drivers, but they wouldn't raise wages," Ms. Swonk said. "Well, now they are."
The construction industry is also booming. Employers added 61,000 jobs last month -- a hefty number for the off-season -- bringing four-month total gains to 185,000.
Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, an online recruiting site, noticed a significant increase in construction job postings over the past week without a corresponding response from applicants.
The mismatch could grow significantly under Mr. Trump's plan to encourage local, state and private investment in infrastructure. "If there is public interest in infrastructure, where do workers come from?" Mr. Kolko asked. "Does that end up bidding up construction wages and competing with other kinds of construction activity already underway?"
The monthly report from the Labor Department provides only a snapshot of the economy. February's figures will be revised up or down twice more, and January's once more.
Nonetheless, job growth has been consistently strong in recent months. The labor force participation rate climbed back to the 63 percent mark, and the unemployment rate for blacks fell to 6.9 percent after popping up in January. (Read more about signs that the economy is looking stronger and stronger.)
Amid the optimistic reactions, however, a persistent lack of employment among large numbers of working-age men continues to haunt the economy.
Although large economic differences across regions have always been a characteristic of the United States, that gap appears to be widening. The Harvard University economists Benjamin Austin, Edward Glaeser and Lawrence H. Summers argue that the disparities are sharp among three regions: the prosperous coasts; the Western heartland, with its natural resources and higher education levels; and the Eastern heartland, which extends roughly from Mississippi to Michigan.
That area is suffering from a glut of social and economic ills, including joblessness, disability, opioid-related deaths and rising mortality, they said.
"The income and employment gaps between three regions are not converging, but instead seem to be hardening," they write in a paper published in the latest edition of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity. "America appears to be evolving into durable islands of wealth and poverty."
Rather than moving to higher-income areas to take advantage of employment opportunities, people remain stranded in areas that are economic dead ends. Among the reasons are rising housing costs and the difficulty of transferring assistance like Medicaid across state lines. That's why a national shortage of workers does not necessarily translate into jobs for harder-to-employ people.
Outside of these depressed pockets, though, the economy is plowing forward.
"Despite the slowdown in the year-over-year wage number, this was an incredibly strong jobs report with widespread benefits," Mr. Kolko said. "Two of the most important household surveys were at their best level in almost 10 years," he added, referring to a drop in the number of people who have been unemployed for more than half a year, and an increase in the proportion of prime-age workers (25 to 54 years old) in the labor force.
"Today was remarkable," he added. "It's really hard to find any bad news."

Full text: FRANKFURT -- Political instability in a heavily indebted eurozone country. The prospect of a trade war with the United States. Stock market turmoil.
None of it fazed the European Central Bank, which took another small step back from crisis mode on Thursday.
The bank's policymakers, who set monetary policy for the 19-nation euro area, held interest rates steady, but dropped language from their communiquÃ© in which they had promised to ramp up economic stimulus measures again "if the outlook becomes less favorable."
It was a subtle but important change. By omitting the phrase, which it has repeated since December 2016, the central bank was in effect saying that the eurozone was no longer in imminent danger of going up in flames, and that it was time to begin stowing the fire hoses.
The expression of confidence came despite warnings from Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, about trade tensions with the United States.
Mr. Draghi, in an obvious reference to President Trump's plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, said during a news conference that it was "dangerous" for countries to change the terms of trade unilaterally, rather than through negotiations.
The protectionist measures were part of a general diplomatic deterioration, Mr. Draghi added, and could damage the confidence that businesses needed before they would invest in expansion and hiring.
"If you put tariffs against your allies," Mr. Draghi said, "one wonders who the enemies are."
It was the second news conference in a row in which Mr. Draghi had expressed exasperation with the Trump administration. In January, he accused Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. treasury secretary, of violating international agreements by making comments that caused the dollar to fall against the euro, giving American products a price advantage in foreign markets.
Still, the European Central Bank's Governing Council was not alarmed enough by the potential trade war to interrupt its gradual exit from the emergency measures it has used to keep the eurozone from falling apart during a decade of financial and economic turmoil.
While Thursday's communiquÃ© merely omitted a single sentence, and Mr. Draghi sought to downplay the importance of the change, investors appeared to find it significant.
Markets reacted swiftly, with the euro jumping as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar, and the yield on the German 10-year bond, the benchmark for the region, rising five basis points.
"It's a tacit acknowledgment that the economic outlook in Europe is rosier than it was," James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in a statement. He added, "The reaction should not be overdone. This is an infinitesimal step forwards."
Some analysts had predicted that the central bank would make no changes in the language it uses to communicate its intentions to financial markets, in light of a confused election result in Italy.
On Sunday about half of Italians voted for populist candidates on the left and right, and left no party with a clear mandate to form a government. There is now very little chance that the country will make the sweeping changes needed to break its economy out of prolonged stagnation.
Its political deadlock and economic doldrums are a threat to the rest of the common currency area. Italy's government debt, measured as a percentage of economic output, is among the highest in the world and, in Europe, second only to Greece's.
But Italy also has the eurozone's third-largest economy, with output 10 times that of Greece, making it a far bigger danger to the region's financial stability if investors begin to doubt the government's solvency.
"We have to bury the hope that Italy will catch up with Germany and France with reforms," Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German bank, said over lunch with reporters in Frankfurt on Tuesday. "Italy will more likely worsen its ability to carry its debt."
The European Central Bank was also unfazed by the ups and downs of global stock markets since the Governing Council last met on monetary policy. Mr. Draghi pointed out that the market turmoil was centered on the United States and "it was pretty short."
As expected, the Governing Council opted on Thursday to leave monetary policy unchanged. Interest rates will remain at a record low level.
There is a faction on the Governing Council that is worried that inflation, now dormant, could get out of hand if the central bank waits too long to stop its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing intended to stimulate the economy.
That faction has been in the minority, but appeared to win the upper hand on Thursday.

Full text: After hours of indecisive trading, stocks finished with modest gains Thursday after President Donald Trump formally ordered tariffs on steel and aluminum imports with the terms were less harsh than investors had feared.
Stocks rallied following reports that Canada and Mexico will be exempted indefinitely from the tariffs and that other countries will be invited to negotiate for exemptions as well.
Congressional Republicans and business leaders oppose the tariffs and have pushed for a more measured approach that would invite less backlash from other countries.
"The president's tone was far more pragmatic," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "This certainly is not the strict tariff proposal that the president had suggested in the past couple of weeks."
Health care companies rose after pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts accepted a $52 billion offer from health insurer Cigna. Tech companies also moved higher, but energy companies slipped along with oil prices.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 12.17 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,738.97. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 93.85 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,895.21. The Nasdaq composite rose for the fifth day in a row, gaining 31.30 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,427.95.
Friday could prove to be another dramatic day on Wall Street as investors review the government's February jobs report. Stocks tumbled after the January report showed unexpectedly strong growth in wages, which set off worries about inflation.
The Cigna deal is the latest in a string of proposed deals as health care's bill payers attempt to get a grip on rising costs. Express Scripts jumped $6.30, or 8.6 percent, to $79.72 while Cigna lost $22.25, or 11.5 percent, to $172.
Grocery store Kroger posted a bigger fourth-quarter profit and said its digital sales almost doubled in the past year, but its profit forecast for the current year disappointed investors. Kroger expects to earn between $1.95 and $2.15 a share for the year, while FactSet says analysts expected a profit of $2.15 per share on average. The stock fell $3.25, or 12.4 percent, to $22.98.
Newspaper publisher Tronc plunged $4.77, or 24.1 percent, to $15.05 after its quarterly profit fell far short of Wall Street's forecasts.
Benchmark United States crude fell $1.03, or 1.7 percent, to $60.12 a barrel in New York. That led to more losses for energy companies.
Investors expect February's jobs report will show another month of strong hiring. According to FactSet, they expect to see that hourly wages grew 2.8 percent. That would be similar to last month's report, which caught investors by surprise and helped touch off a nine-day, 10 percent plunge for the S.&P. 500, which has yet to fully recover.
Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.86 percent from 2.88 percent.
Gold lost $6.10 to $1,319.90 an ounce.
The dollar inched up to 106.24 yen from 106.07 yen. The euro fell to $1.2312 from $1.2411.

Who's Won Trade Wars In the Past

Full text: With President Trump ordering steep new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum on Thursday, and with America's trading partners threatening to retaliate, it looks as if Mr. Trump will get the trade war that he seems to want and that he thinks will be "easy" for the United States to win.
"Trade wars aren't so bad," he had said at the White House on Wednesday.
Which made me wonder: What trade wars does Mr. Trump have in mind?
The most prominent trade war of the 20th century was ignited by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930, which imposed steep tariffs on roughly 20,000 imported goods. Led by Canada, America's trading partners retaliated with tariffs on United States exports, which plunged 61 percent from 1929 to 1933. The tariffs were repealed in 1934.
Historians and economists continue to debate the extent of the damage to the global economy, but there is little disagreement that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing trade war exacerbated and prolonged the hardships of the Great Depression. Many historians contend it also contributed to the rise of the Nazis and other fascist parties. There is almost universal agreement that no one "won" that trade war.
Smoot-Hawley "was such a disaster that it's held sway over American trade policy for over 80 years," said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also teaches international trade law at Johns Hopkins University. "No one wants to repeat it."
He called Mr. Trump's comments on trade wars "a dramatic departure" from economic orthodoxy.
On the question of who wins, "the easy answer is to say that no one wins a trade war," said Marc-William Palen, a professor of history at the University of Exeter in Britain and the author of "The 'Conspiracy' of Free Trade," which examines trade rivalry between the United States and the British Empire in the 19th century. "But the more I reflect on it, it seems the winners are those nations that don't take part."
Professor Palen cited the late-19th-century trade wars between Canada and the United States, which caused a precipitous drop in Canadian exports to America and led Canada to seek export markets in Britain. "The British Empire was the winner," he said.
Another "big winner" from a trade war it was not involved in, Professor Palen said, was Soviet Russia, which was largely shunned by Western trading partners after the 1917 revolution and the rise of communism, and was desperate for hard currency. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Professor Palen said, caused countries like Italy to abandon American imports and resume trading with the Soviets, forging trade links that persist today.
A textbook case of one country's "winning" a trade war occurred during the late 19th century when a newly unified Italy imposed steep tariffs on imports from France in order to spur domestic industrialization. France, which was much richer and stronger, retaliated with tariffs against Italy, and Italian exports to France collapsed. Even after Italy abandoned its tariffs, France continued to punish Italy for years with high tariffs.
"France won in the sense that the trade war was brutal for the Italians," said John Conybeare, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Iowa, and the author of the book "Trade Wars."
Professor Conybeare said an enduring lesson from that trade conflict was that if there is a wide disparity in economic strength between two countries, the stronger country will probably prevail. "Trump must be thinking that the large size of the U.S. domestic market gives it a lot of bargaining power in any trade dispute," he said.
While that may be true with much smaller, weaker countries, it is not the case with trading partners of equal or even larger size, such as the European Union and China. "Without that large disparity in economic strength, both sides lose," Professor Conybeare said.
He cited what have become known as the "chicken wars" of the early 1960s, a trade dispute set off when Germany and France imposed tariffs on American chicken. The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States "lost" the war.
The biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available.
There were also unintended consequences. American automakers, insulated from foreign competition by the tariffs, failed to modernize, improve quality or reduce costs, setting the stage for a decades-long decline, which for Chrysler and General Motors ended in bankruptcy.
Much the same can be said of the United States steel industry, which since World War II has probably received more protection from tariffs and quotas than any other industry. "They just used the protection to raise prices, fatten profits, pay their executives more and avoid automating and reducing costs," Professor Conybeare said. "They didn't use the breathing space they gained to modernize. So much of the U.S. steel industry is using obsolete technology, which is why they can't compete."
Decades of tariff protection have done little to stem the industry's decline. Domestic steel employment dropped from 135,000 in 2000 to 83,600 in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Much like Mr. Trump, President George W. Bush veered from Republican free trade orthodoxy in 2002 when he imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain steel products to counter what he claimed was a surge of imports (Canada, Mexico and a number of developing countries were exempted). Although the tariffs were loudly condemned by many Republicans, politicians from steel-producing states supported the move and protectionist Democrats like Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued that the measures did not go far enough.
The European Union filed charges with the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the tariffs were illegal and discriminatory and authorized up to $2 billion in retaliatory measures. The E.U. threatened tariffs on a variety of American products, including autos and Florida oranges.
Mr. Bush abandoned the tariffs in December 2003. He claimed that they had served their purpose, but subsequent studies suggested that they had little impact on employment in the industry and led to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in industries that use steel as a raw material.
Mr. Trump's pronouncements on trade this week "sound like a very archaic, 19th-century argument," Professor Palen said, referring to a time when protectionism was Republican orthodoxy and Representative William McKinley of Ohio, who later became president, was successfully promoting his Tariff Act of 1890, which raised the average duty on imports to nearly 50 percent.
The act is widely considered by historians to have been a disaster that led to higher consumer prices and inflation and provoked a voter backlash. Republicans lost their House majority in 1890 and lost the White House and both houses of Congress in 1892. The act was repealed in 1894.
In any trade war, as that example suggests, "the big losers are consumers, who are the vast majority of people," Professor Palen said. "A few industries may benefit, but there are way more losers than winners. And the poor are the biggest losers of all. People like Trump may not care that much about paying a few extra dollars. But a lot of people don't have that luxury."
