Full text: In the 1950s, a pack of Camels could be had for as little as 25 cents in some parts of the country. But in New York City today, heavy taxes have pushed that price north of $13. Even adjusted for inflation, that's more than a fivefold increase. In the intervening years, we have also banned smoking in restaurants, bars and public buildings. Some jurisdictions have prohibited smoking even in outdoor public spaces. We have spent billions of dollars on media campaigns to discourage smoking.
Given the longstanding American hostility to social engineering, each of these steps faced heavy pushback. When called on to justify them, regulators have offered their traditional response: Restricting individual freedom is often the only way to prevent undue harm to innocent bystanders.
The specific harm cited has almost always been well-documented health hazards caused by secondhand smoke. This rationale is similar to the one for requiring catalytic converters on cars: We need them to prevent pollution that would otherwise cause undue harm to others.
But unless you work in a crowded bar with no ventilation, the health risks from secondhand smoke are small compared with those from being a smoker. For example, more than 85 percent of American deaths from lung cancer are attributable to smoking, with fewer than one-third of the remainder linked to passive smoke exposure. Regulators may insist that their aim is not to protect smokers from themselves, but our regulations do vastly more to protect smokers (by inducing them to quit) than to protect bystanders.
In fact, smoking also harms bystanders in a more important way: Each person who becomes a smoker makes it more likely that others will become smokers as well. This additional effect outweighs the harm caused by secondhand smoke by enough to suggest that our efforts to discourage smoking, strict as they seem, may not be nearly strict enough.
Some are more sensitive than others to environmental influences. I have four adult sons, none of whom is a smoker. I once remarked to a friend that if they had grown up when I did, at least two of them would be. My son Chris, who was present during this conversation, immediately asked, "Which two?" "David (my oldest) almost certainly would have been," I said, "and Hayden (my youngest) probably would have been, too." I added that Jason wouldn't have smoked no matter when he had been born. Chris seemed offended, insisting that he, too, probably would have become a smoker if he had grown up when I did.
When I started smoking at age 14 in 1959, many of my friends had already been smoking for several years. My parents didn't want me to smoke, but as smokers themselves, they were poorly positioned to object. In those days, more than 60 percent of American men were smokers, and almost as many women. Smoking was just something that most people did.
Yet even then, people who smoked did not seem happy about it. Today, roughly 90 percent of smokers say they regret having started, and about 80 percent express a desire to quit. Some 40 to 50 percent of smokers try to quit each year, but fewer than 5 percent of them succeed. Several of my own attempts to quit failed. So I count myself fortunate to have abandoned the habit before leaving home for college.
The reason I succeeded in raising my children to be nonsmokers and my parents did not is that today's environment is very different from the earlier one. By far the most powerful predictor of whether a person will smoke is the percentage of her closest friends who smoke. If the share of smokers in someone's peer group rises to 30 percent from 20 percent, for example, the probability that she will smoke rises by about 25 percent. Whereas most of my teenage friends were smokers, relatively few of my sons' friends were. In 2016, only about 19 percent of American men were smokers, and only about 14 percent of women.
Today's environment is different mostly because of the taxes and other regulatory measures we have taken to discourage smoking. Well and good, but does anyone think that still having more than one smoker in six people is a desirable population ratio?
Our stated rationale for discouraging smoking -- to prevent harm caused by secondhand smoke -- greatly understates the amount of harm that these actions prevent. When a regulation results in one smoker fewer, every friend of that person will have one smoker fewer in her peer group. Every member of every one of those peer groups will then become less likely to smoke. And that, in turn, will make others less likely to smoke, and so on.
Most people don't like being regulated, but even strict libertarians concede the legitimacy of regulations to prevent undue harm to others. As John Stuart Mill memorably wrote in "On Liberty": "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant."
Causing someone to be more likely to smoke clearly inflicts substantial harm on that person. I have never heard even the staunchest libertarian say, "I hope my children grow up to be smokers." Further discouraging smoking now will make it much easier to raise children to be nonsmokers.
Evidence suggests that stricter measures to discourage smoking would make even smokers themselves happier. In a 2005 study, for example, the economists Jonathan Gruber and Sendhil Mullainathan found that people with a higher propensity to smoke were significantly happier in places with higher cigarette taxes. Higher taxes, they noted, made it easier for smokers to quit.
Today's regulations to discourage smoking are strict, yes. But without violating libertarian sensibilities, we could adopt even stricter measures.

Full text: After another solid monthly jobs report, technology companies again led the way as U.S. stocks rose for the fourth day in a row to start 2018. They are on their longest new-year winning streak in eight years. The Labor Department said employers added 148,000 jobs in December. That was a bit less than experts expected, but still underscored the continued health of the economy. Wages grew and factory managers received more new orders than in any month since 2004. Health care and consumer-focused companies also rose, and the weaker dollar gave industrial firms like Boeing and basic materials makers a lift.
Wages and worker productivity are rising at about the same rate, according to Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a fund manager owned by Prudential Financial. He said if that trend continues, company profits should stay solid and inflation would not be much of a risk to the economy.
Productivity growth has been weak in recent years, but it jumped 3 percent in the third quarter. Mr. Keon said new technologies might now be helping businesses in a bigger way.
"It's possible that we're on the verge of a new productivity revolution," he said.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 19.16 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,743.15, and rose 2.6 percent for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average added 220.74 points, or 0.9 percent, to 25,295.87. The Nasdaq composite index rose 58.64 points, or 0.8 percent, to 7,136.56. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 4.29 point, or 0.3 percent, to 1,560.01.
The last time stocks rose for at least four consecutive days to start a new year was in 2010, when the S.&P. 500 finished higher for six days in a row. It rose 1.9 percent over that run.
While job growth has slowed with the economy close to full employment, solid economic growth in both the United States and major countries overseas is still supporting more hiring.
Apple gained $1.97, or 1.1 percent, to $175. Alphabet, Google's parent company, picked up $14.53, or 1.3 percent, to $1,110.29. The chip maker Xilinx jumped $3.66, or 5.2 percent, to $74.15. eBay added $1.12, or 2.9 percent, to $39.69.
Consumer-focused and health care companies also stand to benefit from sustained economic growth. Amazon climbed $19.55, or 1.6 percent, to $1,229.14. Netflix advanced $4.36, or 2.1 percent, to $209.99. The used car retailer CarMax edged up $2.79, or 4.1 percent, to $71.04.
Among health care companies, Align Technology, which doubled last year, surged $7.77, or 3.3 percent, to $241.07, and the contact lens and surgical products maker Cooper Companies gained $6.95, or 3.1 percent, to $230.50.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.47 percent from 2.45 percent. The yield on the two-year note rose to 1.96 percent from 1.95 percent.
Facing competition from Amazon, Barnes & Noble fell to its lowest price since 1994 after the bookseller said its sales slumped over the holidays. Barnes & Noble sank 90 cents, or 13.8 percent, to $5.60.
Benchmark U.S. crude lost 57 cents to $61.44 a barrel in New York.
Gold rose 70 cents to $1,322.30 an ounce and silver picked up 2 cents to $17.29 an ounce. Copper slipped 3 cents to $3.23 a pound.
The dollar rose to 113.14 yen from 112.74 yen. The euro slipped to $1.2050 from $1.2072.

Full text: The bustling United States economy is beginning to benefit some American workers who have not gotten a taste of the recovery and have been most in need of relief. That picture was reinforced by a report on Friday from the Labor Department, which showed an increase of 148,000 jobs last month. The figure fell short of economists' expectations, but some of the most impressive job gains in the past year were in blue-collar and service industries that pay a decent salary.
Over all, average hourly earnings were 2.5 percent higher in December compared with the year before, scarcely keeping up with inflation. But other data shows that wages have increased most for the least-educated workers and for people in many industries that are generally low-paying.
"Growth is strong, and the benefits of this growth have been widely shared," Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com, a job-search site. "This has been a year in which some of the gaps in the economy that had been growing narrowed a bit."
Manual-labor positions are the kinds of jobs that President Trump has promised to bring back in droves, so progress could be politically important. Hiring picked up fastest in construction and mining. Manufacturing, which lost jobs in 2016, expanded last year at a respectable clip, part of a global resurgence.
Reflecting the economy's resilience, overall hiring in 2017 was only slightly lower than in 2016 -- and it has risen for 87 consecutive months, a remarkable feat.
The unemployment rate was steady at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low. The numbers point to an economy that still has some room to grow.
In a Twitter post on Wednesday, Mr. Trump cited the unemployment rate as evidence that the economy is "only getting better!" When he took office last January, the rate was 4.8 percent.
Most economists say presidents do not generally determine the economy's course, and it is too early to measure the hiring effects of the tax cut signed into law last month. But Mr. Trump's agenda may be having an impact on the economy in other ways. His push to dismantle regulations on businesses seems to have emboldened corporations to start putting more money into machines and plants, the kind of spending that drives broad growth.
A separate survey of manufacturers released on Wednesday suggested that American factories have picked up their orders, production and hiring over the past year.
Democrats offered a less sanguine view of the labor market, asserting that most Americans were still enduring paltry raises and that the Republican tax plan was a boon only to the upper stratum of the country. Among the solutions advocated by Democrats is to increase the minimum wage, as 18 states did on Jan. 1.
"The American economy is unbalanced," Representative Joe Crowley of New York, the leader of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. "Workers struggle to find financial security while special interests, corporations, and the richest among us enjoy lavish tax breaks."
Wages have been one of the most intensely debated puzzles of the labor market, with incomes growing at a more sluggish rate than the hiring demand would suggest.
There are signs beneath the surface, though, that more widespread wage growth may be around the corner.
The security industry, for example, where pay is below average, showed a 7 percent increase in hourly earnings in November from a year earlier. Workers in clothing stores and food services -- two huge, generally low-paying businesses -- saw wages rise by around 4 percent in that period.
In areas where unemployment has dipped below the national rate, pay has begun to accelerate. Cities where joblessness is 3.5 percent or lower have had an impressive 4 percent year-over-year increase in earnings, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
In Indianapolis, where unemployment reached 3.1 percent in November, wages for jobs in the private sector rose by nearly 5 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.
"If the unemployment rate everywhere gets to 3.5 percent, then wage growth everywhere will get to 4 percent," Mr. Shepherdson said.
That kind of tightening may nudge some employers who have resisted giving raises.
"The wage growth rate kicking in isn't an automatic thing that happens in the economy," said Cathy Barrera, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, a job-listing platform. "It requires employers to feel that friction, that competition for talent, to change what they offer recruits."
E-commerce companies have begun to raise wages in hot warehouse markets, such as Memphis or the Inland Empire in Southern California, said Bill Ravenscroft, a senior vice president at Adecco Staffing USA. The agency employs around 60,000 workers, hiring more during the holiday season, and places many in distribution centers and warehouses often used by e-commerce giants.
But employers are not taking that approach across the board. Many are vying for pickers, packers and shippers by offering new perks. Logistics companies have begun providing on-site child care, or reimbursing employees who need to put their children in day care while they work.
Some companies are entering workers in raffles every week to win laptops, televisions and tablets, or are bringing food trucks to their warehouses and paying for employees' lunches.
"These types of benefits in the past, you associated them with Silicon Valley, start-up companies," Mr. Ravenscroft said. "They weren't synonymous with your traditional employers." Clients are hesitant to offer permanent wage increases, he said, but that could change if the jobless rate continues to dip.
Bob Peterson, the chief executive of Melton Truck Lines, said he had been feeling the job market's heat all year, and that he now had no choice but to raise pay for his 1,600 drivers.
"With unemployment this low, anyone worth their salt has got a job and probably a darn good one," Mr. Peterson said. Melton operates in 48 states and has offices in five.
The tight job market has been especially tough on Mr. Peterson, because he requires a drug test for everyone who comes through the door. Many fail, especially after several states legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use.
"There's guys and gals that like to smoke weed, but they can't drive a commercial vehicle because it's prohibited," Mr. Peterson said. "Some people get here and we find out, oops, they have been smoking or injecting."
Mr. Peterson has not given raises in two years, he said, because when he had asked his clients to increase their rates, they threatened to hire another trucking company. He is planning to increase salaries by 10 percent in 2018. Part of the reason, he said, was that he was seeing hiring pick up in the construction business and in manufacturing, two sectors that he competed with for able bodies.
"No one is having an easy time hiring blue-collar workers today," Mr. Peterson said.
Those pressures are bearing down on manufacturing, which added a solid 196,000 jobs last year, and construction, where payrolls increased by 210,000. Mining employers also posted solid gains, bucking a trend of job losses in recent years.
The crash in oil prices in 2014 was particularly hard on jobs in the mining sector, which includes support services in oil fields, and had ripple effects on construction and manufacturing, partly because American companies make much of the world's mining equipment. Oil prices have begun to climb, and that may be one piece of the expansion in all three sectors, economists said.
The rest of the world is also in the midst of a strong recovery, helping to drive an American uptick in productive blue-collar work.
"The manufacturing upturn story is a global story," Mr. Shepherdson said. "It's happening everywhere. You can't take credit for the recovery in Europe and China."

Fed to Raise Benchmark Rate in 2018, but It Lacks Consensus on Frequency

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has entered 2018 without a clear plan for raising its benchmark interest rate and with the added uncertainty of an imminent change in its leadership. An account of the Fed's final meeting of 2017, which the central bank published Wednesday, said officials generally agreed that the Fed should continue to raise its benchmark rate in the new year. But Fed officials expressed a range of views about the frequency of future hikes.
Six of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted during the December meeting that the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018. But six officials predicted two hikes or fewer and four officials predicted the Fed would raise rates at least four times.
The decision about how often to raise rates will be made under new management. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, plans to leave the Fed in early February; her nominated successor, the Fed governor Jerome H. Powell, is awaiting a Senate confirmation vote.
Last year was the first since the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed articulated a clear plan for monetary policy and stuck with it. The central bank said it would raise rates three times and did exactly that, with the third hike coming in December.
The decision at that meeting to raise the benchmark rate into a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent reflected the Fed's optimistic expectations for the economy, the account said.
"Participants saw the outlook for economic activity as having remained strong or having strengthened since their previous meeting, in part reflecting a modest boost from the expected passage of the tax legislation," said the account, which was released after a standard three-week delay.
Officials saw few serious dangers on the horizon, the account said. Most expected inflation to rebound from a long period of sluggishness and were not overly concerned about rising asset values. The S.&P. 500 stock index has climbed 19 percent over the last year.
The Fed also predicted there would be a modest economic boost from the tax cuts President Trump that signed into law at the end of the year. The account said that many officials predicted increases in both consumer and business spending, although they expressed uncertainty about the magnitude.
In the December round of economic projections, the median forecast of Fed officials was that the economy would grow 2.5 percent in 2018, up from a median forecast of 2.1 percent in September. The tax cut was the primary reason for the higher estimate, Ms. Yellen said at a news conference.
The estimate reflected the view of Fed officials that the benefits of the $1.5 trillion tax cut will be attenuated by higher interest rates, as the federal government seeks to borrow more money.
The account also said that some firms were likely to give the windfall to investors or use the money to pay down debts rather than making the types of investments likely to expand the economy.
The internal debate about how quickly to raise rates revolves around the pace of inflation. Last year was the sixth straight year the Fed fell short of its 2 percent inflation target.
"One thing is for certain and that is that inflation has become the most important economic variable steering the Fed's policy," wrote Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.
Some officials have sought to suspend rate hikes until inflation shows greater strength. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, voted against the December rate hike, and said in a post-meeting statement that the Fed needed to demonstrate a commitment to its target.
"I am concerned that too many observers have the impression that our 2 percent objective is a ceiling that we do not wish inflation to breach," Mr. Evans said in the statement.
Most Fed officials, however, expressed confidence that continued growth would increase inflation. That group includes the plurality of officials favoring three rates hikes next year.
It also includes the minority of officials who are concerned that the Fed may not be raising rates fast enough. They noted that the economy is growing more quickly, money remains easy to borrow and the supply of workers is dwindling -- factors that could fuel faster inflation.
One new item on the agenda at the December meeting: Concern about a technical indicator called the yield curve, which compares the interest rates on the different kinds of debt issued by the federal government, which borrows money for periods ranging from one month to 30 years.
In general, investors demand higher interest rates on longer-term loans, to compensate for greater uncertainty, but the difference between short-term rates and long-term rates on federal debt has been compressing. When short-term rates exceed long-term rates, the yield curve is said to be "inverted." Historically, that has often happened before a recession.
Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, voted against the December rate hike. He said in a post-meeting statement that the flattening of the yield curve indicated the Fed was moving too quickly. "In response to our rate hikes, the yield curve has flattened significantly, potentially signaling an increasing risk of a recession," Mr. Kashkari said.
The minutes said most Fed officials did not share Mr. Kashkari's concerns, judging instead "that the current degree of flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historical standards," and that further flattening "would not necessarily foreshadow or cause an economic downturn."

Full text: The United States spends almost twice as much on health care, as a percentage of its economy, as other advanced industrialized countries -- totaling $3.3 trillion, or 17.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2016. But a few decades ago American health care spending was much closer to that of peer nations.
What happened?
A large part of the answer can be found in the title of a 2003 paper in Health Affairs by the Princeton University health economist Uwe Reinhardt: "It's the prices, stupid."
The study, also written by Gerard Anderson, Peter Hussey and Varduhi Petrosyan, found that people in the United States typically use about the same amount of health care as people in other wealthy countries do, but pay a lot more for it.
Ashish Jha, a physician with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, studies how health systems from various countries compare in terms of prices and health care use. "What was true in 2003 remains so today," he said. "The U.S. just isn't that different from other developed countries in how much health care we use. It is very different in how much we pay for it."
A recent study in JAMA by scholars from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle and the U.C.L.A. David Geffen School of Medicine also points to prices as a likely culprit. Their study spanned 1996 to 2013 and analyzed U.S. personal health spending by the size of the population; its age; and the amount of disease present in it.
They also examined how much health care we use in terms of such things as doctor visits, days in the hospital and prescriptions. They looked at what happens during those visits and hospital stays (called care intensity), combined with the price of that care.
The researchers looked at the breakdown for 155 different health conditions separately. Since their data included only personal health care spending, it did not account for spending in the health sector not directly attributed to care of patients, like hospital construction and administrative costs connected to running Medicaid and Medicaid.
Over all, the researchers found that American personal health spending grew by about $930 billion between 1996 and 2013, from $1.2 trillion to $2.1 trillion (amounts adjusted for inflation). This was a huge increase, far outpacing overall economic growth. The health sector grew at a 4 percent annual rate, while the overall economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate.
You'd expect some growth in health care spending over this span from the increase in population size and the aging of the population. But that explains less than half of the spending growth. After accounting for those kinds of demographic factors, which we can do very little about, health spending still grew by about $574 billion from 1996 to 2013.
Did the increasing sickness in the American population explain much of the rest of the growth in spending? Nope. Measured by how much we spend, we've actually gotten a bit healthier. Change in health status was associated with a decrease in health spending -- 2.4 percent -- not an increase. A great deal of this decrease can be attributed to factors related to cardiovascular diseases, which were associated with about a 20 percent reduction in spending.
This could be a result of greater use of statins for cholesterol or reduced smoking rates, though the study didn't point to specific causes. On the other hand, increases in diabetes and low back and neck pain were associated with spending growth, but not enough to offset the decrease from cardiovascular and other diseases.
Did we spend more time in the hospital? No, though we did have more doctor visits and used more prescription drugs. These tend to be less costly than hospital stays, so, on balance, changes in health care use were associated with a minor reduction (2.5 percent) in health care spending.
That leaves what happens during health care visits and hospital stays (care intensity) and the price of those services and procedures.
Did we do more for patients in each health visit or inpatient stay? Did we charge more? The JAMA study found that, together, these accounted for 63 percent of the increase in spending from 1996 to 2013. In other words, most of the explanation for American health spending growth -- and why it has pulled away from health spending in other countries -- is that more is done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, they're charged more per service, or both.
Though the JAMA study could not separate care intensity and price, other research blames prices more. For example, one study found that the spending growth for treating patients between 2003 and 2007 is almost entirely because of a growth in prices, with little contribution from growth in the quantity of treatment services provided. Another study found that U.S. hospital prices are 60 percent higher than those in Europe. Other studies also point to prices as a major factor in American health care spending growth.
There are ways to combat high health care prices. One is an all-payer system, like that seen in Maryland. This regulates prices so that all insurers and public programs pay the same amount. A single-payer system could also regulate prices. If attempted nationally, or even in a state, either of these would be met with resistance from all those who directly benefit from high prices, including physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies -- and pretty much every other provider of health care in the United States.
Higher prices aren't all bad for consumers. They probably lead to some increased innovation, which confers benefits to patients globally. Though it's reasonable to push back on high health care prices, there may be a limit to how far we should.

Full text: To borrow from Yogi Berra, it is tough to make predictions, especially about the future. But 2017 was particularly difficult. On many of the biggest forecasts -- global growth, inflation, the trajectory of the big powers -- the experts got the year wrong. They thought the global economy would continue to struggle, inflation would stage a comeback, right-wing nationalism would prevent economic revival in Europe and laggards like Japan, Russia and Brazil would remain weak. They expected the United States to be the one relatively bright spot and that Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts and protectionism would drive the mighty dollar higher.
Instead, President Trump had little impact on the economy, and the dollar fell against every major currency. While American stocks did well, foreign markets did better, because the rest of the world grew faster than expected, and inflation remained quiet. Given up for dead, even Japan bounced back. The nationalist right underachieved, and recovery spread to Europe and beyond. Three-quarters of the globe saw an acceleration in economic growth for the first time in a decade.
The forecasting misses of 2017 reflect mistakes humans have been making since we started thinking about the future. Every forecaster knows that economies rise and fall constantly, oscillating around a long-term trend line. Yet forecasts typically extrapolate current trends on a straight line, so the vision of tomorrow closely resembles today, often implausibly so. A year ago forecasters thought 2017 would look like 2016; instead the world economy had its best year since the financial crisis of 2008.
The weakness of straight-line forecasts explains why the consensus of leading economists has consistently missed big turns. They have not predicted a single United States recession since the Federal Reserve began keeping such records a half-century ago, and missed many revivals, including the unusually broad global expansion of 2017.
Few dare predict big shifts, so they tinker at the margins. And once an economy gets labeled "miraculous" or "hopeless," the stereotype sticks. Japan had gone cold for so long few experts could imagine it warming up in 2017, but it did. After long slumps, "Old Man Europe," Russia and Brazil also recovered much faster than expected. In part, these economies were just rebounding toward their long-term average or, as economists say, "reverting to the mean."
Economic stereotypes are reinforced by political biases, like Europe's ingrained fear of extreme nationalism. In early 2017, forecasters took rising poll numbers for nationalists, extrapolated them into the future and imagined formerly fringe right-wingers gaining influence and setting off a eurozone crisis. Instead, the center held, and sheer relief helped propel the surprise economic recovery.
Forecasters are prone to focus on a single story line, particularly one as compelling as angry populism. The consensus view figured Mr. Trump's tax and spending plans would increase growth in the United States, while his protectionist threats would undercut the rest of the world. Most forecasters share the establishment disdain for Mr. Trump, yet few paused to consider whether a leader they see as inept and divisive could deliver all this as fast as he promised.
He didn't, and the widely hyped "Trump Bump" barely surfaced in 2017. Yes, the United States economy grew around 2 percent and generated jobs at a healthy pace. But both trends date to well before Mr. Trump. Liberals who thought Mr. Trump would induce a global recession proved even farther off the mark.
If one were to avoid the straight-line projections, political biases and single factors that so often distort forecasts, what would a 2018 forecast look like? Not like the consensus, which is euphoric over the current combo of high growth and low inflation. Usually staid Wall Street economists are giving their 2018 forecasts headlines like "Boom Shaka-laka-laka" and "As Good as It Gets." Inspired by a cocksure consensus, investors are holding less money in cash than they ever have before -- meaning they are all-in on risky investments.
Confidence this solid is a warning sign of complacency. For one, gross domestic product growth is at the top end of the range that has prevailed over the past decade, so it is more likely to slip than accelerate. That should be sobering for every major power, including Trump's America. But please, it's not all about him. For better or worse, Mr. Trump had less impact on the global economy than most experts expected in 2017. The lesson -- the inevitable rarely happens, the unexpected often does -- applies as well to forecasting 2018.

Full text: Every year at this time I join a growing number of journalistic flagellants in enumerating things that I got wrong in the previous annum's worth of columns. When I started the practice, the annual audit sometimes felt a little bit too scrupulous, like picking nits with my own work. But the last two years have been different: As Donald Trump's ascent turned all sorts of supposed wisdom into folly, I've found myself with a great deal of mistaken analysis to acknowledge and live down. I could write this year's column in the same Trump-centric spirit, by focusing on my published fears about his presidency that have not yet been borne out -- particularly the ripple effects I predicted for the economy, for social order and world peace, all of which are thus far less disturbed than I had feared.
But focusing on Trump again would also reveal the limits of this yearly format, because the Trump era is not even close to over yet, and year-over-year developments are generally the wrong way to assess a presidency's impact and the predictions that preceded it.
So the Trump fans currently demanding that anti-Trump conservatives come over to their side because he's appointed decent judges and crushed the Islamic State should keep their powder dry. Now is a good time for intellectual humility, and for reserving judgment on an administration whose ultimate effects on domestic tranquillity and the Pax Americana remain uncertain.
Instead, in the spirit of the longer view, I want to use this confessional column to reach back to the early Obama years, and the arguments I made then that assumed the urgency of deficit reduction, the pressing need for honest liberals to champion major tax increases and for honest conservatives to go all-in for major entitlement reform.
I was not the fiercest of deficit hawks, not a hard-money type or an inflation-panicker. But as a non-economist staring at Congressional Budget Office projections and at examples of fiscal crisis from Greece to California, it seemed reasonable to make deficit cutting a near-term priority from 2010 onward, to offset the surge of Great Recession spending with a period of belt-tightening.
But now I think this reasonable view was wrong. Not completely, in the sense that many of the deficit-reducing policies I supported -- means-testing entitlement programs, eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy and upper middle class -- I still support, because I think the money involved is presently misspent. But I was wrong in the priority that I gave the deficit relative to other issues, wrong to discern a looming "fiscal precipice," wrong in some of the criticism I leveled at both George W. Bush and Barack Obama for failing to care enough about balancing the nation's books.
The best time to make deficit reduction a priority is when the inflation rate and the bond market give you some indication that you are headed for a dangerous inflationary spiral. Such indicators were conspicuously absent eight years ago, but many people I talked to (including people in the Obama White House) argued that it was important to reduce deficits pre-emptively, because the spiraling could happen too quickly for policymakers to effectively respond. At that point I believed them; now I think they had overlearned lessons from the 1970s that did not apply in 2010.
Instead, in hindsight the most important economic argument of the early Obama years was between two schools of thought that agreed we should put more money into the economy and only disagreed about how to do it -- the Keynesians who wanted massive government spending and the market monetarists who favored looser monetary policy. Today, both sides of that debate look far better than the strict fiscal and monetary hawks, and the endless arguments about Bowles-Simpson look like an interesting exercise that did not deserve so much swarming attention from politicians and the press.
There are always real limits on what government spending or tax cuts can accomplish and how far they can go. A society only has so much productive capacity, dumb tax cuts can be hoarded and dumb spending used to enrich special interests or subsidize social pathology, and too much spending can eventually induce inflation.
But those limits are not established by an arbitrary deficit target. Instead, a rich and powerful country with a stable government and control over its own currency (which is to say, not a prisoner of the euro) should be willing to live with a loose fiscal policy when wage growth is disappointing and inflation low, and it should debate tax and spending changes on their own terms -- will this money be put to good use? -- rather than pursuing a balanced budget for its own sake.
That low-inflation, slow-growth context prevailed under Obama; to a lesser extent it still prevails today. There will doubtless come a time when deficit scolds make essential arguments, but of late they haven't -- and when I was one of them, I now believe, I was making a mistake.

Full text: STORM LAKE, Iowa -- When Dan Smith first went to work at the pork processing plant in Storm Lake in 1980, pretty much the only way to nab that kind of union job was to have a father, an uncle or a brother already there. The pay, he recalled, was $16 an hour, with benefits -- enough to own a home, a couple of cars, a camper and a boat, while your wife stayed home with the children. "It was the best-paying job you could get, 100 percent, if you were unskilled," said Mr. Smith, now 66, who followed his father through the plant gates.
After nearly four decades at the plant, most of them as a forklift driver, Mr. Smith is retiring this month.
The union is long gone, and so are most of the white faces of men who once labored in the broiling heat of the killing floor and the icy chill of the production lines. What hasn't changed much is Mr. Smith's hourly wage, which is still about $16 an hour, the same as when he started 37 years ago. Had his wages kept up with inflation, he would be earning about $47 an hour.
The forces that have helped transform this snug lakeside town in northwestern Iowa and others like it during Mr. Smith's working life have created a complex swirl of economic successes and hardships, optimism and unease.
Fierce global competition, agricultural automation and plant closures have left many rural towns struggling for survival. In areas stripped of the farm and union jobs that paid middle-class wages and tempted the next generation to stay put and raise a family, young people are more likely to move on to college or urban centers like Des Moines. Left behind are an aging population, abandoned storefronts and shrinking economic prospects.
Yet Storm Lake, hustled along by the relentless drive of manufacturers to cut labor costs and by the town's grit to survive, is still growing. However clumsily at times, this four-square-mile patch has absorbed successive waves of immigrants and refugees -- from Asia, from Mexico and Central America, and from Africa.
They fill most of the grueling, low-paid jobs at the pork, egg and turkey plants; they spend money at local shops, and open restaurants and grocery stores; they fill church pews and home-team benches. While more than 88 percent of the state's population is non-Hispanic white, less than half of Storm Lake's is. Walk through the halls of the public schools and you can hear as many as 18 languages.
But if the newcomers have brought some of the economic dynamism that President Trump promised to restore to the struggling Midwest and South, they have also fed some of the anxieties and resentments that he stirred.
Steve King, the Republican congressman for this predominantly white, conservative district, blames immigrants and refugees for pushing down wages, bringing unwelcome cultural diversity and burdening public services.
While Mr. King's nativist comments have been labeled racist by critics, his fervent animosity to immigration has done little over the years to dent his electoral popularity in most of the 39 counties he represents.
Storm Lake, with a population of roughly 11,000, is in no way immune to the strains and tensions that an influx of poor, low-skilled and non-English-speaking immigrants and refugees can bring. But after decades of living and working together, the residents recognize that their future is a shared one.
"Other communities our size are shrinking and consolidating school districts," said Mark Prosser, the police chief. "We have schools bulging at the seams. There are expensive challenges, but which one do you want: a dying community or one that has growth?"
Less than a half-mile from the police station, the shelves at Valentina's Meat Market offer a still-life version of the town's inhabitants. A kaleidoscope of packages, jars and produce from nearly every continent is jammed in -- side by side are purple yams from Laos, green plantains from Ecuador, mahogany-brown cassava from Nigeria, tan egg roll wrappers from Vietnam.
Silvino Morelos, the Mexican-born owner, has lived in Storm Lake for more than 20 years. He came after his grocery business in Los Angeles was looted and burned during the racially charged 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of four white police officers accused of beating a black motorist, Rodney King. Here, he said, he has always felt welcome and secure.
"A lot of different communities are living together," said Mr. Morelos, who aims to feed them all.
His wife, Mayela, works from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the pork plant, earning $18 an hour, before handling the register at Valentina's until the early evening. Mr. Morelos often doesn't finish up before midnight, he said, and rarely takes a day off. He recently bought a 22-acre farm about five minutes outside of town where he is raising lambs and goats. Dedicated workers, he said, can live "a good life."
>
Shared ambitions and a willingness to work hard command respect across cultures here.
Mr. Smith, looking back on his decades at the plant, acknowledges that a supply of immigrants makes it easier for employers to pay less, but he doesn't begrudge them the work.
"I harbor no ill feelings for anybody who's trying to make a better life for themselves," he said, settling on the living room couch in his home, a corner house next to the railroad tracks, which he shares with his girlfriend. "They're just trying to make a buck for their family, like I am."
Mr. Smith remembers that it wasn't the arrival of foreign workers that initially drove down wages, but the plant owners.
First was Hygrade Food Products Corporation, an old-style meatpacking house that introduced Ball Park Franks to the Detroit Tigers' stadium in 1957 and operated the Storm Lake plant when Mr. Smith went to work there. Faced with competition from new companies that had developed a faster, more efficient method of boxing beef and selling it to supermarket chains and fast-food outlets, Hygrade in 1981 asked its workers to take a pay cut of $3 an hour. When they refused, the plant closed.
With vigorous support from town leaders, the upstart Iowa Beef Processors (later known as IBP) bought and reopened it a few months later -- slashing wages by more than half and shunning the union.
At that point, Mr. Smith returned to do night cleanup, earning $5.50 an hour with no benefits, but a vast majority of his former co-workers were turned away, he said, because the new owner did not want to hire union supporters. Instead, the company began actively recruiting in Mexico and in immigrant communities in Texas and California.
"They learned real fast to keep a sharp knife and didn't complain if they had a sore arm," Mr. Smith said.
The new form of meatpacking that sprang up in Iowa and the Midwest transformed the industry. "There was lower pay, faster lines and higher injury rates," said David Swenson, a regional scientist in the economics department at Iowa State University.
Tyson Foods bought IBP in 2001, and its red oval logo greets visitors as they drive into town. Tacked onto the entry gate, a large banner announces, "New starting pay" -- $15 an hour on the production line.
Even at that level, more than twice the state's $7.25 minimum wage, workers can be hard to come by. Standing in the same spot for eight hours or more at a time, in near-freezing temperatures, slashing at carcasses that swing by at a fast pace, can numb body and soul. The poultry industry also ranks among the most dangerous in the United States, according to a new report by the National Employment Law Project.
Even if pay were raised to $20 or $25 an hour, Mr. Smith said, "I don't think you could get white guys."
Those who are hired can be dogged by a common negative stereotype. As one supervisor at the plant recalled, some of the Mexican workers on the line complained after he hired a white worker, saying: "This guy is not going to last as long. He's young and he's not going to work hard."
Most of the 2,200 workers now at the pork plant are primarily of Hispanic descent, said Caroline Ahn, a spokeswoman for Tyson. Asians make up the second-largest group, followed by Caucasians. Men slightly outnumber women. She would not specify the turnover rate, but several employees said the company was engaged in a never-ending hiring campaign.
In Buena Vista County, which includes Storm Lake, the jobless rate has dropped to 2.7 percent, and both small and large businesses complain that they cannot find enough workers. The competitive squeeze is expected to only worsen when two new pork plants open in nearby Sioux City and Eagle Grove.
But Mr. Swenson at Iowa State is skeptical of employer complaints about labor shortages. For an industry that needs to be where the animals are, he said, the only answer is to "pay workers enough to retain them or attract them."
Art Cullen, the Pulitzer Prize-winning editor of his family-run newspaper, The Storm Lake Times, acknowledges that processing-plant work is tough. Yet for a refugee or an immigrant without English or skills, butchering livestock at that wage, he said, is a "first rung on the American ladder to success."
That was the way it worked for Abel Saengchanpheng, who came to Storm Lake from Northern California in 1997, when he was 16, after relatives talked up the job opportunities there. Born in a Thai refugee camp after his family escaped from Laos, Mr. Saengchanpheng, now 36 and an American citizen, joined his parents at the plant after he finished high school. He has been there ever since, working his way up to general foreman in 2013, and he now oversees 300 production workers.
With earnings that place him comfortably in Storm Lake's upper middle class, he owns two cars, a Subaru and a Honda, and a home.
"I was so blessed to get into Tyson," he said, sipping coffee at Grand Central Coffee Station. "I remember looking at the first paycheck and thinking, 'There is free money going around."'
The work, though, can feed drudgery as well as dreams.
Blanca Martinez, who came from El Salvador with her husband (a naturalized citizen who lived in Storm Lake) and their daughter, now 5, has been at the turkey plant for two years. She earns $15.70 an hour cutting bone six days a week on the 6 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. shift.
"It's very hard," Ms. Martinez, 37, a permanent resident, said in Spanish through an interpreter. "I'm still not used to the cold." At work, she wears three gloves on her left hand and two on her right -- giving her cutting hand a little more flexibility.
Speaking English would widen her options, Ms. Martinez said, but she has had no time for lessons since her husband received a diagnosis of cancer.
>
The contrast between Storm Lake and many neighboring towns is both by accident and by design.
Refugees from Southeast Asia made their way to the area more than 40 years ago, when Iowa became the first state to offer resettlement assistance at the end of the Vietnam War.
"That was a proactive choice on the part of community leaders," said the Rev. Charles Valenti-Hein, the pastor at Lakeside Presbyterian Church, which sponsored the first group. Making room for other immigrants, he said, was "an extension of that initial act of hospitality, something we've chosen."
Other residents suggested that the proximity of a university, Buena Vista, with some minority faculty members and students, as well as the town's location as a central stopping point on sales routes, may have contributed to the openness.
Yet the flood of Mexican recruits who were funneled to the IBP plant in the 1990s engendered suspicion and tensions. School overcrowding, a surge in uncompensated care at the hospitals and a new need for translators drained city coffers. Complaints about a rise in crime and drugs followed.
"There was a collective holding of breath as the community started to change," said Mr. Prosser, the police chief since 1989 and a Catholic deacon. "At first, people born and raised here felt, 'We want it to go back to the way it was."'
But over time, the community evolved, he said. The immigrants and refugees bought homes, opened businesses and saw their children graduate from school. Nonprofit and advocacy groups sprouted to ease the transition. The police department hired bilingual community liaisons. Most residents still don't bother to lock their doors.
"We've had all sorts of problems over a period of 30 to 35 years," Mr. Prosser said. "But the pros so outweigh the cons, and the community as a whole understands that, and for the most part they've embraced it."
Some surrounding towns have embraced the model, while others have rejected it. Decades ago, the picturesque city of Spencer, about 40 miles north, spurned the overtures of a packing plant, with some residents saying at the time that they didn't want their town to turn into Storm Lake.
Other Iowa towns, like Denison, have followed Storm Lake's lead, though the rapid transition has brought growing pains.
The Rev. Timothy Friedrichsen the Roman Catholic pastor at St. Mary's Church in Storm Lake, served previously at a parish in Denison. "I was aghast at the open hostility towards immigrants that cropped up pretty regularly," he said of Denison, where the Latino population doubled in less than a decade.
"Though some people still feel, 'This is not the Storm Lake I grew up in,"' he said, for most of the population, "there is a kind of comfortableness. This is who we are now."
The most palpable anxiety these days has been fueled by Mr. Trump's statements on immigrants and border control.
Graciela Vrieze, a Spanish-speaking civilian community-service officer with the local police department, said her 13-year-old son, an Iowa-born citizen, had come home from school asking if they were all going to be deported to Mexico. There are few reliable statistics on the number of foreign-born residents with fake or no documents; estimates run to the thousands. Several with documents also said they were postponing trips abroad, however, because of the fear that they may not be allowed to return.
The drive among refugees and immigrants to remain in or return to Storm Lake stands out in a state where more than two-thirds of the counties are shrinking in population. "I love my town," Mr. Smith said, but all three of his children and both of his girlfriend's have moved elsewhere.
Most of the farm boys and farmers' daughters have left, said Mr. Cullen of The Storm Lake Times. "Second-generation immigrants want to stay with their families," he said from the cozy one-room newsroom. He jumped up from his chair to hunt among the stacks of newspapers for a recent edition that featured a scholarship student from El Salvador returning from college to Storm Lake to start a house-painting business. "Those kids are our future."
Immigrant parents who labor on the production lines say they want their children to go to college instead of taking their places at the plant. But the expectation is that those children will return home after graduating.
Ms. Martinez, the worker at the turkey plant, does not have time to take English classes herself, but the future she envisions for her 5-year-old includes going to medical school, becoming a doctor and then coming home to work here in Storm Lake.

Full text: If you are among the majority of Americans whose tax bill will decrease next year, there are some obvious ways to put the money to work. People who are sick, indebted, or in an unstable job or relationship will need to pay the bills or save for imminent hardship. Others who are more stable but not saving enough to meet even modest retirement or college savings goals should probably increase account contributions by the amount they're getting from the tax bill.
The more comfortable among us, however, ought to consider a less obvious course of action: Give the money back.
This is a bipartisan appeal. If you believe the Republican theory that these tax cuts will stoke more economic growth, you can help make it so by spending any extra money in a way that directly improves the American economy. Hire someone in your business. Pay a household employee more. Buy something that helps American workers.
Find the tax cuts and the Republicans who voted for them objectionable? Then take the money and put it toward people who have been left behind economically and causes that can help them.
This tax bill officially makes us all data in a grand experiment on how big changes in tax incentives influence behavior and alter the economy. If nothing else, we should be deliberate and specific in how we want to be counted.
Whatever you decide, declare your intentions on Twitter over the weekend using the #GiveItBack hashtag. I'll be following along.
Meanwhile, here's more on how to do the giving.
Hiring
There is plenty of reason to believe that many large public companies won't give it back to workers. Their executives work for shareholders after all, so the default reflex may well be to use winnings from the new, lower corporate tax rates to buy back shares or do other things that will lift stock prices directly and immediately.
One exception so far is Fifth Third Bank. Rather than handing out bonuses, which don't help employees over time, the bank recently raised its minimum hourly wage to $15, which then becomes the baseline for any future raises. I reached out to the company's chief executive, Greg D. Carmichael, to see if he wanted to take a pledge to give his personal tax winnings back, but the bank's representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
If you own or run a business, you, too, can hand out raises or make new hires. Or perhaps you employ a babysitter or housekeeper. If so, consider offering those workers raises that outpace inflation. Not paying them on the books? Now might be a good time to start. Once you do, your employees may collect larger Social Security checks in retirement, improving their own ability to contribute to the economy over the long haul.
If you don't employ anyone at the moment, hiring occasional part-time help to buy back your own time may contribute to greater personal happiness, as a recent study showed, in addition to putting more money in someone else's pocket.
Spending
If you're among the top earners, your tax winnings may be enough to tip the scales toward buying or replacing a car sooner than you might have otherwise. Buying an automobile is a relatively rare opportunity to make an outsize economic impact, given how much cars cost.
Do you believe that the quality of American cars has finally caught up to those made by foreign companies? Buying one in 2018 that was made in America will let you play your part in moving the economic needle a bit. Don't want an American car? Perhaps you can support an American worker by purchasing a car that was still made here, like a Honda Accord or a Toyota Highlander.
Any extra money, no matter your income, also presents an opportunity to spend more and more selectively on services. That new local restaurant that buys local food and employs local workers and pays rent to a local landlord? Perhaps you could treat yourself to dinner there a few times with your tax winnings, instead of buying imported food from a grocery store owned by an international conglomerate.
Giving
Before you consider which charities you might want to give your newfound tax winnings, you'll probably think about a tax change that could affect philanthropy directly: the increase in the standard deduction. Now that it's going up, people who will no longer itemize deductions, including charitable contributions, may feel less incentive to give as much as they used to.
Or at least that's what philanthropy researchers fear, with one estimate suggesting that our collective giving could fall by a few percentage points. This makes some intuitive sense; nonprofits would not be flooding you with messages right now if people weren't already racing the calendar each December to make tax-deductible donations.
Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, lost his cool on Twitter in recent days over suggestions that the new tax law might fundamentally alter Americans' giving. I offered him the opportunity to take a pledge to give back his tax winnings but received no reply. Crickets also chirped when I asked for pledges from Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, Senator Susan Collins of Maine and President Trump, all of whom also supported the tax bill, via their representatives.
I do hope Senator Cornyn is right about one thing: that we don't give merely or even primarily for the tax break. If you agree and are lucky enough not to need your tax winnings for yourself, perhaps you can find a way to support a cause that helps people who have been left behind by the improving American economy for whatever reason. Please note, however, that if you want to use the money to try to run your least favorite politician out of office, your campaign contributions are not tax deductible even if you are still able to itemize your charitable donations.
The giving guide that Carl Richards recently wrote for The New York Times can help you be more strategic. Tara Siegel Bernard and I also recently answered reader questions on giving, and that article has links to other resources that may be helpful.
Automating your contributions is a good way to capture your tax winnings, especially if those winnings are small enough that they'll add up to only double-digit dollar figures each paycheck that you might otherwise fritter away. Or if you're a beneficiary of the stock buybacks I mentioned above, consider giving away appreciated shares. That way, you get a deduction if you still itemize plus you avoid possible capital gains taxes on the increase in value.
My family intends to dabble in all three of the above categories. In 2018, we plan to pay more to people who help us already and replace our 15-year-old car. Through my work this year, I've learned more about how heavily Americans rely on Medicaid for elder care. As a result, I worry about possible cuts to that program that some politicians may wish to make. If you want to recommend nonprofit organizations that help poor elderly people, please post their names in the comments of this article.
Meanwhile, think about what difference you hope to make with your tax winnings, if any. Then #GiveItBack if you possibly can.

Don't Cheer as the I.R.S. Grows Weaker

Full text: No federal agency generates as much rancor as the Internal Revenue Service, part of that duo of inevitability, taxes and death. Despite its reputation for toughness, the I.R.S. relies on voluntary compliance, as in Americans' sense of duty, to collect the money that powers our government. That's more true than ever, because as it prepares to implement the most sweeping tax overhaul in 30 years, the I.R.S. is perhaps weaker than it has ever been. In 1986, the last time Congress passed major changes in the tax code, it included a budget increase for the agency, allowing it to hire 2,100 more employees to carry out the changes. Earlier this year, as the agency struggled to do its job with a decimated staff, a shrinking budget and decrepit computers, its commissioner pleaded with Congress to at least give it time to prepare for the big tax overhaul Republicans wanted.
That didn't happen. Instead, Republicans rushed hastily written legislation larded with amendments through both chambers. Even before this hash hit their desks, I.R.S. officials were warning about the potential for a catastrophic breakdown that could imperil our tax system. Then, at its busiest time of year, the agency was given a week before the tax law goes into effect to translate hundreds of pages of conflicting provisions, potential loopholes and unintended consequences into coherent guidance for taxpayers.
"On behalf of the hard-working Americans across the nation who are eager to see their paychecks reflect the benefits of this historic legislation, I request that you expedite any requisite updates to the relevant guidance on withholding," reads a self-serving letter to the I.R.S. from Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. "Please keep me apprised of the process so that I may relay to my constituents what they ought to expect in the coming year and when to expect it."
Americans got a hint this week of what they can expect, when thousands tried to pay their 2018 property tax bills in advance, hoping to claim a deduction before provisions sharply limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes take hold on Jan. 1. Then the I.R.S. issued guidance narrowing that loophole, generating confusion and fury.
Americans should reserve their rage for Republicans, who have spent years targeting the I.R.S. for political gain. Since 2010, Congress has cut the agency's budget by nearly $1 billion, or 18 percent, adjusted for inflation, as the I.R.S. processes about 10 million more tax returns. Its work force has been whacked by 21,000, or nearly one-quarter; taxpayers who need help -- often individuals preparing their own returns -- have a hard time getting anyone to answer the phone.
This underscores the peril of demagoguing the I.R.S. It's not the little guy who benefits most from diminishing the agency; it's the scam artists and sophisticated high-dollar cheats.
The size of the compliance staff -- the professionals who go after tax evaders -- has shrunk by one-third, and the ranks of criminal special investigators are thinner than at any time since the Nixon era. New methods and partnerships allow the I.R.S. staff to detect more sophisticated fraud, but the number of audits the agency can pursue is at its lowest point in 14 years. While our audit-prone president might be cheered by that, just a 1 percent drop in compliance means $33 billion fewer dollars into the Treasury. That's enough to pay for more than two years of the Children's Health Insurance Program, the coverage for nine million low- and moderate-income children that Republicans can't seem to find the money to renew.
As in the rest of the federal government in general, the I.R.S.'s antiquated computers use the programming language Cobol, created more than a half-century ago. Every day, the agency catches a million attempts to infiltrate its computer systems by hackers and cyberterrorists intent on stealing taxpayer data.
There is no permanent commissioner leading the I.R.S. Its last one, John Koskinen, left in November at the expiration of his term. Mr. Koskinen had spent a big chunk of his time on Capitol Hill, being lambasted by Republicans over allegations that the Obama-era I.R.S. unfairly targeted conservative political groups seeking tax-exempt status. A report released in October by the Treasury Department's inspector general found that the I.R.S. had also scoured left-leaning groups' applications for tax-exempt status as part of its effort to identify groups focused on politics, not "social welfare," as the rules for tax-exempt status require.
The agency apologized for its improper audits, and a Justice Department investigation found mismanagement but no evidence of a crime. Though the audits occurred before Mr. Koskinen came aboard, Republicans clamored for him to be impeached, an action not taken against an administration official besides the president since the 1870s. The dumb and unsuccessful effort was led by legislators like Jason Chaffetz, then a Republican congressman from Utah, who view the I.R.S. as symbolic of "big government" and think that killing it outright might be a good idea.
Despite its diminished state, the agency has managed to improve some operations and protect taxpayers. During the 2016 fiscal year, the I.R.S. intercepted more than $6.5 billion in fraudulent refunds claimed on 969,000 tax returns filed by identity thieves. Staff members worked to break up and inform the public about multiplying tax scams, including one run from India-based call centers in which callers impersonating I.R.S. agents bilked people, many of them recent immigrants, of more $100 million since 2013, and an email identity-theft scam targeting Hotmail users. Tax investigators have gone after holders of illegal offshore accounts and helped recover billions stolen from the Treasury by filers of bogus returns.
Pounding a perennial punching bag like the I.R.S. scores easy political points among Americans who associate the agency with an unpleasant April deadline. We get it. But if the agency that collects more than 90 percent of the government's money stumbles, all Americans pay, and they can look to Congress, not just the I.R.S., in assigning the blame.

Protests in Iran Over Economic Woes Spread, Including to the Capital

Full text: Protests over the Iranian government's handling of the economy spread to several cities on Friday, including Tehran, in what appeared to be a sign of unrest. President Hassan Rouhani began his second term in August after winning re-election on promises to revitalize an economy hurt by sanctions. Although foreign investment is rising, the country continues to survive mainly on oil sales. Youth unemployment stands at more than 40 percent, sluggish state-owned enterprises control significant sectors of the economy, and American sanctions prevent most international banks from providing financing or credit to Iran.
Many of the international sanctions against Iran were lifted under the 2015 accord on Iran's nuclear program. But unilateral American sanctions on doing financial transactions with Iran remain in place, and the cumulative effect of sanctions has been severe. Mr. Rouhani, who heralded the agreement as a fresh start, has faced criticism for not doing enough to jump-start the economy.
The Trump administration seized on reports of the protests to denounce Iran. "Iran's leaders have turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos," the State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement. "As President Trump has said, the longest-suffering victims of Iran's leaders are Iran's own people." She added that the United States "strongly condemns the arrest of peaceful protesters."
The protests began on Thursday in Mashhad, a city of two million in the country's northeast, where hundreds gathered to denounce recent price increases and the moribund state of the economy more generally, according to Iranian news agencies. Some of them shouted "Death to Rouhani."
It was difficult to judge the size of the demonstrations and whether they were organized, and if so, by whom.
Relatively prosperous, Mashhad is dominated by hard-liners, including supporters of Ibrahim Raesi, who lost to Mr. Rouhani in the May elections. Mr. Raesi has pressed the plight of the poor, a cause picked up by hard-liners who say that Mr. Rouhani's government has failed to address rising inequality.
A new budget presented by the government this month was widely debated on Telegram, Iran's most used social media outlet. Many people were upset over appropriations for religious and revolutionary institutions while other areas of the budget were cut. An unpopular "exit tax" that Iranians pay whenever they travel outside the country was increased, and millions of dollars were cut from a modest but popular subsidy plan for the poor.
At the same time, the government has allowed Iran's currency to depreciate over the past half year, a psychological blow that resulted in inflation of certain products like a 40 percent increase in the price of eggs.
Protests over economic conditions are not uncommon in Iran. They usually take place in front of Parliament in Tehran, and in smaller cities it is not uncommon to see protests by people who have lost their savings in bank failures, or retirees who can't make ends meet. What seems distinctive about the protests this week is how quickly news about them spread on social media and was in turn picked up by foreign-based satellite channels.
The semiofficial Iranian Labor News Agency quoted Mohsen Nasj-Hamedani, Tehran's deputy governor-general for security affairs, as saying that "a number of protesters" had been arrested in the capital on Friday after "an illegal call" for a rally on social media platforms. He said about 50 people had showed up for the rally.
"A number of them left after being warned by police. A few others, however, remained despite being warned to leave," the news service quoted him as saying, and "a number of them were detained after arrest warrants were issued."
The Tasnim news agency quoted Mr. Hamedani as saying that no protest permits had been issued for Tehran and warning that "such gatherings will be firmly dealt with by the police."
Hard-liners, including Mr. Hamedani, castigated the protesters, warning that Iran's enemies would take advantage of any sign of dissent.
One hard-line religious leader, Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, said that a protest in the northeastern city of Sabzevar had been disrupted when "all of a sudden, a small group of roughly 50 people among the crowd started to chant norm-braking slogans such as 'Forget Palestine' or 'No to Gaza, No to Lebanon, I will give my life for Iran."' (Government-approved protests routinely invoke the Iranian government's self-designated role as a defender of Palestinian aspirations and as a foe of the United States.)
A reformist ally of Mr. Rouhani, Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, warned that protesters risked setting off unrest that might not be controllable.
"The ones who trigger political moves in the streets may not be the ones who will put an end to it, since others may ride the wave they have started, and they must know that their action will backfire on them," the semiofficial ISNA news agency quoted Mr. Jahangiri as saying. He added that the government was open to receiving "fair criticism."
The protests also spread on Friday to Kermanshah, a city in western Iran that is mainly inhabited by ethnic Kurds. It is near the site of an earthquake last month that killed hundreds of people.
About 300 people gathered at Freedom Square in the city and carried out a march in which public property was damaged, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency, which is close to the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
The protesters shouted antigovernment slogans like "Death or freedom," "Care for us and leave Palestine" and "Political prisoners must be freed," according to Fars.
Ali Vaez, the Iran project director for the International Crisis Group, said it was possible that hard-line opponents of Mr. Rouhani were behind the protests in Mashhad, capitalizing on anger about the economic belt-tightening and about rising food and gasoline prices.
"The trigger was apparently a protest that the government's hard-line opponents organized in Mashhad, which got out of control and turned into an anti-regime rally and is now spreading across the country," he said.
He noted that Saturday is the eighth anniversary of the nationwide demonstrations that helped crush the 2009 pro-democracy Green Movement.
"The system will probably use it as a show of force and in its wake will repress any dissent," Mr. Vaez said. "The only meaningful consequence probably is that it will provide ammunition for the Trump administration to further condemn the regime."
But Nader Karimi Juni, a reformist journalist, was skeptical that hard-liners were behind the protests. "If the protests continue for a while, which is not certain, it will be dangerous for the regime," he said. "However, the future is unpredictable and the regime has managed to crack down on more serious protests in the past decades."
Fazel Meybodi, a reformist cleric from the holy city of Qom, said he believed the protests had emerged from authentic concerns, as the government's new budget had "made people in the provincial towns angry."
"If the police and government treat people gently, this crisis will wane and tranquillity will prevail," he said. "Otherwise they might -- I stress might -- grow in the future. Economic issues are urgent, and the protests have nothing to do with any factions -- neither reformist nor hard-liner. Poor people are protesting, that is it."

Full text: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranians angry over rising food prices and inflation protested in the country's second-largest city and other areas Thursday, putting new pressure on President Hassan Rouhani as his signature nuclear deal with world powers remains in peril. The police in Mashhad made an unspecified number of arrests, local authorities said, though the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard and its affiliates did not intervene as they have during other unauthorized demonstrations since Iran's disputed 2009 election.
It wasn't immediately clear how many people took part in Thursday's protests, though social media posts suggest several thousand demonstrated at rallies across at least three other cities.
Iran's state-run IRNA news agency quoted Mashhad's governor, Mohammad Rahim Norouzian, as saying there was an illegal gathering there.
"Police gave them the necessary notifications and treated them with great tolerance," Mr. Norouzian said.
The prices of staples like eggs have risen by up to 40 percent in recent days, with farmers blaming the increases on higher prices for imported feed. Poultry is an important part of the diet of many of Iran's 80 million people; previous price increases have caused political problems for Iran's leaders.
So has inflation, which Iran's Central Bank says has returned to 10 percent. Youth unemployment also remains high.
Tempers rose further after Mr. Rouhani submitted to Parliament his 2018 budget, which increases departure taxes for those flying out of the country.
Saeed Leilaz, a Tehran-based analyst, said that Mr. Rouhani's political rivals may have played a role in organizing the protests, saying "the hands of political groups could be seen in today's gathering in Mashhad."
But he said the administration still faces a major challenge.
"There are more than three million jobless in Iran, and more than 35 percent of Iranians are under the poverty line," Mr. Leilaz said. "These are Rouhani's problems, and could kill any government. I won't be shocked if inflation hits 12 percent."
All this comes as Congress weighs President Trump's refusal to recertify the nuclear deal. Many Iranians now say they agree with assertions by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that the United States can't be trusted.
Mr. Khamenei has kept up his criticism of how Mr. Rouhani's administration has handled the economy, along with his opposition to allowing foreign companies to fully enter Iran. The Revolutionary Guard, a hard-line paramilitary organization, has major economic interests in the country.
The guard did not mobilize its Basij volunteer forces to counter the protests on Thursday. Some protesters criticized Iran's support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in his country's civil war. The guard has played a major role in that war.

Full text: PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela -- A general with no energy experience has been installed as the head of the state oil company. Arrests, firings and desperate emigration have gutted top talent. Oil facilities are crumbling, while production is plummeting. As the rest of the oil-producing world recovers on the back of stronger energy prices, Venezuela is getting worse, the result of dysfunctional management, rampant corruption and the country's crippling economic crisis. The deepening troubles at the state oil company, the country's economic mainstay, threaten to further destabilize a nation and government facing a dire recession, soaring inflation and unbridled crime, as well as food and medicine shortages.
When energy prices started to crater several years ago, Venezuela and other oil-dependent nations suffered in tandem. Now, prices are rising and others in the oil patch are on the mend.
Saudi Arabia's government is slashing its deficits and reaping increased revenue. Even dysfunctional Libya and Iraq have been pumping and exporting like mad.
Not Venezuela, the country with the largest proven reserves in the world. The state-owned oil company, PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, teeters on the brink of collapse, its failures at once a symptom and a cause of the nation's downward economic spiral.
The reasons can be clearly seen at the sprawling oil refining complex here on the Caribbean coast. Once the crown jewel of Venezuela's oil industry, it not only fueled the country's booming economy but also produced an abundance of lucrative gasoline and diesel for export.
Today, the complex is in severe decay. A lack of investment compounded by cash flow problems and chronic shortages of spare parts have crippled operations, critics say.
It is closing out the year operating at only 20 percent capacity, with 76 of 84 plants paralyzed, said IvÃ¡n Freites, a union leader and outspoken government critic. The complex does not have the computer software to diagnose its production problems, nor the money to fix them if they did.
"It's like a slow death," Mr. Freites said.
With facilities around the country in disrepair, Venezuela has been unable to take advantage of rising prices by pumping out more oil and ramping up refinery operations. Production is falling 20,000 barrels to 50,000 barrels a day month after month and is now at its lowest level in nearly three decades.
As it sells less oil, Pdvsa is falling behind on its debt payments. It is quickly turning into a liability that could force the country into default.
"With production going down and down, there is a spiral of less cash and less investment and less production," said Francisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Houston. "I don't think there has ever been such a collapse in cash flow of any national oil company."
Pdvsa's production problems have been exacerbated by the turbulence in its leadership. In the last few months, the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro arrested scores of managers on corruption charges. Mr. Maduro says the prosecutions are an effort to clean up the company. But critics view the sweep as a political purge by the Mr. Maduro to consolidate power ahead of presidential elections next year.
And last month, the president appointed Major General Manuel Quevedo to run both Pdvsa and the oil ministry -- though he had no known experience in the energy sector. Critics viewed the move as a transparent effort by Mr. Maduro to safeguard against a coup.
Luis Giusti, who ran Pdvsa before President Hugo ChÃ¡vez came to power in 1999, said Mr. Maduro's purge was "more of a political campaign to see if they can have some breathing room because everything is going down the drain."
"They have been managing the corporation for 18 years and then all of a sudden they are saying now they are going to rescue the corporation," he added. "Rescue from whom?"
For generations, Pdvsa delivered mightily on the promises of Venezuela's oil reserves, funding the nation's socialist-inspired revolution and making it one of the wealthiest countries in Latin America. But production in recent years has plummeted so far that Pdvsa is no longer able to meet domestic demand for diesel and gasoline, forcing the country to import increasing amounts of both, including from the United States.
The company's crude exports have also fallen drastically. Shipments to the United States, Pdvsa's top foreign market, plunged by a third over the last year. Mr. Maduro has threatened to cut crude exports to the United States entirely and sell more to China and India. But crude exports to China have also fallen -- by nearly 15 percent over the last year -- as the quality of its oil has declined and China has increased its purchases from the United States.
Pdvsa is also sagging under the burden of immense debt. It has been effectively in default on its $26.5 billion in unsecured bonds since early November, and it owes roughly $60 billion more to its service companies that drill and maintain its fields.
The Maduro administration has insisted that it intends to continue to make payments on its debts, and investors have been largely tolerant of payment delays. But Pdvsa's financial health has become so perilous that Cuba, Venezuela's closest ally, recently took the company's 49 percent share in a Cuban refinery as payment for outstanding debts.
This company's struggles are particularly evident in the two sprawling refineries that bracket this small city and form part of the ParaguanÃ¡ Refining Center, one of the largest refinery complexes in the world.
As recently as 2015, the center, with a capacity of nearly a million barrels a day, was processing about 587,000 barrels a day, according to Pdvsa's website. The crude was converted into a range of products, including gasoline, jet fuel, asphalts and lubricants.
But the refineries, like most of the company's facilities around the country, have fallen into grave disrepair. The situation has forced severe cutbacks in operations, leading to layoffs and an increase in accidents and injuries, workers and union leaders said.
The refineries have been recently plagued by a series of mishaps.
In late October, some 200,000 gallons of gasoline and other products spilled from a slop tank in one of the refineries, Amuay, into the adjacent bay. The spill killed wildlife and forced local fishermen to suspend fishing for weeks.
Then an overworked pump in the same refinery failed, leaving operational only two of five distillation units, a key part of the refining process, workers and union leaders said.
Days later, a fire broke out in a separate refinery, CardÃ³n, leaving only one of five distillation units functioning. Workers reported that the emergency crew that responded could do little more than to watch the fire burn out on its own. They had run out of firefighting foam.
In the midst of it all, production came to a near-standstill, dropping to just 13 percent of capacity in early-December before rebounding slightly, Mr. Freites said. Three of Amuay's distillation units and two at CardÃ³n were functioning this week, the union leader said on Wednesday, but he added that another fire had broken out in CardÃ³n on Tuesday causing injuries.
The disintegration of the refineries has left many workers dispirited.
Employees have lost all interest, said Emilio, a worker in the CardÃ³n refinery who asked that his last name be withheld because he feared punishment by the authorities for criticizing the company. He said they were simply punching the clock.
Wage increases have lagged far behind soaring inflation and workers have seen their purchasing power drop markedly and benefits reduced sharply. Some employees have been forced to sell their gloves and helmets to put food on their family's dinner table, workers said. Pride of association with Pdvsa has evaporated.
Before, people would be devastated if they lost a job at Pdvsa, said JosÃ©, a worker in the Amuay refinery who also asked that his last name be withheld because he feared retribution from his bosses for speaking publicly about the company. Now, he said, many dread going to work and are looking for jobs elsewhere.
In recent years, the company has slashed the number of contractors employed at the refineries, said Mr. Freites, general secretary of the Oil and Gas Workers Union of FalcÃ³n State. But with production at a crawl, he said, even salaried workers are left with little to do, and many spend their days playing cards and dominoes.
Pdvsa's downfall is rippling through this once-thriving company town. Roads are plunged into darkness at night because thieves have made off with the wires that carry power to the street lamps. Shops in the city's downtown, once abuzz with commerce, are now shuttered.
Residents have migrated abroad in search of work and better lives. Hundreds of oil workers have signed three-year contracts in recent weeks to work for $10 an hour in construction helping the Caribbean island of St. Martin rebuild following the hurricanes.
JosÃ© said he went to work every day wondering which of his colleagues would be the latest to leave; he compared the experience to a reality show. Pdvsa, he said, is now an empty shell.

Venezuela's Diplomatic Isolation Grows as Criticism Puts It on the Defensive

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO -- Venezuela, which a decade ago aspired to be the axis of a new, left-leaning diplomatic and trade alliance in the Americas, is finding itself increasingly isolated in the hemisphere. Venezuela downgraded diplomatic relations with Canada and Brazil in recent days, after a war of words over the Venezuelan government's decision last week to ban three influential opposition parties from running candidates in next year's presidential election.
As its leftist president, NicolÃ¡s Maduro, is increasingly regarded as a despot among neighbors in a region that has shifted politically to the right, Venezuela, once the richest country in South America but now in need of cash, is drawing closer -- and becoming more dependent on -- Russia and China. With its oil, Venezuela is likely to be an attractive, if risky, long-term gamble for Moscow and Beijing, which have sought in recent years to assert greater influence in a region that Washington has long regarded as its backyard.
"Marginalizing the Venezuelan kleptocracy is important, but total isolation will cede the ability of regional leaders to shape political events on the ground to actors outside the region," said Juan Gonzalez, a former White House and State Department official in the Obama administration who worked on Latin America policy. "Russia's increased role is particularly concerning, given their proven interference in the 2016 U.S. election and apparent design to disrupt regional politics."
The disputes with Canada and Brazil occurred as Venezuela also took aim at Todd D. Robinson Washington's new top diplomat in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. Mr. Robinson, a career Foreign Service officer, most recently United States ambassador to Guatemala, said in an introductory video posted online that he would "look for opportunities to help bring back democracy and prosperity" to Venezuela.
Last Thursday, Delcy RodrÃ­guez, the president of Venezuela's national Constituent Assembly, chided Mr. Robinson, saying he had "arrived to our country on the wrong foot!"
Then, over the weekend, Ms. RodrÃ­guez, Venezuela's former foreign minister, announced that the top diplomats from Canada and Brazil had been designated persona non grata. In diplomatic parlance, that gesture typically signals that an envoy is being expelled in protest over something. The announcement followed the two countries' criticism last week of the Maduro government's decision to prevent opposition parties from competing in next year's election.
Ms. RodrÃ­guez said the Canadian chargÃ© d'affaires, Craig Kowalik, was being punished for his "permanent, insistent and rude meddling in the internal affairs of Venezuela." As for the blacklisting of Ambassador Rui Pereira of Brazil, Ms. RodrÃ­guez cited last year's impeachment of Brazil's leftist president, Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by a leader who took a tougher line on Venezuela.
Canada on Monday took reciprocal action, declaring that Venezuela's top diplomat in Ottawa would be expelled.
"Canada will not stand by as the Government of Venezuela robs its people of their fundamental democratic and human rights, and denies them access to basic humanitarian assistance," Canada's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Brazil on Tuesday said it intended to expel Gerardo Delgado, Venezuela's top envoy in BrasÃ­lia. Over the weekend, Brazil's Foreign Ministry had said that the reported expulsion of Ambassador Pereira underscored the "autocratic nature" of Venezuela's government.
The diplomatic disputes unfolded against a backdrop of economic misery in Venezuela. According to statistics published recently by the National Assembly, inflation in November was nearly 57 percent -- above the 50 percent mark that is commonly regarded as the threshold of hyperinflation. Profound shortages of food and medicine, the scarcity of cash and a general breakdown of public services continue to worsen by the day, driving a surge of emigration.
The thinning of the diplomatic corps in Caracas will make it harder for Venezuela's neighbors to try to broker talks between the government and the opposition and to persuade Mr. Maduro to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to parts of the country where people are starving.
"It curtails our capacity to have access to the government and the opposition," a senior Brazilian diplomat said on Wednesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the consequences of the dispute. "We'll keep a chargÃ© d'affaires in Caracas, but an experienced ambassador has much more access and can provide us with more accurate information and analysis."
The diplomatic tit-for-tat comes as Venezuela is being excluded from significant regional discussions. Earlier this year, Caracas was suspended from the trading bloc Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, for failing to uphold the democratic clause in the alliance's charter.
As the region has turned on him this year -- and with his country on the verge of defaulting on its loans -- Mr. Maduro has made increasingly enthusiastic overtures to Russia and China.
During a visit to Russia in October, the Venezuelan leader thanked President Vladimir V. Putin for "all the support, political and diplomatic, in difficult times which we are living through."
The next month, Russia gave Venezuela a much-needed reprieve by restructuring a debt of $3.1 billion.
Earlier this month, Mr. Maduro met with Igor I. Sechin, the chief executive officer of Russia's state-run oil giant, Rosneft, to negotiate new ventures, which included giving the Russian company the right to develop two offshore gas fields.
Mari Carmen Aponte, who served as the Obama administration's top diplomat for Latin America, said Mr. Maduro was negotiating from a position of weakness. China, she said, has a high tolerance for risk and takes a long view on investments in countries rich in natural resources. Russia, on the other hand, she added, probably sees Mr. Maduro's vulnerability as a golden opportunity to gain leverage over another top oil exporter.
"Maduro is essentially alone and doesn't have the wherewithal to survive without allies," Ms. Aponte said. "These allies know that and they are manipulating him very effectively."

Who Toasted Past Tax Cuts? Take a Guess

Full text: Home for the holidays after passing the eighth-largest tax cut in United States history, Republicans could be forgiven for reveling in the warm embrace of nostalgia. Who among them won't raise a glass to Ronald Reagan, a welcome ghost of administrations past, the revered Republican president whose first State of the Union address promised the biggest tax cut ever to "expand our national prosperity, enlarge national incomes and increase opportunities for all Americans"?
Speaker Paul D. Ryan might chuckle fondly at Reagan's tale of woe from a worker in the Midwest -- a precursor to Mr. Ryan's "Cindy"-- who made the everyman's case for a tax cut by complaining, "I'm bringing home more dollars than I ever believed I could possibly earn, but I seem to be getting worse off."
For all the backslapping over a job well done, however, Republicans are proving notably more reluctant to acknowledge the true impact of the tax changes that Reagan wrought.
That's because Reagan's cuts didn't quite work as advertised.
Gross domestic product grew quickly during his two terms, averaging about 3.5 percent a year, pretty decent compared with the current measly pace. For one in two Americans, though -- those in the bottom half of the income pile -- income actually shrank on Reagan's watch. In 1980, the year he was elected, they earned $16,371 a year on average, in today's dollars, according to the World Wealth and Income Database. By 1988, Reagan's last year in office, they had to make do with $16,268.
Reagan promised to "continue to fulfill the obligations that spring from our national conscience," to help those who legitimately could not help themselves. But even throwing in the impact of taxes and transfers from all government programs, Americans on the bottom half of the income scale did not fare much better. By 1988, they were taking in $21,614, on average, $8 more than in 1980, after inflation.
The sliver of America that did get ahead was, you guessed it, the one at the tippy top: the richest Americans, those in the highest 1 percent of the income distribution. Their earnings grew by about 6 percent a year.
Whatever gains that Republican tax cuts have bestowed on the economy in the years since Reagan promised voters a city on a hill, they have all shared the same distributional peculiarities. President George W. Bush passed two rounds of tax cuts, in 2001 and 2003, arguing that the United States had a budget surplus "because taxes are too high and government is charging more than it needs."
To make his case, in 2001 Mr. Bush deployed the Ramos family of Pennsylvania, which he said would save $2,000 from his first round of cuts. "If we had the money," Steven Ramos, a school administrator, told somebody on the president's staff, "it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in two years' time."
And yet, during Mr. Bush's two terms, the average income of the bottom half of Americans slid from $17,827 to $17,473, accounting for inflation. After factoring in taxes and transfers, that sum did increase -- 3.5 percent, or about 0.4 percent a year.
The bottom half of Americans fared better under President Bill Clinton, who actually raised taxes. On average, their incomes rose by a fifth over his two terms, after taxes and transfers, a gain of over 2 percent per year, after accounting for inflation. Their lot also improved during President Barack Obama's administration, census data shows. (The series from the World Wealth and Income Database ends in 2014.)
Over a 34-year stretch starting in 1980, a period during which the nation's top income tax rate plunged from 70 percent to as low as 28 percent, settling at just under 40 percent today, the grand Republican promise of faster growth has proved to be, if not necessarily false, at least irrelevant for the very segment of the electorate for which it was directed.
In 2014, the economy was 2.5 times larger than it was in 1980, but the bottom half of the population made only 21 percent more, on average, even after including government benefits. America's middle -- families earning more than the bottom 30 percent but less than the top 30 percent -- gained only 50 percent in those 34 years. By contrast, the after-tax incomes of Americans in the top 1 percent -- families like President Trump's or Senator Bob Corker's -- tripled.
That is less surprising when one realizes that for all the stories about harried workers in the Midwest shouldering an unbearable tax burden, tax relief since Reagan's fateful State of the Union speech has mostly been aimed at benefiting the well-to-do: The average tax rate for Americans in the bottom half of the income pile was higher in 2014 than it was in 1980. The rate at the top declined.
After multiple repetitions, the Republican promise that the road to paradise is paved with tax cuts may have finally lost its power. Only about a third of voters seem to support the current Republican strategy -- a much smaller proportion than the one that favored the tax cuts passed in 1981, under Reagan, and 2001, under Mr. Bush.
Still, Republicans are having a hard time letting go of Reagan's message. Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers claimed that the corporate tax cuts proposed by the president would give households in the middle of the income scale a boost of $3,000 to $7,000 a year.
Mr. Ryan offered a single mother named Cindy, an assistant manager at a local restaurant who was created by Republican staff members of the House Ways and Means Committee. She makes $30,000 a year, according to Mr. Ryan, and will be mighty pleased with the extra $700 a year she will get from the Republican tax cuts.
The question now is whether the actual harried working-class voters who helped deliver Mr. Trump to office buy the story. The president they voted into power did not campaign on a platform of tax cuts for the rich. His latter-day embrace of Reagan's tax-cutting agenda might strike them as a betrayal. It has been going on for a very long time.

Full text: The Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president. The shift in the Medicare program's penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry's main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve.
"It is critical that we have relief," Mark Parkinson, the group's president, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump in December 2016.
Since 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes -- four of every 10 -- have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. Medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. Common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores.
The new guidelines discourage regulators from levying fines in some situations, even when they have resulted in a resident's death. The guidelines will also probably result in lower fines for many facilities.
The change in policy aligns with Mr. Trump's promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.
Dr. Kate Goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials.
"Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn't increase the quality of care they provide," Dr. Goodrich said.
But advocates for nursing-home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient-safety tool.
"They've pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak," said Toby Edelman, a senior attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy.
Medicare has different ways of applying penalties. It can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. It can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. Or it can deny payments for new admissions.
The average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. In 2016, Congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously.
The new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year.
In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a "one-time mistake." The centers said that intentional disregard for residents' health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines.
A July memo from the centers discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. Daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection.
David Gifford, the American Health Care Association's senior vice president for quality, said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them.
"What was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per-day basis retrospectively," Mr. Gifford said.
But the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per-instance fine of $20,965 even for egregious mistakes.
In September 2016, for instance, health inspectors faulted Lincoln Manor, a nursing home in Decatur, Ill., for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain-medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen. The patient died.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fined Lincoln Manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. An administrative law judge called the penalties "quite modest" given the "appalling" care.
The fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect; if the agency had issued a one-time fine, the maximum would have been less than $21,000.
Lincoln Manor closed in September. Its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request.
Advocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. Janet Wells, a consultant for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the changes come as "some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized -- finally -- at a level that gets the industry's attention and isn't just the cost of doing business."
In November, the Trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. Homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems.
In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rescinded another Obama administration action that banned nursing homes from pre-emptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court.
"We publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year," the agency's administrator, Seema Verma, said in a speech in October. That paperwork is "taking doctors away from what matters most: patients."
Janine Finck-Boyle, director of health regulations and policy at LeadingAge, a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people, said the group's members had been struggling to cope with regulations.
"If you're a 50-bed rural facility out West or in the Dakotas," she said, "you don't have the resources to get everything done from A to Z."

Yes, That Record For Apple Comes With an Asterisk

Full text: The iPhone keeps generating fabulous profits -- and levitating share prices -- for Apple. Those soaring share prices briefly pushed Apple's market value over $900 billion last month. That wasn't simply another mind-boggling number.It marked an historic achievement.
After accounting for inflation, Apple became the most valuable publicly-traded company of all time.
Crossing the $900 billion threshold also raised a question that has popped up periodically during Apple's flight into the stock market stratosphere: Will Apple become the first company to be worth $1 trillion?
We can't predict Apple's future. But help from experts at the University of Chicago, we can place Apple's stock market rise into historical perspective.
After conducting this analysis, Apple's numbers are still spectacular -- but they don't look quite as awesome when you take a really long-term view.
The Effects of Inflation
On Nov. 8, Apple's closing market cap reached $903 billion, surpassing what Microsoft was worth during the dot-com boom. Microsoft's highest closing value in 1999, when translated into today's dollars, was roughly $901 billion.
Apple's value has been rising for quite some time. Earlier in this decade, Apple passed Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the contemporary stock market.
To put its current size in context, Apple is worth more than the entire G.D.P. of Turkey.
But Apple's dominance is not just a question of inflation. Using another metric -- Apple's weight in the current stock market -- IBM and AT&T, in their halcyon days, were far more dominant than Apple is today.
The University of Chicago maintains a database with virtually all companies traded publicly in the United States since December 1925. Alexander Poukchanski, assistant director of index analytics at the Center for Research in Security Prices at the Chicago Booth School of Business, used that data to create a list of the 20 top American companies, ranked by their highest market cap, from 1925 through November.
No surprise: When the numbers are not adjusted for inflation, Apple is the largest company on the list by a large margin, followed by Alphabet (the parent company of Google) and Microsoft. In this list, all three hit their high point in November. Apple has been moving above and below its pinnacle since then, and its value was just above $895 billion at the close of trading Wednesday.
The list is basically split between the hot markets of the last 25 years: the current one, which started in March 2009, and the stock market surge associated with the dot-com era and its aftermath. General Electric was in fourth place over all, based on its $594 billion market cap in August 2000. Companies like Intel, Cisco and Oracle appear on the all-time list, too.
Intriguingly, AT&T made the list twice -- once, in March 2000, and a second time, in July 2016. That is because the University of Chicago says the "old" AT&T went out of existence in November 2005. AT&T was split into many pieces. The new AT&T was formed after SBC, a regional telephone company, bought the old AT&T name.
When you adjust for inflation, the ranking changes.
Degrees of Dominance
Another way of measuring a company's stature in the stock market is to see how big it is relative to the market as a whole. Using this metric, Apple in late 2017 does not tower over the rest of the stock market as much as many other companies did in previous eras.
In fact, although Apple's market cap is far higher today than it was five years ago, Apple shares represented a larger share of the total stock market in September 2012 than they do now.
The Apple of 2017 does not show up at all in either of the two Top 20 lists that Mr. Poukchanski produced, one starting in 1980 and one going all the way back to 1925.
It may be difficult to remember but, as we've written, IBM had far more stock market swagger in the 1980s than Apple does today.
In December 1985, IBM's shares constituted 4.4 percent of the entire stock market, a higher percentage than any other company since 1980.
That is a very high figure, given the enormous expanse of the universe covered by the Center for Research database, which included 6,225 stocks for December 1985. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has, as you might imagine, 500 stocks; the Dow Jones industrial average has 30.)
In November, Apple's shares constituted only 2.5 percent of the overall stock market. In September 2012, they reached 3.2 percent of the total market, far more than today.
In other words, many other stocks have become giants in the 2017 market: Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook and more. Apple does not tower over them as much as IBM once did over its contemporaries.
With an even longer perspective, Apple's current stature diminishes further.
Consider that in May 1932, AT&T constituted 13 percent of the entire stock market -- more than five times higher than Apple's proportion today. In March 1928, General Motors accounted for 8 percent of the stock market. And in 1970, IBM accounted for 6.8 percent of the market of that day.
More Companies in the Market
One explanation for the outsize status of these companies in earlier times is that the stock market itself was much smaller: 6,715 listings in November compared with only 704 in May 1932 and 584 in March 1928. It was easier to be a big fish in those smaller ponds.
That said, at the end of 1985, when IBM's market cap was far larger than any other company's, there were 6,225 publicly traded stocks in the market, nearly as many as today. So the size of the stock market isn't a sufficient explanation: Companies like IBM and AT&T simply were more dominant than Apple is now.
For example, the old AT&T was so big that Standard & Poor's excluded it from a predecessor to the S.&P. 500-stock index "because S.&P. did not want to let the performance of such a large firm dominate the index," as Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in his book, "Stocks for the Long Run."
Considered a monopoly, the old AT&T was forcibly broken up in 1984. (A descendant of the company is embroiled in antitrust issues of its own, arising from its proposed merger with Time Warner).
Some formerly colossal companies are no longer stock market powerhouses. For example, U.G.I., now a modest-sized utility company in Pennsylvania, accounted for 2.6 percent of the entire stock market in December 1932. In those days, the firm says on its website, U.G.I. was a holding company for scores of gas and electric companies, plus major engineering firms.
But a 1935 law during President Roosevelt's administration called for the abolition of such holding companies. After a lengthy court fight, U.G.I. transformed itself into a much smaller entity. On the list of the most dominant companies, it is an artifact of a bygone era.
It is possible that 80 or 90 years from now, journalists and historians will puzzle over Apple's once titanic stature, too. Why did the iPhone become so important -- and why was it so immensely profitable for investors back in the early days of the 21st century?
These questions may seem strange today, and those who are so inclined may celebrate as Apple sets new stock market records. But it is worth recalling that other companies played monumental roles in the stock market, until their day was done.

Full text: In case you haven't heard, nearly all that's good and pleasant in the world died this week. The tax bill passed. The bill has variously been described as "a disaster," "one of the great robberies" of history, and a "massive attack" on the middle class -- and that's just Bernie Sanders. Other critics say it will explode the deficit, enrich the undeserving rich, immiserate the underserved poor, and ring a "death knell" for the sinking middle class. Nancy Pelosi calls it a "Frankenstein," albeit one that will return to kill its Republican creators.
To which any G.O.P. political strategist would rejoin: Keep it up, folks.
There are things genuinely to dislike in the tax bill. It raises taxes on too many people. It barely cuts the top income-tax rate. It doesn't eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax. Taxpayers will get kicked into higher brackets (of which there are still too many) sooner, thanks to a new measure of inflation.
Worst of all is probably the provision for full expensing, which allows companies immediately to deduct the cost of capital investments from their tax bill. This is supposed to be the most stimulative part of the bill, especially for smaller companies looking to grow. But it's also an invitation to invest -- and over-invest -- based on tax incentives rather than the straight business case. Bankruptcies will follow.
O.K., no doubt your objections are different (and probably stronger) than mine. But here are two things to know: Slashing corporate rates -- the bill's central achievement -- is good economics. And wailing against the bill as an American Armageddon is dumb politics, at least for Democrats.
On the first point, consider the following case against the outgoing system:
"Our current corporate tax system is outdated, unfair and inefficient. It provides tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas and hits companies that choose to stay in America with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It is unnecessarily complicated and forces America's small businesses to spend countless hours and dollars filing their taxes. It's not right and it needs to change."
That was Barack Obama in 2012, with a proposal to cut rates to 28 percent. Other prominent Democrats who have previously called for cutting corporate taxes include Tim Geithner, Ms. Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer.
Maybe the current bill cuts the rate too far -- or, as I think, doesn't cut it far enough. Maybe the argument that companies will use additional revenues to hire more workers is too optimistic, if only because the United States is already close to full employment. Maybe they'll reward their shareholders instead -- which, however, probably means you, assuming you have an I.R.A.
And maybe there's something to be said for Google parking several billion dollars in profits in a Bermuda shell company, just to take advantage of the islands' zero rate. It's delightfully devious coming from the well-heeled apostles of "Don't Be Evil."
But the suggestion by senior Democrats that it is now a moral abomination to enact the very type of tax reform they themselves favored until quite recently smacks of partisan dishonesty, if not ideological hysteria. Many developed countries, including Germany, Sweden and Britain, have all slashed their corporate rates in recent years. Lo, the sky did not fall.
Now to the bad politics. Democrats think it's politically smart to oppose the bill because some 58 percent of Americans were against it, according to a recent poll.
A Times analysis of the poll also found that half of the people who will get a tax cut under the bill don't think they're going to get one, likely out of distrust for the president.
But nothing is so splendid in life or politics as a good surprise, and Democrats have positioned themselves to be on the wrong side of it. In 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center, 91 percent of middle-income filers will get a tax cut, averaging close to $1,100. That's real money, or at least enough to give Donald Trump and congressional Republicans a good opening for a "we told you so" moment.
The cuts also coincide with some of the most robust economic growth in over a decade. Ostensibly expert economic opinion now tells us the tax bill will do little or nothing for growth. But some of the same experts also told us Trump's election would cause a worldwide recession and send stock markets tumbling. If there's one thing every conservative lives for, it's liberal whoopsie moments like these.
Time will tell, and stuff happens -- think: war on the Korean peninsula, or perhaps a Bitcoin meltdown. For now, the G.O.P.'s legislative triumph is only being sweetened by the wildly overblown reaction to it. Why liberals would want to give the administration a holiday gift like this is beyond me, but, anyway, Merry Christmas.

Full text: After big gains over the last two days, U.S. stocks declined Tuesday after the House of Representative approved the Republican-backed tax bill, which would lower corporate tax rates. Big technology companies gave up some of their recent gains, and so did smaller companies, which have surged because investors feel they will be major beneficiaries of the reduced corporate tax rate. High-dividend stocks dropped as bond yields rose. U.S. indexes had jumped to record highs over the last two days as Republicans appeared to shore up enough support to make sure the bill passes.
Investors like that because it would boost corporate profits and likely raise stock prices along with it. The bill would initially cut taxes for most Americans but by 2027 would increase tax bills for most.
While stocks weren't doing much Tuesday, bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to its highest price in more than a month, to 2.45 percent from 2.39 percent late Monday.
Invesco Global Market Strategist Kristina Hooper said two factors are sending bond yields higher: investors are selling bonds to buy stocks as the tax bill appears likely to pass, and they also feel the bill may contribute to inflation.
"There's this expectation that we'll see companies save money on taxes, to put it simply, and spend more in other areas," she said. Investors think "it's going to have an impact on employment, wages, and therefore inflation," she said.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.69 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,681.47. The Dow Jones industrial average shed 37.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,754.75. The Nasdaq composite gave up 30.91 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6,963.85. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 12.17 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,536.75. It climbed almost 3 percent over the previous two days.
Apple fell $1.88, or 1.1 percent, to $174.54 after it closed at a new high on Monday. Visa lost $1.41, or 1.2 percent, to $112.14.
The tax bill passed through the House, largely along party lines ahead of a Senate vote scheduled for Tuesday night. The $1.5 trillion package would cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, and would slash taxes for the wealthy, with smaller cuts for middle-and low-income families.
Investors also traded on corporate news. Offshore drilling platform maker McDermott International said it will acquire engineering, procurement and construction services company Chicago Bridge & Iron. The companies valued the deal at $6 billion. McDermott fell 90 cents, or 11.9 percent, to $6.69 and CB&I lost $1.91, or 10.7 percent, to $16.01.
Medical device maker Zimmer Biomet climbed after it named Bryan Hanson to be its new CEO. Hanson most recently led at Medtronic's minimally invasive therapies business. Former CEO David Dvorak left the company in July. Zimmer gained $6.95, or 6.1 percent, to $121.38.
Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare said it will cut another $100 million in costs and will look to sell its Conifer business, which provides revenue management services. The company also said it will continue shaking up its board. Its stock gained 29 cents, or 2 percent, to $15.03.
Nursing and rehabilitation center company Kindred Healthcare said it will be bought by health insurer Humana and two private equity firms for $9 a share. That values Kindred at $782 million, and the company said the deal is worth $4.1 billion including debt.
Rumors of a sale have boosted the stock 23 percent this month, including a gain of 10.5 percent Monday. On Tuesday it retreated 40 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $9.10.
The hype surrounding digital currencies showed no signs of slowing. Shares in the financial technology company Longfin have skyrocketed since it bought Ziddu.com, which created a virtual currency for micro-lending. Longfin went public last Wednesday at $5 a share and announced the Ziddu deal Friday. The stock slipped $4.11, or 5.7 percent, to $68.27, giving Longfin a market value of $5.7 billion.
Even CEO Venkat Meenavalli attributed the sudden spike to "euphoric mania" in an interview with CNBC late Monday.
Energy companies edged higher along with the price of oil. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 30 cents to $57.46 a barrel in New York while Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 39 cents to $63.80 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.70 a gallon. Heating oil gained 1 cent to $1.94 a gallon. Natural gas sank 5 cents to $2.69 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold slipped $1.30 to $1,264.20 an ounce. Silver fell 5 cents to $16.15 an ounce. Copper added 1 cent to $3.15 a pound.
The dollar rose to 112.94 yen from 112.56 yen. The euro rose to $1.1845 from $1.1784.
The DAX in Germany slid 0.7 percent and the French CAC 40 gave up 0.7 percent. In Britain, the FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 shed 0.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.7 percent. The Kospi in Seoul declined 0.1 percent.

Full text: To understand the cynicism and mendacity underlying the Republican tax bill, look no further than a provision that would benefit President Trump and other property tycoons that is in the final legislation Congress is expected to vote on this week. The provision would allow people who make money from real estate to take a 20 percent deduction on income they earn through limited liability companies, partnerships and other so-called pass-through entities that do not pay the corporate tax. The beneficiaries would also include members of Congress like Senator Bob Corker, who last week decided he would vote for the bill even though Republican leaders did nothing to address his concerns about an exploding federal deficit.
The biggest winners would be people like Mr. Trump, his family and similarly advantaged developers who make tens or hundreds of millions of dollars every year on swanky office towers and luxurious apartment buildings. An earlier version of the bill passed by the Senate provided a 23 percent deduction but put limits on its use that would prevent wealthy developers from profiting from it. The House version would simply have reduced the rate at which pass-through income is taxed.
Republican leaders and Mr. Corker, who owns a real estate partnership in Tennessee, say the new loophole was not put in place to win over his vote. Mr. Corker has become more important because his party can afford to lose only two votes, and Senator John McCain will be absent because of the aftereffects from his cancer treatment.
Republicans insist, further, that the provision was not "airdropped" -- Mr. Corker's term -- into the tax bill during conference committee negotiations, and that its main purpose was to make sure pass-through businesses were not treated unfairly because corporations would be getting a big tax cut to 21 percent, from 35 percent now. Whatever the Republicans' protestations, this malodorous loophole is further confirmation that congressional leaders are doing everything they can to maximize benefits for the wealthy at the expense of almost everybody else.
As for Mr. Trump, he has been going around saying the tax bill would "cost me a fortune" and his accountants "are going crazy now." This claim has always been "fake news." But with the new loophole it has become even more nonsensical. Having done nothing to drain the Washington swamp, the president now luxuriates in its warm waters.
All told, the 20 percent deduction for pass-through income would cost the government $414.5 billion in lost revenue over 10 years, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. To put that number into context, it is about 29 times as much as the roughly $14 billion a year that the federal government spends on the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers nearly nine million kids from low-income families. Congress let authorization for that program lapse at the end of September.
The tax bill's generosity toward real estate titans stands in stark contrast to its stinginess toward the average wage earner as well as its very real damage to taxpayers in high-cost states. Average wage earners who would get modest tax cuts in the early years would see them evaporate into thin air after 2025. Homeowners and others in high-cost states like California, New Jersey and New York would see their once-sizable deductions for state and local taxes shrink to a maximum of $10,000 a year, which could in turn reduce home values. Further, the tax bill would permanently change how tax brackets are adjusted for inflation so that more people would be pushed into higher tax brackets over time even if they received only modest raises in salary.
Details aside, here in broad numbers is the bill's impact 10 years from now, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center: Nearly 70 percent of families with incomes of between $54,700 and $93,200 a year would pay more in taxes than they would under current law. By contrast, 92 percent of families whose incomes put them in the top 0.1 percent of the country would get a tax cut averaging $206,280.
This bill is bad enough. No less revolting is the dishonest and sneaky way it was written.

Tax Bill Would Add to Burden of Strained I.R.S.

Full text: After years of upbraiding and even threatening to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, Republicans must now depend on the agency to carry out their signature legislative accomplishment: a comprehensive revision of the tax code. The task is monumental. While processing tens of millions of tax returns for 2017 under the current rules, the I.R.S. would also have to figure out how to interpret and explain a new system and put it into practice.
"Beware," said John A. Koskinen, who retired last month as I.R.S. commissioner. "If the budget keeps being cut and the agency keeps being given more things to do, the I.R.S. is simply not going to work." Either the information technology will fail, forcing the filing and refund systems to collapse, he warned, or enforcement and audits will become so scarce that fewer people will be inclined to pay the taxes they owe.
The House and Senate were expected to vote on the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul as soon as Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence planned to preside over the vote and, if needed, break a tie and pass the bill.
Even before Congress began revising the tax code, the I.R.S. was struggling to keep up with an expanding workload. Since 2010, its budget has been cut by $900 million -- or 17 percent, after adjusting for inflation -- and its staff reduced by 21,000, or 23 percent. In the meantime, it has had to process roughly 10 million more individual returns.
The agency has been a favorite target of Republicans, who have complained that it unfairly investigated conservative organizations and reveled in irritating taxpayers. (A recent inspector general report showed that the I.R.S. had scrutinized both liberal and conservative groups.) During the campaign, President Trump accused the agency of unjustly hounding him with audits year after year. Paying as little as possible was "the American way," he declared.
Although Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has acknowledged the importance of sufficiently funding the nation's revenue collector, Mr. Trump's budget proposed deep cuts.
Referring to enforcement, taxpayer services and cybersecurity, Mr. Koskinen said, "We don't have enough people to do all the work that needs to be done as a general matter," let alone grapple with an overhaul of the tax code.
Getting out new withholding tables, so that payroll managers know how much to deduct from paychecks and can update their systems, would be a priority on the agency's expanded to-do list.
The American Payroll Association, with 21,000 members, sounded an alarm in a letter to Congress: "Our members are already starting to panic, on behalf of themselves and millions of employees, about the effect on 2018 withholdings of a tax bill that will be effective a week after its enactment."
The I.R.S. said in a statement on Thursday that taxpayers should not expect to see any changes as a result of the legislation to be reflected in their paychecks until February, and that the agency would work closely with payroll and tax professionals.
That delay puts the onus on workers to make adjustments later in the year if too much or too little money is being withheld because their January paychecks reflect the outdated 2017 law.
Pete Isberg, vice president for government relations for ADP, one of the largest payroll providers, said taking account of the changes would be easier for the larger automated companies, but acknowledged that the short lead time between the law's anticipated passage and the effective date would be a problem for some.
The prospective elimination of personal exemptions adds another twist. That may invalidate all the automatic withholding forms, or W-4s, that employees signed, Mr. Isberg said, "and put employers in the position of getting a new W-4 from every U.S. worker."
The burden of carrying out a new code also falls heavily on the I.R.S. legal staff, who -- along with their counterparts at the Treasury Department -- are responsible for explaining to tax preparers, businesses and individuals what the statute means. They will detail, for example, under what circumstances the alternative minimum tax should be used, or whether a given expense qualifies for a particular exemption.
If the plan is passed, I.R.S. staff members will have to write countless guidelines and regulations to define and explain critical terms and concepts, as well as correct technical flaws that can arise in the best of circumstances, let alone in a bill done at breakneck speed.
Mr. Trump's directive to federal agencies to eliminate two regulations for every one that is added could present an unexpected speed bump. Most of the regulations that the I.R.S. issues with Treasury are meant to interpret rather than set policy.
"The I.R.S. needs to be exempt from those regulations, or they just won't be able to implement the law," said Fred T. Goldberg Jr., I.R.S. commissioner under President George H.W. Bush.
Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Monday that lawmakers wanted to sit down with the I.R.S.'s acting commissioner, David J. Kautter, to determine the agency's needs. Mr. Brady added that consumer service should be more of a focus: "My sense is that there could be broad bipartisan support for restructuring the I.R.S."
The agency can expect it would be deluged with questions from taxpayers and practitioners about the changes. Responding would require retraining employees and making new hires to handle the expected onslaught of requests.
"The I.R.S. is one of the few agencies that touches just about every household," said Mark J. Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. "If you go to an I.R.S. walk-in site, you have some expectation of getting the right answer."
Updating the agency's vast computer system is also a gargantuan undertaking. The I.R.S. (along with much of the federal government and major financial institutions) uses a computer programming language called Cobol, developed almost 60 years ago. Almost every coding change will, in effect, have to be entered by hand.
Congress significantly increased the agency's funding after the 1986 tax overhaul passed. As a result, the I.R.S. hired an additional 2,100 employees to help carry out the new law.
This time, Congress has not made any specific appropriation requests. During hearings last week before a House oversight committee, witnesses testified about how difficult it would be for the I.R.S. to handle the largest overhaul of the tax code in more than 30 years. Little consideration has "been given to ensuring I.R.S. has the resources necessary to carry out this monumental task," Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, testified.
Given how much the bill is expected to cost, even under the Republicans' optimistic projections, meeting its budget targets will depend on collecting the taxes owed under the new system.
Challenging the I.R.S. at every turn, however, will be a growing phalanx of highly paid tax lawyers and accountants intent on finding ways to outmaneuver the I.R.S. and avoid taxes. Every 1 percent drop in compliance costs the government $33 billion a year. Yet enforcement and auditing capabilities have perhaps suffered the most as the agency's budget has shrunk.
"It won't surprise me if the combination of the filing season and implementation of the legislation create significant problems," said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer and former director of the I.R.S. division for tax-exempt organizations.

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO -- Latin America's political right is on a decisive winning streak. In Brazil, the leftist Workers' Party was ousted from power last year when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached.
Last month, President Mauricio Macri of Argentina led his center-right coalition to a sweeping victory in legislative elections that left the once-formidable Peronist party divided and adrift.
And then in Chile on Sunday night, the left's last hope of hanging on to power in one of the region's economic and diplomatic heavyweights slipped away as the billionaire SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, running on a conservative platform, cruised to victory in the presidential election.
"Chile is saved!" Mr. PiÃ±era supporters chanted on the streets of Santiago, the capital, on Sunday night, where one man savored the moment by holding up a bust of the dictator Augusto Pinochet.
The region's political shift began as the end of a commodities boom a decade ago forced governments to slash spending and as corruption scandals tarred the images of leaders who rose to power by vowing to spread the wealth in a region of stark inequality.
"The population of Latin America is sending a message after the successive failures and crimes of the left in all the countries where it prevailed," Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right Brazilian lawmaker polling in second place ahead of Brazil's presidential election, wrote in a post on Twitter, after congratulating Mr. PiÃ±era. Referring to a regional conference of leftist leaders that dates to the 1990s, he added, "The SÃ£o Paulo forum's days are numbered."
Among the leftists who remain in power, the two most prominent leaders are accused of resorting to undemocratic means to stay in office.
President NicolÃ¡s Maduro of Venezuela became a regional pariah after the democratically elected National Assembly was supplanted by a new body loyal to Mr. Maduro in August, the most aggressive of a series of steps his socialist party has taken to consolidate power amid a worsening economic and humanitarian crisis.
President Evo Morales of Bolivia, meanwhile, has been criticized for pursuing a fourth term in office in 2019, ignoring the will of voters who decided in a 2016 referendum that he should not be allowed to run again.
As the region shifts to the right, its leaders face daunting challenges in an era of slow economic growth and deeply polarized societies.
To a significant extent, those difficulties are the product of policies and expectations leftist leaders set in motion. Austerity measures intended to reduce inflation and balance budgets in countries like Brazil and Argentina stand to anger large segments of the population that came to see such things as free education and generous pensions as basic rights.
In Chile on Monday, leftists were feeling deflated as they began to contemplate an era of lower spending on social programs and education.
"Students still remember vividly when PiÃ±era said that education was a consumer good," Javiera LÃ³pez, the secretary general of the student federation at the University of Chile, said in an interview, making a reference to a remark Mr. PiÃ±era made in 2011 when he was grappling with student demonstrations as president. "The student movement will continue demanding free education as a basic right on the streets and in Congress."
Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, the president of Brazil's Workers' Party, which governed from 2003 to 2016, said the left in the region began to buckle as the 2008 financial crisis in the United States set off a period of global economic uncertainty and retrenchment. Right-wing leaders, she said, seized the opportunity to portray leftist governments as fiscally irresponsible.
"People had reached a level of well-being in which they had food, access to public services, and they began making other demands," Ms. Hoffmann said in a recent interview. Leftist leaders, the senator said, were not in a position to deliver and did a poor job at convincing voters that their improved lot in life was the result of leftist policies.
"The social programs, the gains people saw during that period, were seen as the result of their individual effort," she said.
Yet, voters also soured on leftist leaders because several became embroiled in corruption scandals. Ms. Hoffmann and the two party figures who rose to the presidency, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva and Ms. Rousseff, were charged in September in a broad kickback scheme involving state contracts. They call the case against them a political witch hunt begun to keep the left from returning to power in Brazil during elections next year.
Center-right governments have had difficulty carrying out some of the reforms they promised would usher a new era of prosperity in the region.
In Brazil, President Michel Temer, having spent the bulk of his political capital this year fending off a corruption trial, is struggling to build support for a pension overhaul bill.
In Argentina, Mr. Macri's government's proposed pension plan, which is before Congress, has set off intense clashes in downtown in recent days. On Monday, tens of thousands of people gathered to protest the changes -- a gradual tightening of pension benefits -- and unions called for a 24-hour strike in an effort to sink the measure.
Juan Cruz DÃ­az, a political analyst who runs the Cefeidas consultancy group in Buenos Aires, said voters had gravitated toward the right largely to reject the leadership style of politicians who fell out of favor.
"Voters are rejecting governments that were in power for a long time and became associated with corruption and certain authoritarian attitudes that became their way of exercising power," he said.
Chile's incumbent president, Michelle Bachelet, a physician, left office as a widely popular politician when her first term ended in 2010. Her popularity sank toward the end of her current term as a result of slow economic growth and a ballooning public debt.
Those factors saddled Alejandro Guillier, a center-left former journalist who ran a campaign pledging to build on Bachelet-era reforms.
In a race in which many Chileans found both candidates unappealing, Mr. PiÃ±era's campaign sought advantage by warning that a Guillier victory would put Chile on track to become a "Chilezuela," a reference to Venezuela's crisis.
Luis Tonelli, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Buenos Aires, said that characterization was unfair because Ms. Bachelet was a more fiscally responsible leader than many of her leftist counterparts.
"In much of Latin America, what we're living through is the hangover of something that was not economically sustainable," he said. "But in Chile that doesn't really apply. It's a country that is finally creating a middle class, and that segment of society suddenly has more demands that are harder to fulfill."
The power of leftist leaders may have diminished, but it is by no means exhausted. Despite the criminal case against him, which may keep him off the ballot next year, Mr. da Silva remains the most popular presidential contender in Brazil. In Ecuador, Lenin Moreno, a socialist, beat a center-right rival in April.
Although as a candidate Mr. PiÃ±era made striking overtures to the right-wing fringe, he also vowed to broadly preserve some of Ms. Bachelet's initiatives, including expanding access to education and health care. If he is to govern effectively, analysts said, he will need partners on the left. The conciliatory tone he struck during his victory speech makes it clear Mr. PiÃ±era intends to try.
"My friends, we may think differently, differences are great, a plurality of ideas is great," he said. "But those differences must never turn us into enemies. Each time Chileans turned on each other, and viewed each other as enemies, we harvested our biggest defeats."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In a speech outlining his first national security strategy, President Trump sought to distinguish himself as a commander in chief who is breaking records and setting precedents. Mr. Trump spoke of historic military spending, a never-before-seen emphasis on border security at home and allies finally sharing the United States' defense burdens abroad -- all claims that require some explanation. Here's an assessment.
He falsely called the $700 billion defense policy bill for 2018 "a record."
"We are once again investing in our defense -- almost $700 billion -- a record this coming year," Mr. Trump said.
He was referring to the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual bill that authorizes funding for the Pentagon, nuclear weapons programs at the Energy Department and military elements of the intelligence community. That is different from an appropriations bill, which actually provides the funding.
The defense authorization that Mr. Trump signed into law last week included a base defense budget of $626 billion for the 2018 fiscal year. It also authorized about $66 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, a spending account that is used to fund wars.
One does not need to look far for authorization bills that have been larger. President Barack Obama signed a defense authorization bill of $725 billion for the 2011 fiscal year, more than $150 billion of which funded continuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Adjusted for inflation, the gap between the 2011 bill and the 2018 bill would be greater still.
He misleadingly suggested that NATO members are increasing defense contributions at his urging.
Mr. Trump claimed "tens of billions of dollars more pouring in because I would not allow member states to be delinquent."
Under NATO guidelines, member states agree to commit a minimum 2 percent of gross domestic product to the organization's defense efforts, but few nations actually do so.
Members that were not meeting that bar of 2 percent pledged in September 2014 -- nine months before Mr. Trump announced his candidacy -- to do so over the next decade.
The secretary general of the military alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, said in July that five countries contributed at least 2 percent of their G.D.P. in 2016. He said he expected Romania to reach the benchmark this year, and Latvia and Lithuania to do so next year.
It is conceivable that Mr. Trump ushered along the process, but efforts to address the disparity predated his complaints.
He exaggerated when he said foreign countries were not sharing the "cost of defending them."
"We have made clear that countries that are immensely wealthy should reimburse the United States for the cost of defending them," Mr. Trump said. "This is a major departure from the past, but a fair and necessary one."
The notion that allies do not share the costs of hosting American troops abroad is inaccurate. His emphasis on a dollar-for-dollar "reimbursement" also mischaracterizes the relationship between the United States and its allies.
"That would be mercenary," said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They pay for a lot of the cost supporting our troops in their country."
A 2004 report from the Pentagon detailed the contributions that allies make toward hosting American troops. Japan, for example, provided over $4.4 billion in direct and indirect support, equal to about 75 percent of costs to the United States.
The government of South Korea said in 2014 that it would pay $866 million, equal to about 40 percent of the total, for American troops there.
The United States also benefits from these relationships in the form of a larger global footprint, counterterrorism intelligence sharing and trade advantages.
He exaggerated his national strategy's emphasis on border security as "the first time ever."
While Mr. Trump's strategy may be the first to call for the construction of a border wall, it is not the first to pay tribute to the importance of border security.
Mr. Obama's 2010 strategy spoke of efforts to "maintain effective control of our physical borders" and "safeguard lawful trade and travel into and out of the United States."
It also included a goal of pursuing comprehensive immigration overhaul that "effectively secures our borders" and deters unlawful entry.
President George W. Bush's 2006 strategy declared a goal of working with the United States' nearest neighbors to reduce illegal immigration.
And in his 1998 strategy, President Bill Clinton vowed to "cooperate with other states to curb illegal immigration into this country" and listed border protection as one of his major goals and initiatives.

Full text: Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But in the last three years its economy has collapsed. Hunger has gripped the nation for years. Now, it's killing children.
The Venezuelan government knows, but won't admit it.
SAN CASIMIRO, Venezuela -- Kenyerber Aquino MerchÃ¡n was 17 months old when he starved to death.
His father left before dawn to bring him home from the hospital morgue. He carried Kenyerber's skeletal frame into the kitchen and handed it to a mortuary worker who makes house calls for Venezuelan families with no money for funerals.
Kenyerber's spine and rib cage protruded as the embalming chemicals were injected. Aunts shooed away curious young cousins, mourners arrived with wildflowers from the hills, and relatives cut out a pair of cardboard wings from one of the empty white ration boxes that families increasingly depend on amid the food shortages and soaring food prices throttling the nation. They gently placed the tiny wings on top of Kenyerber's coffin to help his soul reach heaven -- a tradition when a baby dies in Venezuela.
When Kenyerber's body was finally ready for viewing, his father, Carlos Aquino, a 37-year-old construction worker, began to weep uncontrollably. "How can this be?" he cried, hugging the coffin and speaking softly, as if to comfort his son in death. "Your papÃ¡ will never see you again."
Hunger has stalked Venezuela for years. Now, it is killing the nation's children at an alarming rate, doctors in the country's public hospitals say.
Venezuela has been shuddering since its economy began to collapse in 2014. Riots and protests over the lack of affordable food, excruciating long lines for basic provisions, soldiers posted outside bakeries and angry crowds ransacking grocery stores have rattled cities, providing a telling, public display of the depths of the crisis.
But deaths from malnutrition have remained a closely guarded secret by the Venezuelan government. In a five-month investigation by The New York Times, doctors at 21 public hospitals in 17 states across the country said that their emergency rooms were being overwhelmed by children with severe malnutrition -- a condition they had rarely encountered before the economic crisis began.
"Children are arriving with very precarious conditions of malnutrition," said Dr. HunÃ­ades Urbina Medina, the president of the Venezuelan Society of Childcare and Pediatrics. He added that doctors were even seeing the kind of extreme malnutrition often found in refugee camps -- cases that were highly unusual in oil-rich Venezuela before its economy fell to pieces.
For many low-income families, the crisis has completely redrawn the social landscape. Parents like Kenyerber's mother go days without eating, shriveling to the weight of children themselves. Women line up at sterilization clinics to avoid having children they can't feed. Young boys leave home and join street gangs to scavenge for scraps, their bodies bearing the scars of knife fights with competitors. Crowds of adults storm Dumpsters after restaurants close. Babies die because it is hard to find or afford infant formula, even in emergency rooms.
"Sometimes they die in your arms just from dehydration," Dr. Milagros HernÃ¡ndez said in the emergency room of a children's hospital in the northern city of Barquisimeto, noting that the hospital had started seeing an increase in malnourished patients at the end of 2016.
"But in 2017 the increase in malnourished patients has been terrible," she added. "Children arrive with the same weight and height of a newborn."
Before Venezuela's economy started spiraling, doctors say, almost all of the child malnutrition cases they saw in public hospitals stemmed from neglect or abuse by parents. But as the economic crisis began to intensify in 2015 and 2016, the number of cases of severe malnutrition at the nation's leading pediatric health center in the capital more than tripled, doctors say. This year looks even worse.
In many countries, extreme malnutrition "can be caused when there is war, a drought, some sort of catastrophe or an earthquake," said Dr. Ingrid Soto de Sanabria, the chief of the hospital's nutrition, growth and development department. "But in our country it is directly related to the shortages and inflation."
The Venezuelan government has tried to cover up the extent of the crisis by enforcing a near-total blackout of health statistics, and by creating a culture in which doctors are often afraid to register cases and deaths that may be associated with the government's failures.
But the statistics that have come out are staggering. In the Ministry of Health's 2015 annual report, the mortality rate for children under 4 weeks old had increased a hundredfold, from 0.02 percent in 2012 to just over 2 percent. Maternal mortality had increased nearly fivefold in the same period.
For almost two years, the government did not publish a single epidemiological bulletin tracking statistics like infant mortality. Then in April of this year, a link suddenly appeared on the Health Ministry's official website, leading to the unpublished bulletins. They showed that 11,446 children under the age of 1 had died in 2016 -- a 30 percent increase in one year -- as the economic crisis accelerated.
The new findings made national and international headlines before the government declared that the website had been hacked, and the reports were swiftly removed. The health minister was fired and the military was put in charge of monitoring the bulletins. No reports have been released since.
Doctors are censored in hospitals, too, often warned not to include malnutrition in children's medical records.
"In some public hospitals, the clinical diagnosis of malnutrition has been prohibited," Dr. HunÃ­ades Urbina said.
But doctors interviewed by The Times at nine of the 21 public hospitals said that they had kept at least some count. They encountered nearly 2,800 cases of child malnutrition in the last year alone, with starving children regularly brought to emergency rooms. Nearly 400 of the children died, the doctors said.
"Never in my life had I seen so many hungry children," said Dr. Livia Machado, a pediatrician who gives free consultations at her private practice to children who had been hospitalized at Dr. Domingo Luciani Hospital in the capital, Caracas.
The hospital is one of the few still accepting malnourished infants for treatment. Other hospitals often turn them away, telling desperate parents that they do not have enough beds or medical supplies to treat their children. Nearly all of Venezuelan hospitals report shortages of basic provisions like baby formula.
President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has acknowledged that people are hungry in Venezuela, but he has refused to accept international aid, often saying that Venezuela's economic problems are caused by foreign adversaries like the United States, which he says is waging an economic war against his country.
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But many economists contend that years of economic mismanagement set the stage for the current disaster. The damage was masked when oil prices were high, giving the government large resources. But when oil prices began a steep fall at the end of 2014, scarcities became common and food prices skyrocketed. Inflation could reach 2,300 percent next year, the International Monetary Fund warned in October.
The Health Ministry and the National Institute of Nutrition did not respond to requests for interviews or official health reports containing malnutrition statistics. But the nation's political opposition, which has been stripped of its power by the government, continues to sound the alarm.
"We have a people who are dying of hunger," Luis Florido, a congressman who leads the National Assembly's foreign policy committee, told lawmakers in November, calling the food crisis "a humanitarian emergency that all Venezuelans are living."
'So Many Children'
Kenyerber was born healthy: 6 pounds 7 ounces. But his mother, MarÃ­a Carolina MerchÃ¡n, 29, was bitten by a mosquito and infected with a severe case of the Zika virus when Kenyerber was 3 months old. She had to be hospitalized, and doctors instructed her to stop breast feeding because of serious complications from her illness.
Unable to find or afford infant formula, the family improvised with whatever they could find: bottles of cream of rice or cornstarch, mixed with whole milk. It did not provide Kenyerber with the nutrients he needed.
At 9 months, his father found him listless in bed, with blood running from his nose. He rushed him to the overcrowded pediatric emergency room at Dr. Domingo Luciani hospital, where patients and beds spill out of rooms, into dingy hallways paced by armed soldiers.
Kleiver Enrique HernÃ¡ndez, 3 months old, was being treated for severe malnutrition a few beds down from Kenyerber. He too was born healthy -- 8 pounds 2 ounces -- but his mother, Kelly HernÃ¡ndez, could not breast-feed him, either.
Again, despite searching endlessly, Ms. HernÃ¡ndez and her boyfriend, CÃ©sar GonzÃ¡lez, could not get infant formula for their son. It was not for lack of trying.
In online inventory searches of Locatel, one of the largest pharmacy chains in Venezuela, The Times found that only one of its 64 locations across the country reported having the infant formula doctors had prescribed for Kleiver in stock.
It is unlikely that Ms. HernÃ¡ndez could have afforded it anyway. Hyperinflation has shriveled wages paid in the local currency, bolÃ­vars, to a small fraction of what they were worth two years ago. A month's worth of the formula Kleiver needed cost more than twice the entire monthly salary that Mr. GonzÃ¡lez earned as an agricultural worker.
Formula shortages hit the hospitals, too. Doctors in the emergency room at Dr. Domingo Luciani hospital said they had no formula in stock to feed patients like Kenyerber and Kleiver. The 2016 National Survey of Hospitals found that 96 percent of Venezuelan hospitals reported not having all of the infant formula they needed to attend to patients. More than 63 percent reported having no formula at all.
With so few options, Kleiver's mother warily prepared bottles of rice starch and water, occasionally with whole milk, when they could find it. It was not enough.
His parents had taken him to three emergency rooms. Each hospital was full. "I was desperate -- and seeing so many, so many children in the same situation as our boy," Ms. HernÃ¡ndez said.
When they were admitted to Dr. Domingo Luciani, they were tremendously relieved. But soon they watched a steady stream of parents arriving with malnourished babies -- only to leave, crying, "My child has died!"
They waited anxiously for Kleiver's condition to improve, sleeping in a chair by his side or in the courtyard outside, on alert to go searching for any supplies the doctors might ask for.
After 20 days in the hospital, they became one of the families they had watched in horror. A team of doctors worked for hours to help Kleiver, inadvertently covering him in blood and bruises as they tried to insert a tube into his neck. By the time doctors finally accepted that they could not save him, his lifeless body looked brutally beaten. Kleiver had suffered an incredibly painful death, his doctors said -- one that they said could have been avoided had infant formula been available.
Severe acute malnutrition is both self-evident and strikingly complex. Even when doctors are open to recording it for a patient, it is not necessarily the official cause of death. Instead, acute malnutrition can set off a range of pathologies in the human body, leading to death from respiratory failure, infection or other ailments. But in the case of Kenyerber and Kleiver, a rare situation occurred for Venezuela: Severe malnutrition was listed as a cause of death on their death certificates.
More than 100 friends and family members came to the all-night wake in Kleiver's family home. His aunts and cousins hung large posters decorated with colorful hand-drawn cartoons and messages. Kleiver lay underneath, in a small white coffin, on paper wings.
Just three months earlier, the family had colored signs and tacked them to the walls -- to celebrate his birth. One still hung over his bed the night of his wake, cut into the shape of a balloon.
"Welcome Kleiver Enrique, I love you so much," it said.
After the sun came up, the neighborhood held a large funeral procession to the cemetery. Ms. HernÃ¡ndez collapsed on a nearby tombstone, sobbing uncontrollably. Overcome by the guilt of not being able to breast-feed or find infant formula for her son, she shouted repeatedly, "Am I an awful mother? Please, just say it!"
Helpless and Indignant
In Barquisimeto, Dr. HernÃ¡ndez rushed into the emergency room, shouting: "I'm coming in with an 18-day-old baby. He was fed with anise tea, cow's milk and sometimes breast-fed by a neighbor. It's a bad one!"
Doctors and nurses at Dr. AgustÃ­n Zubillaga University Hospital of Pediatrics worked quickly to assess the baby, Esteban Granadillo. He weighed 4 pounds 10 ounces, and looked scared, fixing his hollow eyes on the doctors outside the thick plastic walls of his incubator.
"Tell me what you gave him to eat," Dr. HernÃ¡ndez asked the boy's great-aunt, MarÃ­a Peraza, who had taken him to the hospital. "This child's stomach was destroyed and possibly even his liver by what you fed him!"
Children suffering from malnutrition occupied four of the 12 beds in the pediatric emergency room that day in August. Doctors there said they had received malnutrition cases nearly every day -- a rarity until the crisis started getting worse two years ago.
But only a fraction of the medicines they need are available. In June, the hospital director at the time, Dr. Jorge Gaiti, said he had requested 193 necessary medications from the government agency responsible for distributing them to public hospitals. Only four of the 193 were delivered, according to the reports visible on his computer. The hospital even lacks the most basic medical supplies -- soap, syringes, gauze, diapers and latex gloves.
Nurses send parents away with lists of items to look for in pharmacies or to buy from the black-market vendors who circle the hospital, selling exorbitantly priced, hard-to-find medical supplies.
Dr. HernÃ¡ndez said she felt indignant and helpless as a doctor, as children died in her emergency room unnecessarily. "It is unfair," she said.
Esteban's mother was single, disabled and unable to breast-feed him, his great-aunt said. In desperation, relatives had asked a neighbor with a young child to step in and breast-feed. The family also fed him bottles of cow's milk, or chamomile water and anise tea, to fill his stomach.
"We could not find formula anywhere," said Ms. Peraza, the great-aunt, acknowledging that she knew the food could hurt the baby. "Yes, it was bad, but I tell you -- if we had not done it, this baby would have died."
Ms. Peraza stayed at the hospital next to Esteban's incubator for days, stroking his stomach through the openings and whispering softly to him. He spent weeks in and out of the hospital -- and died on Oct. 8.
Three floors above, pediatricians examined a 1-month-old baby, Rusneidy RodrÃ­guez, a week after she was admitted for severe malnutrition. Her mother, hospitalized with an infection, had been unable to breast-feed her. As in Esteban's case, her relatives had been unable to find formula, so they made bottles out of what they could find: whole milk, cream of rice, or water mixed with barley -- an ingredient used to make beer.
The emergency room was so overwhelmed that gurneys overflowed into the hallway. Sometimes the hospital has to double up patients, two per bed.
In the incubator next to Esteban, a 5-month-old girl, Dayferlin Aguilar, struggled to open her eyes and smile at her mother, Albiannys Castillo. Ms. Castillo had brought Dayferlin to the hospital when the little girl became very weak, falling in and out of consciousness and suffering uncontrollable diarrhea. Doctors diagnosed malnutrition and dehydration.
Ms. Castillo could not produce any breast milk, so she routinely arrived at 1 a.m. to wait in line outside pharmacies until they opened, to search for infant formula. More often than not, she said, they had none in stock or would run out by the time she got to the front of the line.
"Your mamÃ¡ is here with you, my daughter -- and I love you," she told Dayferlin when the little girl managed to open her eyes.
Dayferlin died three days after being admitted to the hospital. She was buried with fuchsia-colored wings made from paper, trimmed in turquoise, with a matching crown placed on her head.
Digging Through Garbage
Oriana Caraballo, 29, waited in line for hours with her three children -- Brayner, 8; Rayman, 6; and Sofia, 22 months -- to enter a crowded soup kitchen run by a local Roman Catholic church in Los Teques. Aside from drinking water, they had not eaten for three days.
Before the crisis, Ms. Caraballo fed her children using the wages from her job at a restaurant. Now she wept as she spooned soup into Sofia's mouth -- and recounted how her children had foiled her suicide attempt.
Ms. Caraballo could not bear the pain of watching her children go hungry. She said she had taken them outside her home, while her baby daughter was sleeping, then went back inside and shut the door. She hung a cable and wrapped it around her neck, she said. When she was just about to hang herself, she heard her daughter start to cry.
"I heard a voice tell me, 'Do it, do it, do it,"' she said. "Then in my other ear I heard, 'Don't do it, don't do it -- look at your children."'
Her son called to her, telling her to open the door. She became overcome with guilt and decided against suicide. Her oldest son has fainted several times at school, from going without breakfast or dinner the night before. He cries every night because he is hungry and, at 8, begs his mother to let him work to buy food for the family.
A recent report by the United Nations and the Pan American Health Organization found that 1.3 million people who used to be able to feed themselves in Venezuela have had difficulty doing so since the economic crisis began three years ago.
In soup kitchens around the country visited by The Times, many of the parents who brought their children had full-time jobs. But hyperinflation had destroyed their salaries and savings. A 2016 survey by three Venezuelan universities found that nine out of 10 households had become "food insecure" in Venezuela.
Caritas, the Roman Catholic aid group, has been weighing and measuring groups of children under 5 in working-class communities in multiple states since last year. Fifty-four percent of children in them suffer from some sort of malnutrition, the study has found.
Many families scavenge for food in the streets or at garbage dumps. Few are homeless, and most said they had never had trouble finding food before the crisis. Hundreds of people can be seen picking through garbage cans each evening when restaurants, grocery stores and residential buildings take out their trash for collection.
In the coastal town of MorÃ³n, dozens of people waded knee-deep in garbage at a large dump, looking for food and recyclables to sell. The nearby port in Puerto Cabello was once the driving force behind the local economy. Now it is largely empty.
Many of the people picking through the trash at the dump said that they used to work in the port but were now desperate to feed their families after being laid off once ship traffic slowed to a trickle. Several mothers said they had never imagined having to feed their families from discarded garbage.
Families are also increasingly sending their children into the streets to beg, or to work for money for food. Some never returned.
Turning to the Streets, or Sterilization
In Caracas, two brothers -- JosÃ© Luis Armas, 11, and Luis Armas, 9 -- said they had run away from home, where there was scarcely enough to eat. Now they live in the streets with other homeless boys in street gangs, getting into knife fights to expand or defend their territories and to control areas for panhandling or picking through garbage for recycling.
Several of their friends have been killed, they said. Luis raised his shirt to show a large gash across his stomach -- the result, he said, of a machete attack by a member of another gang. The attack nearly killed him, he said.
They say they prefer to live on the streets, despite the danger, because they eat better than they could living at home with their families. They spend their days panhandling, searching for discarded food and recyclables, bathing in public fountains, stashing their belongings in trees and storm drains, while constantly avoiding run-ins with the police and rival gangs.
Nelson Villasmil, a government social worker in the capital, said that before the crisis, most of the homeless children he encountered lived in the streets because of parental negligence or abuse. But now when he interviews them, he says, they often tell him they left their homes because there was no food to eat.
"What they cannot find in their houses, they go to find in the street," Mr. Villasmil said.
Three months ago, Yail Fonseca, 13, said he left his home in Los Valles del Tuy to search for food in Caracas.
"I left my home because things are hard," he said. "We weren't eating well."
He says he eats better as a homeless person on his own in the capital than at home with his family on the outskirts of the city. He sleeps under an overhang at an outdoor skate park with a group of other homeless adults and children, waking up at 6 a.m. to search through garbage for food or beg for handouts from local restaurants.
In the evenings, he says, he practices sparring with other young members of his gang, using sticks to become more agile at knife fights. His leader requires them to practice at least 30 minutes a day.
The gang leader, an adult who would not reveal his full name, said they had a code: If anyone in the gang is attacked by a single member of a rival gang, he must defend himself alone, even to the death, no matter how old he is. The rest of the gang will step in only if a member is attacked by multiple rivals at once. Four young members of the gang had been stabbed to death in recent months, the leader said. The boys around him lifted up their shirts to show their own scars.
Sometimes the state steps in, taking away children from some homes where hunger is common. After two of their children died of complications from malnutrition, Nerio Parra and Abigail Torres lost three more -- to social workers.
Their 7-month-old daughter, Nerianyelis, died in September 2016 when the family could not find infant formula for sale, they said. Mr. Parra had a full-time job at a company that makes labels, but the couple said they could afford to feed their children only once a day. The morning Nerianyelis died, she was sluggish and very thin. Her parents said they had carried her in the rain to the hospital, to no avail.
Abigail was so distraught that she broke down and refused to let go of her daughter's body, they said. Hospital security had to forcibly separate the two. Then on Dec. 1, 2016, their 5-year-old son, Neomar, who suffered from malnutrition, dehydration and other ailments, died as well, his case worker said.
After Neomar died, social services took away the three remaining children and placed them in group homes. Now, the couple visit their surviving children and go to the cemetery to visit the graves of their deceased ones.
The burden of caring for children in Venezuela can be so great these days that many women are opting to be sterilized. Just after dawn one Saturday in July, 21 young women dressed in surgical gowns waited to be surgically sterilized during a free event at the state-run JosÃ© Gregorio HernÃ¡ndez Hospital in a working-class neighborhood of the capital.
The hospital says it has sterilized more than 300 women through this program. On that Saturday, all 21 of the women, who ranged from 25 to 32 years old, said they already had children and wanted to be sterilized because the economic crisis had made it too difficult to raise children. Each feared becoming pregnant again, citing dire shortages of essential supplies like diapers, formulas, milk and medicine.
The crisis has also led to widespread shortages of birth-control pills and condoms. Many of the mothers at the sterilization event said that their most recent pregnancies had been unplanned and unwanted, but that they did not have access to birth control.
Eddy FarÃ­as, 25, a hair stylist, said she was nervous about the operation but resolute in her decision to undergo it. As a single mother with a full-time job, she said her wages at a salon were barely enough to feed her five children.
"It's hard to be a mom," she said. "If your child gets sick, you have to run circles trying to find a hospital," she added. "It is a war just to survive day to day."
After her operation, she said, she was in pain from the large incision across her lower abdomen, but relieved.
"If I got pregnant again, that would mean I'd have to go to war again for diapers," she said. "It is like war to have to buy diapers on the black market, or have to wake up before dawn to wait in long lines and fight others for the food, the diapers, the personal things a child needs."
Skipping Meals So Her Children Can Eat
Six weeks after cutting out angel wings from the food rations box to bury Kenyerber, his family was still battling hunger.
His mother, MarÃ­a Carolina MerchÃ¡n, said she had wilted to 66 pounds from skipping meals so that her four surviving children had a little more to eat. Government social workers said she was severely malnourished, as were her own mother and her 6-year old daughter, Marianyerlis. The family has gone as long as five days at a time without consuming anything besides water.
Marianyerlis follows Ms. MerchÃ¡n around for hours, wailing and sobbing, begging for food. Ms. MerchÃ¡n stares blankly at the floor as tears roll down the little girl's cheeks.
"Mama, I'm hungry!" she cries.
Her weight fluctuates between 20 and 29 pounds, depending on how much food she is able to get. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists 6-year-old girls who weigh less than 35 pounds in the lowest fifth percentile. Marianyerlis recently fainted after going two days without eating.
The family have made their home with relatives in an abandoned government housing project, with no running water or indoor plumbing, and jury-rigged electricity. It is uncomfortable, but all of their income must be spent on food.
Baby portraits of the children, one of their few cherished belongings, hang prominently on the wall. The only food in the entire house is half a bag of salt, and one lime.
"This is a nightmare," said Ms. MerchÃ¡n's sister, AndreÃ­na del Valle MerchÃ¡n, 25, describing how the children start to vomit, sweat and become sluggish after days of not eating. Her own 5-year-old daughter had lost 11 pounds this year and now weighed only 17 pounds, she said.
The suffering of Venezuelan families is expected to worsen next year. Beyond the I.M.F.'s warning that inflation could surpass 2,300 percent, observers worry that the leftist government will continue to refuse international aid for political reasons.
"If they accept the help, they accept that there is a humanitarian crisis here, and officially recognize that their population is vulnerable, and just how much their policies failed them," said Susana Raffalli, a specialist on food emergencies who consults for Caritas in Venezuela.
The Venezuelan government has used food to keep the Socialists in power, critics say. Before recent elections, people living in government housing projects said they were visited by representatives of their local Socialist community councils -- the government-aligned groups that organize the delivery of boxes of cheap food -- and threatened with being cut off if they did not vote for the government.
Kenyerber's relatives do not expect the economic crisis to improve anytime soon. They fear that another child in the family may die as well.
"I worry about it day and night," said his aunt, AndreÃ­na.
By the end of 2016, Venezuela's economy was in free fall. Shelves were empty of food and medicine. Chaos ensued. For years, New York Times journalists, including Meridith Kohut and Nicholas Casey, have documented the political, economic and human toll of the crisis.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- The eighth chapter in the "Star Wars" movie series, "The Last Jedi," made the jump to box office hyperspace over the weekend, selling $450 million in tickets worldwide and affirming Disney's strategy for rebooting the 40-year-old franchise for a new generation of fans. Benefiting from stellar reviews and wall-to-wall marketing, "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" collected an estimated $220 million in North America theaters -- some 4,232, some of which offered screenings around the clock. The domestic opening total was the second-highest on record, even after adjusting for inflation, falling just 11 percent short of the $248 million in initial ticket sales for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" in 2015.
"Star Wars" has long been in a league of its own, and "The Last Jedi," directed by the relative newcomer Rian Johnson, was always expected to arrive as a blockbuster. The question was how big of one.
"The Force Awakens" had benefited from unique circumstances. Pent-up demand was off the charts: It was the first "Star Wars" movie in 32 years with performances by fan favorites like Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia). "The Force Awakens," directed by J.J. Abrams, a star in his own right, was also the first "Star Wars" movie pushed through Walt Disney Company's vaunted marketing system. (Disney bought Lucasfilm, the "Star Wars" studio, in 2012.)
As a result, analysts expected "The Last Jedi" to generate roughly $200 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada, or about 20 percent less than its predecessor.
"We came in thinking that anything close to 200 was going to be an absolute win," Dave Hollis, Disney's president of theatrical distribution, said by phone on Sunday. "The result we got is a reflection on Rian Johnson, who delivered a satisfying fan experience. Word of mouth has been enormous."
"The Last Jedi," which cost roughly $350 million to make and market, arrived to better-than-expected turnout even as moviegoers avoided higher-priced 3-D screenings -- an ongoing trend in the movie business, especially for films that draw large family audiences. (The glasses don't fit little faces.) The 3-D format accounted for 30 percent of ticket sales for "The Last Jedi," according to Disney, down from 47 percent for "The Force Awakens."
Even so, theater owners were ecstatic.
"That word actually doesn't do it justice," said Greg Foster, chief executive of Imax Entertainment, which played "The Last Jedi" in both 3-D and 2-D. "This shows that new 'Star Wars' characters are connecting with a new generation of fans. It shows that, when there is a true event movie, people want to see it on the biggest screen possible."
Patrick Corcoran, vice president of the National Association of Theater Owners, echoed those thoughts and noted that "The Last Jedi" also benefited from improved technology in theatrical distribution, including digital presales. "It shows the flexibility of the modern digital multiplex, able to add new show times at the last minute to meet that demand," he said.
"The Last Jedi" brought back Ms. Fisher -- now playing General Leia in one of her final roles -- and Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) but largely focused on newer characters that include the rebel fighter Rey, played by Daisy Ridley; the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver); and the brash pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Men made up 58 percent of the opening-weekend audience, Disney said, on par with "The Force Awakens." The new film drew a larger number of children under the age of 12 and adults 17 to 25, with teenagers slightly down.
Disney blew away the competition. The No. 2 movie was the animated "Ferdinand" from 20th Century Fox -- soon to become a Disney division, at least if regulators approve Disney's acquisition of that studio. "Ferdinand," which cost about $111 million to produce, collected about $13.3 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data.
"Coco" (Disney) was third, taking in $10 million, for a four-week domestic total of $150.8 million.

Full text: Republican lawmakers released the details of their tax code rewrite on Friday, which reconciles differences between the House and Senate bills. Several of the most anticipated changes -- such as a significant increase in the standard deduction and the curtailing of state and local income tax breaks -- made the final cut. Some of the most controversial proposals, like eliminating the medical deduction, were wiped away.
Many of these provisions are temporary, however, and are set to expire after seven years. They all take effect in 2018, unless noted otherwise.
Tax Brackets
NOW Seven brackets, with a top rate of 39.6 percent, which people pay on income they earn beyond $470,700 for couples filing their taxes jointly or $418,400 as an individual.
>
NEW PLAN Seven brackets, with a top rate of 37 percent, which married people filing jointly will pay on income they earn in excess of $600,000. If you're single, the top rate applies to income earned beyond $500,000. Capital gains and qualified dividend rates are unchanged.
Exemptions, Credits, Standard Deductions
NOW If you're single, the standard deduction is $6,350. Add in exemptions, and you're up to $10,400. Married without children? That's $12,700 for the deduction and $20,700 with exemptions. If you're married with two children, the deduction-plus-exemptions figure goes up to $28,700. There is also a $1,000 tax credit per child.
>
NEW PLAN The standard deduction is temporarily increased to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for married couples filing joint returns.
The child tax credit is increased to $2,000 for each child -- and up to $1,400 of that can be delivered in the form of refundable credit, which means taxpayers can receive money back even if they have no tax liability. (Taxpayers may also reduce their tax bill by up to $500 for other dependents who are not children.)
But that all changes in 2025, when the deductions and exemptions revert to current law.
Mortgage Interest, and State and Local Tax Deductions
NOW You can generally deduct the amount you pay for state and local income taxes, including property taxes, on your federal income tax return. You can also deduct the interest you pay each year on mortgage debt up to $1 million, a cap that can cover multiple homes. Plus, you can generally deduct up to $100,000 in interest you pay on a home-equity loan or line of credit.
>
NEW PLAN Taxpayers may deduct only up to $10,000 total, which may include any combination of state and local income taxes and property taxes (or sales plus property taxes in states where there is no income tax). But don't bother trying to prepay your state and local income taxes for 2018 before year-end to circumvent the new limit. The proposal is one step ahead of you and your accountant and won't allow it.
For homeowners who pay their state income taxes quarterly, it is O.K. to pay the last and final installment due Jan. 16 on or before the last day of this year, if you want to claim the deduction this year.
Taxpayers can also prepay their 2018 property taxes -- as long as their local jurisdiction allows it.
You can also deduct the interest paid on mortgage debt up to $750,000; that includes your primary home and one other "qualified residence," which may include a mobile home or a boat. But if you bought a property before Dec. 15, you can still deduct interest up to $1 million (the limit under current law). Home equity loan interest is no longer deductible for anyone.
Medical Expenses
NOW You can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (but not the expenses that amount to the first 10 percent). This is particularly useful for the elderly and others with lower incomes who need regular assistance and care.
>
NEW PLAN In 2017 and 2018, you can deduct out-of-pocket medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. But come 2019, it will go back to the 10 percent threshold for all taxpayers.
Individual Mandate
NOW Under the Affordable Care Act, individuals must buy a qualifying health insurance plan or pay a penalty -- unless they qualify for an exemption.
NEW PLAN The penalty is reduced to zero, which, in practice, means that fewer healthy individuals may sign up for coverage -- and that is expected to lead to higher premiums for people who do not qualify for premium subsidies.
Alternative Minimum Tax
NOW The A.M.T. is an alternative way of calculating income taxes due, to make sure that people with lots of deductions don't pay too little. It often hits higher income families, especially in states where the state income tax is high.
>
NEW PLAN The A.M.T. will not go away, even though many Republicans had hoped to eliminate it. But through 2025, it will apply to fewer people and kick in at higher income levels.
Estate Taxes
NOW In general, estates pay 40 percent federal tax on inherited property, but rules waive that tax for estates up to $5,490,000.
>
NEW PLAN The baseline exemption amount doubles to $10 million and is indexed to inflation occurring after 2011. It applies to the estates of people who die after Dec. 31 but before Jan. 1, 2026 (and also to gifts made during that time frame).
Pass-Through Businesses
NOW People who own small businesses of various sorts generally pay income taxes based on the normal rate for individual taxes. Often, they are involved in or run partnerships, sole proprietorships, limited liability companies and S corporations.
>
NEW PLAN Starting next year and before Jan. 1, 2026, individuals can generally deduct 20 percent of their qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation and sole proprietorship. There are limits, however, including a phaseout for the deduction that begins at $157,500 of individual income and $315,000 of income for couples filing jointly.
529 Plans
NOW Your money grows free of any capital gains taxes and you can withdraw it tax-free to pay for higher education expenses.
>
NEW PLAN Nothing changes with higher education, but you will also be able to withdraw up to $10,000 each year, per child, to pay for private or religious school and receive the same tax benefits. Families participating in home schooling can also take out up to $10,000 a year to use for educational expenses. Also, families can roll 529 funds over to ABLE accounts, which offer tax advantages for people with disabilities.
Investment Fees and Unreimbursed Business Expenses
NOW You can deduct fees you pay to an investment adviser and similar expenses related to money management but only if they add up to at least 2 percent of your adjusted gross income. The same rule applies to work expenses your employer does not reimburse you for.
>
NEW PLAN These will no longer be allowable deductions, though that lasts only through 2025.
Roth I.R.A. Do-Overs
NOW Under current law, you can perform a kind of do-over if you've recently converted an individual retirement account into a Roth I.R.A. The way this works is that if you make the conversion and then the value of the account falls or some other circumstance changes before Oct. 15 of the following year, you can recharacterize the Roth so that it is a plain old I.R.A. again. This could allow people to avoid paying high tax bills on an amount of money that had then fallen in value after the conversion.
NEW PLAN No more do-overs. Once you convert to a Roth, it stays a Roth.
Losses for Fires and Floods
NOW If you're a victim of a house fire, flood, burglary or similar event, you can generally deduct losses -- as long as each loss is more than $100 and all losses collectively exceed 10 percent of your adjustable gross income.
>
NEW PLAN Starting next year, taxpayers can still deduct these losses using the same rules -- but only if the loss occurred during an event that the president officially declared to be a disaster.
Alimony
NOW Alimony is a deductible expense for people paying it, and those who receive it must pay income taxes.
>
NEW PLAN Divorce would become a bit more burdensome for the ex-spouse who pays alimony because it would no longer be a deductible expense. But the person receiving the payments would no longer need to pay tax on the income received. The change would take effect for divorce and separation agreements executed starting in 2019.
Ex-spouses who want to modify existing agreements -- created on or before Dec. 31, 2018 -- can continue to follow the current 2017 tax rules, as long as they specify that in the new agreement. These individuals are likely to stick with the old rules --generally speaking, it would only make sense to change to the new tax treatment if the ex-spouse paying the support is in a lower tax bracket than the recipient.
Moving Expenses
NOW Taxpayers can deduct moving expenses -- even if they do not itemize their tax returns -- as long as the new workplace is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old job location was from the old home. (If you had no workplace, the new job must be at least 50 miles from your old home.)
>
NEW PLAN Moving costs would generally no longer be a deductible expense starting in 2018, though it allows some exceptions for members of the military.
Tax Preparation
NOW You can usually deduct the amount your tax preparation specialist billed you or any similar tax-related expenses, like software you purchase and the fee to file your forms electronically.
>
NEW PLAN Taxpayers would no longer be able to take this deduction.
Riding a Bicycle to Work
NOW You can exclude up to $20 a month from your income for expenses related to regular bicycle commuting, as long as you are not receiving other pretax commuting benefits from your employer.
>
NEW PLAN Starting next year, these expenses are no longer deductible.
New Inflation Counter
NOW There are different ways to measure the change in the cost of living. Right now, the federal government largely relies on what's known as the Consumer Price Index, referred to as the C.P.I.
NEW PLAN The bill would change the measure to what's known as the chained C.P.I., which generally rises more slowly than what is used now. This would slow the speed at which tax brackets grow with inflation, so taxpayers would more quickly find themselves in higher marginal tax brackets.
Using a slower-growing measure also means certain tax breaks would also grow more slowly, like the earned-income tax credit, among others.
This change is permanent; the measure would continue to be used even after other tax changes, including the increased standard deduction, expire.
Gambling Losses
NOW You can deduct gambling losses but only up to the amount of any gambling income during any given year.
NEW PLAN The bill clarifies that people (including many professional gamblers) who also deduct wagering expenses, such as the cost of travel to and from a casino, must add those expenses to their total losses before comparing that sum to their total taxable winnings for the purpose of making the overall deduction calculation. This clarification does not apply to expenses that gamblers incur beyond 2025.
Taxability of Discharged Student Loan Debt
NOW In general, when you owe a debt and the entity to whom you owe it forgives that debt, the amount of the forgiven debt counts as taxable income. This is not currently the case for the people who will soon benefit when the federal government wipes away their debts under the public service loan forgiveness program (and also people in some other health-service and other loan programs). But the amount is taxable when student loan balances are forgiven in the event of a death or disability.
NEW PLAN Discharged debt in the event of death or total and permanent disability will no longer be taxable. The provision expires after 2025.
Kiddie Tax
NOW This year, if a child collects unearned income above $2,100, that money is generally taxed at the parents' tax rates instead of the child's, if the parents' rate is higher. (Children are generally defined as someone under the age of 19, or a full-time student under 24.)
NEW PLAN Under the new rules, the child's net unearned income would be taxed using the brackets that trusts and estates follow; that system has a top bracket of 37 percent, which applies to income that exceeds $12,500.
Tax experts said this won't change much for higher income families since they were already paying similar rates. But middle class families could feel more of a pinch if their children have portfolios generating significant income -- from, say, an inherited individual retirement account. For children with smaller amounts of unearned income, they may come out slightly ahead.
The rules revert back to today's law in 2025.
Taxation on children's earned income is unchanged and is taxed at single taxpayers' rates.
________
WHAT DID NOT CHANGE
STUDENT LOAN INTEREST The House had proposed to repeal the deduction for student loan interest, but the final bill has no repeal.
ADOPTION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS The House had proposed to repeal the deduction for financial assistance that an employer may provide when an employee adopts a child, but the final bill has no repeal.
DEPENDENT CARE ACCOUNTS At one point, the House had proposed to eliminate workplace dependent care savings accounts that allow employees to put away $5,000 free of income taxes each year. It later altered the provision to have the accounts disappear in 2023. The Senate never proposed any change, and there is no change in the final bill.
TUITION WAIVERS Employees of educational institutions who receive reduced tuition -- or a waiver -- for themselves, spouses or dependents are generally not taxed on that income. This is particularly helpful for certain graduate students; their tuition is waived as part of arrangements in which they teach or perform research at their university. The House had proposed to tax the benefit, but the final bill does not have this provision.
EMPLOYER-PAID TUITION When employers pay your tuition for continuing education, the amount they pay is not taxable income for you as long as it meets certain conditions and amounts to no more than $5,250 a year. The House had proposed that the benefit be taxable, but the final bill does not have this provision.
CAPITAL GAINS WHEN SELLING A HOME With some exceptions, a married couple filing their taxes jointly can exclude up to $500,000 in capital gains on the sale of a home, as long as they have used it as a primary residence for at least two of the last five years. A single individual can exclude up to $250,000. The House and Senate both proposed to make this rule more strict, but neither provision prevailed, and the rule will remain the same.
>
TEACHER DEDUCTION Teachers can take a $250 deduction for money they spend on certain job-related and classroom expenses. The House wanted to eliminate the tax break, while the Senate wanted to double it temporarily. Neither proposal made the final bill, and the rule will remain the same.
401(K) TAX BREAK Before the House and Senate introduced their bills, there were rumors they might try to restrict the amount of pretax money that people could put into their workplace savings accounts. They did not try to do this, though, and the rules for these accounts remain the same.
ELECTRIC CARS Buyers of qualifying plug-in electric vehicles, like the Chevrolet Bolt or Volt and Tesla's cars, can sometimes get a tax credit for up to $7,500. The House had proposed eliminating the tax break, but the provision didn't make the final bill. So the tax break remains.
ARCHER MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS These accounts came into existence before health savings accounts but work in similar ways. The House bill had proposed to take away the tax break for contributions to the accounts, but that did not make it to the final bill
SELLING STOCK AND MUTUAL FUNDS Under current law, people who have shares of stock or funds in a taxable investment account can choose which shares to sell if they are selling part of their investment. This allows people who bought shares at different times to sell only the ones that will help them pay the least amount in taxes on any gains. The Senate proposed to restrict such moves, but its provision did not make it to the final bill.

Full text: President Trump has called the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Republican lawmakers are on the verge of passing a Christmas present for the entire nation. But the fine print reveals that some will get a much nicer gift than others, the benefits will change over time, and some will be left out in the cold. Real estate developers and technology companies could see big tax cuts, while low-income households and people buying health insurance could lose out.
With the bill finally headed to a vote this coming week, taxpayers are scrambling to determine whether the legislation renders them winners or losers.
WINNERS
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY Numerous industries will benefit from the Republican tax overhaul, but perhaps none as dramatically as the industry where Mr. Trump earned his riches: commercial real estate. Mr. Trump, along with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is part owner of his own real estate firm, will benefit from lower taxes on so-called "pass through" income, which is money earned by partnerships and other types of businesses whose income is passed through to its owner and taxed at the individual tax rate. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner benefit since they own properties through limited liability companies and other similar vehicles.
Under current law, that income is taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Under the bill, much of that income could be taxed at a rate as low as 29.6 percent, subject to some limitations. Real estate also avoided new limits on interest deductions and retained its ability to defer taxes on the exchange of similar kinds of properties. The benefits of lower rates on pass-through income will extend to Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner's partners at real estate investment trusts as well. At the last minute, lawmakers added language to make it easier for real estate owners to avoid some of the pass-through provision's restrictions and maximize the tax benefits even more.
BIG CORPORATIONS Industries like big retailers will benefit from the new corporate rate of 21 percent, since those companies pay relatively close to the full 35 percent rate. Other aspects of the corporate tax cuts will be enjoyed by an array of multinational industries, particularly technology and pharmaceutical companies, like Google, Facebook, Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Such multinational companies have accumulated nearly $3 trillion offshore, mostly in tax haven subsidiaries, untouched by the United States taxman. The tax bill will force those companies to gradually bring that money home, but it will be taxed at rates ranging from 8 percent to 15.5 percent. That's far lower than the current 35 percent tax rate on corporate profits and even lower than the new 21 percent rate.
Plus, American companies will no longer owe full corporate taxes on future profits they say they earn abroad, providing more incentive to push income into tax haven subsidiaries. The law even includes provisions that could encourage companies to move workers abroad, despite pledges to do the opposite.
MULTIMILLIONAIRES An exemption for estates that owe what Republicans call the "death tax" was lifted to $22 million from $11 million. That doesn't matter much to billionaires like Charles Koch, but means a big tax cut for people with estates worth tens of millions of dollars.
Plus, the top rate applying to wages and interest income would be cut to 37 percent from 39.6 percent.
PRIVATE EQUITY MANAGERS During the campaign, Donald Trump railed against wealthy investment managers who, thanks to the so-called carried interest loophole, pay taxes on the majority of their pay at a lower capital gains rates. But the purported reform to this tax provision will affect few if any private equity managers, leaving the loophole intact.
PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THE PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD THEM Parents would be eligible to use a type of tax-preferred savings plan -- known as a 529 plan -- to save for their children's elementary and secondary education. Right now, those savings plans are only eligible for college. But they would be expanded to allow for up to $10,000 a year for tuition at private and religious schools.
THE LIQUOR BUSINESS Excise taxes for small brewers and distillers are reduced in the final agreement. Those industries are dominated by entrepreneurial small businesses often based in rural areas. They also have strong lobbyists, and many are based in states with powerful senators, like Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. Mr. Portman, who tucked a provision to help craft brewers into the Senate legislation, was part of the small team of lawmakers who merged the two bills into a final version.
ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS They were originally restricted in how much they could benefit from the new pass-through provision. If they structure their businesses a certain way, the final version will let them benefit fully.
TAX ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS Mr. Trump once said his "dream" was to put tax preparation services out of business by simplifying the tax code. But the rushed legislation will probably have the opposite effect, as individuals try and make sense of the complicated new provisions, staggered dates and new rates. The uncertainty and confusion will probably create numerous new opportunities to game the system: tax preparers are sure to see a boom in business advising clients on how to restructure their employment and compensation arrangements to take advantage of the lower tax rates on income reported by corporations and pass-through entities.
LOSERS
PEOPLE BUYING HEALTH INSURANCE With the repeal of the individual mandate, some people who currently buy health insurance because they are required by law to do so are expected to go without coverage. According to the Congressional Budget Office, healthier people are more likely to drop their insurance, leaving insurers stuck with more people who are older and ailing. This is expected to make average insurance premiums on the individual market go up by about 10 percent. All told, 13 million fewer Americans are projected to have health coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS IN THE FUTURE To stay under the $1.5 trillion limit for new deficits lawmakers set for themselves, they opted to make the cuts for individuals and families temporary, expiring at the end of 2025 -- even as the corporate tax cuts will be permanent. Republicans are counting on a future Congress to extend the lower rates, as has happened in the past. But there are no guarantees, and that could mean a big tax increase down the road. What is more, the use of a different, less generous measure of inflation would push taxpayers into higher tax brackets more quickly.
THE ELDERLY A 2010 law requires that any legislation that adds to the federal deficit be paid for by spending cuts, increases in revenue or other offsets. Some cuts would be automatic, and the biggest program to be affected is Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Dozens of other programs are likely to be cut as well, but Medicare, which would face a 4 percent cut, is by far the biggest. Republicans say that this rule will be waived and the cuts will be averted, but that will take a bipartisan deal.
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES Low-income families who claim the earned-income tax credit will lose out on at least $19 billion over the coming decade under the bill because of the change in the way inflation is calculated. And a new requirement that families claiming the child tax credit provide a Social Security number is projected to mean a big reduction in the families claiming it, since those who are not in the United States legally would be prohibited, even if their children were born in the United States.
OWNERS OF HIGH-END HOMES Under current law, the interest on mortgages for first and second homes is deductible for the first $1 million of the loan. The overhaul would cut that to the first $750,000 and eliminate the owner's ability in the current law to deduct the interest on a home-equity loan up to $100,000. This could drive down home prices in some high-end markets; good for prospective buyers but bad for prospective sellers.
PEOPLE IN HIGH PROPERTY TAX, HIGH INCOME STATES Homeowners in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California could be big losers, particularly if they have high property taxes. Their ability to deduct their local property taxes and state and local income taxes from their federal tax bills is now capped at $10,000. In some cases, that could be offset by the lower tax rates that all taxpayers will owe on their ordinary income.
PUERTO RICO Puerto Rico had sought an exemption from new taxes, citing the frail state of its economy nearly three months after Hurricane Maria. But no such luck. The tax bill treats affiliates of American companies on the island as if Puerto Rico were a foreign country and imposes a 12.5 percent tax on intellectual property. Puerto Rico's governor, Ricardo A. RossellÃ³, said the tax would hurt the biomedical and technology affiliates that make up about a third of Puerto Rico's tax base.
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE The tax collection agency has been underfunded and understaffed for years. Now, it will have a raft of new tax rules to deal with that will require upgrading its software, printing new manuals and explaining to confused taxpayers how things work. All this is expected to take place while the commission is working under the supervision of an interim commissioner, who is expected to be replaced sometime next year.

Full text: As we navigated our way out of the airport and onto a shuttle bus, we were surrounded by Brazilians and Argentines -- not an American or European accent to be heard. This, for a North American, is part of the appeal of South American skiing: The experience is that of a world slightly tilted. There's no English babble, and July and August are the best months for snow. I was here in the late North American summer with my partner, Alan, and an Argentine friend, AdriÃ¡n, to explore the mountain sports resort of Chapelco, tucked into the Andes near the Chilean border in Patagonia. AdriÃ¡n, a snowboard fanatic who lives in Canada but comes to Chapelco regularly, usually for a week or more at a time, touts its virtues over other Argentina resorts. "It's the largest skiable area that comes with a local town experience. Catedral is massive, Las LeÃ±as is not as well organized. The rest are way smaller. For me, Chapelco is the closest it gets to the Forest Service ski areas in the U.S."
For now, Chapelco is one of Argentina's less-visited ski resorts, but that may be changing. In August 2017, the resort saw a record number of people -- 7,012 in a single day -- and the resort is constructing its own lodging, with ski-in, ski-out service. Tourism is on an upswing, but the slopes aren't overcrowded and Federico Lopez Jallaguier, the resort's marketing manager, told me that "Chapelco is the ski and snowboard center that has received the most investment in the last 10 years. It's the most renovated of the Argentine centers in terms of chairlifts, snow-grooming and snow-making."
The resort is up-to-date and modern, but the closest town, San MartÃ­n de los Andes, is appealingly wholesome and old-fashioned. The lakeside settlement has a distinctly European feel, with wooden cabins aiming their sharply angled roofs at the sky and a main street lined with chocolate shops and small cafes. But here glÃ¼hwein is replaced by Malbec, and fondue supplanted by rounds of provolone roasted over a wood fire. Families flock here, not just from Argentina and Brazil, but from Chile, too (the man who outfitted us with boots and skis at the rental shop told me they almost never see North Americans), because the homey atmosphere is more child-friendly and welcoming than the party-all-night atmosphere and singles scene in Bariloche, a much larger ski town a few hours south. And although you can usually spot an Argentine soap star or two on the slopes, it's much more common for an adult taking two children up the mountain to hand one off to you for the duration of the ride on the two-person lift.
We'd arrived too late in the day to go to the mountain, but we checked into our aparthotel. These are plentiful in San MartÃ­n, and make sense for groups -- with small living rooms and kitchens, they are much more spacious than a traditional hotel. Ours was a cozy two-bedroom wooden cabin that included a carb-and-sugar-heavy breakfast of rolls, jam and medialunas, the traditional Argentine croissant. After unpacking, we headed to Piscis, a barbecue mecca that flaunted several lambs roasting in the window, each stretched out on two crossed bars and angled over a wood fire. A menu of trout and deer played up Patagonia's traditional ingredients; we added a couple of bottles of Patagonian wine, and at 11 p.m., a man came in and played tango music on an accordion -- aimed at tourists, sure, because tango is an urban pastime, not a Patagonian one, but something that the Brazilians in the restaurant vocally appreciated.
The next morning we piled into the car for the short journey to Chapelco. The resort is 11 miles from the town, a leisurely uphill drive that follows the curve of majestic, mountain-backed Lake LÃ¡car, and ends in three miles of unpaved road. The sky was bright blue and, once we hopped off the chairlift, provided a brilliant background for the snow strewn across the Andes like tiger stripes. It remained spectacularly sunny for most of our trip. One afternoon I looked down from the lift to see a man in full gear, skis on but planted firmly in the snow, lying on his back with his hands behind his head taking a mid-run sunbath.
The slopes at Chapelco run the gamut -- plenty of practice areas, some challenging midrange runs, and black diamonds that please adrenaline junkies, topping out at 6,500 feet above sea level and spread over 4,000 acres. The boundaries of the off-piste areas aren't strongly enforced, and there are tracks everywhere left by boarders slicing through the ungroomed snow as if it were water. The forests are the most skiable of the Argentine resorts, the trees neatly corralled, with the occasional snowboarder swerving around and through. I skied the groomed beginner slopes a few times to warm up, then headed toward the red (Argentina uses the European system of classification; in the United States these would be blue) trails, pausing to snap photos of the lake down below and the LanÃ­n Volcano in the distance -- a view that made it hard, when facing a tricky run, to look where I was going rather than at the scenery. At one point, I almost skied into a tree. Red-faced and windblown and ready for a slower pace, I turned down the camino, a 3.3-mile service road that takes a long, leisurely path through the trees to the base of the mountain, crisscrossing marked runs as it winds its way down. It can fill up with beginners but it's a fabulous slow ride that allows you to soak up the views and leaves you with all your bones and equipment intact.
Around 5 p.m. we got into the car and drove three-and-a-half hours to eat a steak. You might think this is too long but you'd be wrong and there's not an Argentine in existence who would tell you so. Our aim was El Boliche de Alberto, a parrillada where the wood-fired steaks are deservedly famous -- I'd had one two years before and had pestered Alan and AdriÃ¡n to make the trek for another. The restaurant is in Bariloche, and the road south from San MartÃ­n skirts a series of seven lakes that are some of the most stunning scenery in Patagonia. The sun was setting as we drove, but the lakes -- ringed by pines and native coihue trees and surrounded by mountains -- were jaw-droppingly beautiful even in the fading light.
At our destination, crowded with people and warmed by the enormous fire, we picked up hefty, wooden-handled knives and dug into an ojo de bife (rib eye) capped with crispy fat and cooked to precisely the rare degree we wanted. Eating dinner in Argentina is an unhurried process, and we weren't back on the road until 1 a.m. There wasn't another car on the road, which was lightly coated in fresh snow. We rounded the dark curves with the high beams on; I sat in the back seat under the coats discarded by the others -- the heat in our cheap rented Chevrolet Corsa didn't reach past the front seat. There was no cell reception in between these ski towns and the lakes were hidden by fog; it was just the three of us and the snow and the occasional fox darting in front of the headlights.
The result of our midnight excursion was evident when we pulled into the resort the next morning. We noticed a deflated tire, pushed out of shape by a rim that had been damaged by a pothole. After the day's skiing, we would drive it carefully back into town and to a small garage, where a man in his 70s would bang the rim back into shape with a hammer and charge us 80 pesos, the best bargain of the trip. Inflation in Argentina, a constant problem, meant that a dollar was worth around 17 pesos when we were there. Argentina's not cheap, but the exchange rate helped keep costs down. And for overseas visitors, Argentina's new rule -- tourists don't pay the 21 percent I.V.A. tax (V.A.T) on hotel rooms if they use a credit card issued abroad -- is an added inducement.
Skilled skiers and riders can burn their way down the runs that shoot down from Cerro Escalonado, the highest point in the resort, far above the tree line. The views beyond are all rocky crags, deep bowls and untouched snow -- areas that the resort may eventually develop, but which for now remain pristine. From here, the following day, we swooshed down a steep, treeless slalom crowded with snowboarders to the travesÃ­a baja. This .6-mile blue run streaks east along a steep drop-off that's without the protection of trees, but this means sweeping mountain views. It finishes with a sharp dip that ends at the Pradera del Puma, a parador (a small restaurant). We added our skis and board to the collection and tramped in, collecting ceramic bowls of rustic roasted potatoes and lentil stew heavily fortified with meat, then pulled up chairs at the tables outside. The sun shone, James Brown played on the loudspeaker and we shared a couple of Coronas, just for the hell of it.
The final run of the trip was back down the gentle camino, which we dragged out as long as possible before joining the crowd filling the outdoor tables and chairs at the base for a quick pint of Patagonia I.P.A. from a mobile truck. The aprÃ¨s ski here isn't the raucous, hourslong scene of European resorts -- the resort closes at 5 p.m. and at 6 clears out almost instantaneously, with everyone headed back to town for a shower and rest before dinner.
"We followed suit, sauntering over to Cala, a cheery, wooden-roofed pizza joint thronged with groups of snow-loving PorteÃ±os (what people from Buenos Aires are called) and locals, sinking pints of beer and stuffing themselves with the fabulous empanadas. In Argentina, the tradition of indicating an empanada's filling by thumbing the dough closed in a particular pattern lives on: We ordered spinach and cheese and minced beef, followed by a hearty pie of pepperoni and fresh tomatoes that we couldn't finish. If you've spent time in Buenos Aires, where locals have the anxiety levels of New Yorkers and about as much chill, you'd be as surprised as I was to see these PorteÃ±os laughing, drinking and utterly relaxed. It might have been the mountain air, the energy burned off on the slopes, the natural beauty of the area or the beer, but the town and the mountain had worked their magic.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Robert A. Iger is nothing if not consistent. As chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, Mr. Iger, 66, awakens at 4:30 every morning, and every time he announces plans to retire from the Magic Kingdom, he ends up extending his reign, as he did on Thursday for a fourth time.
But the most important consistency that Mr. Iger has exhibited since taking over Disney in 2005 may involve becoming the corporate equivalent of a guardian selected by protective fathers. "He is tremendously good at it," said Mario Gabelli, the longtime media investor.
He formed a deep relationship with Steven P. Jobs, persuading the Apple impresario to part with Pixar Animation Studios, even after Mr. Jobs clashed with Mr. Iger's predecessor, Michael D. Eisner. Disney bought Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, and Mr. Iger now sits on the Apple board. Next up was Isaac Perlmutter, who entrusted Mr. Iger with his baby, Marvel Entertainment. Everyone wanted Lucasfilm. But it was Mr. Iger who persuaded George Lucas to sell his "Star Wars" studio to Disney for $4 billion in 2012.
Mr. Iger's crowning achievement -- should he be able to win regulatory approval and pull off an integration -- came on Thursday when Rupert Murdoch entrusted much of his life work not to his own sons but to Mr. Iger. Disney paid $52.4 billion for the bulk of Mr. Murdoch's 21st Century Fox in a deal with ripple effects from Hollywood and Silicon Valley to audiences worldwide.
"Bob has consistently been the most strategic and curious in the industry," said Peter Chernin, Mr. Murdoch's former top lieutenant and chief executive of the Chernin Company, which has built a vast portfolio of digital businesses. "He's the guy least interested in maintaining the status quo and the one genuinely trying to wrestle with where the world is going."
Mr. Iger, who started his career in the 1970s as a weatherman, has stumbled at times while running Disney. Several of his smaller acquisitions, among them the video-focused Maker Studios and Playdom, an online game company, have been misfires. Efforts to plan out his succession have resulted in the departures of two talented senior executives.
Disney has also recently contended with subscriber losses at ESPN and ratings turbulence at ABC. John Lasseter, the Pixar co-founder who became Disney's top animation executive, said last month that he would step aside for a six-month "sabbatical" because of behavioral "missteps."
But Disney has mostly soared under Mr. Iger's leadership, noted Mr. Gabelli, whose Gamco holds roughly $350 million in Fox shares. Since Mr. Iger took over Disney, annual profit has more than tripled, totaling $8.98 billion in the fiscal year that ended in September.
"To get Disney, Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm to even operate on the same planet is a herculean task," said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management. "As media barons go, I would put Bob in a category of one."
Now, however, just as Mr. Iger approaches what appears to be the end of his career -- his new retirement date is in late 2021 -- he has made an eye-popping bet that will, for better or worse, make everything he has already accomplished seem like a footnote. The 21st Century Fox acquisition is Disney's largest, surpassing its 1995 purchase of Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion, or roughly $31 billion after adjusting for inflation.
Mr. Iger intends to use the Fox businesses, which include the 20th Century Fox studio and a chain of 22 regional sports networks, to supercharge a plan to reposition Disney.
To a large degree, ESPN, bought as part of the Capital Cities deal, has powered Disney for two decades. But traditional television, built on third-party cable and satellite subscriptions, is now in decline as people watch more content online. Mr. Iger sees Netflix-style subscription streaming services as a new growth engine and has announced plans to rely on three of them, with each benefiting from the Fox assets. (Two of the services will be new, and one will be Hulu, which Disney would now control.)
Success is far from guaranteed.
Netflix and Amazon have a huge head start. Disney will have to learn new businesses on the fly. It will be difficult for Disney to integrate 21st Century Fox for reasons of size and culture: Fox is much rowdier. James L. Brooks, a creator of "The Simpsons," which will move to Disney in the merger, on Thursday posted an image on Twitter "with respect." It showed an angry Homer Simpson strangling Mickey Mouse.
While most investors and analysts cheered the merger, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, wrote in a research note that Disney's bid to compete with Netflix was "a lost cause" given that tech companies "have deep pockets and no mandate to turn an economic profit in the near term." Other analysts praised Mr. Murdoch for exiting Hollywood while criticizing Disney for buying traditional television assets -- cable channels like FX and satellite television providers like Sky.
Also, the deal needs approval by antitrust regulators. While President Trump seemed to give it his endorsement on Thursday, pushback has already begun.
"I'm concerned about the impact of this transaction on American consumers," Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement on Friday. Ms. Klobuchar, the Senate antitrust subcommittee's ranking member, asked for a hearing to ensure "appropriate oversight."
Mr. Iger, who declined to comment for this article, expressed confidence on Thursday about winning the approval of regulators.
"If they look at it from a consumer point of view," he said, "they should quickly conclude that the aim of this combination is to create more high-quality product for consumers around the world and to deliver it in more innovative, more compelling ways."
As Hollywood began to get its head around the acquisition, it was seen as either the sad ending of an era or the exciting beginning of one.
The film business has not seen significant consolidation in generations -- perhaps not since 1935, when 20th Century Pictures and Fox Film merged to form 20th Century Fox, going on to deliver classics like "How Green Was My Valley," "The Sound of Music" and "Wall Street." Now that Disney is a content colossus, analysts expect a wave of Hollywood mergers, as companies like Viacom, CBS, Sony, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer look to gain scale.
Some in Hollywood, including many film executives at Fox, which faces downsizing under Disney control, saw the merger as the waning of the traditional entertainment business: Disney wanted Fox's assets to accelerate its push to deliver television show and movies over the internet and fight Apple, Amazon and Netflix in the streaming video wars.
Filmmakers, writers and producers began to moan that all of their creative impulses would now be subject to algorithm approval.
But others had the opposite perspective: By supersizing Disney -- the only major pieces of 21st Century Fox not included in the deal were Fox News, the FS1 sports channel and the Fox broadcast network -- Mr. Iger had engineered Hollywood's best chance for survival. After all, rather than being swallowed by a Silicon Valley giant, Fox's creative businesses will be managed by an entertainment veteran.
"With this deal, Bob is really saying, 'You can all make bets on platforms and algorithms,"' Mr. Chernin said. "'I am going to make my bet on content and control how that content reaches consumers."'

Full text: MOSCOW -- Aleksei V. Ulyukayev, a former economy minister in Russia who had clashed with a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was convicted on Friday of soliciting a $2 million bribe, in a case that pulled back the curtain on Kremlin infighting. Mr. Ulyukayev and his supporters insisted the evidence against him was concocted to eliminate a critic of growing state dominance in the oil industry. But the judge, Larisa Semenova, rejected the arguments that the former minister had been framed and sided with prosectors, who called it an open-and-shut case of corruption.
Judge Semenova sentenced Mr. Ulyukayev, who had been locked in a struggle with Igor I. Sechin, the director of the state oil company Rosneft, over how to revive the swooning Russian economy, to eight years in a penal colony and a fine of 130 million rubles, or $2.2 million.
The punishment was less than the 10-year sentence and 500 million-ruble fine sought by prosecutors. Mr. Ulyukayev's lawyers said they would appeal.
Russia's smoothly executed military operations in Ukraine and Syria, and allegations of election meddling in the United States, have lent Mr. Putin an air of mystery and monolithic power, but the case against Mr. Ulyukayev shed light on the jockeying for position among members of the president's inner circle.
Mr. Ulyukayev had been a prominent member of a liberal wing in the Russian government, and he was accused of seeking a huge bribe from Mr. Sechin in exchange for acquiescing to a major oil deal he had initially opposed.
Mr. Sechin, a former military intelligence officer and longtime associate of Mr. Putin, has argued for Russia to return to a state-dominated economy, particularly in the oil industry. Mr. Ulyukayev, a protÃ©gÃ© of Yegor Gaidar, the architect of post-Soviet privatizations, is an advocate of free-market economics.
Mr. Sechin accused Mr. Ulyukayev of seeking the bribe in exchange for dropping objections to the state oil company's acquisition of a recently nationalized midsize oil producer, Bashneft.
The sale was billed as a privatization, but Mr. Ulyukayev contended that privatization was impossible if the buyer was a state company.
Mr. Sechin said the former minister had solicited the bribe in October 2016, but only with a gesture: During a game of pool, he said, Mr. Ulyukayev held up two fingers, signaling that his price was $2 million.
A few weeks after the pool game, at the oil company headquarters, secret listening devices and a concealed video camera recorded Mr. Sechin offering Mr. Ulyukayev a gift basket that contained artisanal sausages made from wild game and a hefty brown bag. Mr. Ulyukayev said he believed the bag held bottles of wine; in fact, it contained $2 million in blocks of $100 bills, weighing about 45 pounds.
Although the court ruled in his favor, Mr. Sechin did not emerge unscathed. Over Mr. Sechin's objections, the hearings were held in open session, which exposed details of the sting operation and the dealings of the Kremlin elite, like the common practice of giving lavish gifts.
At his annual year-end news conference on Thursday, Mr. Putin chastised Mr. Sechin for ignoring a summons to testify at court. "Sechin should have come to court," Putin said. "What is the problem anyway?"
Mr. Putin did offer a mild defense of Mr. Sechin, saying that no law had been broken when he refused to testify, despite critics who argued otherwise.
Igor M. Bunin, the president of the Center for Political Technologies, said in a telephone interview that Mr. Ulyukayev's undoing was that he had fallen from favor with Mr. Putin, in part for delivering bad economic news.
"It's one thing to support the liberal course, another to fail to create a good personal relationship with Putin," Mr. Bunin said. Earlier in his career, for example, Mr. Ulyukayev, then deputy governor of the central bank, had been passed over for a promotion to bank governor after pushing back against Kremlin pressure to spur economic growth by lowering interest rates, saying such a move risked sparking inflation.
In his closing statement earlier this month, Mr. Ulyukayev protested his innocence and said the court proceedings had evoked the era of show trials in Russia under Joseph Stalin. "The evidence shows that I've been targeted in a monstrous provocation," he said.
Speaking of Mr. Sechin's refusal to testify, Mr. Ulyukayev said the oil executive had vanished and "only the smell of sulfur in the air was left," a reference to the "The Master and Margarita," the riotous Russian novel by Mikhail Bulgakov about the devil appearing in Stalin's Moscow.
Anybody could fall victim to a fabricated criminal case, Mr. Ulyukayev said. "Now this is very easy: A bag, a basket, a poorly filmed video, three clicks and it is ready," he said.

Europe Takes Cautious Approach to Rates

Full text: FRANKFURT -- A lot is happening in the world of central banks. In Washington, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates again to brake the sizzling United States economy. And the Bank of England is also in rate-raising mode.
Not so the European Central Bank, which left monetary policy unchanged on Thursday. No one expected Mario Draghi, the bank's president, to drop any bombshells when he faced reporters after the bank's final meeting of 2017. But there were lots of questions about what will be coming in the New Year.
It could be a watershed. The central bank's own economists substantially raised their estimates for eurozone growth, portending an end to the crisis measures that have been in place in the 19-nation common currency area since 2008. That would usher in a new era, with monetary policy returning to normal and the central bank beginning to gently push up interest rates.
Mr. Draghi's news conference on Thursday revolved around how soon the stimulus measures might end. While he said there has been "a significant improvement in the growth outlook," he steadfastly avoided any statements that would change investor expectations. Still, Mr. Draghi offered a few clues about the central bank's evolving views.
Here are some of the key takeaways.
How much stimulus, and for how long?
The European Central Bank's Governing Council set a course for 2018 when it announced plans in October to scale back the purchases of government and corporate bonds that it had been using to hold down interest rates and stimulate inflation. The bank said it would keep buying bonds at a reduced rate at least through next September, and left open the door for continued purchases after that.
The Governing Council did not change its stance on Thursday, repeating that it can step up the stimulus measures at any time if the eurozone economy starts to flag. That's a sign that interest rate increases are still far in the future.
But some members of the Governing Council have been suggesting that the bank should move more quickly. BenoÃ®t CoeurÃ©, a member of the bank's executive board, said last month that he hoped the need for central bank bond buying would have run its course by September.
Mr. Draghi declined to make any similar statements Thursday. "There isn't any change in the language or intentions," he said.
Will the economy stay on track?
The eurozone economy is humming. In new estimates published Thursday, the European Central Bank's economists said economic growth would accelerate to 2.3 percent in 2018. That compares to their estimate in September of 1.8 percent.
At the same time, the central bank economists predict that inflation -- the figure that influences central bank policy the most -- will remain well below the official target of 2 percent through 2020. That is yet another sign the bank is in no hurry to begin raising interest rates.
Mr. Draghi betrayed some concern Thursday about what will happen when the central bank is no longer flooding the eurozone with cash. He acknowledged that very low interest rates can lead to asset bubbles.
"The ground is fertile for these risks," he said. But he added that evidence of overexuberant prices for real estate or other assets seem to be limited to a few local areas which are not a threat to the eurozone as a whole. "We are not seeing systemically important financial stability risks," he said.
Out of sync?
The European Central Bank exercises strong influence over interest rates in the eurozone but it is also at the mercy of financial markets, which react to a host of forces -- not the least of which is what the Fed is doing.
Now that the Fed is busy raising rates, there is a risk that the rising cost of credit could spill over to the eurozone, slowing the economy before the European Central Bank is ready. The Bank of England raised its benchmark rate in November for the first time in a decade. The British central bank left rates unchanged at its meeting Thursday, but with British inflation on the rise more increases could be on the way next year.
In effect, the European Central Bank is moving at a speed different from that of its two most important counterparts, even though their economies are closely intertwined. Currency exchange rates, for example, react strongly to central bank policy and have far-reaching economic consequences, determining how much people must pay for imported goods and also how cheaply companies can sell their products abroad.
In fact, the euro spiked briefly as Mr. Draghi spoke Thursday but then retreated.
Mr. Draghi said, in essence, that each central bank has to do its own thing depending on where its economy is. He said he hasn't detected any sign that the Fed's rate increases are hurting Europe. "We haven't seen any effect."

The Pentagon Is Not a Sacred Cow

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]14 Dec 2017: A.30.

Full text: Health care, Social Security, Medicare and other social programs are all on the chopping block as the Republican-led Congress scrambles to make up for the revenue lost to its planned tax cuts. The Pentagon, however, remains a sacred cow, destined to receive yet more money. The military budget is now $643 billion. The actual and potential threats from Russia, China, North Korea and Islamic extremists are all serious, but giving the Pentagon another huge increase defies common sense. The Pentagon already wastes about one in five of the taxpayer dollars it receives, according to a Pentagon-commissioned study. And the United States, which has plenty of other urgent needs, already spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined.
The opening bid for the 2018 defense budget came from President Trump, who in May proposed $677 billion. That was $54 billion above a budget cap set by Congress in 2011, after the 2008 financial crisis led to demands for fiscal restraint. Then last month, Congress upped his ante by passing a 2018 military authorization bill that would increase spending to around $700 billion, some $85 billion above the legal cap. Mr. Trump signed that bill into law on Tuesday.
For the moment, that increase is a fiction. Before it can occur, Congress must remove the 2011 caps and appropriate the money. That is the focus of the present budget battle on Capitol Hill. Republican leaders reportedly want to increase military spending by at least Mr. Trump's original figure of $54 billion and nonmilitary spending by $37 billion. Democratic leaders are insisting on equal increases for both categories.
What's not clear is that the Pentagon needs any increase until it can get a handle on waste, which a 2015 study estimated at $125 billion, about one-fifth of its budget.
The Pentagon had a virtual blank check after the Sept. 11 attacks, as it went after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan and then turned its attention to overthrowing Saddam Hussein in Iraq. Military spending in 2017 is already as high as during the armed forces buildup of the 1980s. The proposed increase, coming after the United States has withdrawn thousands of troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, would take it even higher. Mr. Trump, bedazzled by men in uniform and enthralled by displays of weaponry, says more money is needed to build bigger and better forces. And senior commanders have lobbied hard for a big increase to upgrade a military they say lacks readiness, meaning the training and equipment needed to fight.
It's certainly true that the military, cut back after the Cold War, was strained during the 16 years of near constant war after Sept. 11. Yet the ground troops who are doing the actual fighting say there is no crisis, according to the analyst Mark Thompson of the Center for Defense Information at the Project on Government Oversight. Other experts say claims of a deteriorating military are exaggerated.
Some increases are understandable, even inevitable. For instance, from 2001 to 2012, the average cost per active service member grew by 61 percent, when adjusted for inflation, because of new and expanded benefits, increasing health care costs and pay raises. Those costs prompted the Pentagon to reduce personnel, says Todd Harrison, an expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
But other increases arise from a dysfunctional congressional budget process complicated by lobbyists who woo lawmakers to back unneeded or extravagant weapons. That's how lawmakers wind up investing in programs that don't deliver, like the overbudget F-35 jet fighter, and modernizing the nuclear arsenal at an estimated cost of $1 trillion over the next 30 years, when smarter choices would cost less and still keep the country safe.
One encouraging sign is that the Pentagon's acquisition chief, Ellen Lord, is talking to Congress about moving away from high-tech toys that may no longer be relevant or affordable. Another is that the Pentagon has decided to launch its first (believe it or not) audit.
Like other federal agencies, the Pentagon can't have it all. The military is critical to national security. That does not give it license to be a poor steward of resources and gobble up tax dollars at the expense of other programs.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, buoyed by a steadily strengthening economy, raised interest rates on Wednesday for a fifth time since the financial crisis and predicted that a proposed tax cut moving through Congress would modestly increase economic growth for the next few years without stoking inflation. As a result, the Fed said it did not expect the legislation, which President Trump has called "rocket fuel" for the economy, to accelerate the Fed's plans to raise interest rates in 2018 and indicated it remains on track for three rate increases next year.
The Fed's highly anticipated economic assessment, delivered after a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee, amounted to a lukewarm endorsement of the Trump administration's top economic priority. Mr. Trump has suggested that the $1.5 trillion tax cut could nearly double economic growth to as much as 6 percent, a level far greater than most economists think likely.
"My colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists," said Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman. She said they expected the bill to provide "a modest lift."
Ms. Yellen spoke at a news conference after the Fed announced a widely expected decision to increase its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent. The increase continues the Fed's gradual march toward higher rates, which were cut to near-zero during the financial crisis. Wednesday's increase is the third time this year that the Fed has raised rates, reflecting its confidence that the economy is in good health.
The Fed and Congress are moving in opposite directions. The Fed, in raising rates, is reducing the support it has provided to the economy since the financial crisis. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, are preparing a $1.5 trillion tax cut for businesses and individuals with the aim of stimulating economic growth.
Some Fed officials, including Ms. Yellen, cautioned earlier this year that tax cuts could push the pace of growth to an unsustainable level, resulting in higher inflation, and that the Fed might respond by raising interest rates more quickly, to restrain growth and keep a lid on inflation.
After seeing the details of the tax plan, however, Fed officials have concluded that there is no need to raise rates more quickly. A quarterly update of the Fed's economic forecast showed that officials still expect to raise rates three times next year -- unchanged from the last economic forecast.
"We continue to think that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants factoring in their assessment of the tax policy," Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday.
In part, the Fed has concluded the tax plan doesn't pack a large punch. Fed officials predicted that the economy would grow at a 2.5 percent pace next year; the previous forecast was 2.1 percent.
President Trump has predicted that the tax plan could deliver 4 percent growth or more.
Apprised of those comments by a reporter, Ms. Yellen responded: "I wouldn't want to rule anything out. It is challenging, however, to achieve growth of the levels that you mentioned."
The Fed also has learned that it's not so easy to increase inflation, which has remained persistently low despite a tightening labor market and strengthening economy. The Fed aims to keep prices rising by 2 percent a year; it is on pace to undershoot that goal for the sixth straight year, and Fed officials on Wednesday predicted a seventh consecutive failure in 2018.
But the Fed's outlook is also politically convenient, even if some analysts described it as overly optimistic. Republicans argue that the tax cuts will deliver a lasting boost to economic growth by encouraging investment. They do not want the Fed to get in the way by raising rates.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, described the Fed's forecast as "hopelessly unrealistic." He noted that the Fed was predicting that growth would be stronger than it expected, and unemployment would decline further, but without any increase in inflation.
"In short, the Fed forecasts an endless expansion, with minimal inflation pressure," he said.
It would be relatively easy for the Fed to respond if inflation does begin to climb. A thornier problem is the concern voiced by a minority of Fed officials that the central bank is already raising rates too quickly.
Two Fed officials voted against Wednesday's rate increase: Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Mr. Evans has argued that the Fed may be holding down inflation by undermining public confidence that it will raise inflation back up to 2 percent.
The Fed's rate increases have had little impact on financial markets, which have also shrugged off the Fed's efforts to tighten borrowing conditions. Rates on many loans have declined since the Fed's most recent rate increase, in June, and credit terms have loosened. Lee Ferridge, head of North American macro strategy for State Street Global Markets, said Wednesday's decision was "a bit of a nonevent, quite honestly."
Asset prices, which have climbed strongly this year even as the Fed has raised rates, were largely unchanged on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.1 percent, closing at 2,662.85. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to 2.34 percent from 2.4 percent on Tuesday.
Mr. Ferridge said the ongoing stimulus campaigns by other central banks, notably the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, were offsetting the effect of the Fed's retreat.
"You've still got huge amounts of liquidity coming into the system, and that's what's driving markets," he said. "You've got the Fed tightening, but you've got global policy loosening."
Some economists see the lack of tightening in financial markets as a reason for the Fed to raise rates more quickly, to prevent the formation of bubbles that could cause economic disruptions.
Ms. Yellen played down such concerns on Wednesday. She said the Fed saw little evidence that a fall in asset prices would cause broader pain. The use of borrowed money, for example, remains relatively modest by historical standards. "When we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there's nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange," she said.
The Fed's rate increases also haven't had much impact on the domestic economy.
The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage loan, at 3.94 percent last week, was lower than the 4.13 percent average rate at the same time last year, according to Freddie Mac.
But Ruben Gonzalez, an economist at Keller Williams, the real estate franchise based in Austin, Tex., said he expected mortgage rates to start rising gradually.
Mr. Gonzalez noted that housing prices were rising, and he said that higher mortgage rates could worsen affordability problems in some markets. "Any time rates are trending upward, and prices are growing at a rapid pace, affordability is going to be a big conversation," he said.
The next round of monetary policy decisions will be made by a new group of leaders.
Ms. Yellen is scheduled to step down in early February, at the end of her four-year term. Mr. Trump has nominated Jerome H. Powell, a Fed governor, as the next chairman. He is awaiting Senate confirmation. Only one of the nine voting members of the monetary policy committee at the beginning of this year is expected to remain a voting member by the middle of 2018.
Ms. Yellen on Wednesday praised Mr. Powell as "somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and shares its values," and she said she would work to ensure a smooth transition.
Asked about her own legacy, she described her time at the Fed as "immensely rewarding."
"I feel good that the labor market is in a very much stronger place than it was eight years ago," she said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers, scrambling to reach agreement on a final tax bill that they hope to pass next week, are coalescing around a plan that would slightly raise the proposed corporate tax rate, lower the top rate on the richest Americans and scale back the existing mortgage interest deduction. In a frenzy of last-minute negotiations, Republicans drew closer to agreement on nudging the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, up from the 20 percent in the bills that passed the House and Senate but still lower than the current 35 percent corporate rate, according to a lawmaker and a person briefed on the discussions.
They are also considering lowering the top individual tax rate to 37 percent, from the current top rate of 39.6 percent, to assuage concerns from some wealthy taxpayers who fear that their tax bills could rise under the current legislation, which eliminates a host of individual tax breaks.
Another closely watched change centers on the ability to deduct the interest on mortgage debt. Lawmakers are discussing limiting the deduction to mortgage debt of up to $750,000 for newly purchased homes, a higher cap than the $500,000 limit in the House-passed bill but lower than the $1 million limit that currently exists and remains in the Senate-passed bill, according to Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana.
The negotiations come as lawmakers in the House and Senate seek to align their tax bills, which differ in significant ways and must be reconciled to ensure enough Republican support to pass along party lines.
Under Senate rules, the final bill can add no more than $1.5 trillion to federal budget deficits over a decade, a restriction that has led to a frantic game of budget chess as lawmakers look for ways to pay for the changes they are considering. Lowering the top individual tax rate to 37 percent, for instance, will result in less tax revenue for the Treasury Department. Raising the corporate tax rate to 21 percent will help bring in a bit more money to help lawmakers stay in that $1.5 trillion box.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that House and Senate negotiators were making progress in their effort to agree on a final tax bill and that a deal could be reached shortly.
"We don't have it right this minute, but we're getting closer," Mr. Cornyn said shortly before lunchtime. "We've Ping-Ponged a number of offers and counteroffers back and forth."
In a sign of how difficult it is to build consensus for such a fast-moving bill, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Tuesday that she did not like the idea of lowering the top individual rate, which is currently 38.5 percent in the Senate bill and 39.6 percent in the House version.
"I don't think lowering the top rate is a good idea," Ms. Collins said, explaining that she preferred the House version that did not lower the top tax rate. "I had hoped that the House position, the original House position, would prevail."
However, Ms. Collins, who negotiated several changes to the final version of the Senate tax bill in exchange for her vote, would not say whether the adjustment to the top rate was a deal breaker.
"I'm going to wait and look at the entire conference report and what all of the provisions are," Ms. Collins said. "There are a lot of rumors flying around."
The bipartisan conference committee is scheduled to hold its one public meeting on Wednesday afternoon. While that meeting will give Republicans and Democrats a final chance to publicly debate the merits of a $1.5 trillion tax cut, it is not expected to alter the trajectory of the bill or its details.
A spokeswoman for the Senate Finance Committee stressed late Tuesday afternoon that negotiations were still continuing, but many lobbyists said they expected the discussions to be complete before the public meeting on Wednesday begins.
Also on Wednesday, President Trump plans to deliver at the White House what administration officials called a "closing argument" for the tax bill. And in an expression of optimism about the bill's fate, Speaker Paul D. Ryan tweeted a poem on Tuesday titled "'Twas the Night Before Taxmas."
Republicans are speeding ahead with the legislation despite criticism from Democrats that the bill hurts the middle class, benefits the rich and creates a raft of new loopholes that corporations and wealthy Americans can exploit. A special election for the Senate in Alabama has added to the pressure. After The Associated Press called the race on Tuesday night for Doug Jones, a Democrat, over Roy S. Moore, a Republican judge who has been accused of child molestation, the narrow Republican majority in the Senate was set to fall to 51 to 49.
House and Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors to hash out the final details of the tax plan, and they hope to hold a vote next week. Republican leaders want to complete a consensus bill in the next few days, and release its text on Friday. If all goes according to plan, the Senate could take the bill up on Monday and the House could follow on Tuesday or Wednesday.
On Tuesday, speculation on the Capitol swirled over which measures in the House and Senate tax bills would survive, be tweaked or be cut. Vice President Mike Pence huddled with Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means committee, and joined Senate Republicans for lunch to discuss the remaining details of the tax plan.
The big sticking points that remain include whether to scrap or keep the corporate alternative minimum tax and the estate tax for individuals, and how low to set the corporate tax rate.
"Certainly the president indicated he would be willing to go up a bit, and there's been some other concerns," Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, said of raising the corporate tax rate to pay for other fixes in the bill. "Everything's a little bit in flux."
Among the most politically sensitive issues lingering is how to treat the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, which is capped at $10,000 in property taxes in the House and Senate bills. Lawmakers have been working through possible compromises that would let people continue to deduct a certain amount of property or income taxes, but Republicans still run the risk of raising taxes on broad portions of middle-income constituents. Scaling back the SALT deduction appears to be a risk some are willing to take.
"Will there be some outliers who pay more in taxes? Yes," Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said on Tuesday on CNBC. "There are some people who will pay more because they live in very high-tax jurisdictions."
However, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, called on members of the conference committee to rethink eliminating the state and local tax deduction as they craft a final bill.
"Among the plan's deficiencies is the elimination of the state and local tax deduction (SALT), which since the advent of our federal income tax has prevented the double taxation of Americans' income and allowed states to operate as laboratories of experiment as our founders intended," Mr. Issa wrote in a letter to the committee members and congressional leaders.
This week, several independent "dynamic" scores of the tax bills, which include the potential revenue-raising effects of economic growth, found that the proposed legislation would still add at least $1 trillion to the deficit over a decade.
The Treasury Department released a one-page study on Monday that showed the tax plan more than paying for itself, but only if economic growth averages 2.9 percent a year, after adjusting for inflation, over the next 10 years and if other economic policies proposed by the Trump administration are enacted. Most mainstream economists say they believe that such a high rate of economic growth is not possible.
While many tax experts criticized the report as unrealistic, Mr. Ryan praised the Treasury analysis on Tuesday.
"I think that estimate makes a lot of sense," Mr. Ryan said, arguing that the economic models used by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation were less reflective of reality.
Democrats and progressives have been assailing Republicans for recklessly adding to the debt and giving big tax breaks to the rich.
"I would hope my Republican colleagues are taking a look at how the American people feel about this disastrous tax bill," said Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, referring to polling that shows the tax bill as unpopular among the general public. "I hope that they understand that is not what the American people want."

Full text: Technology companies led stocks modestly higher on Monday, driving the market to another set of milestones. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average finished at new highs. Both market gauges also hit record highs on Friday.
Solid gains by health care companies also helped lift the market, outweighing losses among banks and industrial stocks. Energy shares rose along with the price of crude oil.
Many investors had their eyes on Bitcoin futures, which made their market debut. But traders were mostly looking ahead to the outcome of Wednesday's meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers.
"The market is kind of in a holding pattern, just sort of waiting for the Fed meeting," said Randy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab.
The S.&P. 500 index rose 8.49 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,659.99. The index has risen on a weekly basis for the past three weeks. The Dow gained 56.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,386.03. The Nasdaq composite index added 35 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,875.08. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks slipped 1.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,519.84.
The Fed is scheduled to issue an interest rate policy update on Wednesday. Economists expect the central bank to lift short-term rates by 0.25 percent. That would be the third interest rate increase by the central bank this year.
While inflation has remained low, the Fed has seen a path to gradually raise rates as the economy and labor market have strengthened.
The Labor Department said on Monday that employers posted slightly fewer job openings in October than in the previous month, but the number of people being hired increased. Last week, another report showed that employers added a net total of 244,000 jobs in October and 228,000 in November. The trend helped keep the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent.
Technology companies accounted for much of the market's gains on Monday.
The software maker Symantec rose $1.24, or 4.4 percent, to $29.22. Apple gained 2 percent after the website Apple Insider said the company was delivering new iPhones to customers at a faster pace. Apple also made news after it agreed to acquire the Shazam music-identification service in a deal worth about $400 million, according to a report by the technology website Recode. Apple stock added $3.30 to $172.67.
Allergan led the gainers in health care. The company climbed $4.96, or 3 percent, to $172.76.
Bitcoin futures rose on their first day of trading on a major United States exchange. Trading on the contract for the virtual currency began on Sunday. The first futures contract closed at $18,545, according to data from Cboe Global Markets, ending its initial day of trading with a 20 percent gain from its opening price.
Oil and gas prices rose, lifting energy stocks. Chesapeake Energy added 15 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $3.83.
Benchmark United States crude gained 63 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $57.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, added $1.29, or 2 percent, to close at $64.69 a barrel in London.
Gold slipped $1.50 to settle at $1,243.70 an ounce, while silver fell 4 cents to $15.70 an ounce. Copper added 3 cents to $2.99 a pound.
Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent.
The dollar edged up to 113.53 yen, and the euro rose to $1.1786. The British pound climbed to $1.3336.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to end the year by raising its benchmark interest rate for just the fifth time since the financial crisis, as it continues to slowly unwind its post-crisis stimulus campaign. But pressures are building that could prompt the Fed to start moving a little more quickly. Robust job creation in November is the latest sign of stronger economic growth, and it comes as Republicans are preparing a $1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump has described as economic "rocket fuel."
The Fed is widely expected to acknowledge the strength of the economy by increasing its benchmark rate by one quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, after its final policy meeting of the year. Investors, however, already are looking beyond that decision. They want to know what comes next and whether the Fed, which will soon have a new chairman and several new governors, will deviate from the patient approach of the current Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
The Fed predicted in September that it would increase rates three times in 2018 and two more times in 2019. On Wednesday, the Fed is also scheduled to release a new round of economic projections. Some Wall Street analysts expect stronger growth will push the Fed to add at least one rate increase in each of those years.
"Most F.O.M.C. members had not built tax reform into their September projections, and progress has been much more rapid than they (or we) expected," Seth Carpenter, chief United States economist at UBS, wrote in a research note, referring to the Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee.
He said the Fed was likely to predict faster growth, less unemployment -- and more rate increases.
The pace of increases has broad implications for the economy. The Fed held interest rates at a low level after the financial crisis to stimulate economic growth by encouraging investors to take risks and consumers and businesses to borrow money. By increasing rates, it is reducing those incentives.
The Fed is trying to keep growth at a sustainable pace. It does not want the economy to grow so fast that it drives inflation above 2 percent a year, and it does not want to stall the economy and cause a recession.
The first step is the easy one. The Fed has clearly signaled that it plans to raise rates on Wednesday. A measure of investor expectations derived from asset prices put the odds of an increase at 100 percent.
"I think conditions are supportive," Jerome H. Powell, the Fed governor who is awaiting confirmation as the Fed's next chairman told the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing last month. Still, Mr. Powell said, there must be a vote. "We need to go ahead and have the meeting."
The future is more difficult to predict. Fed officials already expected the economy to keep growing in 2018, and unemployment to keep falling. But economic reports in recent months have exceeded expectations, including Friday's estimate by the Commerce Department that employers added 228,000 jobs in November. That has raised the possibility that the economy is continuing to gain strength.
Financial markets have also shrugged off the Fed's efforts to tighten borrowing conditions. Rates on many loans have declined since the Fed's most recent rate increase, in June, and credit terms have loosened.
On the other hand, inflation remains oddly sluggish, up just 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in October. That has prompted a debate among Fed officials. Most, including Ms. Yellen, expect inflation and wages to rise as worker availability dwindles. But a minority sees no harm in patience.
"Is there really a hurry to raise rates?" Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, asked in a recent interview. He said he worried the Fed was undermining expectations that it would take the necessary steps to raise inflation back up to its 2 percent target, which it has undershot for six years. "What if we just decided to wait until the middle of the year and if we saw inflation pick up, then we could do something? I would say at the moment I think the current decision is really a judgment call."
The pending tax cut is a complicating factor. Monetary policy influences economic conditions gradually. In adjusting interest rates, the Fed must anticipate the evolution of those conditions. It also faces political pressure from Republicans who do not want the benefits of their tax legislation to be offset by faster rate increases.
Mr. Powell tiptoed gingerly around tax cut questions at his confirmation hearing. He said that the Fed had not attempted to estimate the impact of the bills passed by the House and the Senate, and that it would not to seek to forecast that impact until the legislation became law.
"We will incorporate, when it's done, fiscal changes that are made," he said.
The presidents of some of the Fed's regional reserve banks have offered their own forecasts, generally in line with the consensus among independent economists that tax cuts would be likely to increase both economic growth and inflation by a modest amount in the short term.
Because some Fed officials think the economy is already growing at a pace that is likely to increase inflation over time, they have said that faster growth would not be welcome.
"I'm not in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy doesn't really need it," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said late last month.
Economists at Goldman Sachs analyzed the Senate version of the tax cut using the Fed's economic model and concluded that it would add about 0.25 percentage points to economic growth for a few years, which could cause the Fed to raise rates by an additional half a percentage point above current projections.
Proponents of the tax plan argue that it will deliver a larger increase in economic growth, both in the short term, by increasing spending, and in the long term, by increasing investment.
But Fed officials have expressed skepticism about such forecasts. The government is planning to leave more money in taxpayers' pockets, and some of that money is likely to be spent. But most economists expect the benefits will be tempered by a large increase in the federal debt, driving up interest rates. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 2014 that every dollar of increased federal borrowing reduced private sector investment by about 15 to 50 cents.
Some proponents of the tax plan argue that interest rates will not rise, increasing the benefit. But Mr. Powell at his confirmation hearing indicated that he shared the conventional view.
Regarding the increase in the federal debt, he said, "Either taxes will have to go up to pay for that, or you'll have even more debt, and that will crowd out private capital and private investment."
The Fed is unlikely to give a complete account of its thinking on Wednesday.
Fed officials want to avoid taking sides in the final stages of the congressional battle over the tax cuts. The House and Senate are still in the process of reconciling the differences in their tax bills. Ms. Yellen, who is expected to step down in February, will hold her final scheduled news conference after the announcement, but she may defer questions about the future to her successor.
"Her comments will likely not be very interesting," said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management. "She certainly does not want to stir the pot."

Full text: Amid pressure on academia to control costs, the pay packages for private college presidents have continued to rise, as the number earning more than $1 million spiked in 2015 and average compensation rose 9 percent, according to an annual survey. In 2015, the year with the most recent data available, 58 presidents earned a compensation package worth more than $1 million, up from 39 presidents in 2014, according to the annual ranking of pay at 500 private colleges compiled by The Chronicle of Higher Education.
In many cases the compensation packages were bolstered by deferred compensation plans and large retirement payouts.
"The number of presidents earning over $1 million is unusually high in 2015," said Dan Bauman, a reporter for The Chronicle who worked on compiling the data. "We attribute that, in part, to a market where presidents are negotiating more deferred compensation and bonus packages before they take the job."
At the head of the list was Nathan O. Hatch, the president of Wake Forest University, whose earnings of $4 million included a lump sum of nearly $3 million that he earned upon completing 10 years in the office.
In a statement, Wake Forest said Dr. Hatch's compensation without those earnings -- a base salary of $839,944 -- was in line with similar institutions. Donna Boswell, the chair of the board of trustees, said Dr. Hatch's leadership was "exceptional."
Colleges frequently cite competitive pressures in setting the pay of presidents, who sometimes come from, or are recruited for, the corporate executive suite. They also note increasing demands on college leaders to raise money for their schools.
By that same token, such lucrative pay packages could "serve to feed a growing political argument for cutting tax benefits and public funding for higher education," said Charlie Eaton, a professor at the University of California, Merced, who has studied university endowment wealth.
The top 10 included some expected names, including the leaders of the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, Columbia University, the University of Chicago and Boston University.
No. 2 was James W. Wagner, who stepped down as Emory University's president last year. In 2015 he earned $3.5 million, which included a payout of 10 years of deferred compensation, according to the university. He was No. 33 on the previous year's list. Jonathan K. Layne, a member of Emory's board, credited the deferred compensation plan with providing "a stable, successful leadership" for Emory.
The top 10 also included Joanne K. Glasser, who departed in 2015 as president of Bradley University in Peoria, Ill.; David E. Van Zandt, president of the New School in New York City; and Daniel Curran, who stepped down from the presidency of the University of Dayton last year. He received more than $2.4 million in total pay, including retirement compensation.
Steve Cobb, who served on the university's board of trustees, called Dr. Curran "an exceptional leader for this university during his 14-year tenure."
"During that time, the university grew in size and stature by almost every measure and was positioned for continued growth," Mr. Cobb said.
The average compensation for presidents at the surveyed private colleges who were in office for the full year rose 9 percent in 2015, to $570,000, and came after a 9 percent increase in 2014. The pay of the average American worker rose between 3 and 4 percent in each year, according to the Social Security Administration.
Private colleges tend to pay their presidents more than public ones do. The Chronicle's most recent compilation for public universities showed eight earning compensation packages exceeding $1 million, led by Michael Crow of Arizona State University, at $1.6 million.
As presidents' pay has risen unabated, lawmakers have begun criticizing the size of some universities' endowments, which are currently untaxed. The tax bills that passed in the House and Senate each include a 1.4 percent tax on earnings of some college endowments, including many of the nation's most elite schools. As many as 70 schools with large endowments could be affected by that tax, depending on which version of the bill is adopted.
Last year, three influential Republican legislators, led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, sent a letter to 56 private universities with endowments of $1 billion or more, requesting information on "the numerous tax preferences" they enjoy. "Despite these large and growing endowments," the letter said, "many colleges and universities have raised tuition far in excess of inflation."
A look at the costs of private colleges by the College Board suggests that while tuition has risen dramatically, the actual price paid by students after grants and financial aid has increased only 5 percent over the past 10 years.
But concerns have been raised about growing student debt. In a presentation earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that student debt was $1.3 trillion at the end of 2016, an increase of about 170 percent since 2006.
Dr. Eaton said the high salaries paid to private university presidents often are tied to the wealth of endowments.
"The unfortunate dynamic is that you see where the extreme wealth of private universities, and their ability to pay higher executive salaries, creates a norm that other universities feel pressured to follow," Dr. Eaton said.

How The Times Analyzed E.P.A. Actions

Full text: The analysis by The New York Times of the Trump administration's record in enforcing environmental regulations was based on data compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency and publicly available in its Enforcement and Compliance History Online database. Because the online records are not always immediately updated, the analysis also accounted for cases pursued under Mr. Trump that were available in E.P.A. and Justice Department news releases, the federal register, court documents and other public sources.
The analysis covered a period of 266 days in each of the Trump, Obama and George W. Bush administrations.
For the Trump administration, it included cases beginning Feb. 17, when Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, began his job, and ending Nov. 9. For an equivalent comparison to the two previous administrations, the analysis covered the first 266 days of Lisa Jackson's tenure at the E.P.A., starting on Jan. 23, 2009, and of Christine Todd Whitman's tenure, starting on Jan. 31, 2001.
Because many cases completed during the first year of any new administration reflect enforcement begun by the previous administration, the analysis included only cases filed under each of the three administrators.
Cynthia Giles, the former assistant administrator for the E.P.A.'s enforcement office during the Obama administration, had compiled a similar enforcement database that she shared with The Times. Using Ms. Giles's approach as a model, but changing some parameters, The Times built its own. The results of the analysis were vetted by Ms. Giles and other environmental experts, including Granta Nakayama, a former assistant administrator for the E.P.A.'s enforcement office during the Bush administration. The results were also shared with current officials at the E.P.A.
The E.P.A. is expected to announce its annual enforcement figures in the coming weeks. The agency generally measures cases that have been closed in the past year, rather than cases filed. In its response to The Times, the E.P.A. cited billions of dollars in civil penalties represented by cases completed since President Trump took office, but many of those cases were filed under the previous administration so were not included in The Times's tally.
The agency also pointed out it can take months or even years to develop a case to the point that it can be filed, so "data from the last nine months is not dependent solely on work that has been performed during this administration."
The Times analyzed the two types of civil enforcement actions -- judicial cases and administrative cases.
In judicial cases, the Justice Department pursues legal action against polluters on behalf of the E.P.A. These can result in large fines and injunctive relief, which is the cost of making changes to prevent further violations. The Times's analysis included all judicial cases filed with a court.
Administrative cases are typically smaller actions that move faster and do not involve the Justice Department, but can result in fines and injunctive relief. The analysis included administrative cases with complaints, proposed orders or final orders.
In comparing the fines and injunctive relief totals, the totals for 2001 and 2009 were adjusted for inflation.
The E.P.A.'s online records change on a daily basis, meaning The Times's database is a snapshot in time and data downloaded on different days might show different results.

E.P.A.'s Polluter Playbook Takes a Turn to Leniency

Full text: EAST LIVERPOOL, Ohio -- The highway billboard at the entrance to town still displays a giant campaign photograph of President Trump, who handily won the election across industrial Ohio. But a revolt is brewing here in East Liverpool over Mr. Trump's move to slow down the federal government's policing of air and water pollution. The City Council moved unanimously last month to send a protest letter to the Environmental Protection Agency about a hazardous waste incinerator near downtown. Since Mr. Trump took office, the E.P.A. has not moved to punish the plant's owner, even after extensive evidence was assembled during the Obama administration that the plant had repeatedly, and illegally, released harmful pollutants into the air.
"I don't know where we go," Councilman William Hogue, a retired social studies teacher, said in frustration to his fellow council members. "They haven't resolved anything."
Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, has said the Trump administration's high-profile regulatory rollback does not mean a free pass for violators of environmental laws. But as the Trump administration moves from one attention-grabbing headline to the next, it has taken a significant but less-noticed turn in the enforcement of federal pollution laws.
An analysis of enforcement data by The New York Times shows that the administration has adopted a more lenient approach than the previous two administrations -- Democratic and Republican -- toward polluters like those in East Liverpool.
The Times built a database of civil cases filed at the E.P.A. during the Trump, Obama and Bush administrations. During the first nine months under Mr. Pruitt's leadership, the E.P.A. started about 1,900 cases, about one-third fewer than the number under President Barack Obama's first E.P.A. director and about one-quarter fewer than under President George W. Bush's over the same time period.
In addition, the agency sought civil penalties of about $50.4 million from polluters for cases initiated under Mr. Trump. Adjusted for inflation, that is about 39 percent of what the Obama administration sought and about 70 percent of what the Bush administration sought over the same time period.
The E.P.A., turning to one of its most powerful enforcement tools, also can force companies to retrofit their factories to cut pollution. Under Mr. Trump, those demands have dropped sharply. The agency has demanded about $1.2 billion worth of such fixes, known as injunctive relief, in cases initiated during the nine-month period, which, adjusted for inflation, is about 12 percent of what was sought under Mr. Obama and 48 percent under Mr. Bush.
Resolving complicated pollution cases can take time, and the E.P.A. said it remained committed to ensuring companies obeyed environmental laws.
"E.P.A. and states work together to find violators and bring them back into compliance, and to punish intentional polluters," the agency said in a statement. Officials said Mr. Pruitt was less fixated on seeking large penalties than some of his predecessors were.
"We focus more on bringing people back into compliance than bean counting," the statement said.
After this article was posted, the E.P.A. issued a statement criticizing the report, and saying that "Administrator Scott Pruitt is committed to enforcement," and that "there is no reduction in E.P.A.'s commitment to ensure compliance with our nation's environmental laws." (The full statement is here.)
Confidential internal E.P.A. documents show that the enforcement slowdown coincides with major policy changes ordered by Mr. Pruitt's team after pleas from oil and gas industry executives.
The documents, which were reviewed by The Times, indicate that E.P.A. enforcement officers across the country no longer have the authority to order certain air and water pollution tests, known as requests for information, without receiving permission from Washington. The tests are essential to building a case against polluters, the equivalent of the radar gun for state highway troopers.
At at least two of the agency's most aggressive regional offices, requests for information involving companies suspected of polluting have fallen significantly under Mr. Trump, according to internal E.P.A. data.
In the last two complete fiscal years of the Obama administration, the E.P.A.'s office in Chicago sent requests for testing that covered an average of 50 facilities per year, or about 4.2 each month. By comparison, after the policy changes, one such request for a single facility was made in the subsequent four-month period. There was a similar decline in the Denver regional office, according to the data.
The enforcement slowdown has been compounded by the departure of more than 700 employees at the E.P.A. since Mr. Trump's election, many of them via buyouts intended to reduce the agency's size, and high-level political vacancies at the E.P.A. and the Justice Department. The agency's top enforcement officer -- Susan Bodine -- was confirmed only late last week.
Separately, Mr. Pruitt's team has told officials and industry representatives in Missouri, North Dakota and other states that E.P.A. enforcement officers will stand down on some pollution cases, according to agency documents. The retrenchment is said to be part of a nationwide handoff of many enforcement duties to state authorities, an effort Mr. Pruitt calls cooperative federalism but critics say is an industry-friendly way to ease up on polluters.
Current and recently departed E.P.A. staff members said the new direction has left many employees feeling frozen in place, and demoralized, particularly in the regional offices, which have investigators who are especially knowledgeable of local pollution threats.
"Certain people who are polluting are doing it with impunity right now and I think it is horrible," said Nicole Cantello, an E.P.A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who has worked at the agency for 26 years.
Ms. Cantello agreed to speak to The Times because she is protected by her status as a union official. The E.P.A. did not authorize agency employees to speak.
The Times asked top E.P.A. enforcement officials from the Obama and Bush administrations to review The Times's data, analysis and methodology. (Read more about The Times's methodology here.) They said the slowdown signaled a sea change in enforcement under Mr. Trump.
"Those kinds of numbers are stark," said Granta Nakayama, a lawyer who served in the Bush administration as assistant administrator for the E.P.A.'s enforcement office and who now represents companies facing E.P.A. enforcement actions for the law firm King & Spalding, where he oversees the environmental practice.
"If you're not filing cases, the cop's not on the beat," he said. "Or has the cop been taken off the beat?"
Cynthia Giles, the former assistant administrator for the E.P.A.'s enforcement office during the Obama administration, also prepared a separate version of the data. She described as a "stunning decline" the reduced efforts under Mr. Trump to require companies to bring their facilities into compliance with pollution laws.
"The Pruitt E.P.A. is cratering on the enforcement work that matters most: holding the biggest polluters accountable," said Ms. Giles, now a director at the Energy & Environment Lab at the University of Chicago.
Some enforcement experts suggested that the E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt might have filed fewer cases because it was going after larger penalties. But according to the Times analysis, most of the top penalties were smaller than those in the previous two administrations. And the nine-month window included the single largest civil case filed by the E.P.A., against Exxon Mobil.
'It Really Just Scares Me'
On a midsummer afternoon in 2013, boiler ash and steam blasted through a breach at the Heritage Thermal Services hazardous waste incinerator, spewing hundreds of pounds of ash into a nearby neighborhood in East Liverpool and setting off a series of small fires at the plant.
Tests later showed that the ash, which looked like dirty clumps of cotton candy scattered across rooftops and lawns, contained toxic chemicals. In some samples, lead and arsenic were found at concentrations that "could pose a hazard to small children," according to an Ohio Department of Health report. Heritage Thermal went door to door offering to wash people's houses and replace vegetables in their gardens.
Sandra Estell, 64, who lives on a river bluff overlooking the plant, said the ash covered her brother's Chevy Blazer and blanketed the street where she grew up. Even when the plant operates normally, she said, she smells the incinerator from her home -- with the odor changing from rotten eggs to an electrical fire to something difficult to place.
Truckloads of hazardous waste often sit in the parking lot outside the plant, awaiting disposal. On the day of the accident in 2013, the plant was burning through a load of waste sent from an oil refinery in Toledo.
"It really just scares me," Ms. Estell said of the incinerator.
The plant falls under the jurisdiction of the E.P.A. regional office in Chicago, which moved quickly to investigate the episode as a possible violation of the Clean Air Act, federal records show.
Investigators sent Heritage Thermal's general manager what is known as a Section 114(a) request for detailed information on the explosion. Failing to answer the questions, warned George T. Czerniak, who was then the E.P.A.'s Chicago-based director of the air and radiation division, could result in punishment.
Heritage Thermal complied within weeks, and also disclosed that the plant had faced a series of related problems when pressure inside the incinerator had climbed to dangerous levels. Mr. Czerniak asked for more information about those episodes, and by March 2015 he had signed a formal letter of complaint, alleging a series of Clean Air Act violations that would very likely result in fines, as well as possible civil or criminal action.
"We are offering you an opportunity to confer with us about the violations," Mr. Czerniak wrote in the letter. "You may have an attorney represent you at this conference."
More than two and a half years later, the matter remains unresolved, leading to the letter of complaint to the E.P.A. last month from the East Liverpool City Council. The body is dominated by Democrats, but it says its motivation in criticizing the E.P.A. is based on concerns about public safety and not partisan politics.
John Mercer, a City Council member, said taking on air pollution issues at Heritage Thermal has been a delicate matter because the area has lost thousands of jobs as steel and pottery manufacturing plants closed. "Heritage Thermal is one of the city's largest employers," he said. "We are all friends and neighbors with those that work there."
Still, he said, residents want the matter resolved. "Our constituents deserve answers that no one seems to want to provide," he said.
A spokesman for the E.P.A. declined to comment on the case's status, as did Christopher T. Pherson, president of Heritage Thermal. The company said in a statement that it "is committed to continuously enhancing its performance and environmental compliance."
Ms. Estell, who was critical of the plant even before it opened in the 1990s for being built near homes, blames the change in administrations in Washington for the inaction. "Something made them slam on the brakes," she said.
Every administration runs into delays when investigating and enforcing environmental laws, and it is hard to pinpoint why any particular case might stall without access to confidential E.P.A. files. But the lack of action in East Liverpool mirrors a pattern of sluggish new enforcement activity under the Trump administration, as represented in data analyzed by The Times.
The Times identified more than a dozen companies or plants like Heritage Thermal that received notices of violation toward the end of the Obama administration, but as of late November had not faced E.P.A. penalties. The findings were based on agency files released through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit group run by a former E.P.A. enforcement chief.
Indiana Harbor Coke in East Chicago, Ind., has received at least three warning notices since 2015 for pollution violations, including hundreds of illegal emissions of lead, which can cause serious health problems, especially for children.
Other cases include TimkenSteel Corporation of Canton, Ohio, which was served with a notice in November 2015 for illegally emitting hazardous toxins, including mercury, which, when inhaled in large quantities, can cause pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and death.
In Waterford, Ohio, Globe Metallurgical was cited in June 2015 and December 2016 for air pollution violations. The E.P.A. collected evidence that it was emitting illegal amounts of sulfur dioxide, which can irritate the nose and throat and, at very high concentrations, cause life-threatening accumulation of fluid in the lungs.
And in East Liverpool, just down the street from the Heritage Thermal incinerator, S.H. Bell was cited for allowing toxic levels of dust with heavy metal chemical additives such as manganese to drift beyond its property line.
Tests conducted near S.H. Bell found "the highest levels of ambient manganese concentrations in the United States," a complaint issued during the Obama administration said. Health officials warned that the situation represented "a public health hazard and should be mitigated as soon as possible to reduce harmful exposures."
Research led by the University of Cincinnati found in September that levels of manganese in the blood and hair of children in East Liverpool appeared to be related to lower I.Q. scores, a conclusion executives from S.H. Bell have disputed.
The E.P.A. moved in the final days of the Obama administration to resolve the S.H. Bell matter, proposing a consent decree in January that would require changes to reduce manganese dust levels and to improve monitoring.
Generally, a proposed consent decree is resolved within several months, but in March, the Trump administration asked a federal judge to delay the case so the E.P.A. could "brief incoming administration officials with decision-making responsibility" given that "many subordinate political positions at the agency remain unfilled." The Justice Department has since asked the court to move ahead, but the case remains open.
A spokeswoman for S.H. Bell said that the company had moved to comply with the requirements and that its operations had not harmed residents. The E.P.A. said in a statement that it was waiting for the court to act. "It would not be appropriate to discuss the open enforcement matters," the statement said.
Roberta Pratt, 49, a bartender who lives with her family on a block situated between Heritage Thermal and S.H. Bell, said she worries constantly about the delays in enforcement at the facilities. The side of her house, she said, is stained with a rusty color from heavy metals that float through the air.
"It makes me feel like less of a mother," said Ms. Pratt of the pollution problems. "You can't protect your children."
Fighting back tears, she added, "People say to me, 'Why don't you just pick up and move out of here?' Well, I just don't have the money to do that."
Industry Gets a Sympathetic Ear
The memo was marked "Privileged/Confidential/Do Not Release" and was signed by Susan Shinkman, the director of civil enforcement at the E.P.A. and one of Mr. Pruitt's top deputies in Washington at the time.
It arrived by email to agency employees across the country on May 31.
With four pages of detailed instructions, it directed E.P.A. investigators to seek authorization before asking companies to track their emissions with instruments that determine the type and amount of pollutants being released at their plants.
It also said investigators needed special authorization if they did not already have evidence that the company had quite likely violated the law, or if state authorities objected to the tests.
The scope was far-reaching, applying to possible violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and federal laws regulating hazardous waste plants.
The goal of these changes, the memo said, was to "ensure a more nationally consistent and complete accounting of federal compliance monitoring and enforcement activities." But the directive arrived like a thunderbolt, upending one of the agency's most effective methods in catching polluters, E.P.A. regional officials said, and one that was extremely unpopular with the oil and gas industry.
In the prior two years, investigators in the Chicago office had sent requests for information -- which includes requests for testing -- that covered 267 facilities in the six Midwest states it oversees, including in cases involving giant mountains of petcoke stored near residential neighborhoods in Chicago. A carbon and sulfur byproduct of refining oil, petcoke particles can become airborne and enter the lungs, causing serious health effects.
Investigators in the regional office in Denver, which handles many oil and gas cases, also sent out a series of requests during the Obama administration based on hints that energy producers were letting vast quantities of hazardous air pollutants escape into the atmosphere. The pollutants included benzene, which is a carcinogen, and methane, which is a major contributor to climate change. The investigations escalated after four workers at energy facilities in North Dakota were overcome by fumes and died.
As the Obama administration came to a close, companies had grown increasingly unhappy with the tests and began to fight them by turning to allies in Washington.
Koch Carbon, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, which operated two petcoke storage facilities in Chicago, challenged the E.P.A.'s authority to require the tests in a formal filing with the agency, E.P.A. documents show, although it still provided the information the agency had requested. The test results showed that its petcoke piles were, in fact, threatening neighbors and led to their removal.
Republicans in Congress, including Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, took up the cause for the oil and gas industry. In public hearings, Mr. Inhofe interrogated E.P.A. officials about the tests and called them "a backdoor effort for the E.P.A. to cut greenhouse gas emissions."
When Mr. Trump was elected and named Mr. Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the E.P.A., the complaints got a fresh -- and sympathetic -- hearing. Ms. Shinkman, in an interview, said she was instructed to write the new policy memo after Mr. Pruitt received letters of complaint from oil industry executives in North Dakota and Colorado. Ms. Shinkman retired from the E.P.A. in September; in its statement to The Times, the E.P.A. did not say whether the oil and gas industry had been a factor in its decision.
Ron Ness, the president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, wrote to Mr. Pruitt in March describing the tests as burdensome and costly. "Under the previous administration, the E.P.A. initiated sweeping Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 114 information requests and threatened company-ending sanctions." Mr. Ness wrote in a letter obtained by The Times.
In his response to Mr. Ness, Mr. Pruitt wrote that the E.P.A. would "develop best practices for the judicious use" of the requests, and also hand off much of the enforcement of air pollution laws to North Dakota officials, except on Indian lands where the federal government has jurisdiction.
"The E.P.A. acknowledges the critical role that the oil and gas industry plays in ensuring the nation's energy independence through domestic energy production," Mr. Pruitt wrote to Mr. Ness in July.
The change in North Dakota was part of a broader effort by the E.P.A. to give states more say in how to treat polluters.
In a letter to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Edward Chu, the deputy administrator of the E.P.A.'s regional office in Kansas, said the agency would back off some inspection and enforcement activity so the state could take the lead. "These shifts in direction do represent significant change," Mr. Chu wrote.
Officials in North Dakota said the new arrangement there is leading to faster resolution of cases involving the oil and gas industry.
"We are focused on compliance and fixes, not on big fines that are trumped up," said Jim Semerad, who leads the division of the North Dakota Department of Health that enforces air emissions rules.
But some critics question the sincerity of Mr. Pruitt's deference to state authorities, in part because it comes as the Trump administration has proposed cutting grants that help states pay for local enforcement. And the vigilance of some states in taking on the new responsibilities is also uncertain.
An audit by the E.P.A. inspector general in 2011 described North Dakota as "a state philosophically opposed to taking enforcement action" against polluters.
The state's fines, moreover, are a tiny fraction of those imposed by the E.P.A. for the same violations, records obtained by The Times show, and some North Dakota settlements do not require the hiring of independent inspectors to ensure companies honor their promises.
In Ohio, a change in state law that was tucked into a budget bill this year cut funding for an inspector in East Liverpool, even as Ohio authorities found continued evidence of air pollution violations at the Heritage Thermal incinerator, according to state records obtained by The Times.
Ohio Environmental Services Industry, a trade group that represents Heritage Thermal and a handful of other hazardous waste companies, pushed for the change. The group said the facility would receive sufficient oversight without the dedicated state inspector.
The changes across the country, some lawyers suggest, are giving violators an upper hand in negotiating with the E.P.A.
Paul Calamita, who represents cities accused of violating the Clean Water Act when they release sewage and contaminated storm water into rivers and lakes, recommends that clients team up with state governments to push back against the E.P.A.
Under President Trump, Mr. Calamita said, the E.P.A. and the Department of Justice have been willing to compromise, withdrawing a six-figure penalty in one instance after refusing to do so in two previous rounds of negotiations during the Obama administration.
"States with new Republican governors are following the Trump approach -- providing compliance assistance at the outset to avoid enforcement where the discharger is cooperative," he said in a presentation to utility executives from around the United States. "A state that pushes back on E.P.A. is likely to be successful."
A Muscular Office Loses Muscle
The E.P.A. under Mr. Pruitt has pursued some high-profile prosecutions of polluters and has talked tough about companies like Fiat Chrysler, which like Volkswagen has been accused of installing software on its vehicles meant to evade emissions standards.
The agency's biggest civil case filed since Mr. Trump took office involves Exxon Mobil, which was accused of not properly operating and monitoring industrial flares at its petrochemical facilities. Exxon agreed in October to pay $2.5 million in civil penalties, some of which will go to Louisiana, and spend $300 million to install new technology to reduce air pollution.
The agency on Friday also released a list of 21 Superfund sites contaminated with hazardous substances and pollutants that Mr. Pruitt has targeted for immediate and intense attention. One of the sites on the list, Tar Creek, a former lead and zinc mine, is in Oklahoma, where Mr. Pruitt once served as attorney general and state senator.
But more than a dozen current and former E.P.A. officials told The Times that the slowdown in enforcement is real on the ground, and that it is being directed from the top.
At the Ralph Metcalfe Federal Building in Chicago, which houses a regional office of the E.P.A., employees said it has become difficult to even start a new investigation. Because it covers states populated with Rust Belt industries, the Chicago office has traditionally been one of the busiest of the 10 regions.
An agency spokeswoman, in a statement, said "we have not rejected any requests for sampling, monitoring and testing" that were sent to headquarters as a result of the new policy. But agency staff said the memo made clear such requests were discouraged, and many fewer were being drafted.
Jeff Trevino, a lawyer in the Chicago office, who has worked for the agency for 27 years, said the new hurdles imposed by Mr. Pruitt had created "a Catch-22" because, with new policies effectively discouraging requests for information, investigators will have a harder time getting the data needed to detect and confirm violations.
Mr. Trevino, like other current E.P.A. employees, was not authorized by the agency to speak with The Times, and did so as a member of the labor union.
"We are the boots on the ground and we just are having a hard time now getting the information we need to do our job," said Felicia Chase, who has worked for nearly a decade as a water pollution enforcement officer in the Chicago office, which covers states from Minnesota to Ohio. She was also speaking in her capacity as a union member.
Ms. Chase sat glumly in the cafeteria just before Thanksgiving. On a television set on the wall, President Trump could be seen offering an official pardon to a turkey, joking that he could not reverse Mr. Obama's turkey pardons from the previous year.
Some workers said they would take the unusual step of asking members of Congress to protect funding for the work they do, while others said they held out hope that the new restrictions on information gathering would not be permanent. Ms. Shinkman, the retired author of the May memo, said she had hoped to avoid a sharp drop in requests for information, but she declined to elaborate how that would be possible.
Mr. Czerniak, who led the air pollution unit in Chicago until his retirement in 2016, said it was hard to watch the agency struggle through this new era.
"People at the agency are just being cautious, almost to the point of paralysis," he said. "They do not want to do anything for fear of being told they have done something wrong -- something the new administrator won't like."

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: TRADE
More Nafta talks, but not with the top negotiators.
The members of the North American Free Trade Agreement gather again in Washington this week to discuss the future of the trade pact. Negotiations have been tense, but two things may take the pressure off this time: The countries are not describing these so-called "intersessional" talks as an official negotiating round and they are expected to focus on making progress on areas of agreement, including digital trade and customs, rather than the most tendentious issues. The next official Nafta negotiating round will be held in Montreal from Jan. 23 to 28. Ana Swanson
W.T.O. members will gather in Argentina.
Officials from the 164 members of the World Trade Organization converge on Buenos Aires this week for a ministerial conference, their first such high-level meeting in two years. While the body is close to announcing an agreement on curbing government fishing subsidies, expectations are low for it to make significant progress in advancing free trade. Instead, the focus will probably be on the posture of the United States under the Trump administration, which has expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the W.T.O. and similar international organizations. Ana Swanson
ECONOMY
Inflation is rising, slowly.
The Labor Department will release data on Wednesday on consumer prices for November. The low rate of inflation has been a persistent economic mystery in recent months, as falling unemployment and rising economic growth have failed to push up prices. The period of weakness could be nearing its end -- economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the report on Wednesday to show that prices rose 2.2 percent in November from a year earlier, above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. But the steadier "core" measure of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has remained more muted. Ben Casselman
Fed expected to increase key interest rate.
Janet L. Yellen will most likely oversee her last major decision as Federal Reserve chairwoman on Wednesday. The Fed's policymaking committee, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday, is widely expected to announce an increase in its benchmark interest rate for a third time this year. The expected decision would lift the rate to a range of 1.25 to 1.5 percent. The Fed has been raising rates despite the weakness of inflation because unemployment has fallen to a low level and job growth remains strong. After the Fed's policy announcement, Ms. Yellen will hold her final news conference as Fed chairwoman. She plans to leave the Fed in early February. Binyamin Appelbaum
TAXES
Congress sets a single public meeting to discuss tax bill.
The lone public conference committee meeting on the proposed tax cut legislation will be held in the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, when Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate will gather to publicly debate a bill that the G.O.P. hopes to get to President Trump's desk by the end of the year.
The meeting, which begins at 2 p.m., is expected to feature Democrats airing their grievances against the legislation and Republicans espousing the merits of the proposals that have passed the House and Senate. Lawmakers are required to have one such public gathering, but most of the real negotiating about the final details of the tax plan will take place among Republicans behind closed doors. Alan Rappeport
ECONOMY
Analysts watch for European economic indicators.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is not expected to make any major announcements on monetary policy when he holds his last news conference of the year on Thursday in Frankfurt. In late October, the central bank announced a significant reduction in its stimulus measures for the eurozone economy, and it would be a surprise if Mr. Draghi signaled any further steps so soon. But analysts will be paying close attention to the latest estimates for growth and inflation by the central bank's economists, which may offer clues about policymakers' view of the eurozone economy. Jack Ewing
Bank of England likely to maintain current interest rate.
The Bank of England was widely expected to keep its benchmark interest rate steady on Thursday after it raised its main rate last month for the first time in a decade. That rate increase to 0.5 percent came as the central bank tried to strike a balance between moderate growth and rising prices, particularly as the value of the pound has declined sharply in the 18 months since Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a process known as Brexit. Chad Bray
TECHNOLOGY
The F.C.C. is expected to repeal net neutrality.
The Federal Communications Commission will vote on Thursday on a proposal to repeal landmark broadband regulations known as net neutrality, rules that ensure an open internet. The plan, put forth by the commission's chairman, Ajit Pai, is expected to pass on a 3-to-2 party line vote. The reversal of the Barack Obama-era rules would free broadband providers to create new pricing tiers for the delivery of web content to consumers and to charge for faster and better quality video streaming. Mr. Pai has proposed that the broadband companies reveal their business practices and that the Federal Trade Commission police the industry for anticompetitive behavior. Cecilia Kang
ECONOMY
A look at retail's strength at the start of the holiday season.
On Thursday, the Census Bureau is scheduled to report retail sales in November. The sales data will indicate whether the Thanksgiving holiday shopping blitz at the end of the month was as strong as many industry estimates predicted it had been. Retail sales rose in October, reflecting a robust economy and high consumer confidence. Michael Corkery
MARKETS
'Quadruple witching' is coming. But don't be scared.
Investors shouldn't fear the so-called quadruple witching on Friday. The third Friday of the final month of every quarter brings the expiration of four types of derivative contracts: stock index futures, stock index options, single-stock futures and single-stock options. (Options give buyers the right to buy or sell stocks at predetermined prices in the future, while futures contracts obligate the buyer to purchase an asset at a set price and date.) Investors are warned that volatility can increase during a quadruple witching as traders adjust their positions. Yet despite the ominous-sounding name, volatility hasn't picked up on such occasions in recent years. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, otherwise known as Wall Street's fear gauge, or VIX, has declined more than half the time on such days since 2015, according to FactSet.

Full text: She has been called "a small lady with a large I.Q." She has been mocked for wearing the same outfit to both her official White House nomination and her confirmation hearing. ("At least we know her mind won't be preoccupied with haute couture," a Washington gossip columnist wrote.) And when President Barack Obama once referred to Janet L. Yellen as "Mr. Yellen," she didn't bother correcting him. Ms. Yellen, the first woman to serve as the head of the Federal Reserve Board, didn't ask to become a feminist icon, and she almost never talks about gender in the abstract or her historic role as the agency's chairman (she bristles at being called "chairwoman"). And yet, during a tenure characterized by a plummeting unemployment rate and consistently low inflation, Ms. Yellen became a pop culture phenomenon.
Last month, President Trump nominated Jerome H. Powell to replace her. The move broke with a long-held tradition of new presidents (even those of opposing parties) extending the terms of the Federal Reserve chairman they have inherited. Ms. Yellen said she would step down from the Fed's board, a position that doesn't expire until 2024, when her four-year term as chairman ends in February. Her impending departure has reminded women of how much it meant to them, to see one of their own making decisions that have reverberated throughout the global economy.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, she is scheduled to preside over the Federal Reserve's last meeting of the year -- and her last major decision as the Fed's leader. The central bank is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate in acknowledgment of the steady decline of the unemployment rate and the general strengthening of the economy.
Despite his unorthodox decision to replace her, even Mr. Trump has agreed that Ms. Yellen has performed well in the job. In the Rose Garden announcing Mr. Powell's nomination, the president called Ms. Yellen an "absolutely spectacular person" and said she had "done a terrific job."
So, why, many women wondered, replace her with a man?
"Janet should've been renominated, as every past Fed chair has been renominated for nearly the last 40 years," Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said in an interview. "But it's not the first time and certainly not the last a highly qualified woman is passed over for a job she clearly deserves."
It's a funny thing Americans have about powerful women. Voters haven't always responded to women who ask for the big jobs (see: Hillary Clinton), but when they see a woman simply doing the job -- and a good one, at that -- they seem happy to give her rock star status.
It's true of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice who has become known to many young women simply as "the Notorious RBG." And it was true of Mrs. Clinton when she was secretary of state, traveling the world and negotiating with world leaders in a scrunchie and glasses while basking in 70 percent approval ratings. (When Mrs. Clinton was asked about her in-the-toilet favorability numbers during the 2016 presidential campaign, she said, "Once I'm doing the job, we'll be back to people viewing me as the person doing the job instead of the person seeking the job.")
To protest Ms. Yellen's departure, liberal activists have worn "Yellen wigs" in support of the economist's signature floppy white bob (as well as her affinity for keeping interest rates low). Supporters describe her in terms more suited to Taylor Swift than a 71-year-old academic shaping monetary policy.
"I'm the biggest Janet fangirl," said Julia Coronado, founder of the economic research firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.
Emily Eisner, a doctoral student a the University of California, Berkeley, and editor of the school's Women in Economics at Berkeley blog, echoed the sentiment, saying, "I don't want to use the word idol, but symbolically, she has meant a lot to me."
Kaivan Shroff, a former campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton, wrote on Twitter, "Janet Yellen is such a BOSS."
Mr. Powell, the incoming chairman, studied closely under Ms. Yellen and is largely expected to continue the economic path she has laid. "They appointed the apprentice instead of the master," Heidi Hartmann, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, said.
The change, Ms. Hartmann added, speaks to the broader problem of a lack of women represented in finance and economic policymaking. "I think men have a fair amount of loyalty to other men, and the other people Trump consulted would've been more open to a man," she said.
The White House shunned any accusations of sexism playing into the decision. "The mere suggestion is an affront to Chair Yellen," the press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.
Described as even-keeled and soft-spoken, but fierce ("People underestimate her at their peril," Ms. Warren said), Ms. Yellen has never inserted herself into the gender wars but by virtue of that "large I.Q.," she has inadvertently found herself in the cross hairs.
The Brooklyn-born Ms. Yellen was the only woman among those earning a Ph.D. in economics at Yale in 1971. For years, she was known in academic circles as "the trailing spouse," overshadowed by her husband, George Akerlof, a Nobel-prize winning economist. The couple has a son, Robert Akerlof, who is also a highly regarded economist.
This trailing spouse, however, went on to be a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a member of the central bank's board of governors. Then, in 2013, 100 years after the Federal Reserve was founded, she made history as its first woman chair.
But history making is often a messy matter. And even with her low profile, Ms. Yellen managed to kick up a central-banking storm.
Mr. Obama's initial choice to steer the nation's shaky economy through the recession had been the economist Lawrence H. Summers, who had served as an adviser. But many Democrats in the Senate, including Ms. Warren, protested the move. They argued that Ms. Yellen, who had worked closely with the outgoing chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was the obvious choice.
Then there was the issue of Mr. Summers, who during his time as president of Harvard had caused controversy and a suitable backlash when he argued that inherent differences between the sexes were a possible reason for the lack of female science professors.
Theories abound that Ms. Yellen has been accepted -- and even beloved -- in a high-powered role because she has not made being a woman a central theme of her career. In contrast to Mrs. Clinton who made gender a significant part of her 2016 candidacy, Ms. Yellen has inserted the issue more subtly.
"You try to make the economy better and reflect priorities of the nation, and there isn't a woman's budget," said Alice M. Rivlin, who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget and as vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board during the Clinton administration. "I felt the same way about the Federal Reserve."
In May, Ms. Yellen delivered a speech at Brown University on the impact of women in the labor force, one of only a handful of times she has directly addressed gender issues.
Women in the workplace have been "hampered by barriers to equal opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life balance," Ms. Yellen said, adding that "if these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy."
Considering her tenure at the Federal Reserve, economists said that having a woman in that role had brought about a more representative approach to monetary policy, even if Ms. Yellen did not emphasize an agenda intended to advance the interests of women. Several academic studies, for example, show that women economists are more likely to address inequality than their male counterparts.
"The economic profession as a whole has a terrible white male problem," Ms. Coronado, said. "Are you even going to ask the right questions if you have a lot of privileged people setting the agenda?"

Full text: I admit it: I use Korean snail slime face serum. It's purported to contain anti-aging properties. I have no opinion as to whether snails are particularly young-looking, but my experience is that their excretions do work on humans. That aside, as someone who grew up among Korean beauty products, I find the world's sudden fascination with Korean skin care, and its now-famous 12-step regimen, to be comical. Dozens of articles in the Western press claim that Korean beauty innovation is 10 years ahead of the rest of the world. So ... in beauty terms, South Korea is in the year 2027?
It gets better: "K-beauty," as it is often called, is not just futuristic; it's ancient as well. According to at least three English-language beauty websites, Korean skin care rituals date back to some purported document from 700 B.C. If Koreans have had a 12-step skin care program for 2,700 years, I'm not sure why they decided to sit on it until the 1990s. But no matter.
In the last six years, Korean cosmetics in the United States have gone from nonexistent to almost mainstream. According to data from Kotra, Korea's trade promotion agency, K-beauty exports to the United States more than doubled from 2014 to 2016. The global cosmetics chain Sephora started carrying K-beauty products in 2011. Other retail chains followed suit, including Urban Outfitters, Ulta and the drugstore chain CVS, all of them touting products with ingredients like chrysanthemum and ginseng. How did Americans come to view South Korea as this beautiful-skinned Eden, when, until a few decades ago, it was impoverished and chokingly polluted?
I lived in Seoul from ages 12 to 18. South Korea was still a developing country when I arrived in 1985, when its inflation-adjusted per capita G.D.P. was about one-fourth of what it is today. Its growing pains showed in the country's dodgy goods.
These days, K-beauty products come in sculptured packaging and smell like an upscale spa. But when I was growing up, Korean skin creams were all the same shade of toilet-paper pink, and they smelled like Glade PlugIns. Any Korean with means used French and American cosmetics (and the Japanese brand Shiseido). No one had ever heard of such a thing as a 12-step regime.
That all changed in the early 1990s. South Korea became wealthy; the quality of everything from cars to CD players improved. Then, in 1998, spurred by the Asian financial crisis, the Korean government altered its economic strategy, branching out from heavy industry and electronics-focused conglomerates into pop culture businesses. Korea was rebranded a "cool" country.
Most of this new "coolness" took the form of mass-produced and exported cinema, television and pop music. But all Korean industries benefited. The popular Korean beauty chains Innisfree and the Face Shop both opened in the early 2000s -- around the same time that we first started hearing about the Korean triple cleanse.
Until very recently, K-beauty's presence in the West was largely a matter of prestige, not money. It was the Asian market that really mattered, especially China. It still does: In 2016, China bought about 38 percent of K-beauty exports and Hong Kong 30 percent, according to Kotra.
But geopolitics may be forcing the K-beauty industry to pivot westward. South Korea has been rethinking the precariousness of an export strategy that is too dependent on China, a country that is not only allied with North Korea, but is also becoming a direct competitor in manufacturing and of late, pop culture and television dramas.
Korean industry got a glimpse of the perils of mixing politics and trade in July 2016, when South Korea announced that it would deploy the American-made Thaad missile defense system. China perceived the move as hostile and threatened sanctions; in March, Chinese tourism in South Korea was down 40 percent from the same month in 2016, resulting in an estimated loss of $6.5 billion in revenue.
South Korea put the Thaad project on hold this June, and the two nations appear to be on better terms now. Still, the backlash gave Korean business a fright and an impetus to seek out new markets. It's no coincidence that South Korea's top boy band, BTS, chose this year to make a splashy American debut, while the Korean bakery chain Paris Baguette announced recently that it was planning to open at least 300 more stores in the United States by 2020.
And K-beauty, too, has moved aggressively. Innisfree, which offers products from the volcanic Korean island of Jeju, opened a Manhattan branch in September. AmorePacific, one of South Korea's oldest beauty companies, plans to open 100 American branches of its retail chain Aritaum, a sort of Korean Sephora, within the next three years.
It's clear what the K-beauty industry wants from the West: a market that isn't fraught with messy geopolitics. But what explains why K-beauty has been embraced in the West with such gusto? Has the old Orientalist belief in ancient Asian beauty secrets struck again? There are certainly echoes of this in the marketing. Sulwhasoo, part of the AmorePacific family, advertises its products as containing "Korean herbal medicine drawn from Asian wisdom."
Or is it because Korean women themselves, with their glowing complexions, are serving as walking advertisements for the power of K-beauty? If so, America, you've been had: ginseng and Jeju volcano water are not the whole story behind that flawless skin.
For the past several years, beauty-obsessed South Korea has been among the world's capitals of cosmetic surgery. Some 20 percent of Korean women have had some form of work done.
Then, there's Botox. Several Korean news outlets this year reported a study finding that 42 percent of Korean women ages 21 to 55 have had either Botox or filler injections.
Many wrinkle creams worldwide contain retinol, a vitamin A derivative that is harmless in small doses but not large ones. Some Korean cosmetics contain concentrations of retinol as high as 3.8 percent -- about twice that of their highest-concentrated American counterparts.
Ancient beauty secrets, or Accutane? Korean doctors prescribe isotretinoin-based acne medicine "indiscriminately," to quote the Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo, despite the risk of serious side effects.
If there are such things as "Korean beauty secrets" they seem to amount to this: Put a lot of time, money and energy into your skin, and you'll probably see results (just don't export too much to China).
But what do I know? I'm the one putting snail slime on my face.

Full text: The Senate and House may spend most of the month ironing out the differences in their tax bills. Or they may be delayed by other legislation and not enact a new tax code until the new year. Either way, high-earning taxpayers cannot afford to wait and see what happens; they need to act this month before certain opportunities go away. And betting on a delay in a final vote is not wise planning: Accountants predict that the new code will take effect on Jan. 1 even if it has to be made retroactive at some point next year.
The two tax bills have differences for sure -- the most obvious being the Senate's seven tax brackets to the House's four. They also have more nuanced discrepancies, like how they treat mortgage interest deductions and small businesses whose owners pay their company's taxes on their own returns.
But even if accountants have not perfected the Excel formulas that will allow them to make exact comparisons, they are already talking to their wealthier clients, particularly those in high-tax states, about what they should do now before deductions go away or are decreased.
For some high earners, lower tax rates could be offset by the end of deductions they have counted on for decades, namely those for state and local taxes, and reduced deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes.
But the higher standard deduction -- at least $24,000 per couple, up from $13,000 -- and the absence or limitation of these other deductions could also lessen the tax benefits of charitable deductions. A more arcane provision in the Senate bill -- regarding blocks of stocks bought at different times -- could make the benefits of harvesting tax losses, a staple of basic financial planning, harder to accomplish.
"The loss of some of the deductions will go a long way toward tax simplification but not necessarily toward tax savings," said Timothy M. Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird, a wealth management firm. "It's going to be easier to figure out how much more you're going to have to pay."
For those who would like to take advantage of tax benefits now, here are strategies they can follow.
Pay property taxes early.
Both the House and Senate bills allow for $10,000 in real estate tax deductions, which is high enough for taxpayers in many states.
Nine counties in the United States with populations of 100,000 or more, however, have an average real estate tax that exceeds that amount, according to an analysis by Attom Data Solutions. No. 1 is Westchester County, outside New York City, at $16,500 a year. The other eight are in New Jersey, New York, Northern California and southern Connecticut.
There are 32 additional counties -- in Illinois, Virginia and Massachusetts -- where the average property tax is $7,000 or more, meaning people who own larger homes in those areas will feel the bite.
Most municipalities set property tax rates in the middle of the year. Homeowners either pay them as part of their mortgage or directly to their town semiannually.
If the latter is the case, advisers say to pay the installment due in early 2018 now. And if the taxes are paid as part of the mortgage payment, they advise checking with the bank to make sure the tax is paid this month and not in January.
Prepay state taxes.
Advisers suggest paying state taxes early, to the extent that is possible, by making an estimated tax payment for what is owed this year. This is something that affects more people, because 41 states tax earned income.
Joseph J. Perry, the tax and business services leader at Marcum, a national accounting firm, said his firm was exploring a novel strategy for clients to prepay New York State tax for the first, second and third quarters of 2018. He said it appeared to be allowed under a mechanism in the state tax code.
But early payment strategies work only if you do not qualify for the alternative minimum tax. Once taxpayers set off the A.M.T., their income is taxed at 28 percent, but they lose these deductions.
High earners with savvy accountants could, however, work the math to accelerate income while qualifying for the A.M.T. this year to pay less in taxes than they might next year, Mr. Perry said.
"If you're at a higher rate next year, you're not going to have that state deduction to bring you down," he said. Therefore, if high earners could receive a bonus this month instead of early next year, they could potentially have that money taxed at the lower rate. (Like all tax strategies, though, this requires running various calculations with an accountant.)
Make large charitable donations.
Calculating the tax value of charitable donations is a little trickier.
The wealthiest will still get a benefit under certain circumstances. For example, if a married couple had a $1 million mortgage with a 4 percent interest rate, it could deduct $40,000 for its mortgage interest plus $10,000 for real estate taxes under the Senate version of the tax bill. This would give the couple $50,000 in deductions, which is above the standard deduction of $24,000, allowing them to claim charitable donations as a deduction.
Under the House proposal, which caps the mortgage that can be used for the deduction at $500,000, they would have $20,000 in mortgage interest and $10,000 for real estate taxes. At $30,000 in deductions, their charitable gifts would still count.
But if that same couple rents instead of owns, it would not have those other deductions to get above the standard amount. So any benefit it gets today from itemizing charitable deductions would be subsumed under the standard deduction.
If the tax math works -- and given that the income tax rates are likely to be higher this year than next year -- people who can make large charitable deductions this year are likely to get more benefit.
Those who do not want to give outright to a charity can make a donation to a donor-advised fund. In doing so, they get the deduction this year but can make the grants to charities later.
Harvest stock losses.
The Senate bill has a seemingly arcane provision that addresses the adequate identification rule, which has to do with selling blocks of stock. As the rule stands, people who bought blocks of stock at different times can choose which blocks to sell or give away for tax purposes.
Under the proposed changes, an investor would have to sell the oldest stock first -- under the premise of first in first out, said Gary M. DuBoff, principal in the tax and accounting department at MBAF, an accounting firm.
The shares with the highest embedded taxes are the ones that people usually donate to charity, but Mr. DuBoff pointed out that this change would have an effect on tax-loss harvesting, a strategy in which an investor sells stocks that have performed poorly to take a capital loss. This still works if someone is selling the entire position, but not if the investor wants to sell more recently purchased blocks, which may have gone down in value while earlier blocks are still up, Mr. DuBoff said.
So this is a good time to make sure your adviser is harvesting losses on blocks within large stock holdings, particularly if earlier blocks have appreciated.
Don't act hastily.
There are risks to acting now without full information. In 2012, Congress and President Barack Obama were locked in a tense debate over tax rates as the United States inched toward what was called the fiscal cliff -- meaning that after Dec. 31, taxes would rise automatically if an agreement was not reached.
As the year was nearing an end, a swath of wealthy taxpayers rushed to make taxable gifts, thinking that Mr. Obama would reduce what had been a generous estate and gift tax exemption of $5 million a person.
Instead, the opposite happened. Mr. Obama and the House speaker, John Boehner, reached an agreement to make that exemption permanent and index it to inflation. That exemption essentially eliminated the estate tax for all but a few Americans, but it was bad news for some people who had made irrevocable gifts solely for tax purposes. Their money was gone before it had to be.
Planners say the risk this year is lower, and they predict that any changes to the bills are going to be on the margins.
"People aren't going to get blindsided here," said Jay Messing, senior director of planning for Wells Fargo Private Bank. "Most itemized deductions are going away. If there's a change and it didn't make sense to donate this year, maybe you just gave money to your favorite charity a little early."
It's smart to act now on some strategies, but others should wait until 2018. Thinking through those will be the focus of next week's column.

Full text: The economy's vital signs are stronger than they have been in years. Companies are posting jobs faster than they can find workers to fill them. Incomes are rising. The stock market sets records seemingly every month. The latest evidence of the revival came Friday, when the Labor Department reported that American employers added 228,000 jobs in November. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent, the lowest since 2000. Job growth has slowed since its peak in 2014 but remains remarkably steady: For the first time on record, employers have added jobs every month for more than seven years -- 86 months, to be precise.
"It's a really, really strong economy," said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm in Chicago. "Companies really want to take advantage of the economy, so they want to hire and get while the getting's good."
That strength could also pose challenges, particularly in light of the $1.5 trillion tax cut that Congress could pass as early as this month. Economists expect the tax bill to provide at least a modest lift to the economy -- but they are not sure that's a good idea.
With unemployment so low and the economy fundamentally healthy, a tax cut could lead the economy to grow too quickly, pushing up inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than planned.
"It's a very poorly timed fiscal stimulus," said Joseph Song, an economist at Bank of America. "It kind of raises the risk of a boom-bust cycle."
For now, however, the figures present a political opportunity for President Trump, who ran for office on a promise to revive the American economy.
Economists almost universally say Mr. Trump has had little to do with the rebound, which began long before he was elected and has not accelerated meaningfully since he took office. But with unemployment low and wages beginning to creep upward, voters may be more inclined to give credit.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Friday that the jobs report was evidence that "President Trump's bold economic vision continues to pay off."
Wherever the credit lies, workers are benefiting from an economy that is delivering broad-based gains in income and employment for the first time in at least a decade. Groups that were left behind in the early stages of the economic recovery, such as African-Americans and people without a college degree, have seen their unemployment rates drop sharply in recent years.
And although wage growth remains disappointing, household income -- which reflects not only hourly pay rates but also how many people have jobs and how many hours they are working -- has shown strong gains, particularly for poorer households.
Companies in nearly every sector are reveling in the best opportunities they have seen in years. Improving global growth is giving a lift to manufacturers, which have added jobs for four straight months. Rising incomes and strong consumer confidence helped retailers, whose payrolls grew at the fastest pace since January despite the shadow of rising online sales. Even the fall hurricanes, which led to a short-lived slowdown in hiring in September, are now helping employment as Texas and Florida rebuild. The construction sector added 24,000 jobs in November.
So as far as the business climate, "maybe it's not quite the best ever, but it's pretty close to the best ever," said Mike Bolen, chief executive of McCarthy Building Companies, a commercial construction company with offices across the country.
"Typically, we'll have one region that's really hot and one region that's really slow, and right now, all five regions are just cooking," he added. "Everything's busy."
Business could get even busier soon. The Republican tax plan aims to encourage business investment by cutting corporate taxes, which could increase demand for the big projects -- hospitals, airports, office building -- that make up a big part of McCarthy's business. In fact, Mr. Bolen said, many clients are already making plans on the assumption that the legislation will pass.
"A lot of people are making decisions this year assuming that it's going to happen," Mr. Bolen said. "If it doesn't happen, I think you'll see some people pull back."
The challenge for McCarthy, as for other builders, is finding the workers for their projects. A couple of years ago, Mr. Bolen said, job seekers would line up outside the gates of construction sites, hoping for a chance to work. Today, McCarthy is having so much trouble finding qualified workers that it is building a 10-acre training center outside of Houston and hiring staff members to teach construction skills.
"It's a really big deal now, probably a bigger deal than I've ever seen it, and I don't see it getting better," Mr. Bolen said. "We are spending a lot of money and effort trying to train up the unskilled portion of our work force."
The question vexing many economists is why, if labor is as scarce as Mr. Bolen and other executives claim, workers are not seeing bigger increases in their paychecks. McCarthy has raised pay, especially for people with specialized skills. But over all, wage growth remains restrained. Average hourly earnings were up 2.5 percent in November from a year earlier, only a bit faster than the rate of inflation.
"It's still just creeping higher," said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. "Wage growth is just not taking off the way we've seen in the past."
That picture could change. Other measures of earnings, for example, show faster growth. And according to an analysis by Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, wages are rising faster in regions where the unemployment rate is lowest. That suggests that pay growth could accelerate if the unemployment rate continues to fall in 2018 as Mr. Shepherdson expects.
Companies are feeling more pressure to raise pay. For the first time in six years, chief executives surveyed by Business Roundtable, a coalition of big corporations, reported that labor expenses were their biggest cost pressure in the fourth quarter.
Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter, said wages would pick up when workers gained the confidence in the economy to demand raises -- and to change jobs if they do not get them. There are signs that could be happening. Nearly 9.5 million workers quit their jobs voluntarily in the third quarter, the most since 2001.
"If people are feeling really confident and comfortable with the labor market, they're going to be more likely to seek that next opportunity," Ms. Barrera said. "When we see that type of confidence, that's when wages will grow."
Rising pay would be good news for workers. But it could cause concern at the Federal Reserve, where policymakers have been gradually raising rates and paring the Fed's bond holdings in a bid to keep inflation in check.
The Fed is all but certain to raise interest rates at its meeting next week, and has signaled plans to do so three times next year as well. But if inflation starts to pick up, the Fed could be forced to act more quickly than it wants, with unpredictable effects on financial markets and the economy.
"You could be looking at a combination in the summer of stronger growth, unemployment at 3.5 percent and still falling, and wage growth picking up as well," Mr. Shepherdson said. "That requires a fairly substantial adjustment to markets."

Full text: Stocks rose Friday following a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, and the strong finish pushed the Standard & Poor's 500 index to its third straight weekly gain despite some weakness earlier in the week. The gains were widespread, and telecom and health care stocks helped lead the way. Overseas markets were also higher after negotiators hit a breakthrough in the United Kingdom's efforts to leave the European Union.
The S&P 500 rose 14.52 points, or 0.6 percent, to finish at 2,651.50, another record. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 117.68, or 0.5 percent, to 24,329.16, and the Nasdaq composite rose 27.24, or 0.4 percent, to 6,840.08.
The U.S. jobs report, which is the economic highlight of each month, showed that employers added 228,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate remained at a low 4.1 percent. It's the latest evidence that the U.S. economy continues to improve, in sync with the rest of the world.
Paychecks, though, have not been getting much bigger, and hourly wages rose less last month than economists expected. Higher pay would help workers spend more, but it could also lead to higher inflation.
"The way risk markets are looking at it is it's very much a Goldilocks environment: still muted or low inflation and very positive growth," said Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management.
She said that it's encouraging that an area of strength in the job market is the manufacturing industry. It's an indication that companies are spending more on equipment and other things to grow, something that economists had been waiting years to see.
The jobs report is the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Reserve meets next week to discuss interest rate policy. Most economists expect it to approve the third increase in short-term rates for the year.
Biotechnology stocks helped lead the market, and health care stocks in the S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent for one of the biggest gains of the 11 sectors that make up the index.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals jumped $7.68, or 7.2 percent, to $114.46 for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 following a report from The New York Times that an activist hedge fund has bought shares in the company and pushed it to do more to lift its stock price.
Technology stocks in the S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent. The industry has been the market's biggest winner this year, but it had stumbled recently as investors moved out of tech stocks and into companies seen as benefiting more from Washington's push to overhaul the tax code, such as financial companies and retailers. The pullback was short-lived, and tech stocks erased their losses for the week.
Another potential source of worry for investors dissipated after Congress passed a spending bill that will prevent a government shutdown this weekend. The deal keeps the government running only until Dec. 22, though, when another deadline looms.
Stock markets in Europe climbed after negotiators reached a key agreement that allows talks to continue to the next stage for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Investors are hoping for a smooth exit that does not disrupt global trade.
In Germany, meanwhile, political parties agreed to open talks that could renew Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing coalition. That helped Germany's DAX index gain 0.8 percent. The FTSE 100 in London rose 1 percent, and France's CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.4 percent, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1.2 percent and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.1 percent.
The price of oil continued to recover from its sharp loss in the middle of the week. Benchmark U.S. crude gained 67 cents to settle at $57.36 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $1.20 to $63.40 per barrel. That helped energy stocks in the S&P 500 rise 0.9 percent.
Natural gas added a penny to $2.77 per 1,000 cubic feet, heating oil gained 3 cents to $1.93 per gallon and wholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.72 per gallon.
Gold slipped $4.70 to settle at $1,248.40 per ounce, silver rose 2 cents to $15.82 per ounce and copper added a penny to $2.98 per pound.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.37 percent.
The dollar ticked up to 113.51 Japanese yen from 113.13 yen late Thursday. The euro dipped to $1.1768 from $1.1774, and the British pound slipped to $1.3398 from $1.3465.

Full text: John B. Anderson, a former Republican congressman from Illinois who bolted his party to run as a plain-spoken independent candidate for president in 1980, drawing an enthusiastic if transient following among liberals and college students, died on Sunday night in Washington. He was 95. His death was confirmed by his daughter Diane Anderson.
The United States was struggling with a recession, a severe energy crisis and the protracted Iranian hostage crisis when Mr. Anderson gave up a safe seat in the House of Representatives to seek the Republican presidential nomination. When that try fizzled, he reintroduced himself as an independent, honest-dealing alternative to the rancorous business-as-usual politics of the major parties.
For a while he had the national spotlight, a 58-year-old maverick whose white hair, horn-rimmed glasses and clearheaded presentation gave him the air of a genial professor who was not so much above the fray as he was unwilling to play by its rules.
Mr. Anderson refused to pander, telling voters in Iowa that he favored President Jimmy Carter's embargo on grain sales to the Soviet Union after it had invaded Afghanistan. He called for a gasoline tax of 50 cents per gallon -- when a gallon cost $1.15 -- to save energy.
Early on, when all six of his rivals for the Republican nomination assured the Gun Owners of New Hampshire that they firmly opposed gun control legislation, Mr. Anderson said, "I don't understand why."
"When in this country we license people to drive automobiles," he added, "what is so wrong about proposing that we license guns to make sure that felons and mental incompetents don't get ahold of them?"
He was roundly booed.
His backers promoted his campaign style as "the Anderson difference," but despite it -- or perhaps because of it -- he never finished better than second in a Republican primary. That came in Illinois, his home state, which he had expected to win. When he did not, losing to Ronald Reagan by fewer than 12 points (Mr. Reagan was born in Illinois), he decided to run as an independent.
Drawing support from moderate to liberal Republicans and liberal Democrats and finding a receptive audience on college campuses, Mr. Anderson did well in the polls at the start. At one point, upward of one-fifth of voters said they preferred him to the major party nominees, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Carter, the Democrat, who was seeking re-election. Mr. Anderson peaked in June, when he was the choice of 24 percent of respondents in a Gallup poll, 25 percent in a Harris/ABC poll and 18 percent in a New York Times/CBS News poll.
His hopes were sustained by the volatility of the 1980 campaign, with its sudden swings of popularity. Mr. Carter's Democratic challenger, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, led by large margins in early polls, only to see the president recover and defeat him soundly in the primaries.
Mr. Reagan, the early Republican favorite, spent money lavishly, but lost to George Bush in the Iowa caucuses and trailed in national polls before a solid win in New Hampshire put him back on the road to the nomination. Mr. Anderson said he believed that the tide might turn in his favor in "the climactic phase of the campaign."
So he pushed on, calling Mr. Carter a "mean and evasive" campaigner who used a recession and high unemployment to fight inflation, and criticizing Mr. Reagan's campaign "one-liners," calling them "slick and simplistic."
But in a pattern familiar to independent candidates, Mr. Anderson's support drifted as voters turned to candidates who they believed could actually win the White House. On Election Day, when Mr. Reagan won in a landslide, Mr. Anderson ended up with 6.6 percent of the popular vote.
Evolving to Moderate
Mr. Anderson was perceived as the most liberal of the three contenders. That label probably fit on social issues like abortion, but his economic views were traditionally conservative. He preferred to think of himself as the moderate in the race -- a self-description that reflected a marked political evolution.
In his first three years in the House, starting in 1961, Mr. Anderson, a former prosecutor and a decorated World War II veteran, received a zero rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action. Not long after entering the Capitol, he proposed a constitutional amendment declaring that "this nation devoutly recognizes the authority and law of Jesus Christ, Savior and Ruler of nations."
The measure never came to a vote, and he later apologized for it.
Though his views began to moderate, he was still conservative enough in 1969 for the Republicans to elect him chairman of the House Republican Conference, the third-ranking leadership position. He held the post through 1979, though not without fighting off challenges from the right. By then, the A.D.A. had put his voting record in the mid-40s, and he had harshly criticized President Richard M. Nixon, a fellow Republican, over his handling of the Watergate scandal. His own critics called Mr. Anderson self-righteous and preachy.
Mr. Anderson was an effective orator in the days when speeches on the House floor could still change votes. He was a leader in the passage of open housing legislation in 1968 and in setting campaign contribution limits in 1974, and he worked with his Democratic friend, Morris K. Udall of Arizona, to create 10 national parks in Alaska, protecting 100 million acres.
But he grew increasingly impatient not only with the House but also with the growing strength of the right wing of his own party.
"Extremist fringe elements," he complained in 1977, "seek to expel the rest of us from the G.O.P." He warned, "If the purists stage their ideological coup d'Ã©tat, our party will be consigned to the historical junk heap."
The right returned the compliment with a strong Republican primary campaign against him in his 1978 House race. With the help of Democratic crossover votes, Mr. Anderson won with 58 percent over the insurgent, Don Lyon, a conservative minister. But he resented the challenge, and his thoughts turned to the White House.
It was always a long-shot campaign. No elected official, not even his friends in the House, endorsed him. His Republican campaign, announced in June 1979, drew little support as Mr. Bush emerged as the only viable alternative to Mr. Reagan (who wound up choosing Mr. Bush as his running mate).
For his independent run, announced in April 1980, Mr. Anderson had to spend millions to get on the ballot in all 50 states as the National Unity Party candidate, leaving little cash for television advertising. (His running mate was Patrick J. Lucey, a former Democratic governor of Wisconsin.) And when Mr. Carter refused to join him in a September debate sponsored by the League of Women Voters -- the president, it was said, did not want to be perceived as taking Mr. Anderson's candidacy seriously -- Mr. Anderson's last and best chance of making an impact was snuffed out.
The debate went ahead without the president, but Mr. Reagan gained more from it than Mr. Anderson did. When Mr. Anderson's poll standing slipped below 15 percent, the league did not invite him back for an October debate, the only one between Mr. Carter and Mr. Reagan, for whom it was a turning point.

But Mr. Anderson never considered dropping out.
"We had operated from the very beginning with the assumption that it was a given that Jimmy Carter could not be re-elected," Mr. Anderson told a conference at the Institute of Politics at Harvard weeks after the election. His hope, he added, was that with the collapse of the Carter campaign, he could emerge "as a rational and reasonable alternative to Ronald Reagan."
To the frequent accusation that he had been a spoiler in the race, he replied: "What's to spoil? Spoil the chances of two men at least half the country doesn't want?"
Immigrants' Son
John Bayard Anderson was born on Feb. 15, 1922, in Rockford, Ill., a son of Swedish immigrants, E. Albin Anderson and the former Mabel Edna Ring. As a boy he worked in the family's grocery store and was the valedictorian of his class at Rockford Central High School.
He earned bachelor's and law degrees at the University of Illinois and a master of laws at Harvard. In World War II he earned four battle stars as a staff sergeant in the field artillery in Europe and later worked in the Foreign Service in Berlin and Washington, where he met Keke Machakos, a passport photographer. They married in 1953. Returning to Illinois, he was elected state's attorney for Winnebago County in 1956.
In addition to his daughter Diane, he is survived by his wife; three other daughters, Eleanora Van der Wal, Karen Moree and Susan Anderson; a son, John Jr.; and 11 grandchildren.
He left Congress so he could seek the presidency in 1980, then considered another presidential run in 1984 but ended up supporting Mr. Reagan's Democratic challenger, Walter F. Mondale, the former vice president. He backed Ralph Nader's third-party run in 2000 and disapproved of the Tea Party movement, telling The New Yorker in 2010, "I break out in a cold sweat at the thought that any of those people might prevail."
Mr. Anderson had homes in Rockford as well as in Washington, where he practiced intellectual property law, and in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he taught law for many years at Nova Southeastern University. He served as president of the World Federalist Association, which promotes international cooperation, and chairman of FairVote, a nonprofit group that favors ranked-choice voting.
Mr. Anderson was the author of "Between Two Worlds: A Congressman's Choice" (1970); "The American Economy We Need" (1984) and "A Proper Institution: Guaranteeing Televised Presidential Debates" (1988).
The most enduring impact of his 1980 independent campaign came in the courts, where his victories enabled later third-party candidates like H. Ross Perot and Mr. Nader to get on the ballot. Most important was a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in 1983 that threw out Ohio's filing deadline of March 20 for independent candidates. (Mr. Anderson had not decided to run as an independent that early in 1980, but got on the ballot when a Federal District Court ordered Ohio to let him run.)
Ohio defended its deadline as a way to maintain "political stability." But the Supreme Court accepted Mr. Anderson's argument that states could not impose substantially more onerous burdens on independent candidates than on major party nominees.
Though Mr. Anderson's candidacy had little impact on the outcome of the 1980 election, his campaign was memorable for its candor. Appearing in Des Moines with six rivals for the Republican nomination, Mr. Anderson was alone among them in saying something specific when asked if there was anything in his career he would take back if he could.
"It would have been the vote that I cast in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution," he said, referring to the 1964 congressional measure that gave President Lyndon B. Johnson license to widen the war against North Vietnam.
He was equally forthright in defending his call for an emergency excise tax on gasoline, unpopular though it might have been.
"I did it as a security measure, to be sure," he told the September 1980 debate audience, "because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf."

Cheering On President, Investors Push the Markets to New Heights

Full text: One of the longest stock-market booms in history continued its gravity-defying ascent Thursday, with investors cheering the prospect of deep corporate tax cuts and the rollback of government regulations under President Trump. The Dow Jones industrial average eclipsed yet another milestone, closing Thursday above 24,000 for the first time. And the Standard & Poor's 500 index logged its 13th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history.
Stock markets have been going up, more or less without interruption, since March 2009, the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis. This eight-and-a-half-year bull market is now the second-longest in history, behind only the rally that lasted from 1987 until 2000.
Investors are embracing Mr. Trump's pro-corporate presidency, marked by the promise of lower taxes, the installation of former industry executives in key government agencies, and the repeal or relaxation of rules and regulations that have made it hard for some big businesses to expand without fear of interference from Washington.
Indeed, the view is taking hold that Mr. Trump, in so aggressively promoting policies aimed to stoke the economy and financial markets, has unleashed animal spirits -- largely absent under President Barack Obama -- that are now reflected in ever rising consumer confidence indicators and a willingness to embrace risk in the stock market.
"It comes down to psychology, and the psychology today is that everything is awesome," said Charlie Bilello, a stock market historian at Pension Partners. "Jobs have grown for 85 straight months, you have growth in corporate earnings, and you have tax cuts."
This week's rally was sparked by a smattering of good news. Strong economic signals showed consumer confidence at a nearly 17-year high. Retailers posted promising results as the holiday shopping season kicked into gear. And it wasn't just the Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500 was up 0.82 percent on Thursday and closed at 2,647.58. The Nasdaq composite finished up 0.80 percent.
More than anything, enthusiasm about life being more pleasant for corporate America is propelling stocks. This week, investors were thrilled by the signs that a normally dysfunctional Washington is coalescing around a tax-cut package that would go straight to the bottom line of businesses and their owners.
Of course, there is no guarantee the tax-cut package will become law. That is a potential tripwire for markets.
"If the tax reform doesn't get done, I think there will be a pretty sharp correction," said Bruce Van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, one of the largest banking companies in the northeastern United States.
Mr. Van Saun said stock markets could plunge as much as 15 percent if the tax cut was derailed in Congress. "I think it's quite pivotal right now," he said. "The businessperson has an expectation that this will get done."
In a year of stock market records, hitting the 24,000 mark is not the most historic. This was the fifth 1,000-point milestone for the Dow this year; it first hit 20,000 on Jan. 25. The latest large round number -- surpassed after the Dow jumped 1.3 percent Thursday -- arrived barely a month after the previous landmark.
These milestones, of course, are arbitrary. Passing a round number in a particular index isn't itself significant.
But the ease with which the barrier was cleared highlights the extent to which investors are willing to look past geopolitical uncertainty and pricey stock valuations and bet that the market will keep going up.
"People are assuming this is normal -- but it is not," Mr. Bilello said. "The relationship between risk and reward has broken down."
Is this a bubble that's about to pop? Investment experts are divided.
Skeptics point to the fact that many stocks, especially in the technology sector, are at historically high levels. Investors, they note, are relying on debt to amplify their returns. And a tulip-style mania has sent the price of the digital currency Bitcoin soaring.
But even more investors are bullish. Sure, valuations are high, but in contrast to 2000, when Silicon Valley was littered with companies without business models, today's tech behemoths -- including Facebook and Amazon -- are fundamentally sound. And a round of tax cuts could further fatten corporate profits. As for Bitcoin, if it crashes there is no direct reason it should necessarily drag down stocks.
Market participants say one of the distinguishing features of this long run is its ability to keep climbing a so-called wall of worry. Investors have suffered numerous frights, such as Britain's voting to leave the European Union, geopolitical fears in North Korea and political turmoil in Washington, but they have jumped back into the market after each stumble.
Ed Yardeni, an independent stock market strategist, has identified 58 of these small market panics since 2009. This year, he has not seen a single one.
"This is starting to feel like a melt-up," Mr. Yardeni said, describing a feverish state of a bull market when investors discard all fears. "The market has climbed a wall of worry, but now it seems as if there is nothing to worry about."
That, Mr. Yardeni said, is itself something to worry about, because investors are throwing caution to the wind.
According to Mr. Bilello, the stock analyst, a typical year will include three or four stock market corrections. In 2017, there have been none. The worst swoon this year was a 3.3 percent fall between March 2 and April 19.
Such a relentless -- and smooth -- rise in stocks is very unusual.
Several unprecedented factors might be helping the rally, analysts say. For the first time ever, an American president is actively promoting a stock market surge. Mr. Trump has tweeted often about the stock market, including eight times this week alone.
A president's boasting about the market doesn't mean it should keep going up. But at these high levels, psychology becomes a critical factor that can move stocks higher.
That could mean your brother-in-law praising his portfolio at a cocktail party -- or the president of the United States speaking more broadly to his 43 million followers on Twitter.
It doesn't hurt that there has never been a time when the global economy has been growing so strongly while central banks kept interest rates so low.
Traditionally, bull markets come to an end when, after a sustained period of growth, inflation forces central banks to raise rates.
Now, with inflation stagnant and the lingering anxieties of the 2008 financial crisis fading, investors are not ready to contemplate the end of the party.
For example, the latest missile scare from North Korea, after so many previous flare-ups, barely caused investors to bat an eyelid.
"I used to call my clients fully invested bears," said Mr. Yardeni, the investment strategist. "Now they are giddy bulls -- how could they not be?"

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump urged senators this month to repeal the Affordable Care Act's requirement that most Americans have health insurance and use the proceeds to slash the top tax rate paid by the richest Americans, a suggestion that pitted his priorities against his daughter and Republican senators intent on helping the middle class. In the end, the president accepted only a partial victory. He got the repeal of the health law's individual mandate, but gave up on an income tax rate cut that would have directly benefited him personally. Instead, Ivanka Trump and her allies in the Senate prevailed in their push to include an expanded child tax credit.
"This was certainly an uphill battle, especially given that it is not an issue that is as widely understood," said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a leading advocate of the expanded child tax credit. "We didn't necessarily have the sense that the president was opposed to it. I still don't have that sense. I think if he had been, things would have worked out differently than they did."
Two White House officials pushed back against the notion that Ms. Trump had split with her father. They said middle-income tax relief was one of the president's priorities and that Ms. Trump worked in lock step with the administration on all aspects of tax reform.
But the fight is actually continuing. Later this week, Mr. Lee and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, will take on another top priority of the president's, cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The senators plan to offer an amendment that would cut the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, instead of 20 percent, and use the proceeds to help families with little or no income tax liabilities benefit from the expanded child credit and to allow the child credit to rise with inflation.
A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, wasted no time declaring the president's opposition on Wednesday.
Mr. Trump was not secretive about his desire for a lower income tax rate for the nation's wealthiest families. This month, he tweeted his desire:
But his suggestion that the top rate come down clashed directly with the push to assist the middle class. The president had also pressed to eliminate the estate tax, a provision that would have hugely benefited his heirs.
Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee did vote unanimously to add the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate to their bill, effectively giving themselves more than $300 billion to spend on additional tax cuts. Then lawmakers went to work to devote that money to priorities other than lowering the top income tax rate or cutting the estate tax.
Senators Lee and Rubio enlisted Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, who talks frequently with Ms. Trump, and Senator Dean Heller of Nevada to push the child credit expansion in the Finance Committee.
"It seemed to me to be common sense if our goal was to deliver as much of a tax break for the middle class on down," Mr. Scott said.
The victory somewhat improved the optics of a bill that most opinion polls suggest is unpopular among a majority of the American public. By expanding the credit to $2,000 per child from $1,650, as initially proposed in the Senate bill, Republicans substantially reduced the number of middle-class families who are likely to face an immediate tax increase under the bill.
The higher child tax credit in the Senate tax plan avoids tax increases for 3.5 million families, compared to the less generous credit increase in the House plan. (Because that credit and all other individual tax breaks in the bill are scheduled to expire in 2025 to satisfy Senate procedural rules, all middle-class families face a looming tax hike in 2026 if a future Congress does not intervene.)
Republicans have drawn criticism in the House and the Senate for pitching their tax plans as benefiting the middle class, only to see analysts conclude that, because they eliminate some tax breaks while lowering rates, many working families would actually see their taxes go up. Early analyses suggested that roughly a quarter of middle-class families could see their taxes rise in a year if the initial Senate bill became law, compared to about half of families under the House bill.
Senate Republicans worried about those distributional effects, Mr. Scott said. By expanding the credit and also allowing taxpayers of higher incomes to claim it, he added, "That combination solved the problem for a lot of people."
Democrats have criticized the decision to include mandate repeal in the tax bill. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will lead to 13 million fewer Americans choosing to buy health insurance or sign up for government-provided insurance such as Medicaid, and its analysis finds the move will, on balance, reduce incomes for workers earning $30,000 and below, because they will receive fewer government benefits and subsidies for care.
The Republican bill is "a plan to take health care away from people," Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, said in a Facebook town hall meeting on Tuesday night. He offered partial praise, though, for the expanded child credit. "If that were done the right way," he said, "it really would help working families a lot. As the provision is now drafted, it does too much for people like senators, frankly, and families in high-income categories, and not enough for working families."
Republicans say mandate repeal, which is politically popular, gives consumers the freedom to choose whether they buy coverage without fear of government penalty. They say the budget office is wrong to score benefits that consumers willingly forgo as lost income.
But they are happy to accept the analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation that the move will free up more than $300 billion -- through reduced government spending -- that can be used to offset tax reductions in the bill.
That money gave an opening to Mr. Lee, Mr. Rubio and Ms. Trump, who had worked together for months laying the groundwork for the child credit expansion. The group was disappointed in the House version of the tax bill and the initial Senate bill, which expanded the credit from $1,000 today, but counteracted that expansion with other lost tax breaks for families.
"The nominal expansion in the original bill was quite arguably completely eaten up by other changes," Mr. Lee said.
Neither Mr. Scott nor Mr. Lee would characterize their conversations with the president during that negotiating period, but Mr. Lee said there were several competing ideas for how to allocate the $300 billion.
Had Mr. Trump's request for a 35 percent top rate been granted in full, Republicans would have delivered even larger benefits to high earners, whom the joint committee judges already to be the largest recipients of tax cuts under the plan. Mr. Trump would have likely seen his tax bill shrink considerably.
White House officials say the president was pleased simply to see the mandate repeal included. And while Mr. Lee is still pushing for a further expansion of the child credit -- one that would allow more low-income families with little or no income tax liabilities to benefit from it -- he called the overall bill "a step in the right direction."
He, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Scott and Mr. Heller are all expected to vote for it on the Senate floor.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- At a Wednesday afternoon rally in Missouri, President Trump played up what he called the "biggest tax cuts in history" and boasted about economic growth "in a nonbraggadocious way." "In fact, they're going to say Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator," he said of his rosy projections, in a speech full of exaggerations and falsehoods. Here's an assessment.
He is wrong that "for years, they haven't been able to get tax cuts, many, many years since Reagan."
President Ronald Reagan, who enacted a major tax cut in 1981 and lowered tax rates again in 1986, was hardly the last president to have done so. President Bill Clinton signed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. President George W. Bush enacted two major tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. The stimulus passed under President Barack Obama included hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, and Mr. Obama later extended the Bush tax cuts with the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012.
He inaccurately suggested the plan wouldn't help the wealthy.
Mr. Trump insisted that the tax bill is "not good for me" or the wealthy. Referring to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, the president said: "I keep hearing Schumer, 'This is for the wealthy!' If it is, my friends don't know about it."
That is not supported by most analyses of the tax plans being considered in Congress.
Under the Senate plan, every income level would receive a tax cut in 2019, but people earning $20,000 to $30,000 annually would face a tax increase the next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. By 2027, most people making under $75,000 each year would see a tax increase, while those making more would continue to receive a tax cut.
Under the House plan, every income group would see tax cuts through 2027, but the richest one-fifth of Americans would receive 56 percent to almost 75 percent of the cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center.
Based on his 2005 tax return, Mr. Trump himself could save more than $1.1 billion under the White House tax framework, according to an analysis by The New York Times, and the same amount under the House plan, a tax expert at Marcum L.L.P. told NBC.
He falsely called the current plan the "biggest tax cut in the history of our country, bigger than Reagan."
Mr. Trump has repeated this claim at least a dozen times since October, but it has not been true of any of the tax plans released in Congress or outlined by his administration.
A 2013 Treasury Department report assessed the size of major tax bills either as a percentage of the economy, by the reduction in federal revenue or in inflation-adjusted dollars. The 1981 Reagan tax cut is the largest under the first two metrics. It was equivalent to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product and reduced federal revenue by 13.3 percent. The 2012 Obama tax cut amounted to the largest cut in inflation-adjusted dollars: $321 billion a year.
For Mr. Trump's tax cut to exceed the Reagan cuts as a share of G.D.P., the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it would need to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years. To have a larger effect on revenue, it would need to cost $5.7 trillion. No version of the current tax cut plan meets those benchmarks.
The budget blueprint that Republicans released in mid-October, the bill passed in the House in November and the bill currently being considered in the Senate all amount to a tax cut of about $1.5 trillion over 10 years. This would place as the 12th-largest as a share of the economy.
He falsely suggested that the stock market was previously flat.
Mr. Trump spoke of tepid growth before he took office. "In all fairness, the stock market was going this way," he added, drawing a flat line with his hand. The stock market has hit record highs under Mr. Trump, but the uptick began after the financial crisis in 2008.
The link he drew between market performance and G.D.P. growth also contradicts his own comments. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the economy was "doing terribly" at 1.2 percent G.D.P. growth, which occurred in the first quarter of this year. But during that quarter, he jubilantly posted on Twitter about the stock market's "longest winning streak in decades."
He exaggerated when he said a 3.3 percent growth was the "largest increase in many years."
The Commerce Department adjusted its estimate of G.D.P. growth to 3.3 percent in the third quarter of 2017 from a previous estimate of 3 percent. This is the largest increase in about three years, according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The economy grew at 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 and at 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014, and the increase was larger than 3.3 percent in five other quarters under Mr. Obama.

The Rush to a Bad Bill

Full text: As more senators show signs of sacrificing their principles and embracing the Republican tax bill for minor and nebulous concessions, it bears looking more closely at the process that produced this terrible legislation and some of its lesser-known provisions. The Senate tax bill, a 515-page mammoth, was introduced just last week, and the chamber could vote on it as soon as Thursday. This is not how lawmakers are supposed to pass enormous pieces of legislation. It took several years to put together the last serious tax bill, passed in 1986. Congress and the Reagan administration worked across party lines, produced numerous drafts, held many hearings and struck countless compromises. This time it's not about true reform but about speed and bowling over the opposition in hopes of claiming a partisan victory. The country ought to be dismayed by the way senators like Bob Corker, Susan Collins and Ron Johnson appear to be backing away from their principled objections based on half-measures promised by President Trump and the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that will not address its big flaws.
This rush to the Senate floor has been orchestrated by Mr. McConnell, following the same playbook he used in the failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The longer people have to study the details, the less likely the bill is to pass. People should know by now about the big stuff: the giant permanent corporate tax-rate cut, the small and temporary tax cuts for the middle class, the repeal of the A.C.A.'s individual mandate and the $1.4 trillion added to the federal deficit over 10 years. But other provisions are not as well understood and deserve to be called out. Here are three.
PICKPOCKETING THE MIDDLE CLASS: Like the House tax bill, the Senate measure would change how the government adjusts tax brackets and other tax provisions for inflation, replacing the Consumer Price Index with the Chained Consumer Price Index, which tends to increase at a slower rate. While most taxpayers would not notice an immediate impact, the effects would compound over time as more low- and middle-income families are pushed into higher tax brackets, and as working families receive less help through benefits like the earned-income tax credit.
Over the next decade, changing the inflation measure would mean that families would lose $134 billion by paying more in taxes and receiving fewer benefits than they would under current law, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. The increase will be even bigger in future years: $31.5 billion in 2027 alone.
HIDDEN GOODIES FOR BUSINESS: While families would be hit with tax increases, corporations stand to reap even bigger tax cuts under certain conditions. That is because the bill contains a tax-cut provision that would automatically kick in if the government took in more money than its accountants are projecting right now. Businesses could pocket an extra $79 billion in 2027 because of that measure, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Proponents of the tax cut might argue that the government should give back money if it collects more than it expected. But there's still going to be a gigantic deficit, and -- surprise, surprise -- there are no similar givebacks for individuals.
A BREAK FOR BOOZE: The Senate bill contains a special tax cut for makers of beer, wine and spirits, for no particular reason. (Perhaps it's because these companies are doing their patriotic duty of keeping Americans in good cheer.) It would reduce levies on beer, wine and liquor produced in or imported into the country, and, while described as a boon for "craft beverage," it would benefit the entire industry, saving it about $4.2 billion over 10 years. This is particularly galling because taxes on alcohol have not increased since 1991 and are calculated without an inflation adjustment, which means they have already shrunk substantially over time.
These policy changes, smuggled into the bill to please big Republican donors, would never survive a more transparent process. History will remember them for what they are: smaller scams aimed at winning support for a much bigger one.

'Rocket Fuel' Plan for an Economy That Is Already Moving Fast

Full text: ST. CHARLES, Mo. -- President Trump rallied support on Wednesday for his tax plan in a Missouri county where the unemployment rate is 2.7 percent, a fitting backdrop for a speech in which he bragged about the health of the economy while contending that a major tax cut was crucial to economic growth. Republicans have juggled those twin claims in pitching their tax bill, which was introduced at the beginning of November and remains on course to reach Mr. Trump's desk next month. They insist that the plan will deliver an immediate stimulus and encourage long-term investment.
"These massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel" for the American economy, particularly for small businesses on Main Street, Mr. Trump said in a speech here.
But some economists question whether rocket fuel is needed at this point in the economic recovery and say that too much stimulus could ultimately backfire.
The economy is strengthening and unemployment is at its lowest point in 16 years. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, above the maximum sustainable level of output estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Trump played up that report in a long riff, saying that the growth rate would have been "4 percent, maybe over 4 percent" if not for late summer hurricanes. "We are hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time" in office, he said, adding, "This is all done without the tax cuts."
The entire developed world is enjoying a simultaneous economic expansion for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, and the Fed and other economic forecasters see few obstacles to continued growth on the horizon.
"I'm not in favor of tax stimulus at the current time because the economy doesn't really need it," William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Monday.
The dispute about the economic effect of the tax plan is playing out at high speed because Republicans are rushing to pass the plan without the rounds of hearings and competing economic analyses that have shaped past efforts to substantially overhaul the federal tax code.
Cutting taxes is likely to bolster short-term economic growth by encouraging more spending. But officials at the Federal Reserve have warned that the American economy is already growing around the maximum sustainable pace, meaning that faster growth is likely to cause higher inflation. The Fed could seek to dampen that effect by moving to raise interest rates more quickly.
"Economic growth appears to have stepped up from its subdued pace early in the year," Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, told Congress's Joint Economic Committee on Wednesday.
"We welcome strong growth," she said, adding, "We're worried about trends that could push inflation above our 2 percent objective."
Those concerns are shared by independent economists. Inflation has remained sluggish since the financial crisis; this is the sixth straight year that inflation is likely to run below 2 percent. But some economists see evidence that the pace of price increases is already strengthening.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was already rising fast in metropolitan areas with low unemployment. Mr. Shepherdson has revised his forecasts upward for next year, in part because of accelerating business investment. That, in addition to a tax cut, would be "like a double boost for an economy that doesn't need a single boost," he said.
Charles Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, said Monday that the Fed might need to raise interest rates more quickly even if growth did not accelerate. Some economists argue larger federal deficits can increase inflation. If tax cuts did increase inflation, or increased expectations of inflation, Mr. Evans said he would favor raising interest rates more quickly in response.
Proponents of the tax plan contend that it will also increase the nation's economic capacity. They say that cutting corporate taxes, in particular, will encourage more investment. That will raise productivity, resulting in faster economic growth without increased inflation.
The direct benefits of the tax cuts would mostly accrue to the wealthiest Americans, but Republicans say that increased investment will ultimately raise wages, too. Wage growth has remained sluggish in recent years even as the unemployment rate has declined.
Some economic forecasters have increased their estimates for economic growth next year, both as a result of underlying improvement in the economy and in anticipation of a significant tax cut.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it expected the American economy to grow 2.5 percent next year, up from a forecast of 2.4 percent six months ago.
The potential pace of economic growth -- the effective speed limit for the American economy -- is determined by two factors: the expansion of the work force and the productivity of the average worker. Both have grown slowly in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue.
The government projected in October that the labor force would grow at an annual rate of 0.6 percent over the next decade. That is about half the pace of annual growth from 1996 to 2006, when the supply of workers expanded an average of 1.3 percent each year.
The slower growth of the work force reflects the aging of the population as the baby boom generation moves into retirement. The youngest members of that generation will be 62 by 2026. It also reflects the reduced volume of immigration. The number of people moving to the United States has declined in recent years, and the Trump administration is working to further reduce the volume of both legal and illegal immigration to the United States.
The reasons for the slow growth of productivity are less clear.
The productivity of the American economy -- basically, the value of a given amount of work -- increased at an annual rate of 0.4 percent from 2007 to 2016. That was about half the 0.9 percent pace of annual growth over the previous three decades.
And the problem is becoming worse. Productivity last year fell 0.2 percent.
Some Republicans, including Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, contend that economic growth is already increasing partly in anticipation of a tax cut, and that failing to pass legislation would send stocks tumbling and curtail growth.
It is a matter of basic logic that lower taxes should encourage corporate investment by increasing the profitability of those investments. But studies generally find the benefits are modest, and corporate executives often discount the importance of tax rates in their decision-making.
When Gary D. Cohn, President Trump's chief economic adviser, recently asked a gathering of chief executives to raise their hands if the proposed tax cuts would affect their investment plans, only a few raised their hands. "Why aren't the other hands up?" Mr. Cohn asked.
Another question is whether higher interest rates might offset the benefits of a tax cut. Critics of the Republican plan argue it would increase the federal debt, which would drive up rates as the government competes with private borrowers for the money it needs to fund its operations.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2014 that every dollar of increased federal borrowing reduced private sector investment by about 15 to 50 cents.
Proponents of the plan argue that those effects are greatly overstated. They say that the government will be able to borrow the money it needs in global markets without driving up rates.

Full text: The tax bill being debated in the Senate this week would affect nearly every American. Numerous analyses have estimated the average impact of the bill on household finances, and advocates on both sides have produced examples of "typical" families that would win or lose under the plan. Such analyses, however, tend to gloss over the remarkable diversity of Americans' financial situations. In truth, there is no "typical" American household. Even families that look similar on the surface can differ in ways that radically alter their situation come tax season.
The 25,000 dots on these charts each represent an American household in the broadly defined middle class. The vertical axis represents income; the horizontal axis represents how big a tax cut (or tax increase) each household would get under the bill in 2018, according to a New York Times analysis using the open-source tax-modeling program TaxBrain.
A couple of things should jump out right away. First, there are more dots on the right side of the chart than the left -- more households would get a tax cut than a tax increase. (The chart represents the impact in 2018; the situation looks considerably different in 2027, after many provisions of the bill are set to expire.)
Second, the dots are all over the place. Look at the line of households earning about $100,000 a year. On the far left of the chart, there's a household that would pay more than $4,000 more in taxes under the Senate plan. On the far right is a household that earns almost the same amount but that would pay $4,000 less under the plan. (All figures are relative to what each household would pay under existing tax law.)
If you want to understand the tax bill, it helps to understand what factors separate those two families, and all the other families in between.
Take these findings with a grain of salt: The tax bill remains a work in progress, and some details aren't yet clear. Our analysis doesn't try to account for the impact the bill would have on the economy, for good or ill. (In tax-wonk terms, ours is a "static" analysis rather than a "dynamic" one.) Nor does it account for any spending cuts that Congress might adopt now or in the future to pay for these tax cuts. (The Congressional Budget Office estimates that under congressional budgetary rules, the tax plan would force deep cuts to Medicare spending over the next decade.) But it should give us a sense of how the bill's many provisions would help -- and hurt -- millions of families across the country.
The United States tax code is full of specialized deductions -- for charitable donations, mortgage interest, medical expenses and lots more. But about three-quarters of middle-class taxpayers don't have to worry about any of that -- they take the so-called standard deduction, which replaces most of those specialized tax breaks with a single lump sum.
The Senate bill would roughly double the standard deduction: to $12,000 for an individual or $24,000 for married couples. As a result, most middle-class households that take the standard deduction now would get a tax cut under the bill in 2018, and almost none would get a tax increase.
The story is very different for the roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes. As a result, households that take those deductions now could lose out. In total, about 40 percent of households that itemize their deductions would pay more in 2018 under the Senate bill -- in some cases a lot more.
The Senate bill would affect different types of families differently.
For the roughly 70 percent of married, childless couples who take the standard deduction, the G.O.P. bill has three main changes that matter: the doubling of the standard deduction (which helps them), the elimination of the personal exemption (which hurts them) and the revision of the income tax brackets (which would lower tax rates at many income levels).
Those earning $40,000 -- roughly the bottom of the middle class in our definition -- get about a $300 tax cut. Higher earners get a bigger cut, in absolute terms, because they have more income that's subject to the reduced tax rate.
For families with children, another big provision comes into play: the child tax credit. The Senate bill would double that credit to $2,000 per child. As a result, families with children would generally get a bigger tax cut, although the benefits start to phase out above a certain income. (This analysis is based on an interpretation of the tax bill that is being used by the Joint Committee on Taxation and many other economists. The bill is ambiguous, however, and there is an alternative interpretation that would be much less generous to lower-income parents.)
One of the bill's most significant changes would be the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes. More than 40 million households wrote off a combined $350 billion in state and local income and sales taxes in 2015, according to the I.R.S., and 38 million households deducted close to $200 billion in property taxes. Both deductions would disappear under the Senate bill. (The House version of the bill would get rid of the deduction for income and sales taxes but would cap -- not eliminate -- the property-tax deduction.)
Many households most affected by the loss of the state and local tax deduction live in coastal states such as New York, California and Connecticut. Those states have high tax rates; they also tend to vote for Democrats. In Connecticut, for example, more than 40 percent of taxpayers deducted either income or sales taxes in 2015, compared with just 28 percent in the United States as a whole.
Households that take large state and local deductions also tend to be relatively wealthy. That's partly because richer households tend to take bigger deductions across the board. But it's also a reflection of the higher cost of living -- and correspondingly higher incomes -- in many coastal states.
Until now, we've been focusing on the impact of the Senate bill on people's taxes in 2018, when most households would get at least a small tax cut. But the situation would look very different a decade from now. That's because in order to reduce the cost of the bill, its authors set essentially all of the individual tax cuts -- the doubled standard deduction, the more generous child credit, the lower tax rates -- to expire after 2025. But one provision that's bad for taxpayers -- changing the measure of inflation used for many tax calculations -- would not expire. As a result, two-thirds of middle-class households would get a tax increase in 2027, and none -- zero percent -- would get a tax cut.
Those figures, however, consider only how the bill would affect personal income taxes. Starting in 2019, the bill would also cut taxes on businesses. Unlike the personal tax provisions, the business tax cuts would not expire.
Exactly how corporate tax cuts would affect individual households is a matter of intense debate among economists. The White House argues that cutting corporate taxes would result in big wage gains for workers. Many independent economists say most of the gains would go to business owners rather than workers. But economists generally agree that companies would probably pass on at least some of their savings to employees. (Executives and other top earners would probably get the biggest boost.) And people who own stocks or have other business investments would see a direct benefit from corporate tax cuts.
Congress's in-house tax analyst, the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that about 25 percent of the cuts to corporate taxes would go to workers in the form of higher incomes. Using that and some other assumptions from the committee, we can allocate the corporate tax cuts to individual households. A bit under half of middle-class households would get a tax cut -- or, technically, an increase in after-tax income -- under these assumptions, and a bit more than half would see their after-tax income go down compared with under existing law. Both the cuts and the increases would generally be small for middle-class households, although the gains could be significant for some wealthy households.
Compared with the 2018 analysis, conclusions about the effects of the tax bill in 2027 are highly uncertain. On the one hand, Republicans argue that Congress is unlikely to allow tax cuts to expire in 2026 as planned, so the middle class might do better than this analysis suggests. On the other, many liberal economists argue that the Joint Committee on Taxation is too generous in its assumptions about how much workers would benefit from the corporate tax cuts. Our analysis makes no effort to account for the broader economic effects of either the tax cuts or of the extra debt that the government would have to take on to pay for them. It also doesn't account for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, a provision that would have a much bigger impact in 2027 than in 2018.

Full text: Jerome H. Powell, nominated by President Trump to lead the Federal Reserve, plans to tell a Senate committee on Tuesday that he supports the Fed's efforts to maintain economic growth and to tighten regulation of the financial system, according to a copy of his prepared testimony. Mr. Powell, who has played a role in the enforcement of those policies as a Fed governor since 2012, added that he saw room for improvement, including opportunities to reduce financial regulation.
"If confirmed, I would strive, along with my colleagues, to support the economy's continued progress toward full recovery," Mr. Powell said in the prepared testimony, released by the Fed Monday evening before his confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. "Our aim is to sustain a strong jobs market with inflation moving gradually up toward our target."
The mention of the job market is a significant marker of Mr. Powell's views. Some conservatives contend that the Fed should focus solely on inflation and not worry about unemployment.
Mr. Powell also reiterated his support for the Fed's efforts to increase the strength of financial regulation in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, creating some distance from the Trump administration, which has described those regulations as an ineffective impediment to growth.
"Our financial system is without doubt far stronger and more resilient than it was a decade ago," he said. "Our banks have much higher levels of capital and liquid assets, are more aware of the risks they run, and are better able to manage those risks."
Mr. Powell's characterization of the financial industry differs sharply from the picture painted last week by Mr. Trump, who criticized the regulatory actions of the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau in a Twitter post, saying that "Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public."
Mr. Powell added, however, that he was open to changes that improved the current system.
"We will continue to consider appropriate ways to ease regulatory burdens while preserving core reforms -- strong levels of capital and liquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning -- so that banks can provide the credit to families and businesses necessary to sustain a prosperous economy," he said.
Mr. Powell, 64, joined the Fed in 2012. He is a lawyer by training and an investment banker by trade, with deep roots in the financial industry and the Republican Party. Since joining the Fed, he has voted consistently in support of the policies proposed by the current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. But Mr. Powell has sometimes expressed reservations about the extent of the Fed's efforts to revive economic growth and to restrain the financial industry, suggesting he would seek to moderate the central bank's current approach.
Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Powell this month, declining to appoint Ms. Yellen to a second term. Mr. Trump said he wanted to choose his own Fed chairman. Ms. Yellen has said she will step down as soon as her successor officially takes the post.
In his testimony, Mr. Powell praised both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke and added that he would resist political pressure.
"I am committed to making decisions objectively and based on the best available evidence," he said. "In doing so, I would be guided solely by our mandate from the Congress and the long-run interests of the American public."

Milestone for More Women: A 401(k) Worth $1 Million

Full text: Accumulating $1 million in retirement savings is symbolic, even if it means different things to different people. It represents an aspirational amount of wealth to some, financial security to others or a milestone on the way to greater savings still. Of course, in a nation where 44 percent of the population does not have $400 saved for an emergency expense, reaching $1 million may seem unimaginable.
For a small but growing number of working women, however, it has become a reality.
Over the last 12 years, the share of women who have amassed sums of $1 million or more in their retirement plans has doubled, according to research conducted by the investment firm Fidelity, based on the 15 million participants in the 401(k) accounts it oversees. About 20 percent of its 401(k) millionaires were women as of the end of September, the firm found, up from just under 10 percent in the same period in 2005.
"Part of it is that we've seen more women actively participating in 401(k) plans and contributing more," said Jeanne Thompson, a senior vice president at Fidelity Investments, who conducted the study. The firm said 133,000 people on its platform have achieved 401(k) millionaire status.
Financial professionals who work with women say they are not surprised that more women have crossed this threshold, particularly as more women understand the challenges they face. Women earn less than men but live longer and often spend more years out of the work force caring for young children or elderly parents.
"When I first started in the financial services industry 25 years ago, I noticed male colleagues would often share ideas and thoughts about investing and planning for retirement with each other but women really didn't," said Manisha Thakor, director of wealth strategies for women at Buckingham Strategic Wealth.
"In the intervening two and a half decades, we've seen the dramatic rise of female co- and primary breadwinners and, concurrently, the adoption of the 'this is information I need to know to protect my family' mind-set amongst women," she added.
So what can we learn from these women who have achieved millionaire status, particularly those who managed to get there on not-so-stratospheric salaries of, say, less than $150,000?
Contrary to stereotypes that women are more risk-averse, women who achieved millionaire status -- and who earned less than $150,000 -- are investing in stocks in a similar fashion to men: They held about 77 percent of their savings in stocks, on average, versus 76 percent held by their male counterparts. So they have clearly been helped by the growth in the stock market.
And by several measures, significant differences between the sexes fade when income is no longer a distinguishing factor. Among the 401(k) millionaires earning less than $150,000, women earn $117,000, on average, compared with $118,800 for men. Both genders have earned similar rates of return on their money -- and they have been working and saving somewhere in the neighborhood of three decades.
Both men and women also tend to cross the 401(k) millionaire threshold after they hit 50, though women take a slight lead: The average age is 58.5 for women, 59.3 for men. Women may have an advantage because of their behavior. "The biggest difference is that women are saving more," Ms. Thompson said.
Indeed, women who earn less than $150,000 and have attained 401(k) millionaire status are saving 18.1 percent of their salaries, on average. That amount is complemented by a 6.8 percent employer contribution, for a total of 24.9 percent, or roughly twice as much as women over all. Men, meanwhile, save 22.8 percent total, including the employer match.
The analysis did not track whether these women were always superstar savers, squirreling away disproportionately more than average, or how their behavior may have changed over time. Workers do tend to save more, however, as they get closer to retirement (Millennial savers at Fidelity, who are in their 20s and 30s, for instance, save an average of 10.2 percent; Gen Xers (late 30s to early 50s) save an average of 11.7 percent).
Given the women millionaires' ability to accumulate such large sums, we can reasonably assume that a fair bit of good fortune played a role.
These women have been gainfully employed over long stretches of time -- in fact, that's why Fidelity was able to study their behavior. It's probably also safe to assume if they had a Fidelity 401(k), they also had decent health insurance. Because they have been employed and saving, they have seemingly been able to weather financial challenges, whether it was a plunging home value in the depths of the housing crisis or, perhaps, an expensive divorce.
We do not know how many of these millionaire women were also mothers, but it also seems reasonable to infer that they probably had enough household income to cover child care -- or family help -- so they could continue working for 31 years, on average -- with little interruption.
Not all women have that privilege, and there is a lot that needs to go right to be a successful saver. That's why Sallie Krawcheck, a former Wall Street executive who held several prominent positions before opening Ellevest, an online investing platform for women, suggests that woman get started early.
"Our research further shows that 'the biggest investing mistake women make' is not overtrading or chasing last year's winners or falling in love with a stock," Ms. Krawcheck said. "It's not getting started soon enough and not making it a habit."
To achieve millionaire status on a relatively modest income, consider the following 25-year-old worker with a starting salary of $40,000, which grows by 1.5 percent a year. To accumulate $1 million, she would need to save 23 percent of her paycheck -- including any employer match -- until she retires at age 65 (with an ending salary of nearly $74,000), according to Fidelity's calculations. That assumes her portfolio grows 3 percent annually, not including inflation.
She could reach that milestone by saving a total of 16 percent annually if her portfolio earned 4.5 percent, also excluding inflation.
"It's more about the continuity of the savings rate and investing for growth over the long term," Ms. Thompson said.
Accumulating large sums is obviously far easier with a higher income -- the average 401(k) millionaire women earn $287,700, while men generate $354,600 annually.
And despite its symbolism, $1 million is not the right number for everyone. A credentialed financial planner (who puts clients' interests first) would take a close look at your current cash flow and expenses, make some assumptions and come up with a personalized figure for your life circumstances and goals.
But if you're looking for a broad rule of thumb, which can serve as an (overly general) guidepost, consider this: For people earning $50,000 to $300,000, Fidelity suggests they end up with 10 times their last annual income and investing at least half their savings in stocks over the long haul. In other words, those who end their careers earning $100,000 are estimated to need $1 million.
The firm estimates that will put retirees on track to replace 45 percent of their income, with Social Security providing the rest, assuming Congress strengthens the program and does not make cuts that diminish it.
Despite the progress by women, men still make up the vast majority of workers with the largest account balances -- and it is hard to know when women will reach parity.
It probably traces back to uneven income levels. In the Fidelity 401(k) universe alone, for instance, the average male participant earns $113,100 compared with the average female, earning $80,600. Adding to the disparity is the fact that some women carry a disproportionate amount of responsibility at work and home.
"Many women don't have continuous career paths, they are more likely to take time off from the work force, step out for a year or two, and/or may work part time at different points in their careers," Ms. Thompson said. "These moves can all impact their long-term savings."

Full text: MOSCOW -- Russia's economy is on track for a full year of growth. Inflation is slowing. The central bank has been replenishing its reserves of hard currency. The country is finally emerging from a difficult recession, and the timing could not be better: President Vladimir V. Putin is running for re-election soon.
Mr. Putin is widely expected to triumph in the March polls -- there is no credible opposition, and he has levers of the state, from fiscal largess to official media outlets, at his disposal.
The Russian election offers Mr. Putin a chance to cement his grip on power, even as his country remains under pressure from sanctions related to another election -- the 2016 presidential vote in the United States. American intelligence agencies say Russia interfered with a campaign of computer hacking and posts from fake social networking accounts.
The Russian leader is seeking a resounding mandate, after the last polls in 2012 were marred by charges of election fraud, as well as protests. And the return to economic growth, albeit modest, clears one of the main hurdles that Mr. Putin was facing as he bids for six more years in power.
Figures discussed on Friday at Mr. Putin's meeting with government and central bank officials showed strong consumer demand, a main driver of the growth. Retail sales for the month increased 3 percent compared with a year before, according to the state statistics service. The Finance Ministry projects the overall economy to grow 2.1 percent for the year. That would be Russia's first full year of economic growth since a recession began in 2014.
Other economic indicators have been trending in the same direction. Inflation is expected to be about 4 percent for 2017, low by recent Russian standards. As recently as 2015, official figures showed consumer prices were rising more than 15 percent, and ordinary Russians were feeling the pinch. The cost of Russian staples was rising: The price of bread, an important product because of its mythologized status in the Soviet period as a symbol of well being, increased about 11 percent a year during the recession, according to the state statistics agency.
But as the price of oil, a major export commodity, has recovered from multiyear lows in 2014, Russia's central bank has resumed purchases of hard currency. It has been replenishing the reserves its uses to maintain the long-term stability of the ruble.
"It's a broad recovery, and it will continue," said Vladimir Osakovsky, chief Russia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "There is strong fundamental support."
The country certainly faces challenges, Mr. Osakovsky and other analysts say. It remains vulnerable to swings in the price of oil and natural gas, for example. The two commodities account for about 60 percent of export revenue and 50 percent of the federal government's tax base, and a sudden drop in prices could expose wider issues with the economy.
Experts also worry that Russia's banking system is vulnerable. The central bank had to nationalize two midsize private lenders this year, and several banks lost money betting against the ruble in recent years, according to Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets, an investment bank.
"So far, the central bank has managed to keep the banking system working," Mr. Tikhomirov said. But, he added, "the cost of saving these banks is growing."
Still, positive news has been trickling in.
In September, Fitch, the credit rating agency, revised its outlook for Russian sovereign debt to positive from stable. Through the year, foreign investors have piled into Russian government bonds, raising the share of Russian debt held by foreigners to more than 30 percent, up from 5 percent.
Also helping the recovery was government spending on major infrastructure projects, including a bridge across the Kerch Strait to Crimea, a major gas pipeline to China called the Power of Siberia, and soccer stadiums for the World Cup, which Russia will host next year.
That has helped the country overcome Western sanctions imposed during the Ukraine crisis and over meddling by Moscow in the 2016 election in the United States. These "smart sanctions" were in any case narrowly targeting companies and businessmen aligned with Mr. Putin, meant to affect Kremlin insiders and not to slow the overall economy or hasten political change.
Mr. Putin now finds himself in a more favorable economic environment before next year's election. And even though Russians have taken a considerable hit to their pocketbooks in recent years -- real income, or wages adjusted for inflation, declined through the recession -- he remains the overwhelming favorite. In an October survey conducted by the Levada Center, an independent polling organization, two-thirds of likely voters said they would cast their ballots for Mr. Putin.
Spurring growth beyond the 2 percent region forecast by the government will not be easy, though.
The country will very likely have to agree a series of major economic overhauls in order to bolster its long-term growth potential. The retirement age -- currently 55 years for women and 60 years for men -- will have to be raised, economists say. Without such changes, expansion will remain capped at its current levels, Russia's central bank chairwoman, Elvira S. Nabiullina, warned this month.
"Without reform," Mr. Tikhomirov said, "the future for Russia will be fairly bleak."

The G.O.P.'s Tax Trap

Full text: Do congressional Republicans and President Trump want to undertake a multitrillion-dollar federal bailout of states and cities? If not, the Senate and House should squelch their competing proposals to reduce or eliminate Americans' ability to deduct state and local taxes on their federal tax forms. Curtailing tax breaks is generally a good idea. Subsidies for certain activities distort the economy. When the mortgage-interest deduction spurs a family to buy a more expensive home than they would have otherwise, it keeps that money from more productive parts of the economy.
But state and local tax deductions do not fall into this category. Since the nation's founding, American citizens have safeguarded small-scale democracy. The Bill of Rights prescribes that "the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states."
Scholars and judges differ over where state control ends and federal oversight starts. But no scholar argues that states, cities and towns don't possess the right and obligation to staff schools, pave roads, purify water and put out fires.
For this, local and state governments need money -- which they mostly get from their own taxpayers, not from Washington. To assert that the federal government has the primary claim on this tax dollar, as Republicans are doing, is to claim that the federal government bears the primary responsibility for these tasks.
That's not a conservative argument, but a European one. In France, the national government, not Paris, stands behind a $37 billion "Grand Paris" plan to improve public transportation. In America, by contrast, Washington expects New York and New Jersey to bear half the cost of a new tunnel under the Hudson River, even though Amtrak, the national railroad, depends on this critical piece of infrastructure. Similarly, New York has received only $1.3 billion toward the $4.2 billion cost of the first three stops of the Second Avenue subway. The rest comes from New York taxpayers.
Wealthier taxpayers do disproportionately benefit from these tax deductions, because they pay the most in taxes. In New York City, just 1 percent of tax filers -- 37,273 households -- pay 49.3 percent of city income taxes. But their ability to deduct these taxes from federal taxable income is an indirect subsidy to New York's poorer and middle-class residents, who benefit from state and local spending on education, Medicaid, public safety and homeless services.
If Congress were going to diminish America's local-governance model anyway, now is not the time. Nearly a decade into the economic recovery, state and local governments remain under fiscal stress, particularly when it comes to pension and health care promises to retirees.
Chicago owes $45.2 billion to current and future public-sector pensioners, but had set aside only $9.5 billion as of the city's latest audited annual report. New Jersey and its local governments owe $122.2 billion, but have set aside just $53.7 billion. Even healthier governments, such as New York State and New York City, owe tens of billions of dollars in future health care payment obligations to retirees.
As retirement costs have grown, state and local governments have cut back on infrastructure investments. Municipal debt -- the mechanism through which governments borrow to build and maintain infrastructure -- is 17 percent below its 2007 level after inflation.
Republicans characterize this issue as a blue-state problem because blue states have higher taxes. But red states are struggling too. Texas owes $39.1 billion for pensions, but has set aside just $25 billion. Gulf states, including Florida and Louisiana, must invest in flood-protection measures. Houston voters approved new borrowing for such infrastructure this month -- borrowing enabled by local tax deductions.
Republicans also characterize the issue as one of local mismanagement. "I don't think it's up to the federal government to save New York from its bad decisions," said Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's budget director, last week. True, governments from Chicago to New Jersey have made poor fiscal decisions. In a system that grants citizens great autonomy to govern themselves at the local level, disparities in financial management are inevitable. But it is none of Washington's business that New York's taxes are too high.
One reality remains -- somebody must pay. Three sources exist: taxpayers; public-sector retirees, via pension and health-benefits cuts; and municipal investors, via Detroit-style debt defaults in severe cases. Congress is making the first more difficult for state and local governments, and in most places, legal protections prevent governments from cutting pension benefits.
That leaves bondholders. As the Standard & Poor's rating agency said this week, the overall impact of a tax plan that curtails state and local tax deductions "could be costly and detrimental to the credit quality of many public-finance issuers."
Signing a bill into law that creates systemic distress for a financial market that affects the lives of all Americans is hardly the best way to improve the economy. And it may result in eventual tax increases, not tax cuts, at the federal level. Global investors may grow tired of America's lurching from crisis to crisis and raise the cost of federal borrowing, as well.

Vary the Minimum Wage by Region?

Full text: To the Editor: Re "A Smarter Minimum Wage" (Op-Ed, Nov. 18):
Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler's argument for a regionally tiered minimum wage is poor policy that would leave too many workers behind. The minimum wage rates they recommend -- an average of $10.90 initially for most regions of the United States and just $9.25 in lower-cost parts of rural America -- are far too low and would not reach $15 an hour until about 2032 for most of the United States, and 2041 in rural America (assuming 2 percent annual inflation).
While the $15 wage movement started in cities like Seattle and New York, paychecks have been flat all across America, and cost-of-living data show that in all 50 states single workers will need $15 an hour in just a few years to afford the basics. Beyond living costs, regional wage differences in low-paying industries have been declining, with the result that home health aides and waitresses in New Jersey today earn just a little more than they do in Mississippi.
Our national economy therefore needs a strong and uniform national wage floor to lift workers across the country -- and prevent a race to the bottom.
PAUL K. SONN, NEW YORK
The writer is general counsel at the National Employment Law Project.
To the Editor:
Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler correctly identify a serious problem with the national minimum wage: The cost of living varies greatly depending on where you live. However, their proposal for different minimum wages in a country with "hundreds of different micro-economies" is not only exceedingly complex but also avoids the fundamental question: Why have a minimum wage at all?
The New York Times itself opined in a 1987 editorial, "The Right Minimum Wage: $0.00," that the minimum wage prices the working poor out of the job market. It still does. But it's also about choice. Shouldn't adults have the freedom to decide the price at which they are willing to exchange their labor with other adults? If we are pro-choice, we should be supporting the right of adults to make choices in all aspects of their lives, personal and economic.
ANDREW TERHUNE, PHILADELPHIA
To the Editor:
The interesting proposal by Jonathan Cowan and Jim Kessler misses an important point. Even in Oklahoma City, where a simple breakfast at a diner costs only $5.79, and in Fargo, N.D., where a dozen eggs costs only 93 cents, a wage of $15 an hour doesn't go very far. The system we have now is not very different from the reasonable but complicated system that Mr. Cowan and Mr. Kessler propose.
We now have a national minimum wage, and cities and regions where costs are higher are free to set their minimums higher. We need a $15 federal minimum wage because $15 is the minimum that a worker anywhere in the country should be paid. Cities and regions where the cost of living is more expensive will still be free to set higher minimums.
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is a national disgrace. It was not sufficient when that rate was set in 2009. Doubling the minimum is right. And high-cost cities like New York and Seattle will want to go higher.
The bigger national disgrace is the discrepancy in income between low-wage workers and the plutocrats. Nobody is thinking about setting a maximum income for the people at the very top. But at least we can use the concept of the minimum wage to take a small step toward reducing the outrageous disparity between the highest and the lowest incomes by making sure that everywhere in the country someone with a job will have enough to live on.

Market's Record Run Skips a Beat as Interest Rates Fall

Full text: NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks mostly slipped away from their latest record highs Wednesday as the two former halves of Hewlett-Packard both tumbled, while falling interest rates helped phone companies but hurt banks. The price of oil jumped on reports OPEC and a group of other countries might extend the cuts in production they made at the start of this year. That took energy companies higher. Hewlett Packard Enterprise sank after it said CEO Meg Whitman will retire, while printer and PC maker HP lost ground after its latest quarterly report.
Interest rates fell after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest meeting, which ended Nov. 1. While most officials were comfortable raising interest rates soon, as investors think they will do in December, a few Fed leaders think rates should stay where they are until there is more evidence inflation is rising.
The Fed has suggested it wants to raise rates three more times next year, but many are skeptical that it will.
"The market certainly doesn't believe it, and hasn't believed it all along," says Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He said investors may change their minds as economic reports roll in over the next few weeks, and they may get nervous if they think the Fed will move faster.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 1.95 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,597.08. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 64.65 points, or 0.3 percent, to 23,526.18. The Nasdaq composite rose 4.88 points, or 0.1 percent, to a record 6,867.36. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 2.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,516.76.
All four indexes closed at record highs Tuesday, and on Wednesday most of the companies on the New York Stock Exchange finished higher.
U.S. markets will be closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday. They will reopen Friday but will close at 1 p.m. ET.
The two main companies that once comprised Hewlett-Packard took the largest losses in the S&P 500. Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which sells data-center hardware and tech gear, dropped after it announced company President Antonio Neri will replace Whitman as CEO Feb 1. Whitman became CEO of Hewlett-Packard in 2011 and oversaw its split in 2015. HPE also reported mixed fourth-quarter results.
Analysts said they were surprised by the timing because Whitman suggested last month that she wasn't leaving soon. Like several other analysts, Steven Milunovich of UBS said Neri is a good choice, but that Whitman will be hard to replace.
"Whitman's star power could be missed when competing with the likes of Michael Dell, Chuck Robbins, and Ginni Rometty for large enterprise deals," he wrote, referring to the CEOs of Dell, Cisco Systems and IBM.
HP Enterprise fell $1.02, or 7.2 percent, to $13.10. Meanwhile HP Inc., which sells PCs and printers, had a solid quarter but couldn't sustain the gains it's made this year. The stock lost $1.12, or 5 percent, to $21.34. It's up 44 percent in 2017.
Bond prices started the day with small gains, which sent yields lower. Yields moved lower still as investors looked over the Federal Reserve minutes. The Fed has already raised interest rates twice this year in spite of low inflation, and Wren, of Wells Fargo, said investors may get jumpy as they examine economic data in the next few weeks and try to figure out how fast the Fed will move next year.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.32 percent from 2.36 percent. That sent banks lower because lower yields translate to smaller profits on loans. Cincinnati Financial fell 80 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $72.66. Phone companies, which pay big dividends similar to bonds, climbed higher. Verizon Communications rose 92 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.10.
The dollar also weakened as investors expected lower interest rates. It sank to 111.17 yen from 112.44 yen. The euro rose to $1.1822 from $1.1742.
U.S. crude rose $1.19, or 2.1 percent, to $58.02 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 75 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $63.32 a barrel in London. Both oil benchmarks are at two-year highs.
Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter in the world, wants the OPEC cartel to extend this year's cut in oil production for another nine months. The nations of OPEC, as well as other major oil producers including Russia, will meet in Vienna next week to discuss their goals.
Farm equipment maker Deere posted a bigger profit and better sales than analysts expected, and it also gave surprisingly strong forecasts for its new fiscal year. The stock climbed $6.02, or 4.3 percent, to $145.25.
Gold added $10.50 to $1,292.20 an ounce. Silver rose 15 cents to $17.11 an ounce. Copper rose 1 cent to $3.14 a pound.
In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 1 cent to $1.77 a gallon. Heating oil remained at $1.93 a gallon. Natural gas skidded 5 cents to $2.97 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Germany's DAX lost 1.2 percent while the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.2 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 0.5 percent and the Hang Seng index of Hong Kong advanced 0.6 percent. The Kospi in South Korea rose 0.4 percent.

Full text: BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- The Northern Ireland Assembly's palatial building in Stormont, in the hills that overlook Belfast, is an eerie place these days. This time last year, its grand lobby bustled with lawmakers, lobbyists and civil servants, but this week it is empty and lifeless. Further inside, a few tourists warmed the blue seats of the debating chamber, rather than the 90 lawmakers elected to work there. Even their microphones had been removed.
"It's a total ghost town," said Claire Hanna, one of those lawmakers. "It's dead."
And so it has been since as long ago as January, when Northern Ireland's governing coalition collapsed. That created a power vacuum at Stormont that has still not been filled, paralyzing the region's already pinched institutions and threatening a 1998 peace deal that largely ended three decades of fighting between nationalist and unionist factions.
Since that deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland has been run mostly by a devolved regional government that must, in effect, be led by a coalition between the region's largest nationalist party and its largest unionist counterpart.
But in January this delicate arrangement was upended when Sinn Fein, which hopes for a united Ireland one day, withdrew from a coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The government stopped working and the assembly stopped meeting. A major overhaul of the region's ailing health system was postponed, and all long-term decisions about government spending were put on hold.
"This is a more profound crisis than we've had at other times in the last 20 years," said Stephen Farry, the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, a centrist group that does not identify as either nationalist or unionist.
The government was shaken again this weekend, with the news that Gerry Adams would stand down as president of Sinn FÃ©in. His departure at the end of the year may help the party achieve its goal of becoming a palatable coalition partner in the Irish government, but for Northern Ireland the implications are less clear.
Optimists have expressed hopes that his absence could give the political parties in Belfast more room for maneuver. But combined with the death in March of Mr. Adams's former colleague, Martin McGuinness, it deprives the government of established leaders who are willing or able to make compromises on both sides of the sectarian divide.
The assembly has previously been suspended, most memorably between 2002 and 2007. "But then there was the sense that this was a blip and the problems would be overcome," Mr. Farry said.
"This crisis has a different feel to it," he added. "There's a much more profound question over the direction of travel and whether power-sharing is sustainable. And that begs the question: What happens next?"
In the short term, civil servants have been left in charge of the day-to-day management of the region. But if the impasse continues, many fear that decisions will be made by ministers in London, a system known as "direct rule" that the 1998 agreement was meant to end. In the absence of a Northern Irish finance minister, the British government has already made the first step toward "direct rule" -- passing an interim budget for Northern Ireland on Monday to ensure that salaries can be paid until March.
The specter of Brexit compounds the crisis: When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, border controls may be reintroduced between Northern and southern Ireland for the first time since the Good Friday Agreement was introduced.
Some now question whether the agreement has in essence collapsed, and fear, if not a return to anything like a full-blown conflict, then at least a rise in sporadic acts of paramilitary intimidation.
"I don't mean to be dramatic or anything, but I do think the Good Friday Agreement is effectively dead," said Ms. Hanna, who represents the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Sinn Fein's main nationalist rival.
"I don't think there's any real support for violence, but you can see how quickly things can unravel," she added. "It's very bleak, and it is something to worry about."
A Stagnated State
For now, civil servants are keeping the machinery of the state in motion. But as unelected employees, they must simply apply the decisions made by the elected government during the last financial year, meaning that they can neither react to changing circumstances nor increase their budgets in line with inflation.
This has led to stasis and, in some cases, cuts to jobs and services. In one high-profile case, officials were forced to scrap an intensive support program for around 1,000 of the region's most vulnerable children and teenagers, even though the program had led to a significant drop in antisocial behavior and a rise in school attendance.
These children were "the first victims of this political impasse," said Charlie Mack, the chief executive of Extern, the charity that ran the program on the government's behalf. "Which is disgraceful."
The health system has also been affected. With the longest wait times in the United Kingdom, the sector had been due for a major overhaul this year. But that has been on hold since the start of the crisis, said Janice Smyth, the Northern Ireland director at the Royal College of Nursing, the world's largest nursing union. "It cannot happen until we get a minister," she said.
Across the region's charitable sector, which is significantly dependent on state funding, charities have become wary of starting new projects or hiring staff, making them less able to respond to social problems that require new strategies.
"There's been a stagnation," said Seamus McAleavey, the chief executive of Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action, a group that represents more than 1,000 nongovernmental organizations. "Treading water is probably a fairly good description."
The Blame Game
Yet these administrative challenges have not yet encouraged politicians to reach a settlement. In fact, their differences have increased as the year has developed.
When they left the coalition in January, Sinn Fein originally intended to force the resignation of the D.U.P. leader, Arlene Foster, who was accused of corruption. But after Ms. Foster refused to step down, Sinn Fein expanded its demands, calling on the D.U.P. to agree to give the Irish language the same legal status as English and to legalize same-sex marriage. (In Scotland and Wales, the Scottish and Welsh languages already have an equal legal footing with English, and same-sex marriage has been permitted in the rest of the United Kingdom since 2014.)
Both sides have been accused of not being truly invested in a compromise.
After the Conservative party lost its majority this summer in the national Parliament in Westminster, it turned to the D.U.P.'s small group of national lawmakers to ensure that it remained in power. And there are now suspicions that "the Westminster deal has made them less interested in Stormont politics," said Cillian McGrattan, a politics professor at Ulster University. "I think they have a view that if they're going to get things done, they're going to get them done in Westminster."
The D.U.P. dismisses this argument and says that in fact, it is Sinn Fein that has ulterior motives for maintaining the standoff. Since Sinn Fein also operates in the Republic of Ireland, it fears that it will harm its reputation among left-wing voters in Dublin if it is forced to pursue neoliberal policies while in government in Belfast, said Sammy Wilson, a D.U.P. lawmaker.
Sinn Fein scoffs at this. "Why would it not be great for Sinn Fein to be running things?" asked Mairtin O Muilleoir, the Sinn Fein finance minister at the time of the coalition's collapse. "The months I spent as finance minister burnished and enhanced Sinn Fein's reputation for getting things done."
A New Paradigm?
As the standoff drags on, and polarization increases, people find it harder to envisage Northern Ireland as an autonomous entity. "We're back to this binary situation where people either see it as a problematic part of the U.K. or as a part of united Ireland," said Graham Walker, a politics professor at Queen's University, Belfast.
To resolve the crisis in the long term, some suggest reshaping the Good Friday Agreement to allow for other kinds of coalitions, instead of a mandatory partnership between the region's two largest nationalist and unionist factions. Others predict a referendum on Irish reunification within a decade, arguing that the current dysfunction, coupled with the fallout from Brexit, may encourage moderate nationalists to see a united Ireland as a more urgent priority than they did previously.
Whereas Stormont was once seen as a symbol of hope and progress, citizens of all backgrounds now see it as an embarrassment.
Ricky Routledge, the head of a homeless charity who meets lawmakers at Stormont as part of her work, said she once felt a sense of civic pride on her visits there.
"Now, I go up to Stormont and it's this great big echoey, empty, impotent place," Ms. Routledge said. "And it's heartbreaking."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said on Monday that she would step down from the Fed's board at the same time that she ends her term as chairwoman. President Trump decided earlier this month to nominate Jerome H. Powell, a Republican who sits on the Fed's board, as the next chairman, deciding against offering Ms. Yellen a second term. Ms. Yellen, whose term as chairwoman ends in February, could have remained on the Fed board until her term as governor expires in 2024.
Her decision to step down instead had been widely expected, though some Democrats had argued publicly and privately that she could best defend her legacy from the inside.
"I am gratified that the financial system is much stronger than a decade ago, better able to withstand future bouts of instability and continue supporting the economic aspirations of American families and businesses," Ms. Yellen wrote Monday in a letter to President Trump announcing her decision. "I am also gratified by the substantial improvement in the economy since the crisis."
Ms. Yellen also praised the selection of Mr. Powell as her replacement, and promised to work toward a smooth transition.
Ms. Yellen's departure would leave the Fed with just three people on its seven-member board, which would be the fewest in the Fed's history and could strain the board's ability to manage the operations of the central bank. The dearth of governors also means that a majority of the votes on the Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, are now held by the presidents of regional reserve banks, not political appointees. The committee consists of 12 voting members -- the seven Fed governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and four additional Reserve Bank presidents.
The Trump administration filled one vacancy on the Fed's board earlier this year when Mr. Trump nominated Randal K. Quarles as the vice chairman of supervision. But it has not yet nominated any candidates to fill the three current vacancies and now, with Ms. Yellen's departure, Mr. Trump will have a fourth seat to fill.
Ms. Yellen, 71, has spent almost two decades at the Fed. President Bill Clinton named her as a governor in the mid-1990s. She returned to teach at the University of California, Berkeley, before going back to the Fed as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004. She became vice chairwoman in 2010.
As vice chairwoman, she worked closely with the then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke on the Fed's post-crisis stimulus campaign. She paid tribute to Mr. Bernanke in her resignation letter, writing that his "leadership during the financial crisis and its aftermath was critical to restoring the soundness of our financial system and the prosperity of our economy."
After succeeding Mr. Bernanke in 2014, Ms. Yellen continued those efforts.
Among her most important achievements was convincing Fed officials to be patient and to repeatedly extend the stimulus campaign. She rallied her colleagues to the view that the economy had plenty of room to expand without driving up inflation. The Fed continued to hold down interest rates, and job growth continued at a pace many had regarded as unsustainable.
The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in October while inflation has remained sluggish. The Fed has rarely come closer to its goals of maximizing employment and stabilizing inflation.
Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth economist who worked as an adviser to Ms. Yellen, credited her with "leading and managing a relatively large Fed committee with lots of independent voices."
"Sometimes they call it a cacophony," he said. "She managed to turn it into a symphony."
Ms. Yellen drew on her background as an academic economist. As a professor at Berkeley, she wrote extensively about the mechanics of labor markets. But she broke with academic consensus when many experts underestimated the potential for job growth.
"What also counted were her common sense and her open mind," Mr. Levin said. "That has made a material difference in people's lives and livelihoods."
Ms. Yellen's focus on unemployment represented a shift for the Fed, which in the decades before the 2008 financial crisis honed a single-minded emphasis on controlling inflation.
She paid regular visits to job-training programs across the country, meeting with groups of workers to hear their stories. She also invited a coalition of unions and community groups, Fed Up, to meet with her in the Fed's grand boardroom on the National Mall in Washington.
In one of her first public appearances as chairwoman, she went to Chicago to meet with three people struggling to find jobs, then gave a speech declaring her priorities.
"It is my hope," she said, "that the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives."
The Fed's focus on unemployment raised the ire of conservative critics who worried the central bank would lose control of inflation, or that it was underwriting excessive speculation in financial markets. Those predictions have not materialized.
Ms. Yellen also emerged as a stalwart defender of the stronger financial regulations imposed after the financial crisis, particularly after President Trump took office and announced that he intended to sharply reduce regulation of the financial sector.
Yet Ms. Yellen's successful management of the economy, and her calm and mild personal style, meant that her interactions with Republicans were largely devoid of hostility. Mr. Trump made a point of praising her even as he made her the first Fed chairman in modern times to complete a first term without receiving a second.
"Although we did not always agree on the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary policy, I have great respect for Chair Yellen," Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement on Monday. "I wish her well."
The Trump administration did not publicly press for Ms. Yellen to step down as a governor, but her decision is in keeping with Fed tradition. The last chairman to remain on the board after losing the top job was Marriner Eccles, who was replaced as chairman in 1948 but remained on the board until 1951.
The Trump administration did ease Ms. Yellen's exit, however, by choosing a centrist as her replacement. Mr. Powell has described the administration's plans to reduce financial regulation as a "mixed bag," saying that he wants to retain some of the most important stringencies imposed after the financial crisis. He has also supported the Fed's gradual retreat from its stimulus campaign in the face of demands from some Republicans for interest rates to rise quickly.
And earlier this year Ms. Yellen lost allies when two other Fed governors appointed by President Obama, Daniel Tarullo and Stanley Fischer, resigned. That had already guaranteed Mr. Trump's ability to appoint a majority of the Fed's board, leaving any remaining Obama-era holdovers with little prospect of real influence.
Ms. Yellen's term as chairwoman ends on February 3, but the exact timing of her departure depends on Mr. Powell's confirmation progress. Although the legislative calendar is crowded with other priorities, he is not expected to face significant opposition and the Banking Committee scheduled a confirmation hearing for Nov. 28. Ms. Yellen would remain in office during any delay, saying in her letter that she would depart "immediately" once her successor was sworn in.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: OIL INDUSTRY
Crucial moment for an oil pipeline.
Nebraska's Public Service Commission is scheduled to decide on Monday whether to grant a permit for the building of a section of the Keystone XL pipeline that would connect Canadian oil with refineries on the Gulf Coast. It is a crucial moment for a project that has been delayed for years and was stopped by the administration of President Barack Obama, only to be resuscitated by President Trump. A leak in the existing Keystone pipeline last week, which spilled 5,000 barrels of oil on a farm field, was an embarrassment for the Canadian pipeline company TransCanada, which owns both pipelines. Clifford Krauss
ECONOMY
Draghi to report on eurozone financial risks.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, will report to the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday about the risks facing the eurozone financial system. The topic is timely; some economists worry that financial minefields could come into view as the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve slowly withdraw the stimulus they have been providing for the past decade. Mr. Draghi is also chairman of the European Systemic Risk Board, which has expressed concern that a spike in interest rates could put stress on countries that have a lot of debt. Jack Ewing
A chance for Yellen to lay out her policy views.
The people who run the world's largest central banks are a small and intimate group. They share similar challenges and meet regularly to trade notes. And on Tuesday evening, two members of that group will do it in public. Janet Yellen, now in her final months as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will be interviewed by Mervyn King, former governor of the Bank of England, at New York University. Ms. Yellen in recent speeches has sought to provide a clear record of her views on the major issues confronting the Fed in the realms of monetary and regulatory policy. She has only a few more opportunities to do so before her four-year term ends in early February. Binyamin Appelbaum
Consumers seem optimistic ahead of the holidays.
Millions of Americans will head to the mall at the end of this week for the Black Friday deals that mark the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season. For a sign of how freely American shoppers will be spending this holiday season, look to the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer sentiment, which will be released on Wednesday. A preliminary reading showed that consumer confidence edged down in early November but remains strong. Other measures also suggest that consumers are feeling good about the economy, although there remains a large partisan divide. Ben Casselman
Fed minutes may offer details on inflation views.
The Federal Reserve's most recent policymaking meeting, on the last day of October and the first day of November, was a bloodless affair. The Fed gave every indication before the meeting that it planned to wait until its final meeting of the year, in mid-December, to raise its benchmark interest rate for the third time this year. There were no surprises in the post-meeting statement, and there is little drama in the release on Wednesday of an account of the October-November meeting. It will most likely provide more details about the Fed's ongoing struggle to understand the slow pace of inflation -- but it probably won't shake the conviction of investors that the Fed will raise rates in December. Binyamin Appelbaum
A Thanksgiving respite for trading.
Markets in the United States will be closed on Thursday as traders and other Americans observe Thanksgiving. The University of Illinois Extension estimates that people will eat a total of 46 million turkeys for the holiday, though official numbers on stuffing and mashed potato consumption are less readily available. And, according to AAA, more than 50 million people will travel at least 50 miles to their feast, paying lower airfares but higher gas prices than in recent years. Zach Wichter
RETAIL
Get ready for Black Friday lines outside stores.
Retailers, as they do every year, will trot out some of their deepest holiday discounts during the annual Black Friday shopping extravaganza. Lines outside stores will probably start forming early and stretch far, even as more companies stay closed or at least cut back their hours on Thanksgiving. Many brands have shifted their focus from doorbuster deals in their brick-and-mortar locations and are instead advertising online bargains, even as they also compete in a brutal retail market by refreshing their physical spaces. Analysts are expecting e-commerce sales to set fresh records, as they did earlier this month on Singles Day in China. Tiffany Hsu
BANKING
Taking the temperature of European banks.
The European Banking Authority is expected to unveil the results of its latest transparency exercise for more than 130 banks in the region on Friday. The regulator is not conducting a stress test this year, but instead examining a variety of data that has been provided to local bank supervisors, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank. The exercise will cover a period from December 2016 to June 2017 and provide information about capital, leverage ratio, profit and losses and other data points. The information from the Italian and Spanish banks may prove interesting following the bailout efforts for Italian banks and sales brokered by the Spanish government. Chad Bray

Full text: Supporters and critics of the Republican tax bills argue over their effect on middle-class Americans, but there is one group that everyone agrees would come out ahead: the millionaires and billionaires who have to reckon with the estate tax. As Steven Mnuchin, President Trump's Treasury secretary, bluntly declared last month, "Obviously, the estate tax, I will concede, disproportionately helps rich people."
As it is now, the estate tax affects a small set of wealthy Americans, applying only when someone leaves assets worth more than $5.49 million to heirs. Together, parents can leave $11 million to their children without paying a penny in estate taxes.
Last year, for example, more than 2.6 million people died in the United States. Of the estates filed with the Internal Revenue Service, 5,219 -- or 0.2 percent of the total -- were large enough to qualify for the tax.
The kind of households that could potentially owe money, however, include Mr. Trump's, Mr. Mnuchin's, and those of several cabinet members and advisers, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Gary Cohn, chief of the National Economic Council.
(An analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress Action Fund concluded that the estate tax repeal could save Mr. Trump's estate more than $1 billion, and those of his cabinet members $3.5 billion.)
Mr. Trump has stated, incorrectly, that the tax is crushing "millions of small businesses and the American farmer." In reality, only about 80 small businesses and farms would fall under the estate-tax tent this year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
Republicans want to shrink the numbers further. In the Senate's proposed tax bill, exempted income would temporarily double to $11 million per person -- $22 million for a couple -- during the next decade.
If those rules had been imposed last year, the number of estates owing money under the tax would have been no more than 2,204 -- fewer than 0.1 percent of the total.
The House bill approved Thursday goes a step further, doubling the exemption through the 2024 tax year (and indexing for inflation), but then eliminating the tax. The result is that other taxpayers would have to make up the $151 billion cost over the next decade.
Opponents of the tax say fairness is at stake. No one -- including billionaires -- should have their assets taxed twice, once in life and once in death, the argument goes. But the issue is less about double taxation than no taxation.
Many of the assets held by the ultrawealthy are investments that are not taxed until they are sold. Pass along these investments after you die, and your family can pretty much avoid ever paying capital gains tax on them. That's where the estate tax comes in.
"It was a kind of imperfect substitute or surrogate for the capital-gains tax," Wojciech Kopczuk, an economist at Columbia University, explained. "It's a roundabout way of getting some revenue that escapes some other type of a tax."
In the past, a reduction in the estate tax was always coupled with a plan to end the protective shell that encases inherited capital gains and keeps them from being taxed.
"What's unusual about the current bill is that when there's been previous efforts to cut back or repeal the estate tax, there was also an effort to change the tax on capital gains," said Michael J. Graetz, a Treasury official in the elder President George Bush's administration and a co-author of a book on the estate tax.
The Republicans' repeated success in whittling away at the number of people subject to the tax is both a marvel of marketing -- with its relabeling as a "death tax" -- and a testament to the outsize influence of wealthy donors on policy.
The modern version has been around for more than 90 years. One of its primary advocates was not a soapbox socialist but a Republican. Theodore Roosevelt, the first 20th-century president to endorse a tax on luxe inheritances, was the son of a wealthy socialite and an industrial baron. He warned that passing vast fortunes from one generation to the next not only undermines the recipients but "is of great and genuine detriment to the community at large."
Over the past couple of decades, Republican efforts to shield more prosperous Americans from the estate tax have been increasingly successful. In 2001, estates worth more than $675,000 (nearly $1 million in today's dollars) could be taxed at a top rate of 55 percent.
Now, the top tax rate is 40 percent of the amount exceeding $5.49 million. The effective average rate turns out to be much lower, -- less than 17 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center -- because of that multimillion-dollar exemption up front.
(Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have their own estate taxes, while six others have an inheritance tax, which falls on the beneficiary rather than the estate. Maryland and New Jersey have both, though New Jersey's estate tax is scheduled for repeal on Jan. 1.)
Opponents of the tax have put a lot of money into fighting it over the years, without encountering much pushback, Mr. Graetz said, even from sectors that could be hurt by the change, like charitable organizations (since tax-deductible contributions are rendered less beneficial to rich donors) and insurance companies (whose policies become less essential to provide heirs with immediate liquidity or cash).
The repeal effort is aided by the aspirations of dreamers and strivers who imagine that they, too, might reach the estate tax threshold by the time they die.
There is still hardly any organized opposition, even though the Republican proposal "basically allows you to escape not only estate taxes but also income taxes," Mr. Graetz said.
For the handful affected, the stakes are enormous, he said, but for everybody else, "it's just another increase in the deficit, which doesn't seem to rally the public."

Full text: After 19 minutes of dueling, with four bidders on the telephone and one in the room, Leonardo da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi" sold on Wednesday night for $450.3 million with fees, shattering the high for any work of art sold at auction. It far surpassed Picasso's "Women of Algiers," which fetched $179.4 million at Christie's in May 2015. The buyer was not immediately disclosed. There were gasps throughout the sale, as the bids climbed by tens of millions up to $225 million, by fives up to $260 million, and then by twos. As the bidding slowed, and a buyer pondered the next multi-million-dollar increment, Jussi Pylkkanen, the auctioneer, said, "It's an historic moment; we'll wait."
Toward the end, Alex Rotter, Christie's co-chairman of postwar and contemporary art, who represented a buyer on the phone, made two big jumps to shake off one last rival bid from Francis de Poortere, Christie's head of old master paintings.
The price is all the more remarkable at a time when the old masters market is contracting, because of limited supply and collectors' penchant for contemporary art.
And to critics, the astronomical sale attests to something else -- the degree to which salesmanship has come to drive and dominate the conversation about art and its value. Some art experts pointed to the painting's damaged condition and its questionable authenticity.
"This was a thumping epic triumph of branding and desire over connoisseurship and reality," said Todd Levin, a New York art adviser.
Christie's marketing campaign was perhaps unprecedented in the art world; it was the first time the auction house went so far as to enlist an outside agency to advertise the work. Christie's also released a video that included top executives pitching the painting to Hong Kong clients as "the holy grail of our business" and likening it to "the discovery of a new planet." Christie's called the work "the Last da Vinci," the only known painting by the Renaissance master still in a private collection (some 15 others are in museums).
"It's been a brilliant marketing campaign," said Alan Hobart, director of the Pyms Gallery in London, who has acquired museum-quality artworks across a range of historical periods for the British businessman and collector Graham Kirkham. "This is going to be the future."
There was a palpable air of anticipation at Christie's Rockefeller Center headquarters as the art market's major players filed into the sales room. The capacity crowd included top dealers like Larry Gagosian, David Zwirner and Marc Payot of Hauser & Wirth. Major collectors had traveled here for the sale, among them Eli Broad and Michael Ovitz from Los Angeles; Martin Margulies from Miami; and Stefan Edlis from Chicago. Christie's had produced special red paddles for those bidding on the Leonardo, and many of its specialists taking bids on the phone wore elegant black.
Earlier, 27,000 people had lined up at pre-auction viewings in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York to glimpse the painting of Christ as "Savior of the World." Members of the public -- indeed, even many cognoscenti -- cared little if at all whether the painting might have been executed in part by studio assistants; whether Leonardo had actually made the work himself; or how much of the canvas had been repainted and restored. They just wanted to see a masterwork that dates from about 1500 and was rediscovered in 2005.
"There is extraordinary consensus it is by Leonardo," said Nicholas Hall, the former co-chairman of old master paintings at Christie's, who now runs his own Manhattan gallery. "This is the most important old master painting to have been sold at auction in my lifetime."
That is the kind of name-brand appeal that Christie's was presumably banking on by placing the painting in its high-profile contemporary art sale, rather than in its less sexy annual old master auction, where it technically belongs. To some extent, the auction house succeeded with the painting even before the sale, having secured a guaranteed $100 million bid from an unidentified third party. It is the 12th artwork to break the $100 million mark at auction, and a new high for any old master at auction, surpassing Rubens's "Massacre of the Innocents," which sold for $76.7 million in 2002 (or more than $105 million, adjusted for inflation).
But many art experts argue that Christie's used marketing window dressing to mask the baggage that comes with the Leonardo, from its compromised condition to its complicated buying history and said that the auction house put the artwork in a contemporary sale to circumvent the scrutiny of old masters experts, many of whom have questioned the painting's authenticity and condition.
"The composition doesn't come from Leonardo," said Jacques Franck, a Paris-based art historian and Leonardo specialist. "He preferred twisted movement. It's a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best, and it's very damaged."
"It's been called 'the male Mona Lisa,"' he said, "but it doesn't look like it at all." Mr. Franck said he has examined the Mona Lisa out of its frame five times.
Luke Syson, curator of the 2011 National Gallery exhibition in London that featured the painting, said in his catalog essay that "the picture has suffered." While both hands are well preserved, he said, the painting was "aggressively over cleaned," resulting in abrasion of the whole surface, "especially in the face and hair of Christ."
Christie's maintains that it was upfront about the much-restored, damaged condition of the oil-on-panel, which shows Christ with his right hand raised in blessing and his left holding a crystal orb.
But Christie's was also slow to release an official condition report and its authenticity warranty on the Leonardo runs out in five years, as it does on all lots bought at its auctions, according to the small print in the back of its sale catalog.
The auction house has also played down the painting's volatile sales history.
The artwork has been the subject of legal disputes and amassed a price history that ranges from less than $10,000 in 2005, when it was spotted at an estate auction, to $200 million when it was first offered for sale by a consortium of three dealers in 2012. But no institution besides the Dallas Museum of Art, which in 2012 made an undisclosed offer on the painting, showed public interest in buying it. Finally, in 2013, Sotheby's sold it privately for $80 million to Yves Bouvier, a Swiss art dealer and businessman. Soon afterward, he sold it for $127.5 million, to the family trust of the Russian billionaire collector Dmitry E. Rybolovlev. Mr. Rybolovlev's family trust was the seller on Wednesday night.
There was speculation that Liu Yiqian, a Chinese billionaire and co-founder with his wife of the Long Museum in Shanghai, may have been among the bidders. In recent years, the former taxi-driver-turned-power collector has become known for his splashy, record-breaking art purchases, including an Amedeo Modigliani nude painting for $170.4 million at a Christie's auction in 2015. But in a message sent to a reporter via WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, Mr. Liu said he was not among the bidders for the Leonardo.
On Thursday morning, soon after the final sale was announced, Mr. Liu posted a message on his WeChat social media feed. "Da Vinci's Savior sold for 400 million USD, congratulations to the buyer," he wrote. "Feeling kind of defeated right now."

Broad Declines Reflect a Market Losing Its Momentum

Full text: Technology companies led U.S. stocks lower Wednesday, giving the market its biggest loss since early September. Grocery stores and packaged foods and beverage companies also accounted for much of the decline. Energy stocks fell as the price of crude oil closed lower a day after its biggest loss since October. Banks and phone companies eked out modest gains.
The latest slide extended the market's losses from a day earlier and added to its pullback in November.
Unlike October's broad market rally, fewer stocks and sectors have been notching gains this month, and the latest market decline reflects that, noted Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird.
"And that's exemplary of a market that's losing momentum, and that's the real story here," Bittles said. "It means the market is struggling here, and it could mean that a lot of the good news on the economy, earnings and even the potential for a tax-reform bill are to a great extent already built into current prices."
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14.25 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,564.62. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 138.19 points, or 0.6 percent, to 23,271.28. The Nasdaq composite slid 31.66 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,706.21. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gave up 7.16 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,464.09.
The major indexes are all in the red for the month, but still near their most recent record highs.
Stocks were headed lower from the get-go on Wednesday as investors weighed a batch of new government data on inflation, retail sales and manufacturing.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2 percent in October, while a closely watched report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed manufacturing expanded at a slower pace this month in New York, but remained at a healthy level. In addition, the Labor Department said consumer prices edged up 0.1 percent last month, the smallest gain in three months. That followed a report earlier this week showing that prices at the wholesale level spiked last month.
"The inflation data that was released this week are basically giving a green light to the Fed to raise rates," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
Investors were keeping an eye on Washington, where Senate Republicans began pushing their version of a major tax overhaul that would slash corporate taxes.
But the Senate measure was complicated by the last-minute inclusion of a repeal of the section of the Affordable Care Act that requires Americans to get insurance coverage. The legislative push also appeared to hit a snag Wednesday, when Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he opposes the GOP tax bill, saying it helps corporations more than other businesses.
Expectations of a big business tax cut have helped lift the market higher this year.
The uncertainty over the fate and timing of the tax bill contributed to growing market unease.
The VIX index, which tracks expected price swings in the S&P 500, jumped 13 percent Wednesday, a three-month high. The index closed at a record low as recently as Nov. 3.
A sell-off in high-yield bonds may be another potential red flag for the market. An exchange-traded fund that tracks high-yield bonds, the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, has declined 2.2 percent since Oct. 24 and is at its lowest level since March.
"That would suggest, as opposed to the economy steaming ahead, that some folks are looking for the economy maybe to slow next year," said Bittles.
Technology sector stocks, which have done far better than the rest of the market this year, took some of the biggest losses Wednesday. Chipmaker Nvidia lost $4.20, or 2 percent, to $209.98. Macom Solutions Technology Holdings slumped 18 percent after the chipmaker's latest quarterly results fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The stock gave up $6.59 to $30.02.
Companies that make consumer products also were big decliners. General Mills slid $1.59, or 2.9 percent, to $52.53.
Target slumped 9.9 percent after the retailer issued a weak profit forecast for the quarter including the holiday season. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, tumbling $5.93 to $54.16.
IBM fell 1.2 percent after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it sold another chunk of the technology company's stock. IBM declined $1.79 to $147.10.
Investors bid up shares in banks and other financial companies. Bank of America climbed 55 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $26.79.
Crude oil prices pared some of their early losses, but still finished lower.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 37 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $55.33 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 34 cents, or 0.5 percent, to close at $61.87 a barrel in London.
A report from the International Energy Agency pointing to strong production growth in the years ahead, particularly in the U.S., has weighed on oil prices this week. That's pulled down energy stocks, such as Halliburton. The stock dropped $1.25, or 2.9 percent, to $41.69.
In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline gave up 2 cents to $1.74 a gallon. Heating oil was little changed at $1.91 a gallon. Natural gas declined 2 cents to $3.08 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell $5.20 to $1,277.70 an ounce. Silver slid 10 cents to $16.97 an ounce. Copper shed 1 cent to $3.06 a pound.
The dollar fell to 112.89 yen from 113.40 yen on Tuesday. The euro was unchanged at $1.1794.
Major stock indexes in Europe also closed lower. Germany's DAX fell 0.4 percent, while the CAC 40 in France slid 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.6 percent lower.
Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index tumbled 1.6 percent as manufacturers' shares were stung by a stronger yen. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.0 percent, while Australia's S&P ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent. The Kospi of South Korea declined 0.3 percent.

Full text: The Toys "R" Us world headquarters are on a sprawling wooded campus next to a reservoir in Wayne, N.J., on a street that bears the name of the company's iconic mascot, Geoffrey the giraffe. But in September, when Toys "R" Us filed for one of the largest bankruptcies of the year, it did not go to nearby Newark.
Instead, the toy company followed an increasing number of corporations -- from Gymboree to a major coal company to a Pennsylvania fracking company -- that are choosing to file for bankruptcy in Richmond, Va.
In recent years, Richmond has become the destination wedding spot for failed companies. The United States Bankruptcy Court there offers several features attractive to the executives, bankers and lawyers trying to get an edge in the proceedings.
First, Richmond's bankruptcy court offers a so-called rocket docket that moves cases along swiftly. Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings can be laborious proceedings that drag on for years. Gymboree's bankruptcy was completed in less than four months.
Second, the legal record in that court district includes precedents favorable to companies, like making it easier to walk away from union contracts.
But perhaps one of the biggest draws, according to bankruptcy lawyers and academics, is the hefty rates lawyers are able to charge there. The New York law firm representing Toys "R" Us, Kirkland & Ellis, told the judge that its lawyers were charging as much as $1,745 an hour. That is 25 percent more than the average highest rate in 10 of the largest bankruptcies this year, according an analysis by The New York Times.
"The numbers are stratospheric," said Kevin Barrett, a lawyer at the firm Bailey Glasser, who represented the State of West Virginia in two coal bankruptcy cases filed in Richmond.
Companies can file for bankruptcy in a court district where they have an affiliate -- a loophole that allows them to shop for the court they think will provide the best outcome.
For an affiliate to be incorporated in Virginia, it can use a "registered agent" with a local address, according to the state. For its bankruptcy filing, state records show, Toys "R" Us used a Richmond affiliate whose registered agent has an office in downtown Richmond.
Representatives for Kirkland & Ellis and Toys "R" Us declined to comment for this article. So did a spokesman for the federal bankruptcy court in Richmond.
It's not just the lawyers who stand to gain from the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy. The bankers and other professionals who helped arrange $3.1 billion in new debt to keep the company operating in bankruptcy will collect $96 million in fees, according to a court document filed by Toys "R" Us.
Executives at bankrupt companies typically agree to the high fees, bankruptcy experts say, because they think the cost will have been worth it if the lawyers and bankers can save their business. Kirkland & Ellis has a long track record of getting companies back on their feet in bankruptcy.
The two judges in Richmond are also known for their expertise. "The judges understand the complexities of large corporate bankruptcies and can handle cases expeditiously," said Dion Hayes, a local bankruptcy lawyer.
Still, the huge fees can eat into the money that is left over for small creditors -- typically vendors, suppliers and pensioners.
In the Toys "R" Us case, dozens of suppliers of scooters, rubber duckies and teething rings could lose millions in the bankruptcy.
Linda Parry Murphy, chief executive of Product Launchers, a distributor for several small toy suppliers, said her clients were owed about $1.2 million from Toys "R" Us. She worries that they may recover as little as $120,000.
"For some of these clients it was very devastating," she said.
Nationally, professional fees for bankruptcies have been increasing about 9.5 percent a year, about four times the rate of inflation, according to Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Mr. LoPucki said the higher fees were fueled, in part, by court shopping. Lawyers advising troubled companies tend to gravitate to courts that approve their fees, he said. Judges who balk at high fees see far fewer cases.
"They become pariah courts," Mr. LoPucki said.
Down the road, creditors in the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy can challenge how many hours the lawyers bill at the high rates. Another check on the costs is the United States Trustee Program, which helps oversee the process and can object if the legal bill seems unreasonable.
The vast majority of companies -- more than 76 percent -- now file for bankruptcy in a different state from where they are based, Mr. LoPucki said.
Delaware and New York -- which have long been popular bankruptcy destinations -- still see the lion's share of the filings.
But Richmond is gaining ground. In July, an article in The Virginia Lawyers Weekly declared the city a "bankruptcy haven" and quoted a local lawyer who said the high legal fees charged there would give judges in other courts a "heart attack."
Then in September, the court landed the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy.
Toys "R" Us started out in 1948 as a company that sold cribs and strollers out of the ground floor of a house in Washington, D.C.
It expanded into the world's leading toy retailer with about 2,000 stores and an advertising jingle -- "I Don't Want to Grow Up, I'm a Toys 'R' Us Kid" -- that could stick in its customers' heads like glue.
Seeing opportunity in a consolidated toy industry, the private equity investors Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust bought the company in 2005 and loaded it up with debt that today stands at $5.3 billion. It was a burden that proved too much to overcome.
Toys "R" Us has dozens of affiliates around the globe employing 64,000 people. But when it came time to file for bankruptcy, the company opted for Richmond, where its law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, had success in the past.
The law firm had represented Patriot Coal, a coal miner based in West Virginia that filed for bankruptcy twice in four years, most recently in Richmond in 2015.
In that case, the most profitable mines went to another coal company backed by Patriot's lenders, while the others were closed.
Mr. Barrett, the lawyer who represented the State of West Virginia in that case, was stunned by the fees.
"I remember five lawyers in one meeting, and I joked that meeting cost $10,000," he said.
This year, Kirkland worked on another bankruptcy case in Richmond -- Gymboree, the children's clothing retailer, based in San Francisco.
Like Toys "R" Us, Gymboree was owned by private equity and was weighed down by debt.
After emerging from bankruptcy in September, the company closed 350 of its stores across the country, but the retailer is still in business.
The Toys "R" Us bankruptcy case kicked off in September at a packed hearing. Kirkland & Ellis set the stage by playing the Toys "R" Us theme song for the judge.
The toy company, the lawyer explained, had tried to turn around its business. But it couldn't afford to sufficiently spruce up its stores and compete with retailers like Walmart and Amazon because it had billions of dollars in debt. He emphasized how Toys "R" Us had brought joy to many children and how the bankruptcy process would help the company survive.
"We are all Toys 'R' Us kids," he said.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- The foreign ministers of the European Union approved an arms embargo against Venezuela on Monday as part of what they called "restrictive measures" to pressure the administration of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro to strengthen the rule of law and democracy. The ministers also established the legal framework for sanctions, including travel bans and the freezing of assets, against government officials, a step the Trump administration has taken against dozens of Venezuelan government officials, including Mr. Maduro.
But the ministers stopped short of naming any specific officials who might be subject to such penalties, saying they still hoped Venezuela could find a "peaceful negotiated way" out of its economic and political crises.
"The primary responsibility for ending the crisis in Venezuela lies in the country," the ministers said in a statement. "The E.U. calls upon the government to urgently restore democratic legitimacy, including through free and fair elections, and on the opposition to continue engaging in a united manner towards a negotiated solution to the current tensions, in the interest of the country."
Opposition leaders in Venezuela announced last week that they planned to resume stalled face-to-face negotiations with the Maduro administration this week in the Dominican Republic. The opposition said it was intent on establishing conditions for a fair and democratic presidential election next year.
The new European pressure on Venezuela comes as the country reels from an economic crisis that has caused near-quadruple-digit inflation, driven up poverty rates, ruined public services and depleted stocks in grocery stores and pharmacies, causing widespread hardship and compelling the emigration of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.
Though Mr. Maduro is widely unpopular, he has used the judiciary and other divisions of government to tighten his hold on power, jail prominent critics and demoralize the opposition, which has suffered deep schisms following a dismal showing in regional elections last month in which the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela was able to buttress its dominance.
The European Union's foreign ministers cited those elections, which were scarred by allegations of fraud and electoral trickery, as an impetus for its decision on Monday, and they called on the Maduro administration to allow "a comprehensive and independent audit" of the results.
"These developments have accentuated the political polarization in the country," the group said.
In a statement, the Maduro administration called the new European restrictions "illegal, absurd and ineffective."
Also on Monday, the government, seeking to ease Venezuela's economic crisis and avoid a default, began talks in Caracas on renegotiating a crushing foreign debt that has drained its treasury of money to import food and medicine.
Though many major investors around the world balked at an invitation to the meeting, citing safety concerns amid the capital's violence and the possibility they could run afoul of American sanctions, scores of bondholders or their representatives attended the hourlong gathering. It was held at a regal government building here known as the White Palace.
But government officials at the meeting presented no firm proposals to attendees, Reuters reported, and no future gatherings were scheduled. That left bondholders and analysts struggling to figure out whether the Maduro administration had any sort of strategy to resolve its debt problem.
"I don't think they have a fully constructed plan," said Diego Ferro, an executive at Greylock Capital, an investment house that holds Venezuelan bonds though its representatives did not attend the meeting. "To organize this meeting in Caracas at this moment seemed to be more of a political statement on their part than to have a really constructive dialogue. Nothing should really surprise."
Mr. Maduro has said he hopes to restructure Venezuela's $63 billion in bonds, most of them issued by the government and the state-run oil company, PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa. He has made payments on the country's foreign debt a cornerstone of his economic policy, even at the expense of food, medicine and other critical imports for the country.
Over the weekend, Mr. Maduro reiterated that commitment, according to news services, declaring that Venezuela would "never" declare default.
But many analysts both in Venezuela and abroad have questioned the sincerity of Mr. Maduro's attempt to refinance the debt, saying that were he indeed serious, he would not have named Tareck El Aissami, his vice president, as head of the effort. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Mr. El Aissami this year, barring American financial institutions from doing business with him.
All told, Venezuela owes more than $120 billion, including the bond debts, oil payments to Russia and China and outstanding claims by oil service companies.
Further complicating the economic picture for Venezuela, its crude production has dropped below two million barrels per day, to its lowest point in 28 years. Oil is the government's main source of revenue.
The economic and political pressures on Venezuela were also underscored on Monday at the United Nations, where the Security Council held an informal meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation in Venezuela and its threat to regional stability.
Notably absent was Venezuela's ambassador, Rafael RamÃ­rez, who held a news conference in which he denounced the meeting as "a hostile act" by the United States and a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.
"We will resolve our issues on our own and in peace," he declared in a Twitter post.
China and Russia, both Security Council members, refused to attend, suggesting that any push by the United States and others for Council action on Venezuela would probably meet strong resistance.
Separately in New York, a derivatives industry trade organization met to discuss Venezuela's debt situation and whether late bond payments earlier this month from PetrÃ³leos de Venezuela constituted a so-called credit event. Such a determination by the group, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, might allow debt holders to collect on a kind of insurance against default known as credit default swaps.
The group postponed its decision until Tuesday.

Full text: BERLIN -- It's the spring of 1929, and this city is a fast-moving modern metropolis where artistic and sexual experimentation flourishes against a backdrop of organized crime, political street battles and a fragile democratic order. Welcome to the world of "Babylon Berlin."
This new epic crime drama, set during the Weimar Republic, the chaotic 15-year era that preceded the Third Reich, is widely predicted to become an international television sensation. Reportedly the most expensive German-language TV show ever produced, "Babylon Berlin" aims to build on the success of other recent German hits, like "Deutschland '83" and "The Same Sky."
This ambitious 16-part, two-season show has already been sold to 60 TV markets. It had its British premiere on Sunday night on Sky Atlantic and will begin streaming on Netflix in the United States on Jan. 30.
Based on the best-selling novels by Volker Kutscher, the show centers on Gereon Rath, a police detective from Cologne played by Volker Bruch, who arrives in the unfamiliar capital to investigate a blackmail plot involving a sadomasochistic porn film.
The troubled young detective is assisted by Charlotte Ritter, a police typist played by Liv Lisa Fries, who strives to make the most of Weimar Berlin's new freedoms to escape the poverty of her bleak, overcrowded tenement. By day she picks up sporadic work at police headquarters, and by night turns tricks at Moka Efti, a nightclub and temple to hedonism.
The complicated plot encompasses a Russian freight train carrying poison gas and gold; secret military maneuvers; and a brutal May Day confrontation between police and Communists. There are Soviet agents and Trotskyist agitators, a cross-dressing jazz singer, an Armenian mafia boss and a rich industrialist in cahoots with a group of army officers.
The star of the show, however, is Berlin. The lavish production lovingly recreates the city's 1920s streets, cafes and nightclubs. Around 70 percent of the series was shot on location, with the rest filmed on a massive set at the historic Babelsberg studios.
Costing 38 million euros (about $44 million) to produce, the 180-day shoot involved three crews and three writer/directors: Tom Tykwer (of "Perfume" and "Run Lola Run" fame), Achim von Borries and Henk Handloegten, who had all long sought to work together on a project based on this period.
"The three of us had the idea to do a big panoramic view of the society at the end of the 1920s, the Weimar Republic, before we actually knew the novels," Mr. Handloegten said.
Paul Cooke, professor of world cinemas at the University of Leeds, said TV depictions of this period have been rare. "Most obviously, Fassbinder's 'Berlin Alexanderplatz,' which was a big hit in the 1970s," he said. "It's touched on in Edgar Reitz's 'Heimat,' which was a huge international hit. But it's later periods of history that tend to be the focus of German productions that do well internationally."
The makers of "Babylon Berlin," however, were interested in exploring the prelude to the Third Reich. "All these people didn't fall from the sky as Nazis," Mr. Handloegten said. "They had to become Nazis."
In writing the screenplay, the creators made some key changes to the books. As well as expanding the political elements, they turned Gereon Rath into a more sympathetic character, traumatized by his experiences in World War I, prone to fits of shaking and addicted to morphine.
Charlotte Ritter is no longer a bourgeois law student but a street-smart working-class woman. "We felt very strongly that we should have a main character from this proletarian background, because Berlin was always a poor city," Mr. Handloegten explained.
Work has already begun on Season 3, and there's plenty more source material to draw on. Mr. Kutscher has already written six Gereon Rath novels and plans another three, culminating with Kristallnacht in 1938.
The TV adaptation is already a commercial and critical hit at home. Within a week of its German premiere on Oct. 13, the first episode had been watched by 1.2 million people -- a German viewing figure bested only by "Game of Thrones."
"The show is epic, the story is complex," the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel wrote. "The TV version gives the material what it requires while never taking away the striking images, ambiguous characters and exciting story: everything needed to suck you in."
The weekly magazine Der Spiegel described the show as a "masterpiece" and a "great, dizzying panorama," and predicted that it could be "the first big German TV production since 'Das Boot' to have really relevant success abroad."
The praise, however, has not been universal. The Munich-based daily SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung said: "The period it depicts may have been sensuous, but the show is not. The world of 'Babylon Berlin' remains behind glass."
In Britain, the reception has been positive so far. "It's all wonderfully gripping, and Bruch has the most pained, expressive eyes you'll see all year," the critic for The Financial Times wrote. "With the arrival of Charlotte ... drab secretary by day, jazz baby by night, we enter the youthful Berlin of dance crazes and desperate excess."
Some critics have also drawn parallels to current political events, like the American election of Donald J. Trump, the Brexit vote, and the arrival of the far-right Alternative for Germany in the Bundestag.
"The echoes of the 'populism' of the 1930s with what is going on right now is certainly a link that is being made," Professor Cooke said. "How far this is played out in the show itself remains to be seen. But it is fair to say that these kinds of historical dramas always tend to use the past as a cipher for the present."
But Hajo Funke, professor of political science at the Free University Berlin, cautions against making too many comparisons. "Economically, socially and politically, it was a totally different situation," he said.
"In 1929, there was a brief phase of stability after the terrible shock at the end of World War I, the inflation crisis, the economic restrictions," Professor Funke added. "It was not at all clear if it would be possible to overcome the next crisis."
At the same time, he agrees that the show taps into the current mood. "It could serve to point to the dangers, to the destructive forces in society and politics," he said.
For the makers of "Babylon Berlin," it was crucial that the audience experience the past through the eyes of the protagonists.
In the first season, for example, Hitler is only mentioned once in passing. After all, Berlin was a left-wing bastion, and in the 1928 election, the Nazis got only 1.6 percent of the city's votes.
"In 1929, there were no Nazis in Berlin," said the producer Stefan Arndt. "You cannot see or even smell that there's danger coming."

Full text: According to news reports, Donald Trump wanted the House Republican tax "reform" bill to be called the Cut Cut Cut Act. Alas, he didn't get his wish, and it was instead given a boring name nobody can remember. But there's still time to change it! So let me propose, as one reader suggested, that it be renamed the Leona Helmsley Act, after the New York hotelier convicted of tax evasion, who famously declared that "only the little people pay taxes." That, after all, is the main thrust of the bill. It hugely favors the wealthy over the middle class, which is pretty much always true of Republican proposals. But it's not just about favoring high incomes: It also systematically favors people who live off their assets, especially inherited wealth, over the little people -- that is, poor shlubs who actually have to work for a living.
To get an idea why, consider four hypothetical taxpayers and how they would fare under the G.O.P. bill.
First is the poster child family Paul Ryan keeps talking about, a family with two children making $59,000 a year. In the first year of the Cut Cut Cut Act, such a family would indeed receive a tax cut. But this cut comes from several special tax credits that are basically loss leaders to help sell the plan; they all either expire in later years or will get eroded by inflation. By 2027, with the plan fully phased in, that exemplary family would actually be facing a significant tax increase relative to current law.
Second, consider someone who is much further up the scale, but still works for a living. In the movie "Wall Street," Gordon Gekko sneers at "a $400,000-a-year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being comfortable." What would happen to that guy? Well, I've done some back-of-the envelope calculations: If you ignore deductions, he'd end up paying a few hundred dollars less in taxes. But once you take lost deductions into account, especially reduced deductions for state and local taxes, he almost certainly ends up facing a tax hike, not a cut.
And of course it's not just Wall Street stiffs who would find themselves in that situation: So would doctors, lawyers, engineers, and other well-paid professionals. Overall, the Tax Policy Center estimates that more than a quarter of the population would see taxes go up, not down, under the G.O.P. proposal; for those with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000, that fraction rises to more than 40 percent.
But what about owners of small businesses? Under current law, their business income is "passed through" to their personal income, and taxed accordingly. The Cut Cut Cut Act would instead allow people with such income to pay only 25 percent, a big tax break for those with high incomes. But this raises obvious possibilities for abuse, with every well-paid professional reclassifying herself or himself as a business.
To limit these abuses, the G.O.P. bill imposes rules that basically limit the 25 percent rate to "passive" income recipients. That is, you get the full tax break only if you own a business but don't, you know, actually run it.
Finally, let's imagine a very lucky individual -- let's arbitrarily call him Eric Trump -- who stands to inherit a stake in a business he doesn't run, plus a bunch of stock. He'll get his inheritance tax-free, because the estate tax gets phased out in the G.O.P. bill. He'll get to pay a low tax rate on his business income. And his stocks will pay higher dividends, because the G.O.P. bill also sharply cuts corporate tax rates, and most of the benefit of those cuts will probably flow to shareholders.
So when Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser, says that the bill's goal is "to deliver middle-class tax cuts to the hard-working families in this country," he's claiming that up is down and black is white. This bill does little or nothing for the middle class, and even among the affluent it's biased against those who work hard in favor of the idle rich.
Also let's not forget that tax increases on working Americans are only part of the story. This bill would also, according to the Congressional Budget Office, add $1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. You know what that means: If this bill or anything like it passes, Republicans will immediately revert to their previous pretense of being deficit hawks and start demanding spending cuts.
And since federal spending is dominated by programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- that benefit the middle and working classes, the end result of this tax bill would be to leave most working Americans, even those who wouldn't face direct tax increases, worse off, all for the benefit of a tiny minority, especially those who haven't even worked for their wealth.
You might wonder how Republicans imagine that they can get away with this. But anyone who has paid attention to U.S. politics knows the answer. First, they will lie, unashamedly, about what their bill actually does. Second, they will try to distract working-class voters by stoking racial animosity. That didn't work too well in Tuesday's elections, but they'll keep on trying.

To do so, they're cutting billions of dollars in tax benefits to people trying to raise children, pay for college, buy a home or invest in renewable energy. That is why taxes would go up for about 45 percent of middle-class taxpayers by 2026 under the House bill, according to an analysis by The Times. By contrast, the people in the top 1 percent of income will get an average tax cut of $64,720 a year by 2027, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Even the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation concludes that the tax cuts are heavily tilted toward the rich. Yet, the Republicans may take the knife to even more middle class benefits, because the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the bill would overshoot the $1.5 trillion target by nearly $200 billion.
If the bill exceeded the $1.5 trillion deficit threshold, it would have to be considered under rules requiring 60 votes in the Senate for passage, rather than a simple 51 vote majority. But whether the provisions in the bill are procedural necessities or just incredibly meanspirited, these are some ways they could hurt your family if you:
Are planning to adopt a child: The bill eliminates the adoption tax credit, which is worth $13,570 per child to parents dealing with adoption procedures that can cost tens of thousand of dollars. This would offset $3.8 billion in tax cuts over 10 years -- maybe not much in a federal budget of $4 trillion a year, but every dollar counts!
Have or develop chronic illnesses: Republicans want to get rid of the medical expenses deduction, which is primarily used by families grappling with serious health problems. Nearly nine million taxpayers deducted $84 billion in such expenses from their taxes in just 2015; eliminating it would offset about $182 billion in tax cuts over 10 years.
Have dependents you need to take care of: Under the proposal, dependent-care benefits that families receive from employers for things like day care or elder care, including flexible spending accounts, will become taxable. More than one-third of private sector workers and more than half of state and local government workers had such benefits in 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Currently up to $5,000 a year in such benefits are exempt from taxes. This provision would offset $6.5 billion in tax cuts.
Want to move for a better job: The bill would repeal the deduction for moving expenses when families take a new job that is at least 50 miles away. Not helping people move to areas with better economic opportunities would pay for $10.6 billion in tax cuts.
Want to keep up with inflation: One of the biggest changes in this bill is a technical one involving how income thresholds, credits and other parts of the tax code are adjusted for inflation. This will end up pushing middle-class taxpayers into higher brackets and making credits and deductions less valuable over time, all in the service of paying for $128 billion worth of tax cuts.
Want help buying a home: The Republicans want to end a program that lets state and local governments issue private-activity bonds to finance housing and let homeowners claim a tax credit on certain mortgages. This could reduce new affordable housing construction and renovations of existing properties, experts say. Chalk up $38.9 billion for tax cuts.
Need help paying for college: The bill repeals numerous education deductions and credits. It also makes taxable the value of the tuition and other benefits universities give to their graduate teaching and research assistants. Ditto for education benefits offered by employers to their workers. Who cares about educating the next generation when you can bring in an extra $65 billion as offsets for an enormous corporate tax cut.
Are an undocumented parent raising a child who is an American citizen: The House bill would require at least one parent to have a Social Security number to claim the refundable portion of child tax credit. Hurting young citizens in this way would add up to $21.7 billion.
Are an undocumented student: House Republicans want to require students to provide a Social Security number to claim access to the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tuition and related expenses. This measure will chip in $800 million.
Want to buy an electric car: The House bill would get rid of a $7,500 tax credit for electric car purchases starting with vehicles that hit the road next year; the measure would bring in a modest $200 million.
Want to invest in wind projects: The production tax credit for renewable energywill become less valuable under the Republican proposal, raising $12.3 billion in revenue.
It is not surprising that Republicans want to cut taxes on businesses and the wealthy. But they should stop pretending that this terrible proposal is a favor to average Americans, when many of them in fact will be left a good deal poorer.

Full text: In 2006, the endowments of Indiana University and Texas Christian University invested millions of dollars in a partnership, hoping to mint riches from oil, gas and coal. The partnership was formed by the Houston-based Quintana Capital Group, whose principals include Donald L. Evans, an influential Texan and longtime supporter of former President George W. Bush. Little more than a year earlier, Mr. Evans had left his cabinet position as commerce secretary.
Though the group had an impressive Texas pedigree, presidential cachet and ambitions for operations in the United States, the new partnership was established in the Cayman Islands. The founders promised their university and nonprofit investors that the partnership would try to avoid federal taxes by exploiting a loophole called "blocker corporations," which are typically established in tax havens around the world.
A trove of millions of leaked documents from a Bermuda-based law firm, Appleby, reflects some of the tax wizardry used by American colleges and universities. Schools have increasingly turned to secretive offshore investments, the files show, which let them swell their endowments with blocker corporations, and avoid scrutiny of ventures involving fossil fuels or other issues that could set off campus controversy.
Buoyed by lucrative tax breaks, college endowments have amassed more than $500 billion nationwide. The wealth is concentrated in a small group of schools, tilting toward private institutions like those in the Ivy League and other highly selective colleges. About 11 percent of higher-education institutions in the United States hold 74 percent of the money, according to an analysis in 2015 by the Congressional Research Service.
"It's overwhelmingly weighted towards the 1 percent," said Dean Zerbe, former tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee. "Most of the schools are the most elites in the country."
The House Republican tax plan includes a 1.4 percent tax on the investment income of private colleges and universities with endowment assets of $250,000 or more per student. It would not apply to public schools. If passed, the new tax would affect about 70 elite private colleges, though it would not touch the type of offshore benefits the Texan partnership pursued.
On Monday, 45 education groups declared their opposition to the bill in a letter to Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Tax 'Blockers'
College and university endowment earnings are usually tax-exempt. But as endowments have sought greater investment returns in recent years, they have shifted more of their money out of traditional holdings like United States equities to alternative, potentially more lucrative investments. These include private equity and hedge funds that frequently borrow money, opening them up to tax consequences.
When schools earn income from enterprises unrelated to their core educational missions, they can be required to pay a tax that was intended to prevent nonprofits from competing unfairly with for-profit businesses.
Establishing another corporate layer between private equity funds and endowments effectively blocks any taxable income from flowing to the endowments, the reason they are called blocker corporations. The tax is instead owed by the corporations, which are established in no-tax or low-tax jurisdictions like the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin Islands.
"Congress is essentially subsidizing nonprofits by allowing them to engage in these transactions," said Norman I. Silber, a law professor at Hofstra University who co-authored a paper on blocker corporations in 2015. "They're allowing them to borrow so that they can build up their endowments."
The use of blocker corporations has raised concerns among policymakers in recent years. That's partly because they cost the United States Treasury millions of dollars, but also because they legitimize an opaque offshore network sometimes used for nefarious purposes.
"They're not cheating. They're not hiding money or disguising money," said Samuel Brunson, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago who has studied endowment taxation. "But they're adding money to a system that allows people, if they want to hide their money, to do it." Not only do the universities benefit -- so does the wealthy and influential private equity industry.
Perhaps illustrating the sensitivity of the topic, officials at most of the college and university endowments that use blocker corporations, including Colgate, Dartmouth, Duke and Stanford, declined to comment specifically, citing longstanding policies against discussing their investments. Among them was Matt Kavgian, the director of strategic communications for Indiana University's $2 billion endowment, which had invested $10 million with Quintana.
An exception was the Quintana shareholder Texas Christian University, whose chief investment officer, Jim Hille, acknowledged that the $1.5 billion endowment had used blocker corporations. Mr. Hille said the decision to use one often came down to whether the expected return would offset the cost of establishing a blocker corporation.
References to such corporations in the Appleby files, shared with The New York Times by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which obtained them from the German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, date back at least to 2003. At that time, five elite schools -- Columbia University, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, Stanford University and Johns Hopkins University -- became partners in a Bermuda-based group called H&F Investors Blocker.
H&F Investors Blocker was formed to invest with one of the largest private equity firms, Hellman & Friedman, in shares of Axel Springer, a German publisher of newspapers and magazines.
Minutes from meetings at Appleby's office in Hamilton, Bermuda, never mention tax avoidance or even explain why the word "blocker" is used in the partnership's title. But an audit by Ernst & Young, contained in the minutes, shows that H&F Investors Blocker would owe no federal income tax.
By 2008, the University of Texas system -- whose endowment last year was $24.2 billion, behind Harvard's ($34.5 billion) and Yale's ($25.4 billion) -- asked Appleby to set up a Cayman Islands company called TX Liquidity Capital so "certain tax advantages will accrue to the system," documents show.
Colgate University, with an endowment worth $822 million last year, stood to benefit from blocker corporations in 2008 when it invested in Genstar Capital, a private equity fund specializing in leveraged buyouts, according to the records. One investor in that Cayman Islands partnership, called Genstar Capital Partners V HV, took pains to include a handwritten a note near his signature: "elect to invest through the blocker." Other investors were Dartmouth, Stanford and a Duke fund called Gothic Corporation.
A Shift in Public Attitude
While legal, blocker corporations are part of a system of endowment tax breaks fueling an undercurrent of populist anger. Many students across the country struggle under massive college debt. At the same time, critics say, some wealthy schools use these tax advantages to stockpile endowments that exceed the gross national product of entire countries.
Last year, three influential Republican legislators, led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, sent a letter to 56 private universities with endowments of $1 billion or more, requesting information on "the numerous tax preferences" they enjoy. "Despite these large and growing endowments," the letter said, "many colleges and universities have raised tuition far in excess of inflation."
So far, universities have mobilized lobbyists to emphasize the public benefits they deliver, beating back challenges to their tax breaks. But there is evidence that the mood has shifted, said Charlie Eaton, a professor at the University of California, Merced, who has studied endowment tax breaks.
"In some ways, the anti-elite and anti-university spirit of Trumpism could create a favorable environment on Capitol Hill for some kind of action on this," Dr. Eaton said. "That's part of the reason universities urgently need to grapple with this. Because people genuinely feel that our elite universities have become islands of wealth."
In a study this year, Dr. Eaton estimated that a trio of tax breaks benefiting universities costs federal taxpayers $19.6 billion a year. Taxpayers, many of them wealthy, get breaks when they donate to colleges. Tax-free municipal bonds allow schools to borrow money at low rates. And for the most part, endowment investment returns are tax-free.
Controversial Ventures
Multiple Appleby documents offer a glimpse into the complex financial transactions and investments, some controversial, that university endowments engage in all over the world, aside from using blockers.
Universities have been under pressure from both students and activists to shift to "green" investments in response to climate change, as well as to take social policy and global governance issues into account in investments.
The Appleby records show that investment funds of Columbia and Duke, both ranked in the top 20 endowments, held shares as recently as 2015 in Ferrous Resources, registered in the Isle of Man. Its primary business is iron mining in Brazil.
The company drew criticism there with a planned 480 kilometer pipeline to transport iron slurry from a mine in Minas Gerais to a port.
"Major demonstrations took place against this project, which culminated in the creation of a campaign,"' researchers wrote in a 2015 paper published in the journal Society & Nature.
A 2010 environmental study of the pipeline revealed that more than 110,000 people might be affected by noise, dust, soil degradation and water quality issues. The project was postponed in 2012 after a downturn in iron prices.
The company, Ferrous Resouces, declined to comment, except to say that the project had been discontinued.
Columbia, which owned more than eight million shares in Ferrous Recources, or 1.1 percent of the company, declined to comment. Various investment funds connected to Duke, which also declined to comment, held more than two million shares in the company.
While some schools have announced shifts away from controversial investments, others have pointed out that divesting from fossil fuels would probably lead to a significant drop in operating funds.
Underscoring endowments' reliance on hydrocarbon holdings, 10 schools invested in a Cayman Islands partnership in 2012 known as EnCap Energy Capital Fund IX-C, part of EnCap Investments, a private equity firm known for the acquisition and development of North American oil and gas properties.
Among the investors were the University of Alabama, DePauw, Northeastern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Reed College, Rutgers, Syracuse, Texas Tech and Washington State.
Texas Christian University, Top, has a $1.5 Billion Endowment, and Indiana University, Above, has an Endowment of $2 Billion. In 2006, Both Schools Invested Millions in an Oil, Gas and Coal Partnership Established in the Cayman Islands, a Tax Haven.

Full text: Two decades have passed since diplomats from around the world emerged from a conference hall in Kyoto, Japan, with what was billed as the first deal ever to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases that are relentlessly warming the earth's atmosphere. Climate diplomacy has made a lot of progress since then. All but one of the world's nations -- the United States -- have enlisted in the cause, making concrete commitments to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
Leaving aside President Trump's past declarations that climate change is a hoax, there are heartening signs that the strategy may work: Global carbon-dioxide emissions have stopped rising. Coal use in China may have peaked. The price of wind turbines and solar panels is plummeting, putting renewable energy within the reach of meager budgets in the developing world.
And yet as climate diplomats gather this week in Bonn, Germany, for the 23rd Conference of the Parties under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, I would like to point their attention to a different, perhaps gloomier statistic: the world's carbon intensity of energy.
The term refers to a measure of the amount of CO2 spewed into the air for each unit of energy consumed. It offers some bad news: It has not budged since that chilly autumn day in Kyoto 20 years ago. Even among the highly industrialized nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the carbon intensity of energy has declined by a paltry 4 percent since then, according to the International Energy Agency.
This statistic, alone, puts a big question mark over the strategies deployed around the world to replace fossil energy. In a nutshell: Perhaps renewables are not the answer.
Over the past 10 years, governments and private investors have collectively spent $2 trillion on infrastructure to draw electricity from the wind and the sun, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Environmental Progress, a nonprofit that advocates nuclear power as an essential tool in the battle against climate change, says that exceeds the total cost of all nuclear plants built to date or under construction, adjusted for inflation.
Capacity from renewable sources has grown by leaps and bounds, outpacing growth from all other sources -- including coal, natural gas and nuclear power -- in recent years. Solar and wind capacity installed in 2015 was more than 10 times what the International Energy Agency had forecast a decade before.
Still, except for very limited exceptions, all this wind and sun has not brought about much decarbonization. Indeed, it has not added much clean power to the grid.
Environmental Progress performed an analysis of the evolution of the carbon intensity of energy in 68 countries since 1965. It found no correlation between the additions of solar and wind power and the carbon intensity of energy: Despite additions of renewable capacity, carbon intensity remained flat.
Some countries have bucked the trend. Denmark has sharply cut its carbon intensity with vast installations of wind turbines. And yet Germany's experience seems to be more typical. The country went all out in deploying wind and solar energy over the past 10 years, but the decline in carbon intensity was minuscule, from 212 to 203 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour.
The renewables-or-bust crowd on the periphery of the meeting in Bonn might argue that the sun and wind owe their poor track record at decarbonization in countries like Germany to the fact that nuclear power was being phased out at the same time that they came online.
It is true that Germans would have made more progress in the battle against climate change had they kept their nuclear reactors running and shut plants burning lignite instead. Still, there are other reasons behind renewables' poor track record in decarbonizing electricity.
Nuclear power faces hurdles beyond popular mistrust. Notably, reactors require a lot of capital up front. But renewables have a hard time producing power at a nuclear scale.
For instance, the Diablo Canyon reactor that California plans to close produces 14 times as much power as the Topaz solar farm, which requires 500 times as much land, according to Environmental Progress. The Wind Catcher farm in Oklahoma occupies 2,400 times as much land as Diablo Canyon but produces half as much energy.
The most worrisome aspect about the all-out push for a future powered by renewables has to do with cost: The price of turbines and solar panels may be falling, but the cost of integrating these intermittent sources of energy -- on when the wind blows and the sun shines; off when they don't -- is not. This alone will sharply curtail the climate benefits of renewable power.
Integrating renewable sources requires vast investments in electricity transmission -- to move power from intermittently windy and sunny places to places where power is consumed. It requires maintaining a backstop of idle plants that burn fossil fuel, for the times when there is no wind or sun to be had. It requires investing in power-storage systems at a large scale.
These costs will ultimately be reflected in power prices. One concern is that by raising the retail cost of electricity they will discourage electrification, encouraging consumers to rely on alternative energy sources like gas -- and pushing CO2 emissions up.
Another concern is that they will drive wholesale energy prices down too far. Because they produce the most energy when the sun is up and the wind is blowing, renewable generators can flood the grid at critical times of the day, slashing the price of power. This not only threatens the solvency of nuclear reactors, which cannot shut down on a dime and must therefore pay for the grid to accept their power, but also reduces the return on additional investment in renewables.
A study by Lion Hirth from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research found that the value of wind power falls from 110 percent of the average power price to 50 to 80 percent as the penetration of wind rises from zero to 30 percent of total consumption. "Competitive large-scale renewables deployment will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate," he concluded.
The diplomats in Bonn may be tempted to wave away these concerns. Thomas Bruckner of the University of Leipzig argues that in the case of Germany, expanding renewables to supply 80 percent of power by 2050 is "not a significant burden." Heavy German investment in renewable energy technologies over the last decade succeeded in bringing prices down, he contends; it will be much cheaper to go the rest of the way.
Perhaps. But there is some evidence that among investors, at least, the excitement may be waning. After half a decade of sustained increases, investment in solar and wind energy has been fairly flat since 2010, at around $250 billion per year. While that is a lot of money, it is nowhere near enough.
"We will need twice as much investment over a sustained period of time to get anywhere close to achieving 2 degrees," said Ethan Zindler, head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance in the Americas, referring to the objective of the world's climate diplomats: keep the average world temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above its average in the late 19th century.
I would suggest that the challenge is not just to raise more money. Building a zero-carbon energy system requires broader thinking about the technological mix.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Republican tax bill picks winners and losers across the income scale, including among millionaires. It is good news for people like President Trump but bad news for professional athletes. The bill delivers large breaks to high-earning owners of certain businesses, known as pass-through entities, which comprise most of Mr. Trump's business empire, and to heirs of large estates, such as Mr. Trump's children. So-called passive owners of businesses like real estate partnerships and hedge funds or even a local landscaping service, the example that Republicans pointed to when unveiling the plan last week, would enjoy the largest tax cut of all individual taxpayers under the bill. In part, that's because the legislative text includes a carve-out allowing these earners to maintain their state and local income tax deduction -- a valuable benefit that all other individual taxpayers could lose under the bill.
By contrast, millionaires who earn money solely from their high-salaried employment -- such as professional athletes -- would see their taxes go up if the bill becomes law, because of a steep increase in their personal tax rates.
Members of the House Ways and Means Committee met on Monday to begin officially debating the bill, a process that is expected to last several days as lawmakers seek to change various aspects of the sweeping legislation. On Monday, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Kevin Brady of Texas, unveiled an amendment that would restrict a tax break for hedge funds, private equity firms and other investment managers.
The so-called carried interest provision allows income earned by fund managers and others to be taxed at a lower capital gains rate, rather than as ordinary income. Mr. Brady's amendment would require investors such as hedge fund managers and real estate developers to hold on to assets for a period of three years to qualify for the lower capital gains rate on their income.
As drafted, the bill would raise taxes on an executive in one of Mr. Trump's companies who is paid solely through a seven-figured salary, while reducing taxes on Mr. Trump himself. Put another way, it would likely cut the taxes paid by Robert Kraft, the owner of football's New England Patriots, while likely raising taxes on Tom Brady, the team's quarterback.
However, Mr. Brady would likely benefit from the bill, to some extent, through his pass-through business TB12 LLC, which sells nutritional supplements online and operates a sports therapy center at the Patriots' practice facility.
Mr. Trump often says -- sometimes quoting a directive given to him by Mr. Kraft -- that he wants to cut taxes for the middle class, not for high earners. "The Democrats will say our tax bill is for the rich," Mr. Trump said last week, "but they know it's not."
Early analyses of the bill do not support that claim. Several, including analyses from Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation and the independent Tax Foundation, find that America's highest earners would, as a group, receive at least twice the tax cut that middle-class workers would get, as a percentage of their income.
The independent Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said on Monday that the top 1 percent of income earners, those who make just under $500,000 a year or more, would receive nearly half of the bill's tax benefits a decade from now. That group of taxpayers would consistently see income gains from the bill, and those gains would grow from 2.4 percent in 2018 to 2.5 percent in 2027, the institute said. Every other income group would see its percentage gains dwindle over time as a result of changes the bill makes to inflation calculations for certain tax benefits, and the fact that a middle-class tax credit it creates would expire after five years.
Still, the bill does not treat all top 1 percenters equally. An analysis using the economic modeling software TaxBrain suggests that a quarter of tax filers earning $1 million or more would see their taxes go up next year if the bill becomes law. No other income group would initially see that high a share of tax filers with tax increases.
The House bill mixes steep reductions in business tax rates with a blend of rate cuts and loophole closures on the personal side, producing a mixed bag for taxpayers up and down the income spectrum, but delivering the largest gains, in dollar and percentage terms, at the top.
"While every income group sees a benefit on average under this plan, high-income filers get the most relief, particularly those making above $1 million," said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, who has modeled the effects of the proposal. "That's true even before taking into account the impact of the corporate tax cuts."
Mr. Tedeschi said those results were intuitive, given the nature of the bill, which includes the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax and the reduction in rates for pass-through income to 25 percent from the top 39.6-percent rate now. That will amount to a large cut for many wealthy business owners.
High-income taxpayers who earn "labor income" -- money paid for work -- would not fare as well. The bill eliminates many deductions popular with higher-income taxpayers, including those for state and local income taxes paid. It would also cap at $500,000 the amount of new mortgage debt on which interest could be deducted, down from $1 million. And those high-earners are stuck with the top personal income tax rate of 39.6 percent -- though the threshold for paying it rises to $500,000, from $418,000 today, for individuals and $1 million, up from $471,000 today, for couples.
The bill also effectively increases that top rate even further by preventing those taxpayers from taking advantage of lower marginal rates along the income scale, a benefit which all other taxpayers enjoy. The bill proposes three individual income tax brackets: 12 percent for married couples earning up to $90,000; 25 percent for those earning up to $260,000 and 35 percent for those earning up to $1 million. A couple earning $350,000 would pay 12 percent on the first $90,000 of that income, 25 percent on the next $170,000 and 35 percent on the remaining $90,000. Those earning more than $1 million would gradually lose the benefits of the 12 percent bracket as their incomes rose.
Those changes serve to raise taxes on high-salaried employees who earn all their money through labor income. (Relatively low rates for investment income such as capital gains and dividends are left unchanged.) High-earning business owners, though, are largely shielded and in fact see substantial tax cuts on average, a distinction Republicans touted in their talking points when releasing the bill.
"Our legislation will ensure this much-needed tax relief goes to the local job creators it's designed to help," Republican leaders said in the talking points. That would be achieved "by distinguishing between the individual wage income of NBA All-Star Stephen Curry and the pass-through business income of Steve's Bike Shop."
Pass-through owners benefit from the reduced top rate on their income, to 25 percent from 39.6 percent. Some benefit more than others; passive owners, who do not work in their businesses, see all of their profits qualify for that lower rate. For active owners, who both work in their businesses and own them, the lower rate would apply to 30 percent of their profit income, while 70 percent was taxed at individual rates, unless the owners sought to have a different formula used.
Another provision in the bill, spotted by a team of New York University tax law experts on Sunday, appears to allow pass-through owners to continue deducting their state and local income taxes paid. A Ways and Means spokesman confirmed Monday that such owners "will continue to be able to deduct state and local taxes incurred in the conduct of a trade or business."
The N.Y.U. professors criticized the provision. "Employees paying state and local taxes on their wages would get their deduction denied, while still allowing owners of companies like partners in private equity or law firms or Donald Trump himself to continue to deduct their state and local income taxes," said David Kamin, an N.Y.U. law school professor who worked on tax policy in the Obama administration. "That would be deeply inequitable."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- For years, conservative activists have clamored for the ouster of John A. Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, who became a boogeyman for the right amid accusations that the agency was unfairly targeting Republicans. This week, their wish for his departure will finally be fulfilled. Mr. Koskinen's term in office ends on Thursday, concluding a tenure in which he sought to stabilize an institution that landed at the center of a political firestorm. But Mr. Koskinen, who spent much of his time on the job sparring with lawmakers at hostile congressional hearings, is leaving on his own terms and, he says, without regret.
"Survival is its own reward," Mr. Koskinen, 78, said in an interview in his office in the I.R.S. building.
His departure, however, will leave an already stretched agency without a permanent leader even as the possibility of the largest tax overhaul in a generation looms. Mr. Koskinen said that he applauded the efforts of Republican lawmakers to simplify the filing process, but that big changes to the tax code would complicate the tax collection process for the agency's thin staff.
Since 2010, the I.R.S.'s budget has fallen 18 percent, adjusted for inflation, and its enforcement staff has shrunk 23 percent. President Trump has proposed further cuts.
Mr. Koskinen was already enjoying retirement in 2013 when the Obama administration asked him to take the helm of the I.R.S. during a crisis fueled by allegations that it had wrongfully scrutinized Tea Party groups that had applied for tax-exempt status. He was known as a Mr. Fix-It in Washington for his work at the Office of Management and Budget during the 1990s government shutdown, for heading the team that averted the Y2K crisis at the turn of the century and for leading Freddie Mac during the financial crisis. The I.R.S. was a challenge he could not refuse.
Four years later, Mr. Koskinen has weathered a fusillade of attacks. Threatened with censure and impeachment on the grounds that he was misleading Congress about the actions of his predecessors, the commissioner refused to be pushed out of the job.
"Not a chance," Mr. Koskinen said when asked if he ever considered quitting.
His wry sense of humor remains intact. In his waning time, he jokes with his staff about all the "fun" of their daily tasks and counts down the days to his departure by tending to a makeshift pumpkin patch decorated with gourds bearing his likeness. Soon enough, Mr. Koskinen jokes as he distributes candy to a visitor, he will turn into a pumpkin and disappear.
Mr. Koskinen is spending his remaining days defending his agency's integrity and drumming up funding for a department that has been running on dwindling resources. Mr. Koskinen took some solace in an inspector general report released last month that showed the I.R.S. had actually been scrutinizing both liberal and conservative groups, yet he remains concerned that the coarse treatment he received from members of Congress could discourage future public servants from taking such jobs.
"I do think it's corrosive," said Mr. Koskinen, who compared the I.R.S. targeting scandal to the furor over the attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya, that led to investigations and congressional hearings. "When you have an issue that resonates, you don't want that issue to go away."
Earlier this year, Republicans were hopeful that Mr. Trump's arrival would finally secure Mr. Koskinen's dismissal. However, Mr. Koskinen and Mr. Trump have a good rapport, and the president took no action to remove him.
In fact, the two men have a long history together. In 1975, when Mr. Koskinen worked at the Palmieri Company, an asset management firm, he negotiated a deal with Mr. Trump over the sale of the Commodore Hotel in New York City from the bankrupt Penn Central Transportation Company.
The deal marked the beginning of Mr. Trump's foray into the Manhattan property market, and Mr. Koskinen recalled haggling with him for months over the details of the transaction. He even offered Mr. Trump advice, counseling him not to broadcast that he was just 29 years old when he was casting about for a $70 million loan.
"He was irrepressible, energetic and fun to deal with," Mr. Koskinen said.
While he has not spoken to Mr. Trump since they touched base before the inauguration, these days one of Mr. Koskinen's top priorities has been protecting Mr. Trump's tax returns. The president has refused to release his returns, and the documents have become the most sought-after leak in a capital that has never been so porous.
On the occasions that portions of Mr. Trump's returns have trickled out into the public domain in the past year, Mr. Koskinen was relieved when he learned that it was not the fault of the I.R.S., which by law must keep taxpayers' returns private.
"I told people to check what our process was and do whatever we could to isolate the returns," Mr. Koskinen said. "We've had people offering bounties and people offering millions of dollars for them."
Hard copies of Mr. Trump's tax returns are kept in a locked cabinet in a special office at the I.R.S. headquarters. Mr. Koskinen said the cabinet would eventually be replaced with a safe.
With hackers rampant, Mr. Trump's returns are not the only ones Mr. Koskinen is worried about. He said the agency gets more than a million "pings" per day from cyberattackers trying to gain access to taxpayer data, and he warned that budget cuts could make it difficult to safeguard the system.
Mr. Koskinen, who is a Democrat, said he hoped that the tension between Congress and the agency would abate once the Trump administration installed a successor.
Last month, the Treasury Department announced that David Kautter, its assistant secretary for tax policy, would serve as interim I.R.S. commissioner until Mr. Trump nominates someone to take the job for a full five-year term.
As for his own plans, Mr. Koskinen, who has a physics degree from Duke and a law degree from Yale, is keeping his options open. One possibility is that he will give retirement another try for a while.
"The plan," he said, "is to not answer the phone."
"Survival Is Its Own Reward," Said John A. Koskinen, the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner, Whose Term Ends On Thursday. (Photograph by Andrew Mangum for the New York Times)

Full text: One day in September, investors with fading summer tans mingled with their brokers over a three-course lunch at Cipriani in Lower Manhattan. Stocks were soaring and they swapped market tips and touted apps that allowed them to buy Bitcoin on the golf course. But the full stomachs and fat portfolios couldn't mask a sense of unease that pervaded the gathering: that the good times could suddenly end, derailed by nuclear war, political upheaval, a sudden rise in inflation or simply from stratospheric stocks crashing down to earth.
"Investors have never felt less secure, even though we are eight years into a bull market," Mark H. Haefele, the chief investment officer in the wealth management division at the investment bank UBS, told the crowd.
Rarely has a bull market been so unloved. Since March 2009, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has nearly quadrupled in value. This year, not only is the index up 15 percent, but it also seems to have stopped going down at all: October was the 12th straight month that the S.&P. has logged a positive return, the first time that has happened since 1935.
Yet in most conversations about the ever-rising stock market, brokers and investment advisers say, are dominated by the question of when it will all come to an end.
With the exception of President Trump, of course. On Saturday, in an interview on Air Force One, he once again took credit for the market's most recent record close on Friday.
Generally, this far into a bull market, euphoria kicks in. In 1929, shoeshine boys were doling out stock tips. In 1999, people were quitting their jobs to trade technology stocks from their living rooms.
These days, each successive stock market record seems to spur more hand-wringing than cheerleading. There is anxiety about overhyped shares, about the possibility of central banks withdrawing their support for global economies, even about markets simply being worryingly quiescent, as evidenced by the historically low readings of the volatility index known as the VIX.
"The VIX is too low, valuations are too high, the recovery is too old and the Fed is tightening," said Jim Paulsen, a veteran market strategist for the Leuthold Group in Minnesota. "For an old market dude like me, that is a scary list."
For several years now, Mr. Paulsen has been pleading with his clients to embrace the bull market. He has touted the breadth of the surge, in which no single sector has dramatically outrun another on the way up. And he has argued that worldwide growth with little inflation represents an unusual buying opportunity.
When he meets with clients or presents his views at conferences, though, the vast majority of the questions he receives are about what will ultimately bring the market crashing down.
"No one ever asks me when the S.&P. is going to blow past 3,000," he said of the benchmark stock index which ended trading on Friday at 2,587.84.
In fact, many analysts say that this so-called wall of worry is a positive sign. Investors may be piling into stocks and bonds, the thinking goes, but they are doing it with a measure of hesitation, which prevents some of the excesses that preceded previous market corrections.
That is not to say the market is without froth.
Since early 2009, the market capitalizations of Amazon and Apple, have soared from $26 billion and $74 billion to $532 billion and $872 billion.
The surge in the price of Bitcoin strikes many observers, including the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, as a classic portent of a bubble ready to pop.
Nor are many skeptics comforted by the fact that a former logistics manager at a Target store has made millions of dollars betting that the VIX index, Wall Street's closely watched fear gauge, will continue to fall.
These are not exactly the hallmarks of a restrained market.
To a large extent, the main drivers of the bull market have been sophisticated investors. Cash holdings by institutions and high-net-worth investors are at record low levels, which means they have been plowing money into the markets, according to numerous surveys.
Many retail investors, though, have remained on the sidelines -- a sharp contrast to the activity that preceded the bursting of previous bubbles.
According to Charles Schwab, which oversees $3.1 trillion in retail investments, the cash portion of client accounts was 11.1 percent as of September. That is down from 13 percent at the end of last year, but it is still a sizable ratio, which suggests that investors are not dumping their entire savings into the stock market, at least for now.
Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Schwab, said that until just recently, investors have been highly skeptical that the market's bull run was justified. However, in the last month or so, she has noticed a change in sentiment at client meetings and investor events.
"Some investors are conceding it's a bull market," she said. "They are looking for approval to jump on the bandwagon."
Still, she points out, retail investors have nowhere near the commitment to stocks that characterized past stock market booms.
Richard Bernstein, a former equity strategist at Merrill Lynch who now runs his own investment firm, has been bullish on stocks since 2009. He said that by this point of a strong equity run, buying stocks traditionally becomes widely accepted by all investor classes -- the consequence of one outstanding stock market year following another. Nobody wants to hear their neighbors boasting about their sizzling portfolios without having their own good news to share.
That is not the case this time. According to Mr. Bernstein, Wall Street experts on average advise investors to put 55 percent of their portfolios into stocks, as opposed to other assets such as bonds. That is considerably more conservative than the traditional recommendation that investors have up to 65 percent in stocks.
And many pension funds, instead of investing in the stock market, are putting money into private-equity investments, even though they incur hefty fees and their money generally gets locked up for 10 years.
"This is crazy," Mr. Bernstein said. "So when people say there is euphoria in the market and people are getting carried away, I say, 'who are we talking about?"'
Late last month, at an investor panel sponsored by the fund company Eaton Vance, Mr. Bernstein cited the rising South Korean stock market in arguing that fears of nuclear war were overblown and should not be used as an excuse for investors to avoid putting their money into stocks.
As usual, the pushback was quick in coming.
What happens if war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, a member of the audience asked him. Wasn't he ignoring that possibility?
Mr. Bernstein argued that investors should care the economic and corporate fundamentals -- not the remote chance that a calamity will strike.
"You cannot invest successfully," he said, "when you are crouched under your desk in a fetal position."

Tax Reform Should Help Families

Full text: Having kids is one of life's greatest experiences. It's also expensive. Between school supplies and summer camps, sports and doctor's visits, raising children increasingly takes more and more money. I should know -- my wife, Jeanette, and I have four. We've been blessed in recent years, but I know what it's like to start a family and struggle to make ends meet. My parents were immigrants who came to America with virtually nothing, and after I finished law school, I owed more than $100,000 in student loans. There's a reason many people feel it's harder to afford children now than in previous generations. It's true. According to federal data adjusted for inflation, from 1960 to 2015 the average annual cost of raising a child in a middle-income family rose by over $11,000. It's now estimated that middle-class parents will spend more than $230,000 over the course of their son or daughter's childhood -- and that doesn't even include college tuition.
Ask just about any couple and they'll tell you this absolutely influences their decisions about when to have children and how many to have. As the economist Lyman Stone has shown, by 2012, the average number of children American women intended to have was 2.37, and the total fertility rate was 1.88 -- a gap of about 0.5 children on average. Since the 1960s, there has been a consistent gap between intended and total fertility, even as the number of children American women desire to have and the total birthrate have declined over time.
There are many causes for this gap, but the increasing cost of childbearing clearly has played a role in its development. For example, think of families who delayed having children for a few years until they were more financially stable and may not have been able to have as many as they initially wanted. Or parents who wanted more children, but after their first or second realized they couldn't afford the combined cost of taking care of the child and reducing their work hours. The German economist Anna Raute has isolated this "opportunity cost" of childbearing as a significant factor in fertility decisions.
Tax reform is a key part of reinvigorating the American dream so that couples have the flexibility to choose how to best start and raise a family. The status quo means the cost of having children makes those choices for them, resulting in smaller families, riskier pregnancies, longer commutes from more affordable exurbs and more missed recitals.
Families are how our values are passed down from generation to generation. We simply cannot have a strong nation without strong families, and working Americans face a challenge in the cost of raising children that threatens the health and vitality of our country.
Washington should help by modernizing the tax code for the 21st century. Think about it: For high-cost, major life decisions, we have financial products that help families pursue the American dream. For buying a home, we have the 30-year mortgage. For going to college, we have student loans. But for having a child, we have very little, even though raising a child is more expensive than buying a house or getting a college degree.
A few years ago, Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and I proposed a comprehensive tax reform plan that started with the simple idea that families, not special interests, should be first in line for tax relief. This year, Congress again has the opportunity to achieve this goal, which can be done by at least doubling the per-child tax credit to $2,000 and making it refundable against payroll tax liability -- the biggest tax paid by working-class American families. The House tax bill released last week falls short in this regard.
Providing significant tax relief to working families shouldn't be a final box to check after all of the lobbyists have had their fill. As Congress works on a tax reform package, families must be our priority. We cannot lose sight of what should be the primary goal of tax reform for our time. As the 2016 election revealed, the crisis of the working-class family has steadily grown in recent years, with fewer marriages and children, less work and lower pay, and high rates of disability, all against the backdrop of increasingly out-of-touch, ruling-class elites in the wealthiest country in the world.
We can begin the work of reconciling our social contract to the realities working families face by committing the resources of tax reform to a robust expansion of the per-child tax credit. Doing so would ensure that lower-income Americans will not be left out of the biggest legislative undertaking of this Congress.
Most important, expanding the child tax credit would align our nation's tax code with what every parent already knows to be true: Raising children is the most important job we will ever have.

Full text: Donald Trump has not proved himself to be much of a talent scout; as president he has tended to pick far-right zealots, inept toadies, conflicted swamp dwellers and unqualified family members for top jobs. So it is a relief that he picked a levelheaded and competent person to lead the Federal Reserve, whose authority to direct interest rates and supervise banks gives it enormous influence over the economy. By choosing Jerome Powell, a Republican respected across the political spectrum, Mr. Trump has opted for continuity and stability, rather than disruption and destruction. Mr. Powell has been a solid member of the Fed board since 2012 and has supported its current chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, as they worked to revive the economy.
Mr. Powell appears to share Ms. Yellen's view that while the economy has improved a lot in recent years, the time is not right for the Fed to raise interest rates rapidly and substantially. He is a far better choice than other candidates Mr. Trump was said to be considering. They included critics of the Fed who claimed in the wake of the 2008 crisis that the central bank was sowing the seeds for out-of-control inflation. (Almost a decade later there is still no sign of that.) Other potential nominees have advocated for the deregulation of banks, which could imperil the financial system.
That said, Mr. Trump would have made a much better decision had he offered Ms. Yellen a second term, in keeping with a tradition in which presidents have reappointed Fed leaders who were seen to be doing a good job, regardless of party affiliation. As Mr. Trump noted himself, Ms. Yellen has done a terrific job during a precarious time. Under her watch, unemployment fell to 4.1 percent last month, from 6.7 percent when she took over in 2014, and inflation has been well below the Fed's 2 percent target. The agency has also become a more vigilant supervisor of big banks. Of course, we have not always agreed with Ms. Yellen, particularly when the Fed has been overly fearful of inflation.
Ms. Yellen may be tempted to leave the Fed now that she has been passed over for a second term as chairwoman. But her term on the bank's board of governors does not end until January 2024, and we hope she stays on. She is one of the most experienced and knowledgeable monetary policy experts in the world and would be incredibly valuable to Mr. Powell, a former lawyer who is not an economist by training. Further, by staying, she prevents Mr. Trump from appointing to the board someone inclined to weaken financial regulations. He has already chosen one such person, Randal Quarles, and there are three open seats; Ms. Yellen's would be the fourth. (There are seven seats in total.)
It is not entirely clear how the Fed under Mr. Powell -- assuming he is confirmed, as is likely -- will approach the bank's regulatory mission. He appears to favor some deregulation, experts say, but not a wholesale discarding of the post-crisis regulatory framework put in place under the Dodd-Frank law in the Bernanke and Yellen years.
Having joined the Fed's board when the economy was still limping, Mr. Powell is surely aware of the dangers of returning banking to the bad old days that led to the devastating financial crisis of 2008. Senators ought to press him during his confirmation hearings about where he stands on questions like whether the Fed should reduce the reserves that banks are required to have on hand. (It should not.) And they ought to hold Mr. Trump's other nominees to the Fed board to the same tough scrutiny.
Mr. Trump clearly chose Mr. Powell in part because he did not want to scare investors and jeopardize the one good thing he has going: a growing economy. One can only hope that the president continues to keep that consideration in mind as he picks other nominees.

Full text: House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a bill that would make significant changes to the tax code. The biggest cuts are weighted toward corporations, and while many families would receive a tax cut, the benefits would be mixed, and some would probably end up paying more. Income Tax Rates Reduced and Brackets Consolidated
The bill would reduce the current marginal income tax brackets to four from seven -- 12, 25, 35 and 39.6 percent -- and lower rates by increasing the income ranges that higher rates apply to. The top rate would be the same as it is now, except the income level at which it would apply would increase to $1 million for married couples. While the rate applied to the lowest income bracket would increase, the first $24,000 for a couple would be deductible, meaning that those making up to that amount would pay no income tax. The bill would repeal the individual Alternative Minimum Tax -- which primarily affects households with incomes from $200,000 to $1 million -- and would maintain preferential rates for investment income. It would also repeal the estate tax after six years, in the meantime doubling the amount of inherited wealth that is exempt from the tax to $11 million from $5.5 million.
Standard Deduction Doubled and Others Repealed
The proposal makes significant changes to deductions that are claimed by taxpayers to reduce the amount of income that is taxed. The plan would nearly double the amount of the standard deduction, to $12,000 from $6,350 for a single filer and to $24,000 from $12,700 for a married couple. Currently 30 percent of filers, primarily in higher-income groups, choose itemized deductions over the standard deduction. Experts predict that share would decrease under the plan because the new standard deduction would be more than many people qualify for in itemizations. To help pay for the lower tax rates and higher standard deduction, the bill eliminates most itemized deductions, keeping in place just three -- deductions for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and state and local property taxes. The mortgage interest deduction would be capped for newly bought homes up to $500,000, and the property tax deduction would be capped at $10,000. One of the largest deductions that would be eliminated is the one for state and local income taxes, which primarily affects itemizing households in high-tax states like New York. Those who live in states with high property taxes could also be hit by the capping of the mortgage interest deduction. The largest deduction claimed by taxpayers in the lowest income group is for medical expenses totaling at least 10 percent of income. While only a small share of lower income filers itemize their deductions, and many will benefit more from the new, higher standard deduction, some with significant medical bills could be hurt by the plan.
Exemptions Eliminated and Child Tax Credit Increased
While the bill nearly doubles the standard deduction, it would repeal the personal exemption, which is currently $4,050 per taxpayer and dependent claimed on a return. To help make up the loss for families, the bill increases the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000 and creates a new $300 credit for filers, spouses and non-child dependents. But there are many variables that determine how these changes would affect families. The new $300 credit expires after five years, and the increased child tax credit won't make up for the loss in personal exemptions for many higher-income families who itemize their deductions.
Less Generous Measure of Inflation Used
Income tax bracket levels are indexed for inflation using the Consumer Price Index to prevent filers from creeping into higher tax brackets. The standard deduction is also adjusted for inflation so it does not lose its value over time. The bill calls for a different measure of inflation, called chained C.P.I., to calculate these increases. The bill cites economists as saying that chained C.P.I. is a more accurate measure than the current C.P.I. in use. But it is a slower growing measure of inflation, so the change would result in a tax increase over time. The bill initially called for the new measure to start in 2023, but an updated version released Friday would implement it in 2018. The personal exemption is currently indexed to inflation, and the child tax credit is not. The bill would repeal the personal exemption and increase the child tax credit, indexing the first $1,000 of the $1,600 credit to the chained C.P.I.
Major Changes to Business Taxes
The most expensive change in the bill would be a reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The White House has said that this cut would result in benefits for workers at an average of $4,000 per household, but many experts are skeptical of those effects. The bill also would limit to 25 percent the tax rate for "pass through" businesses -- sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations that currently pay taxes at the individual rate of their owners. Families that own businesses that qualify them for the lower rate would benefit from this change, though certain personal service businesses like law, accounting and consulting would not be eligible.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Republican tax rewrite unveiled on Thursday has set off a scramble among lobbyists and interest groups desperate to preserve prized tax breaks that are suddenly at risk in the sweeping bill moving through the House. Yet the ability of K Street to prevent longstanding tax provisions from getting the ax is running headfirst into Republicans' own mad dash as they attempt to quickly pass the tax rewrite and get it to President Trump's desk by Christmas.
The rapid pace set out by Republican leaders is by design: They want to prevent the kind of arm-twisting that has long bedeviled previous tax overhaul efforts by leaving little time for outside groups to blitz lawmakers with concerns. Several consultants and lobbyists said on Friday that individual companies were just beginning to digest how the 400-plus page bill, which drastically changes how American businesses are taxed at home and abroad, would affect their bottom lines.
Another complication was presented by President Trump, who wants to include a controversial measure to do away with the Affordable Care Act's mandate that most Americans have health coverage or pay a penalty. On Friday, the House's leading tax writer opened the door to including that provision, saying that no decision had been made.
Even without injecting health care into the debate, the tax bill will find itself under scrutiny and will be picked apart by those who stand to lose.
"It's pretty weedy stuff," said Dave Camp, a former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who wrote a 2014 tax bill that laid some of the groundwork for the current one. Mr. Camp, who is now a senior adviser for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that when lawmakers attempt to overhaul the code, "you get significant pushback on just about everything."
The groups pushing back the hardest on Friday included those in the real estate industry. Some of them had raised concerns before the bill was released, only to discover their biggest fears realized in the draft legislation. The bill includes several measures long opposed by those groups, including a limit on interest deductions for new home purchases of $500,000 or more and an expansion of the standard deduction.
The Mortgage Bankers Association plans conference calls and discussions with members of Congress throughout the weekend, said David Stevens, the group's president. Realtors are running online ads raising concerns over those provisions.
Mr. Stevens complained about the "piling-on effect" of the bill's provisions on homeownership incentives, and said the bill is "moving really fast" through the House. "Every special interest is going to have concerns," he said. "If Congress is going to have integrity, they're going to listen to them and make the best decisions."
Some of those groups were already training their efforts on a still-unfinished Senate version of the legislation, fearing that House leaders -- who introduced their bill on Thursday -- were intent on speeding the plan to a vote with little time or opportunity to amend it. The House bill, as one consultant to business groups put it, feels "pretty baked" already.
If Republicans decide to take aim once more at the Affordable Care Act, that would add yet another dimension to the battle over taxes.
Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said no decision had been made about whether to include repeal of the so-called individual mandate. But he said Mr. Trump wants its inclusion, and he indicated that Republicans wanted to evaluate the fiscal effects of taking that step. Senate Republicans may not be as enthused about its inclusion.
"While I support replacing the individual mandate with an auto enrollment system that allows for a consumer to opt out, it would make it more difficult to pass a tax relief bill if it is combined with a repeal of the individual mandate," Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Friday.
Members of Mr. Brady's committee will meet Monday to begin marking up the tax bill, but lobbyists fear the process will not yield any substantive changes. Republican leaders are hoping to pass it through the House by Thanksgiving. The Senate, meanwhile, stands ready to release its bill as soon as the House committee approves its version.
Representatives from industry groups were carefully analyzing how the companies they represent would be affected by a proposal in the House bill that would create a 20 percent excise tax on payments to foreign affiliates.
The small-government advocacy groups spearheaded by the billionaire Republican megadonor brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch have been seeking to rally opposition to the excise tax from other conservative groups, as well as trade and industry associations.
The Koch groups already have expressed concern about the provision -- as well as a plan to retain an upper-income tax bracket -- in meetings this week with the Speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mr. Brady and Senate leadership.
The proposed excise tax is "misguided" and its costs would be passed along to consumers, said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a nonprofit group funded by the Koch brothers and their network of donors.
Yet Mr. Phillips said Americans for Prosperity remains supportive of the overall legislation and is walking a delicate line between trying to tweak the bill without diminishing its prospects.
"It's important to keep this thing moving forward in the House as we try to improve it," he said, "and then we get another bite at the apple in the Senate."
Republican leaders warned on Thursday that interest groups would attack the bill and said they would resist efforts to keep things "status quo."
"You're going to gore some sacred cows in an operation like this," said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, on Friday. "But I really worry about more what happens inside the building. And as I talk to members, they're not feeling a lot of pressure at this point against this."
Any lobbyist push is complicated by the House's math problem: The bill must contain enough revenue to offset its corporate and individual tax cuts. An independent analysis of the bill from the Tax Foundation on Friday suggested that problem might be larger than Republican leaders anticipated.
The analysis found that the draft legislation would cost too much to survive the budgetary requirements needed to pass the Senate on a party-line vote -- a sign that Republicans will almost certainly need to rework it in order to keep their hopes alive for delivering a bill to Mr. Trump's desk by Christmas.
The analysis found that the bill would add $2 trillion to the federal budget deficit over the next decade, an amount that shrinks to $1 trillion even when additional economic growth effects from the bill are factored in.
"This does not pay for itself," said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation.
The bill would continue to add to deficits after 10 years, violating the procedural budget rules that Republicans are hoping to use to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate.
The White House is projecting robust economic growth from the tax cut, and the analysis found that, if those growth projections hold, the bill would create an additional one million jobs and raise incomes for rich, poor and middle-class Americans. If those growth projections fail to materialize, the top 1 percent of earners would see income gains twice as large as those seen by middle-class workers.
When economic growth is taken into account, the gains would be more evenly distributed, with the middle class seeing the biggest income increase on a percentage basis. That is because the Tax Foundation assumes additional growth spurred by business tax cuts largely finds its way into workers' paychecks.
Republicans are looking for other ways to squeeze more dollars out of the bill. On Friday, they released an amended version that would reduce the value of the income tax cuts for individuals by $90 billion over the course of a decade and slightly shrink the estimated cost of the legislation.
The amended bill includes a technical change that immediately adopts a revised measure of inflation, known as "chained C.P.I.," which would change how inflation is calculated, thus slowing the speed at which tax brackets grow with inflation. As a result, Americans would more quickly find themselves in higher marginal tax brackets -- jumping from a 12 percent top bracket to 25 percent, for example -- as their incomes increase.
The chained measure would also slow the value growth of some inflation-adjusted tax benefits, such as the earned-income tax credit.

Full text: The hurricane-battered job market surged back to life in October, the government reported on Friday, the latest sign that the American economy has entered perhaps its strongest stretch of growth in years. Yet the latest round of jobs data did nothing to resolve the question that has bedeviled the economic recovery for years: When will job growth translate into strong wage gains for American workers? Average hourly earnings were 2.4 percent higher in October than a year earlier, barely keeping pace with inflation.
Considering the tight labor market, with unemployment at its lowest level since Bill Clinton was president, many economists say the dividends have been paltry.
"It's certainly trending the right way, but it's surely still unexciting -- even unacceptable -- wage growth at this point," said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America.
Employers added 261,000 jobs in October, the Labor Department said, the most in more than a year. A strong rebound in job creation had been expected after hurricanes in Florida and Texas kept tens or even hundreds of thousands of workers away from work -- and off payrolls -- in September.
The storms' effects were clearest in the weather-dependent leisure and hospitality sector, which lost 102,000 jobs in September, then gained them all back and more -- 106,000 jobs -- in October.
The hurricanes' damage to the labor market also was not quite as bad as initially believed. The Labor Department on Friday revised its estimate of September payrolls from a decline of 33,000 -- the first net loss in jobs in seven years -- to an 18,000-job gain. With the revision, the economy has now added jobs for 85 straight months, a record.
Economists recommended setting aside both the September and October reports and instead focusing on the longer-term picture. The United States has been adding about 170,000 jobs a month this year, the slowest pace since 2010 but still a rate most economists consider fundamentally healthy.
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell yet again to 4.1 percent, its lowest level since 2000. The labor force shed 765,000 workers in October, but most economists dismissed the drop as a correction after four straight months of gains.
"The trend is rock-solid," said Ryan Sweet, director of real-time economics at Moody's Analytics. "The labor market just continues to chug along, and it's showing very little evidence of slowing."
Indeed, there are signs that the economy as a whole is gaining strength. Last week, the government reported that gross domestic product rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the second-straight quarter of solid growth. Consumer spending, the dominant driver of economic growth in recent years, has stayed strong: Retail sales posted a big gain in September, and consumer confidence hit a nearly 17-year high this week.
But consumers are no longer alone in driving the economy forward. Stronger global growth (along with a weaker dollar) has led to higher demand for American goods and services in recent months, aiding the manufacturing sector and increasing exports.
"It's finally feeling like the economy is starting to fire on multiple cylinders rather than relying solely on consumers," said Brett Ryan, an economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.
President Trump hailed the strong jobs report on Friday afternoon, tweeting "JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!" Many economists, however, argue that the president deserves little credit for the strong job market, which predates his time in office. And the recent run of strong economic data could complicate the Republican argument that a tax cut is needed to promote economic growth.
The solid jobs figures on Friday, combined with the other recent economic data, also make it likely that the Federal Reserve will push ahead with plans to raise interest rates despite sluggish inflation. The Fed this week left interest rates unchanged but hinted that it expected to raise rates at its December meeting unless the economy changes course.
The strong economy, however, only adds to the enduring mystery of anemic wage growth. Average earnings actually fell slightly in October compared with September, and although that was partly a statistical quirk caused by the hurricanes, the slowdown was larger than most economists expected. The year-over-year pace of growth, at 2.4 percent, was the weakest since early last year.
The problem is hardly a new one. Throughout the recovery, there have been predictions that wage growth would accelerate as unemployment fell. And throughout the recovery, those hopes have been dashed. Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, likened wage growth to a baseball team that keeps crushing fans' hopes for a championship.
"We'll continue to 'wait till next month' for better growth in wages," Mr. Hamrick said. "It's been disappointing for years now."
There are hints of progress. Earnings growth, at least before adjusting for inflation, has accelerated a bit in recent years. And more sophisticated measures show somewhat stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index, a measure of compensation that considers benefits as well as cash pay, was up 2.5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace in two and a half years.
Some industries are seeing faster growth -- and not just for high-earners. In recent months, there have been hints that wage gains are filtering down to workers in fast food and other low-wage industries. In September, the retail giant Target announced that it was raising pay for all its workers to at least $11 an hour and would pay at least $15 an hour by the end of 2020. That move, and others like it, is putting pressure on other low-wage employers to increase pay.
"It's really hard to retain employees when those companies are saying, 'Any employee in our company is getting at least $15 an hour,"' said Jennifer Durham, chief development officer for Checkers and Rally's, a drive-through burger chain with 860 locations across the country.
So far, however, Checkers and Rally's has resisted broad-based pay increases, choosing instead to focus on helping employees earn more through advancement.
"Base pay is a starting point, but it's not the entire proposition," Ms. Durham said.
Republicans in Washington in recent weeks have proposed their own solution to slow wage growth: lower taxes on businesses, which they argue would lead to big pay increases for workers. Many economists are skeptical that companies would pass tax savings on to workers, or argue that the benefits of the Republicans' proposed tax plan would be far smaller than its authors claim.
Instead, economists point to another factor holding back wage gains: productivity. Growth in productivity -- how much workers can produce in an hour, on average -- has been slow, making it harder for companies to improve wages without eating into profit margins.
"It's hard to get wages really taking off without productivity growth," Mr. Ryan said.
Productivity growth accelerated in the third quarter, though it is too soon to know whether the that represents the start of a longer-lasting rebound. And despite the disappointing pay data, there are signs that companies are being forced to work harder to attract employees, and to keep the ones they have from bolting to competitors. A report from the payroll-processing firm ADP this month found that people who switch jobs are seeing significant pay gains, which suggests workers are jumping ship in search of better opportunities.
David Staszewski, executive vice president of sales for Wireless Zone, a cellphone retailer, said that over the last six months, the company's franchisees had increasingly complained about holding on to workers. Many of them have had to raise pay or restructure commissions to keep employees, he said.
"They'll move at the blink of an eye and really not care," Mr. Staszewski said. "A friend of theirs will call up and say, 'Hey, it's better over here,' and they will up and leave."

Full text: The Russian energy and aluminum company EN+, which is controlled by a member of President Vladimir V. Putin's circle of favored businessmen, said on Friday that it had raised $1.5 billion in an initial public offering seen as a major test of investors' appetite for Russian assets. The results of the listing were at the bottom end of EN+'s expectations, but the offering was nonetheless one of the largest by a Russian company since the Kremlin drew international condemnation and sanctions by annexing Crimea in 2014. It is also the latest sign that some investors have not been deterred by the steady drumbeat of allegations linking President Trump's campaign to the Russian government.
The offering may draw attention for using the London Stock Exchange, where listing rules are less stringent than in New York, for a transaction that had the effect of funneling money to a Russian state bank that has faced sanctions in both the United States and the European Union, even though EN+ has not faced sanctions.
The offering's prospectus said that EN+ intended to use $942 million out of the $1.5 billion it raised to pay down a loan from VTB Bank. The offering is intended, it said, to "repay in full the loan provided to it by VTB."
The United States sanctioned the bank on July 29, 2014, 12 days after a civilian airliner was shot down over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, most of whom were Dutch citizens; safety investigators and Dutch prosecutors determined that a Russian antiaircraft missile had hit the plane.
The sanctions prohibit Western companies from extending new long-term credit lines to VTB and other Russian banks, but allow loan repayments.
EN+ itself has links to the scandal over Russian interference in the United States presidential election. The company is controlled by the Russian oligarch Oleg V. Deripaska, a confidant of the Russian president who once had close ties to Paul J. Manafort, the former Trump campaign manager who was charged this week with money laundering as part of the special counsel inquiry into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Deripaska, an orphan from a small village in southern Russia, muscled his way into the aluminum business in Siberia in the 1990s. At the time, the industry was in bloody turmoil as organized crime figures and venal local officials fought in what became known as the Aluminum Wars.
Despite his humble background, Mr. Deripaska is closely entwined with the Moscow elite. As an example of his proximity to power, analysts of the oligarchy have pointed out that he is married to the step-granddaughter of the late former Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin; Mr. Deripaska has played down the tie as irrelevant to his business activities.
Mr. Deripaska was never charged with a crime in Russia over the Aluminum Wars, but the United States has for years denied him a visa, suggesting something unseemly in his ascent in the Siberian aluminum industry. It was in an effort to solve this earlier problem in Washington that a decade ago he reached out to a business partner of Mr. Manafort, Rick Davis, for lobbying.
Mr. Manafort and Mr. Deripaska set up an investment company to buy television stations in Ukraine that eventually unraveled in a $19 million lawsuit filed by Mr. Deripaska in the Cayman Islands, court records show. But now, those decade-old ties to Mr. Manafort have become a focus of attention in the Trump-Russia investigation.
During the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Manafort had asked, through an intermediary, whether Mr. Deripaska might resolve a financial dispute in exchange for "private briefings" about the Republican Party presidential campaign, The Washington Post has reported, citing email exchanges. Mr. Deripaska dismissed the emails as just scheming by "beltway bandits," the Post reported.
The Russian businessman offered this year to cooperate with congressional investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election in the United States, but American officials were said to be unwilling to accept his conditions, which included a request for full immunity.
Addressing concerns about Americans doing business with Kremlin insiders, the sanction law passed by Congress in August stipulates that American officials are to prepare a report on Russian oligarchs by early next year, identifying those deemed close to Mr. Putin for possible sanctions. It is not clear whether Mr. Deripaska is under consideration for inclusion on that list.
The potential for new sanctions based on Kremlin ties, long important for survival and success in business in Russia, has the oligarchy on tenterhooks, said Alexey Makarkin, vice president of the Center for Political Technologies, a research institute in Moscow. "They see a potential threat," he said. "A lot of businessmen are very worried."
Still, the EN+ offering is the latest sign of investors -- while wary of sanctions -- being attracted to Russian companies as the country's economy gains a firmer footing.
Fitch, the rating agency, in September upgraded its outlook on its rating of Russian sovereign bonds to positive, from stable, highlighting a modest economic recovery. Growth is expected to reach 2 percent this year, and inflation is down to 4 percent. Under President Putin, who has been loath to become economically vulnerable to Western lending, the federal debt in Russia is low.
EN+'s offering, in particular, comes on the heels of a quiet inflow of foreign money into Russia's government bond market, where interest rates run about 8 percent. Nonresident investors, who owned only about 5 percent of government bonds at the start of the year, bulked up to to about 30 percent by the fall, an inflow of about $30 billion, according to Alexander Y. Abramov, a professor at the Higher School of Economics at Moscow's National Research University.
"The budget is under control, the reserve funds are high," Mr. Abramov said. "The interest in Russia is in the relatively stable ruble, and no events can be seen in the near future to change that."
EN+ is a producer of hydropower through EN+ Power and of aluminum through Rusal, in which it holds a 48.1 percent stake. EN+ reported revenue of $5.8 billion in the first half of this year. The stock offers investors a chance to own shares in the gigantic dams corralling the power of Siberian rivers like the Yenisei and Angara.
The company said it had priced its offering at $14 per global depositary receipt, toward the bottom of its expected range. It said that the offering gave it a market value of $8 billion. Shares of EN+ were trading below the offer price, at $13.82 a share, in conditional trading in London on Friday. The company's shares are expected to begin trading in Moscow on Wednesday.
"We are very pleased with the level of interest and support for our offering that we have received from the global investor community, and I am delighted to welcome all new shareholders onto En+ Group's register," Maxim Sokov, the chief executive of EN+, said in a news release.
The EN+ offering comes amid a relative low point in London's I.P.O. market. Though more money and more deals have been raised on the London Stock Exchange so far this year compared to all of last year -- $5.9 billion has been raised in 25 transactions for the year to date -- that remains far below the levels set in 2013 through 2015, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
Despite any concerns about how Britain's pending exit from the European Union might affect London's attractions as a listing venue, the London Stock Exchange and the related AIM exchange remain Europe's busiest market for I.P.O.s.
Citigroup, Credit Suisse, J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch International, SIB (Cyprus) Limited and VTB Capital acted as joint global coordinators on the EN+ offering.

Full text: By most conventional measures, Janet L. Yellen's four years as the nation's top economic policymaker have been a success. Unemployment fell steadily during her term, inflation stayed in check and the Fed began backing gradually away from the extraordinary steps it took in the wake of the financial crisis. That wasn't enough to save her job, however. President Trump has nominated Jerome H. Powell to be chairman of the Federal Reserve, which means that Ms. Yellen will be the first person in nearly 40 years to serve no more than a single four-year term as head of the central bank. Ms. Yellen, who was serving as the Fed's vice chairwoman at the time of her appointment, was not the only person considered for the top job. President Barack Obama considered naming former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to the post. Once Mr. Obama did nominate her, Ms. Yellen was confirmed on an unusually partisan 56-26 vote in the Senate. And once in office, Ms. Yellen continued to stir strong feelings. Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail accused the Fed under her leadership of imposing burdensome regulations on the financial industry -- a complaint that may have contributed directly to Mr. Trump's decision not to reappoint her. Here is a closer look at Ms. Yellen's complex legacy. Unemployment and inflation are low, but to many the recovery is incomplete. Since the late 1970s, the Fed has had a "dual mandate" of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. By one set of measures, Ms. Yellen's tenure was a clear success on both counts: unemployment is at its lowest level since 2001. And the Fed's preferred measure of inflation has generally stayed well below its 2 percent target. Other measures paint a more ambiguous picture, however. The share of working-age Americans who have jobs -- a more comprehensive measure than the unemployment rate -- remains below its prerecession level, and wage growth has been slow for much of Ms. Yellen's term. Both trends suggest that the Fed is still falling short of its "maximum employment" mandate. The low rate of inflation has also led many liberal economists to suggest that the Fed could have done more to bolster the economy without running the risk of runaway price increases. Ms. Yellen described persistently low inflation as "a concern" in a news conference in September. Rosy growth forecasts were not matched by reality. Under Ms. Yellen, as under her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, a stronger economic recovery was always just around the corner. In March 2014, shortly after Ms. Yellen took over, Fed policymakers said they expected gross domestic product to grow at about a 3 percent rate each year through 2016. That proved overly optimistic: In 2016, economic growth by the Fed's measure didn't even reach 2 percent. It isn't clear what's behind those repeated disappointments, or how much Ms. Yellen or the Fed are to blame. Slow growth has been a problem across the developed world in recent years, and the United States has in fact outperformed many of its international peers. Some economists have pointed at demographics, globalization or other forces outside policymakers' control. But to the extent Ms. Yellen's policies were driven by her assessment of the strength of the economy, those assessments proved consistently too rosy. Too fast or too slow? Yellen's rate increases attracted criticism on both sides. When Ms. Yellen became chairwoman in February 2014, the Fed had held interest rates near zero for more than five years in an effort to revive the economy. With unemployment falling and inflation edging upward, she came under almost immediate pressure to raise rates. Instead, she waited nearly two years -- until December 2015 -- to do so, then another full year before doing so again. (The Fed has now approved four quarter-point rate increases under Ms. Yellen, and is widely expected to raise rates again in December.) Ms. Yellen's caution drew fire from inflation hawks, and she faced dissent within the Fed as well. Three members of the Fed's policymaking Open Market Committee voted against the decision to leave rates steady at the committee's September 2016 meeting. But Ms. Yellen also faced criticism from the left -- in 2015, Ms. Yellen's former rival for the Fed's top job, Mr. Summers, argued in a commentary in The Financial Times that the Fed was making a "serious error" by raising rates too soon. The Fed is figuring out how to unwind a $4 trillion balance sheet. The Fed did much more than just cut interest rates in response to the 2008 financial crisis. It also embarked on a series of unusual or unprecedented steps: bailing out banks, buying up troubled mortgages and, later, injecting trillions of dollars directly into the economy through successive rounds of bond-buying known as "quantitative easing." Those efforts -- which Ms. Yellen helped guide as a member and later vice chairwoman of the Open Market Committee -- were winding down by the time she took over as Fed chief, leaving her with a different challenge: what to do about the Fed's more than $4 trillion balance sheet. For most of Ms. Yellen's tenure, her answer was "nothing" -- the Fed bought new bonds to replace ones that were maturing, keeping its total holdings essentially flat. But in September, the bank said it would begin gradually paring its holdings by allowing some bonds to roll off its balance sheet. The unanimous decision was widely seen as a vote of confidence in the health of the United States economy. It will be months before it is clear whether that confidence was well placed. Markets have soared, but some see a bubble ready to burst. A Federal Reserve chief's every utterance can move global financial markets. Ms. Yellen's utterances, more often than not, moved them up. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broadest measure of American stock market performance, is up by nearly half since Ms. Yellen took office, and the more technology-centric Nasdaq composite is up by two-thirds. Riskier assets have seen even bigger gains. Those big gains have been good news for investors, including workers trying to rebuild their retirement savings after the 2008 financial crisis. But they have led to fears among some market analysts that the Fed could be artificially propping up the market by encouraging investors to take bigger risks in search of higher returns -- perhaps inflating a bubble that will pop as the Fed begins raising rates and reducing its bond holdings. Ms. Yellen herself has hinted that asset prices may be too high, although she has also expressed confidence that the financial system is strong enough to withstand a drop in prices. (President Trump during last year's campaign called the market gains "a big, fat, ugly bubble," but more recently praised them as evidence that his economic policies are working.) Yellen's view of financial regulation may be falling out of favor. As the first post-financial crisis head of the Fed, Ms. Yellen had the task of putting in place new rules that greatly expanded the central bank's role in regulating the financial industry. Ms. Yellen left much of that work to another Fed board member, Daniel K. Tarullo, who resigned earlier this year, and to Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, who stepped down in October. In recent months, however, Ms. Yellen has become more vocal about the need for financial regulation. In a speech in Wyoming in August, she warned against forgetting the lessons of the financial crisis, and said the Fed's policies -- which have included subjecting big banks to strict "stress tests" that evaluate how well they could weather another crisis -- had made the financial system safer. Those views aren't popular among Republicans in Congress or in the White House. Mr. Trump has criticized financial regulation as stifling lending and economic growth, and he nominated Randal K. Quarles, an outspoken critic of post-crisis regulations, to lead the Fed's regulatory efforts.

In Britain, Bank Issues Rate Raise And Caveat

Full text: LONDON -- The potential panic phase of Britain's decision to leave the European Union is effectively history. That appeared to be the message delivered by the Bank of England as it lifted interest rates on Thursday for the first time in a decade, tightening credit in the world's fifth largest economy. But if the risk of a precipitous plunge is now safely in the rear view, a trudge through confusing terrain remains ahead as Britain pushes on toward Europe's exits -- or Brexit. It is a journey that will almost certainly entail pain and lost treasure, the central bank explicitly warned in a statement accompanying its rate hike.
"Uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity, which has slowed even as global growth has risen significantly," the bank declared. "Monetary policy cannot prevent either the necessary real adjustment as the United Kingdom moves toward its new international trading arrangements or the weaker real income growth that is likely to accompany that adjustment over the next few years."
Central banking is a mysterious enterprise, not unlike a conclave of seers communicating by smoke signals from a mountain redoubt. Yet this message was strikingly clear: Britain is bound toward trouble, with only the extent of the damage yet to be determined.
The rate hike surprised no one, having been telegraphed for weeks. The increase of the bank's lending rate from 0.25 percent to 0.50 appeared small enough that few expected it to pack substantial economic consequences. The bank presented it as a requisite attack on rising prices. But analysts saw another motive, an eagerness from the central bank to secure room to act again should the economy weaken: It raised rates so it could lower them if Britain requires a fresh jolt of stimulus.
The action packed symbolic import. On a June morning last year, as Britain awoke to the startling news that voters had approved Brexit, the central bank governor, Mark Carney, took to television to offer assurances that help was at the ready to cushion against nasty consequences. Weeks later, the bank announced a quarter-point interest rate cut to spur economic activity.
Now, nearly a year and a half later, Mr. Carney was taking that easy money back.
"It's signaling that the bank has a degree of confidence that that immediate post-referendum worry has been put to bed," said Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, an asset management firm in London. "But there's a long game to be played, and Mr. Carney is not convinced that Brexit is going to be anything other than harmful for the U.K. economy."
Lifting interest rates tends to increase the value of a nation's money, as investors arrive seeking higher returns. But markets pushed down the value of the British pound against both the dollar and the euro following the central bank's action, an apparent reflection of worry about Britain's economy and its trade with Europe.
The clock is ticking toward a March 2019 deadline for negotiations between Britain and the European Union over their future dealings. So far, talks have produced a surplus of bitter recrimination and meager sign of an agreement.
Uncertainty is already exacting a price. Nearly half of Britain's exports are sold within the European Union, a stream of cars, liquor and pharmaceuticals that could confront tariffs absent a completed trade deal. As the markets factor in the prospect of diminished trade across the English Channel, they have pushed down the value of the pound by nearly 15 percent against the euro since last year's Brexit vote.
The falling currency has lifted the prices of Britain's imported goods, squeezing households with inflation now running at a 3 percent annual rate. That has dented consumer spending, contributing to a marked slowdown in Britain's economy.
As the possibility looms that Britain might crash out of the European Union absent an agreement with the bloc, multinational companies are reassessing the merits of centering operations here, imperiling investment.
London's status as a global financial center has in recent decades taken strength from rules that allow banking operations in Britain to serve clients across the European Union. Without a deal preserving that arrangement, London's unique reach is imperiled. Global banks have in recent months inked leases for office space in Frankfurt, Dublin and Paris as they ready plans to move parts of their operations from Britain to places firmly within European confines post-Brexit.
Global auto manufacturers have similarly concentrated factories in Britain while exporting their wares across Europe. But as the potential for an unruly Brexit increases, auto companies are also calculating the merits of shifting production to European locales.
The British government, headed by a weakened Prime Minister, Theresa May, has pinned hopes on halting this trend by convening negotiations toward striking a future trade deal with Europe. She wants those talks to start in December. That date is of more than random significance: Many multinational companies with operations in Britain hold board meetings in winter months to formulate plans for the next year.
If December passes without sign of progress on a trade deal -- an outcome that is more than thinkable -- that will likely accelerate decisions by multinational companies to move pieces of their businesses to Europe.
In that scenario, Britain risks a recession next year, said Peter Urwin, director of the Centre for Employment Research at Westminster Business School in London. "At the very least, the odds are 50-50," he said.
Central banks tend to lift rates when economies are strengthening. They make credit more expensive so as to guard against the side-effects of rapid expansion, such as rising prices and reckless investment. Yet the Bank of England, Mr. Urwin suggested, appears to be less concerned about inflation than positioning itself to step in with more help if the economy weakens.
"They are trying to get a little ammunition back in the armory," Mr. Urwin said.
Many analysts assumed the bank was essentially forced to deliver the rate hike. Had it held back, that would have surprised investors -- a taboo in central banking -- while resonating as evidence of deepening concern about the health of the British economy.
Investors might well have intensified their unloading of the British pound, exacerbating inflation, and increasing the strains facing the economy.
Skipping the rate hike also would have put Britain further out of step with policymakers in the rest of the global economy, and especially the United States. The Federal Reserve has been lifting rates to return credit to more normal levels, following years of injections of extraordinarily cheap money.
Yet in lifting rates, the Bank of England has slightly added to the headwinds assailing Britain on its continued slog toward Brexit. Retail and auto sales have been weak, even with ultracheap finance. Now, credit terms are likely to tighten along with variable mortgage rates. The cost of capital will climb slightly for companies already reluctant to invest in uncertain times.
Given the backdrop, investors concluded that another rate hike is unlikely anytime soon.
"Today's excitement is likely to prove only a short hiatus before the economy returns to another extended period of monetary policy inaction," declared Matthew Beck, lead U.K. economist with Oxford Economics in London.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump nominated Jerome H. Powell to chair the Federal Reserve on Thursday, bypassing Janet L. Yellen for a second term but turning to a replacement who is expected to stay the course on monetary policy if the economy continues its steady growth. "He's strong, he's committed, he's smart," Mr. Trump said in the White House Rose Garden, where he introduced Mr. Powell as his choice. Using Mr. Powell's nickname, the president said, "I am confident that with Jay as a wise steward of the Federal Reserve, it will have the leadership it needs in the years to come."
Less certain is where Mr. Powell would lead the Fed if the economy falters. Mr. Powell, a member of the Fed's board of governors since 2012, has consistently voted with Ms. Yellen to slowly raise interest rates and sell off assets that the Fed bought up in the wake of the severe recession of 2008 and 2009. Colleagues consider him a centrist and pragmatist.
But he lacks the deep background in economics of some of his predecessors, and he has expressed skepticism in the past about the unconventional measures that the Fed took after the recession.
Mr. Powell could also depart from the Fed's current trajectory when it comes to regulating banks and other financial institutions -- rules Mr. Trump has said should be loosened.
The nominee offered little hint of his thinking during brief remarks in the Rose Garden. He said the nation's economy has made "substantial progress toward full recovery" since the financial crisis and that banks are in far better shape. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and prepared to respond to changes in markets and evolving risks," he said.
Mr. Powell is a Republican with strong roots in the party's establishment and in the financial industry, a lawyer by training and investment banker by trade. As Fed chair, a position some consider the second most powerful post in government, he would be the voice of an institution that is charged with keeping the economy on track by adjusting interest rates that influence the decisions of millions of Americans.
In replacing Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump is breaking with precedent. The previous three Fed chairs were reappointed, in each case by a president of the opposite political party.
Mr. Trump said that he respected Ms. Yellen and on Thursday called her "a wonderful woman who has done a terrific job." In a statement, Ms. Yellen congratulated her chosen successor and said she was "confident in his deep commitment to carrying out the vital public mission of the Federal Reserve."
The Fed under Ms. Yellen's leadership has sharply reduced unemployment while maintaining control of inflation, coming as close to achieving its congressional mandate as at any time in its history.
Her prospects to be renominated momentarily lifted making when the president agreed to meet with her on Oct. 19 at the urging of Gary D. Cohn, Mr. Trump's national economics adviser who himself was once a top candidate.
Mr. Trump came away genuinely impressed with Ms. Yellen, according to a person briefed on the process, but a speech she gave in Jackson Hole, Wyo., in favor of financial regulation damaged her chances given the White House agenda of cutting red tape and freeing up financial firms.
White House officials said Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Powell's combination of government and private sector experience. Ultimately, Mr. Trump, who as a real estate developer benefited from cheap credit, came down for Mr. Powell, whom he hopes will deliver lower interest rates.
The position requires Senate confirmation, but Mr. Powell is likely to attract broad support from the Republican majority. He won some Democratic votes when he was confirmed as a Fed governor in 2012, and when he was confirmed again in 2014.
The Federal Reserve has embarked on a path of gradually raising its interest rate from ultralow levels meant to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate again in December, likely Ms. Yellen's final act as chair. Under Mr. Powell's leadership, the Fed will presumably continue on its projected path of raising its interest rate three more times next year, as well as continuing to pare back its massive balance sheet of Treasury notes and bonds.
Mr. Powell remains a centrist voice in the Fed's internal debates, arguing for the Fed to end its stimulus campaign at a slow and steady pace. Over the last year, that has placed him solidly among the majority led by Ms. Yellen.
"Our view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation," said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets.
But some argue that there is more uncertainty surrounding Mr. Powell's approach than for other recent Fed chairs. Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities, said it was unclear how aggressive Mr. Powell would be in responding to an economic slowdown.
"I don't think it's right to think of Powell as a Yellen clone," Mr. Alexander said. "In terms of the core issues of monetary policy, we just don't have much of a baseline for him."
Mr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades who does not have a degree in economics -- meaning his opinions may not be as fully formed as some of his predecessors. He also lacks a body of academic work analysts could parse for his views.
Ms. Yellen's work on the labor market and former Fed chair Ben Bernanke's focus on financial crises both gave insight into their leadership at the Fed, said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University. But beyond Mr. Powell's performance as a "loyal lieutenant" to Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, "we don't know all that much about any existing priors Powell has about monetary policy," she said.
As a member of the Fed's board of governors, Mr. Powell raised concerns in 2013 that the Fed was trying too hard to revive economic growth with its massive bond-buying program -- calling into question whether he would be as willing as Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen to use such tools again.
The Fed announced in September 2012 that it would launch a third round of bond buying, purchasing $85 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities until economic conditions improved to its satisfaction. The program was backed by Mr. Bernanke, then Fed chair, and Ms. Yellen, then the vice chairwoman, who argued the Fed had not done enough to reduce unemployment.
A group of three Fed governors, including Mr. Powell, pressed Mr. Bernanke to clarify the Fed's goals, establishing what Mr. Powell called an "off-ramp" for the program.
Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to reshape the Fed further through appointments in the coming months, which could help consolidate or complicate Mr. Powell's task of forging consensus. The president has three more open seats on the board of governors, and may have a fourth if Ms. Yellen decides to step down from her position on the board as she departs as chair. One addition may be John Taylor, a Stanford economist who is among the Fed's most vocal critics, and who was a top choice for Fed chief along with Mr. Powell.
Mr. Powell may diverge from his predecessor on financial regulation. In a June appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Powell said that the Fed's current rules showed opportunities for improvement, although he made clear that he did not fully embrace the Trump administration's plans for significant reductions in regulation, released a few weeks earlier.
"There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness," he said, adding, "There are some ideas that I would not support."
Mr. Powell has expressed support for legislation that would require financial regulators to apply cost-benefit analysis to proposed rules. He pushed back against proposals to allow large banks to borrow more of their funding, saying that requiring them to raise capital from investors had strengthened the financial system.
Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native. He studied politics at Princeton, then earned a law degree from Georgetown and embarked on a career in investment banking.
In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and was named under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught trying to manipulate the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell spent an August weekend making phone calls from Cape Cod, arranging for the company's top managers to resign and for Warren Buffett, a major investor, to become chairman of the company's board.
Under pressure to account for the shortcomings in regulation that had allowed Salomon's misconduct, Mr. Powell told Congress, "There is no question that it can be improved, and improve it we will."
Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997. Over the next eight years, he solidified his fortune. His 2016 financial disclosure form showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, he left the firm to focus on public policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011, when he worked behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The next year, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The House Republican tax bill is a clear windfall for corporate America and a roll of the dice for the middle-class families that President Trump promised would be the centerpiece of his economic agenda. Early projections suggest the bill would cut taxes for an average middle-class family. But the typical cut could be relatively modest, compared with the benefits for businesses and high earners. More important, the myriad changes in the code would actually raise taxes on nearly 13 million tax filers who earn $100,000 a year or less, according to preliminary calculations using the open-source economic modeling software TaxBrain.
Those changes also include limits on, or the elimination of, what might be called tax breaks for middle-class aspirers. The bill would no longer allow Americans to deduct interest on student loans they took out to attend college. It would limit mortgage interest deductions to $500,000 on newly purchased homes, a provision that would hit middle-class teachers or office workers looking to buy starter houses in high-priced, economically vibrant areas such as New York City and Silicon Valley.
One of the bill's biggest lifts to working families would vanish after five years -- though Republicans would certainly push to extend it -- and another would be diluted by the bill's changes to how the tax code calculates inflation.
It is difficult to see those provisions as the unambiguous gift to American workers -- the "major, major tax cut," in the words of Mr. Trump -- that Republicans promised. Instead, the bill effectively asks those workers to put their faith in a sort of bank-shot theory of income growth, where corporate tax cuts turn into profits that are passed on to workers in the form of higher wages.
If those benefits do not accrue, many workers could face higher taxes while companies keep their savings or pass them on to shareholders in the form of higher dividends.
Democrats assailed the bill as a corporate handout at the expense of workers. Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, said the bill included "tax cuts for the wealthiest paid for on the backs of our children and grandchildren." Republicans, she said, "have cooked up a plan behind closed doors that could actually increase taxes on working families."
The Republican architects of the bill headlined their sales pitch by saying the plan would deliver a tax break of $1,182 a year to a typical family of four earning $59,000 a year.
"This plan is for the middle-class families in this country who deserve a break," Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House and Republican of Wisconsin, said on Thursday. "It is for the families who are out there living paycheck to paycheck, who just keep getting squeezed."
For those families, the potential benefits are complicated. Calculations by David Kamin, a former Obama administration official who now works on tax issues at New York University's law school, suggest that the family cited by Mr. Ryan would see its tax cut evaporate over a decade, because of the expiring tax credit (assuming it is not extended) and a change in inflation indexing. By 2024, Mr. Kamin estimates, the family's tax bill would be higher than it would have been under the current law.
If the bill simply cut income or payroll tax rates for middle-class workers and doubled the standard deduction for individuals and married couples, it would be easy for Republicans to make their middle-class case: They could just calculate the value of those changes, as the Bush administration did when it pushed its own tax cuts in 2001 and 2003. Those cuts reduced rates for the rich and for low- and middle-income earners alike.
But the new bill goes beyond rate cuts and the standard deduction to eliminate many tax preferences, some of which benefit the poor and the middle class and also presumes spillover effects from returning money to corporations.
Under the current law, parents may claim personal exemptions on their tax forms for themselves, their spouses and their children. The new bill would replace those exemptions with an expanded child tax credit and a $300 personal credit for each parent. For some families, the value of the new package appears to be less than the value of the old package, so their taxes would go up. Also, the $300 credit is set to expire after five years.
Other workers will see tax increases by losing access to deductions they currently make heavy use of. Most notably, that includes workers with high out-of-pocket medical costs, who would no longer be able to deduct them under the Republican bill.
"If you're a middle-class family, how do you judge this?" said Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader and Democrat of California. "If you own a home or want to one day, you lose. If you have a sick child or a family member with long-term medical care needs, they take away the medical deduction, you lose. If you have student loans or want to have student loans or use the credit for lifetime learning, there's a credit for lifetime learning, you lose."
The Tax Foundation, an independent think tank that tends to find high growth effects from tax cuts in its models, found more hopeful results. It chose eight "example" tax filers last month to examine when the bill was released, and when it analyzed them on Thursday, the incomes of all eight rose from the plan.
In recent weeks, White House officials have focused less on the amount of tax cuts that would flow to workers under any Republican bill and more on the wage increases that could be prompted by corporate rate cuts. The White House Council of Economic Advisers has produced two studies suggesting the cut to a 20 percent rate, as the bill calls for, could deliver a $4,000 income boost -- or more -- to an average household over time, a number that liberal economists call inflated.
"I would expect to see an immediate jump in wage growth," the council's chairman, Kevin Hassett, said last month.
Polling suggests a middle-class message is critical for both the Republicans trying to pass a bill and the Democrats attempting to kill it. A new survey of battleground states by Global Strategy Group and Hart Research Associates, conducted on behalf of the liberal groups Not One Penny and Americans for Tax Fairness, found even a strongly pro-Trump group of voters voicing concerns over the plan's effects on workers.
Six of 10 respondents in the survey said they believed the plan would benefit the wealthy more than the middle class. Only two in 10 said they believed they would benefit personally. The respondents voted for Mr. Trump by a 13-point margin last year. The poll also tested attack messages on the plan and found that those that stressed its benefits to the rich and corporations were effective at eroding support for it.
"It puts us in a very strong position to win this battle," said Bryan Bennett, polling adviser for Not One Penny, a group formed to fight tax cuts for the wealthy.
Public Opinion Strategies also conducted a poll about the tax plan recently, on behalf of the American Action Network, a conservative group that supports Republicans' tax efforts. It tested which messages could move voters on the bill. One of the most effective started with this: "The plan will benefit those who need it most, the middle class."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Wednesday and signaled another rate increase is very likely to come in mid-December. But hanging over the meeting was the anticipation of a much bigger change: The nomination of Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman. The Fed's current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, is expected to remain in that post until her term expires in February. On Wednesday, President Trump called Ms. Yellen "excellent." Nevertheless, he is expected to nominate Mr. Powell, a current board member, for the Fed chairmanship at a Rose Garden event on Thursday, according to people familiar with the decision.
Mr. Powell, a Republican who joined the Fed in 2012, has steadily supported Ms. Yellen's approach to monetary policy and is expected to follow a similar trajectory if confirmed to lead the central bank. Mr. Powell has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, including its four interest rate increases and the gradual unwinding of the Fed's stimulus campaign.
The meeting Wednesday was the first since the Fed began reducing its vast portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it acquired in an effort to stimulate the economy during and after the 2008 financial crisis.
The Fed is approaching the process cautiously, and so far investors appear unfazed. The central bank is paring its $4.2 trillion in bond holdings by just $10 billion per month through the end of this year, then gradually increasing the pace until it reaches a monthly rate of $50 billion.
At the conclusion of its two-day gathering in Washington, the Fed announced that it would leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in a range between 1 and 1.25 percent, after lifting it twice so far this year. The vote was unanimous, and the central bank did not alter any of the careful wording in its statement about its expected rate of future increases -- a sign that it is not trying to quell widely held expectations of a rate increase of a quarter point in December.
"They're on track to raise rates in December," said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist at Nomura Securities.
In its statement, the Fed said economic activity had been rising "at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions." It said that the hurricanes had caused a drop in payrolls in September and a pickup in inflation because of higher gasoline prices, but that it expected both effects to be temporary, and that the storms would be "unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term."
The last time the Fed met, in September, large parts of the United States were still reeling from hurricanes that threatened to disrupt economic activity in several major cities. Two weeks later, the government reported that the economy had lost jobs in September for the first time in seven years, a decline most experts attributed to the storms' impact.
Since then, however, economic data has indicated that the economy weathered the storms without lasting damage. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services, rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter of the year, the second straight quarter of solid growth. Measures of retail sales and consumer confidence have likewise been strong, and most economists expect the next round of employment figures, due Friday, to show a solid rebound from September's dip.
"Much of the uncertainty that had existed at the September meetings because of the hurricanes has subsided and signs are that growth has been stronger," said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.
The one sticking point remains inflation. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is well below the central bank's 2 percent target; what's more, inflation has slowed this year even as the unemployment rate has fallen, a trend that would ordinarily be expected to put upward pressure on prices. That disconnect has complicated the Fed's plans to raise interest rates at the steady clip it has signaled, including three more times next year.
Ms. Yellen and most of her colleagues have expressed confidence that the slowdown in inflation is temporary and therefore should not force a change in plans. In a September speech, Ms. Yellen said that low unemployment is leading to pay increases, which will ultimately lead to higher prices as well; other Fed officials have made similar comments in recent weeks.
Still, at some point "temporary" effects stop looking so temporary. The Fed will get several more reports on inflation before its December meeting, and it remains possible that weak data could give policymakers pause.
Financial markets appear all but certain that the Fed plans to raise rates in December. Futures contracts on Wednesday morning suggested investors saw a 96.7 percent probability of a rate increase at the Fed's next meeting, according to CME Group. Matthew Hornbach, global head of interest-rate strategy for Morgan Stanley, said the Fed had sent a clear signal that it was prepared to raise rates even if inflation stays low in the coming months.
But Ken Matheny, executive director of Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, was less certain that a December rise was inevitable. He said that the Fed was struggling to reconcile strong growth with weak inflation, and that policymakers would be watching coming inflation data closely in making their interest-rate decisions.
"A December rate hike is not a foregone conclusion," Mr. Matheny said, adding that the market's overwhelming confidence in an increase was "a puzzle."
Policymakers and investors have also been watching closely for any signs that the Fed's long-awaited process of drawing down on its $4.2 trillion balance sheet is disrupting financial markets. In 2013, interest rates spiked unexpectedly in response to the Fed's announcement that it would begin slowing its bond purchases, a reaction that came to be known as the "taper tantrum."
So far, there is little sign of trouble. Interest rates have edged up since the Fed announced its plans in September, but the stock market has continued to rise and there has been no hint of another tantrum. In a speech last month, Ms. Yellen said the asset-reduction process seemed to be going smoothly so far.
"I'm sure they're very relieved at the reaction they got," said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Investors said the nomination of Mr. Powell would mean that the Fed was likely to continue on its current course.
A former Treasury Department official under President George H.W. Bush and a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, Mr. Powell emerged as the front-runner for the position in recent weeks from a diverse group of finalists. That group included Gary Cohn, a close economic adviser to the president; John B. Taylor, an economist who is a vocal critic of the Fed; and Ms. Yellen herself.
Mr. Trump has the opportunity to significantly reshape the Federal Reserve through appointments. Mr. Trump has appointed just one board member so far, the former Treasury official Randal K. Quarles, as the vice chairman for supervision, who voted for the first time on Wednesday.

Full text: The price tag of President Trump's vision of remaking the American nuclear arsenal soared on Tuesday as a new government estimate put the cost of a 30-year makeover at $1.2 trillion, more than 20 percent higher than earlier figures. The rebuilding proposal includes the nation's nuclear weapons, bombers, missiles and submarines.
The report from the Congressional Budget Office was the most authoritative accounting yet of the full cost of rebuilding an aging, potentially vulnerable nuclear arsenal that often relies on Cold War-era technology. It was published just weeks before the Pentagon is supposed to issue its first broad nuclear strategy of the Trump administration, an assessment called the Nuclear Posture Review.
Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who had been a skeptic about the need to preserve the nuclear force's 400 land-based missiles, in silos across the American West, said in September that he had changed his view and now believed it was necessary to preserve them.
Mr. Trump has publicly declared that he wants the American nuclear arsenal to be "top of the pack," and has been widely reported as asking his aides why the United States needs to limit the number of deployed warheads to 1,550, as set by the 2010 New START treaty with Russia. But he has said nothing about breaking out of the treaty, and the estimate issued Tuesday by the budget office is based largely on plans that were left over from President Barack Obama's time in office.
Those plans may grow more ambitious, senior administration officials say, as the White House seeks new ways to counter North Korea, push back against Iran and deal with significant nuclear modernization in both Russia and China. The authors of the Nuclear Posture Review were told they could consider the building of new types of nuclear weapons, even some now prohibited by treaty.
Any changes could drive up the estimated cost of rebuilding the nation's arsenal, and the figures released Tuesday did not account for inflation, which independent experts say would drive the total figure to more than $1.6 trillion.
The overall direction of the buildup may also end the discussion, driven by Mr. Obama during much of his term, about how to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American offensive and defensive planning. In the end Mr. Obama walked back from his vision, deciding against eliminating one leg of the "triad" -- made up of weapons carried aboard ground-based missiles, submarines and bombers -- and he rejected advice from some of his top nuclear strategists about how to bring the total number of deployed American weapons below 1,000, even if President Vladimir V. Putin was not willing to make similar cuts.
Critics of the American arsenal, who grew increasingly frustrated with Mr. Obama, have urged Mr. Trump to pare back, for reasons of budget if not strategy.
Two former senior military officials, William J. Perry, who served as secretary of defense, and Gen. James E. Cartwright, who served as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the congressional report as "a wake up call" in a letter Tuesday to Mr. Trump. The report demonstrated that current plans to rebuild the nuclear arsenal "are unsustainable and must be rethought," they wrote.
The report, about 70 pages long, details nine cost-cutting options for Congress that run from relatively minor to more extensive.
One option, for example, examined the savings if the administration decided to forego a new generation of nuclear cruise missiles -- low-flying weapons with stubby wings that, when dropped from a bomber, hug the ground to avoid enemy radars and air defenses.
The weapon was endorsed by Mr. Obama, though it has been criticized by other Democratic nuclear experts, like William Perry, as destabilizing. In any event, its elimination would save only about $30 billion -- about 2.5 percent of the total nuclear expenditures.
Another option called for deploying fewer submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles than currently planned. Over three decades, that would save $85 billion. Scrapping the aging land-based missiles altogether would result in the largest savings, $175 billion.
"It explodes the myth that the plan's proponents have been trying to foist on us -- that it's all of the above or nothing," said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington. "The reality is that there're a number practical options to save tens of billions of dollars while still maintaining a robust nuclear force."
The $1.2 trillion figure over three decades compares to annual expenditures for Medicare of about $650 billion and for Medicaid of about $550 billion.
"The stark reality underlined by C.B.O. is that unless the U.S. government finds a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, the nuclear weapons spending plan inherited by the Trump administration will pose a crushing affordability problem," said Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association.
While Mr. Trump likes to take credit for the nuclear weapons push, the costly makeover actually began with Mr. Obama, despite his repeated calls for "a world without nuclear weapons." Mr. Obama argued that by making nuclear weapons safer and more reliable, their numbers could eventually be reduced, setting the world on a path to their elimination. Some of Mr. Obama's aides, thinking that Hillary Clinton would win the presidential election, expected deep cuts in the $1 trillion plan.
Mr. Trump inherited the costly makeover, and his first budget proposed to move fully ahead with the Obama administration approach -- and then some. In an August speech, he boasted that his administration was spending "vast amounts" on overhauling the nuclear arsenal.
Administration critics and arms control advocates say the Congressional Budget Office report reveals how extraordinarily difficult it will become in future years to maintain the nuclear weapons plan and the administration's promises as the costs of the rebuilding program begin to soar.
"Many elements of Trump's nuclear spending spree are excessive and dangerous," said Tom Z. Collina, policy director at Ploughshares Fund. "We would be safer and richer without them."
Mr. Perry, the former defense secretary, argued last year in a New York Times Op-Ed article that eliminating the ground-based missiles would improve global security. "These missiles are some of the most dangerous weapons in the world," he wrote. "They could even trigger an accidental nuclear war" because their vulnerability to pre-emptive strikes would, in a time of crisis, give the president an incentive to launch them.
Critics see the nation's launch-on-warning policy as greatly increasing the risk of accidental war. In the past, they note, false alerts have repeatedly brought the world to the brink of thermonuclear disaster.
"We should consider all aspects of our nuclear posture, and our conventional forces' needs," Mr. Perry and General Cartwright wrote to Mr. Trump, "before rushing headlong into these expensive and contentious development programs."

Full text: SITTINGBOURNE, England -- Britain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim's Fruit Crisps, the impact is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple. Nim's dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.
The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain's decision to leave the European Union -- widely known as Brexit -- the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.
Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company's founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. "I had to cut costs somewhere," she said.
She could be speaking for all of Britain.
In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies' paring their investments in Britain.
Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had expanded a tad more than expected between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market's assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus.
But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain's fragile state. Many focused on plunging retail and car sales as a harbinger of trouble.
The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped over the past year while consumer credit is rising -- a combination that often ends badly.
The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.
With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.
"Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months," said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. "There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment."
Britain now stands as one of the world's weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. Over the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent.
Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within European Union territory.
Citigroup has outlined plans to set up a trading operation in Frankfurt, while applying for a backup license in France. Goldman Sachs recently leased expanded office space in Frankfurt.
In the West Midlands, an industrial reach of England that includes Birmingham, foreign direct investment dipped slightly in the year after the Brexit vote, according a recent assessment from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce.
The chamber pinned the blame on "uncertainty caused by the outcome of the E.U. referendum," which was "delaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K."
Chamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the European Union in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth.
"It's a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe," said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. "We really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world."
At the KimberMills International factory in the Black Country west of Birmingham, workers use tongs to pluck glowing orange blocks of steel from a caldron-like furnace, then pound the metal into desired shapes using a three-and-a-half-ton hammer hoisted by a pulley.
Other workers guide lathes and drills to yield an assortment of industrial parts -- rockers for marine engines, clamps for oil pipelines, components for gearboxes of construction machinery.
The plunge in the pound has raised the price of steel the company imports from Sweden, the Czech Republic and Italy. The company has raised its prices to adjust.
KimberMills taps a forge in Eastern Europe to produce large parts that are beyond its works in England. If Britain fails to strike a trade deal with Europe, these parts could face tariffs. The company has already begun seeking out alternative suppliers in Britain.
"Despite everything that happens, there's a resilience to the British market," said Larry Joyce, the company chairman. "We just get on with it."
But on a recent afternoon at the Great Western pub, a cozy, beer-scented den in Wolverhampton, people worried that such sentiments were being overwhelmed by the economic realities of Brexit.
The pub has been doing a brisk business, owing to the success of the local soccer team, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, whose stadium is within walking distance. But customers were nursing woes.
"Brexit is a disaster," said Richard Lloyd, 48, the proprietor of a local construction company, as he hoisted a pint of Guinness. "It's thrown a lot of people into uncertainty. Companies are certainly delaying investment. They are being very cautious."
Two years ago, Mr. Lloyd employed as many as 20 people. These days, he has only four. "If things were going really swimmingly, I'd hire more," he said.
A local taxi driver, B. Maan, recalled how he used to take home 200 pounds, or about $266, in the course of a Saturday night, ferrying revelers to pubs. These days, he is fortunate to secure 120 pounds.
"People are spending less," he said.
Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain's governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.
"We can't see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected," said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. "How can you go ahead with big investments when you don't know what framework will result?"
For Nim's Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.
Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim's buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.
The fall in the pound has also made Nim's products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim's snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and -- soon -- Saudi Arabia.
"What I've learned is that Europe isn't the only market for us," said Ms. Raja, whose Nim's business card identifies her as TheBoss.
Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Ms. Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.
"I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples," she said.
She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit.
"I have to keep my margins tight," she said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump is expected to nominate Jerome H. Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, replacing Janet L. Yellen, whose term expires early next year, according to two people familiar with the plans. Mr. Powell, a Fed governor since 2012, is a Republican with deep roots in the party's establishment and in the financial industry. He has steadily supported Ms. Yellen's approach to monetary policy and financial regulation, creating an expectation that he would be unlikely to attempt large or sharp changes in the Fed's course.
One White House official described Mr. Powell as a "safe" choice as well as the candidate who most closely fit Mr. Trump's penchant for filling top jobs with characters from "central casting," as he has often put it.
Both people familiar with the president's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that Mr. Trump was notoriously mercurial and liked creating drama around important personnel decisions. However, both said the president appeared set on Mr. Powell. An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, after the Fed wraps up a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and before Mr. Trump leaves on Friday for a 12-day Asia trip.
The choice would cap an unusually public selection process, during which the president has openly discussed his views of various candidates, asked Republican senators to vote by raising their hands for those under consideration and sought the opinion of a television host. Mr. Trump also posted a video on Instagram promising "everybody will be very impressed" with his selection.
In looking past Ms. Yellen, Mr. Trump would be breaking with longstanding precedent. Every Fed chairman in modern history who completed a first four-year term was nominated for a second. The last three Fed chairmen were nominated for new terms by a president of the opposite party. And Mr. Trump has praised Ms. Yellen's performance: During her four years, unemployment has fallen sharply, inflation has remained low and the economy is growing.
"You like to make your own mark," Mr. Trump said last week, by way of explanation.
In choosing Mr. Powell, however, Mr. Trump would be resisting pressure by conservatives to make a larger mark on the Fed's management of the economy. Many conservatives, including Vice President Mike Pence, favored the selection of John B. Taylor, a Stanford economist who has been an outspoken critic of the Fed's monetary policy.
Mr. Powell, by contrast, has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012, although he expressed some reservations in internal debates about the extent of those efforts. In recent years, he has backed the methodical unwinding of the Fed's stimulus campaign, which involved purchasing $4 trillion worth of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to help the economy recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
Fed officials are often labeled hawks if they favor higher interest rates to control inflation, or doves if they want to keep rates low to promote job growth. Richard Fisher, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed, said Mr. Powell "is neither a hawk nor a dove."
"I used to say that we all want to be wise owls," he added, "and I think that he fits that category very well."
Mr. Fisher said Mr. Powell was moderate to a fault. "I've tried to get him to drink more than two glasses of wine at dinner, and he will not do it," he said.
A survey of 144 investors conducted by Evercore ISI found that they expected that Mr. Powell would push rates modestly higher than Ms. Yellen over time.
Mr. Powell also has sought a middle ground on the contentious debate over financial regulation. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans argue that excessive regulation is restraining economic growth. At a Senate hearing in June, Mr. Powell agreed that there was room to improve regulation, but he described the Trump administration's proposals as a "mixed bag," adding that he opposed some of the specific proposals.
Describing an effort already underway at the Fed, he said, "The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work."
Mr. Powell would require Senate confirmation, and his views, particularly on regulation, could draw opposition from some conservatives in the Senate, 21 of whom voted against his confirmation as a Fed governor in 2014. Two Republicans on the Senate banking committee, which will consider the nomination, had previously raised concerns about Mr. Powell: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania.
If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades without an economics degree. He brings a background in financial markets, a contrast with Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. People who have worked with Mr. Powell say he studied economics assiduously after joining the Fed, gathering stacks of papers on the questions of the day, then reading and discussing the findings with colleagues.
"I think it's far more important to understand and appreciate high-quality economic analysis than it is to have a Ph.D.," said Kim Schoenholtz, a professor of economics at New York University.
He noted that most Treasury secretaries had not held degrees in economics. "What distinguishes the most effective secretaries is skill at bringing in talented personnel and appreciation for the value of informed economic analyses," he said.
Jon Faust, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University who worked with Mr. Powell at the Fed, said Mr. Powell had endeavored to understand monetary policy and had demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject. But Mr. Faust said it might be particularly important to have a trained economist as chairman if there was another recession.
"If the economy broadly behaves, I don't think it'll be of great consequence," Mr. Faust said. "If we were to face another period where you need innovative and creative leadership, Jay has a lot of skills, and it could still go O.K., but you'd like to add to those skills a lifetime of studying monetary policy."
Mr. Powell, 64, is a Washington native who has spent most of his life in a mix of public and private roles. He studied politics at Princeton University, then earned a law degree from Georgetown University before embarking on a career in investment banking in New York.
In 1990, he returned to Washington to work for his former boss, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, as under secretary for finance. When Salomon Brothers was caught manipulating the market in Treasuries, Mr. Powell, vacationing on Cape Cod, spent a long August weekend on the phone arranging for top managers to resign and for Warren E. Buffett to be chairman of the company's board.
Under pressure to account for the shortcomings in regulation, Mr. Powell told a congressional committee in 1991, "There is no question that it can be improved, and improve it we will."
Mr. Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997 and earned a fortune. His most recent financial disclosure showed a net worth of as much as $55 million. In 2005, he left the firm to focus on fiscal policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
He attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011 for his work behind the scenes to persuade congressional Republicans to raise the debt ceiling. The next year, President Barack Obama nominated Mr. Powell to the Fed alongside a Democrat, the Harvard economist Jeremy Stein, in a package deal that was meant to attract bipartisan support.
Mr. Stein returned to his life as a Harvard professor after two years; Mr. Powell decided he liked working at the Fed, and so he stayed.

Full text: Here's what to expect in the week ahead: TECHNOLOGY
Tech giants to face congressional questions.
Some of the world's internet heavyweights will make their first public appearances before lawmakers investigating the role their sites played in Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Beginning Tuesday, the top lawyers for Facebook, Google and Twitter will appear in three consecutive hearings. On Tuesday afternoon, the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism will hold a hearing on how social media networks have been used to promote terrorism or radicalization and may address a bill proposing that websites disclose who paid for political ads they carry. Wednesday is the main event, starting with a 9:30 a.m. hearing by the Senate Intelligence Committee and then a 2 p.m. hearing by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Those hearings will be focused on misinformation and fake accounts linked to Russia that were used to purchase ads during the election. Cecilia Kang
ECONOMY
Eurozone economy bouncing back.
The renaissance of the eurozone economy is expected to be confirmed on Tuesday when the European Union statistics agency publishes an initial estimate of economic growth. Analysts forecast that the economy of the 19 countries in the eurozone grew 0.5 percent from July through September compared with the previous three months, as countries like Spain bounce back after almost a decade of malaise. Confidence in the eurozone's prospects has prompted the European Central Bank to begin dismantling the emergency stimulus it has been providing, but there are still trouble spots, like Italy, where banks are weak and growth is meager. Jack Ewing
Government to release data on employee earnings.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release data Tuesday on the Employment Cost Index for the third quarter. The report is less well-known than other measures of wages and earnings, but is preferred by many economists for its methodological sophistication and because it accounts for the cost of employee benefits. Economists will be looking for evidence that low unemployment is at last translating into faster wage growth for workers; the last report, in July, showed wages rising but more slowly than before the 2008-9 recession. Ben Casselman
BANKING
European banks report earnings.
More of Europe's largest lenders will report their results for the third quarter. Credit Suisse, the British banks HSBC and Standard Chartered and the French banks BNP Paribas and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale are all scheduled to update investors. European banks that reported their results last week generally mirrored their American counterparts, suffering tough quarters on trading revenue, but benefiting from stronger consumer lending. Chad Bray
ECONOMY
A Fed meeting and, perhaps, a new chairman.
While President Trump publicly deliberates who should lead the Federal Reserve next year, it's business as usual at the Fed, which will hold a regularly scheduled meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged. The big question is whether the Fed remains on course to raise the rate at its final meeting of the year, in December. Any sign of hesitation would surprise financial markets. Economic growth is strong, unemployment is low and the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, has said repeatedly that she isn't overly worried about low inflation. Binyamin Appelbaum
AUTO INDUSTRY
Auto sales expected to resume decline.
Automakers on Wednesday are expected to report declines in new vehicle sales in October, a return to the downward trend the industry has been grappling with this year. In September, auto sales jumped as consumers rushed to replace cars and trucks damaged by the hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida. But that boost has dissipated. Edmunds.con is forecasting that October sales declined by 3.5 percent compared with a year ago. While sales remain at healthy levels, they have fallen every month this year except in September, after a record total in 2016. Neal E. Boudette
Investors looking for news on Tesla's Model 3 production.
When Tesla reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, all eyes will be focused not on the bottom line, but on the Model 3 production line. The electric car maker is expected to report a quarterly loss -- it has lost money in five of the last six quarters -- but more important is whether it has solved the bottlenecks that slowed production of the $35,000 Model 3, its first mass-market car. From July to September, Tesla produced fewer than 300, short of a goal of 1,500. Investors are hoping the earnings report will be accompanied by more details on the company's progress. Neal E. Boudette
ECONOMY
Bank of England expected to raise rates.
The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates on Thursday as it releases its latest forecast for inflation. The central bank dropped rates to the lowest level in its history last year over concerns about how the British economy might fare after a vote to leave the European Union, commonly known as Brexit. A decline in the value of the pound since the vote has raised concerns about inflation, prompting some members of the bank's Monetary Policy Committee to vote for an increase in rates in recent months. Inflation in Britain reached 2.8 percent in September, its highest level in five years, according to the Office of National Statistics. The central bank sees a 2 percent inflation rate as a sign of healthy economic growth. Chad Bray
A rebound is expected for the job market.
Employers in the United States cut jobs in September for the first time in seven years, a decline that economists attributed largely to the hurricanes that struck Texas and Florida. On Friday, the government's monthly employment report will reveal how strongly the job market has bounced back. Economists expect the report to show that employers added about 300,000 jobs in October, which would represent the strongest growth in more than two years. Policymakers will be watching closely. Disappointing data on hiring or workers' earnings could make the Federal Reserve think twice about raising interest rates in December. Ben Casselman

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- George Clooney served up a comedic drama that gave Paramount Pictures the worst wide-release opening total in its history. Steven Spielberg's production company delivered a military drama that went widely ignored. The Weinstein Company offloaded a horror movie in very limited release and took in a grand total of $742. Put simply: Hollywood had another horrific weekend at the box office.
The No. 1 movie was "Jigsaw," the eighth installment in the "Saw" horror series. It took in about $16.3 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data, tying "Saw VI" for the lowest opening in the franchise, after adjusting for inflation. Analysts had anticipated ticket sales of roughly $20 million for "Jigsaw," which received poor reviews.
Lionsgate, which spent a modest $10 million to make "Jigsaw," also had the No. 2 movie. "Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween" collected an estimated $10 million, for a two-week total of $35.5 million.
According to comScore, domestic ticket sales for October totaled $539 million, a 13 percent decline from the same month last year, when dramas like "The Accountant" and "The Girl on the Train" got turnstiles clicking. Explanations for the downturn include the escalating popularity of streaming services -- "Stranger Things 2" arrived on Netflix on Friday -- and subpar offerings from Hollywood; Mr. Clooney's film, "Suburbicon," received a D-minus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls.
After years of focusing on big-budget fantasy movies, Hollywood may also have inadvertently trained people to think of moviegoing as less of a pastime and more as a special event. (Next weekend, Disney will release "Thor: Ragnarok" in theaters, and ticket sales are expected to be massive. In partial release overseas over the weekend, "Thor: Ragnarok" collected $107.6 million, beating "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2" in some countries.)
Contributing to dismal weekend results in North America was "Suburbicon," which is Mr. Clooney's sixth film as a director and his fourth misfire. Bludgeoned by critics -- "a tonal disaster from start to finish" is how RogerEbert.com put it -- "Suburbicon" cost about $25 million to make, and took in roughly $2.8 million in the United States. It was distributed into 2,046 theaters, giving Paramount its worst wide-release result on record.
"Suburbicon" is not a financial catastrophe for Paramount. After initially passing on the script, the studio ended up paying about $10 million for domestic rights. Foreign distributors covered the balance of the cost. The problem is that Mr. Clooney -- an Oscar-winning actor and producer -- has now had more misses than hits as a director, which is usually when studios cut off the money. (Especially if you are a female director.)
Mr. Clooney's last film, "The Monuments Men," was also a critical and commercial disappointment in 2014. So was "Leatherheads" in 2008. His first stab at directing, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," got good reviews in 2002 but fizzled at the box office. Mr. Clooney's successes as a filmmaker have been "The Ides of March" in 2011 and "Good Night, and Good Luck," for which he received an Oscar nomination for best director in 2006.
Also flopping over the weekend was "Thank You for Your Service," which cost Mr. Spielberg's Amblin Partners $20 million to make and took in roughly $3.7 million. "Thank You for Your Service," which received mostly positive reviews and was distributed by Universal Pictures, may have suffered from a lack of audience interest in films involving the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "American Sniper" was a smash hit in 2014, but ticket buyers have rejected entries like "Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk" (2016), "Green Zone" (2010), "In the Valley of Elah" (2007), "Lions for Lambs" (2007) and "Home of the Brave" (2006).
Also notable: "Amityville: The Awakening," a low-budget horror movie from Dimension, a division of the embattled Weinstein Company, and Blumhouse Productions, was made available in 10 theaters on Saturday. The fate of this movie, which was released on GooglePlay for free earlier this month, was decided long before the sexual harassment crisis that has enveloped the Weinstein Company in recent weeks. But it nonetheless adds to the poor recent track record of Dimension, run by Bob Weinstein.

Donald Trump Wants to Raise Your Taxes

Full text: The old formula for passing a big tax cut for the rich was simple: Package it with a modest tax cut for the middle class -- and talk endlessly about the middle-class part. President Trump and Congress are following the formula in some ways. Their plan would deliver an average tax cut of $700,000 to the nation's 175,000 richest families. That's enough for each to buy a new 50-foot yacht, annually. Meanwhile, Trump and other Republican leaders keep repeating "middle class," "middle class," "middle class."
Yet there is also a major difference between the current plan and George W. Bush's tax cut or Ronald Reagan's. Trump's plan would not actually cut taxes for many middle-class families. It would raise them.
These families are in the minority, yes. But there are a lot of them. About 17 percent of households earning between $50,000 and $150,000 would see their taxes rise immediately, according to the only rigorous analysis so far, by the Tax Policy Center. Among households earning between $150,000 and $250,000, the share is about 35 percent.
These numbers would grow over time, for reasons I'll explain. Ultimately, the plan would be likely to hurt the finances of the vast majority of Americans. No wonder it is starting to look politically vulnerable. Last week, a precursor bill barely passed the House, receiving 20 no votes from Republicans, many worried about the tax increases.
Republican leaders certainly have a path to passing a tax bill, because nothing unites modern Republicans the way a tax cut does. But the opposition to the recent health care bills also started as an underdog and managed to prevail, by relentlessly talking about the bills' effects. When enough Americans understood the truth, enough members of Congress felt pressure to vote no.
The same could happen on taxes. It is already starting to. Recent polls suggest the plan's approval rating is only about 30 percent.
To understand the Trump tax increases, you should first acknowledge the most admirable feature of his plan. It doesn't aspire to be merely a tax cut. It aspires to be tax reform -- both cuts and increases. Some deductions shrink, while rates fall, in the name of simplifying the tax code.
But after this promising start, the plan commits its cardinal sin. It places the highest priority on huge tax cuts for the very wealthy. They get lower rates and get to keep cherished tax breaks, like the "carried interest" loophole. Herbert Hoover's Republican Party wanted to put a chicken in every pot. Donald Trump's wants to put a yacht at every private dock.
Having lavished so much money on the wealthy, the tax package -- or at least the vague framework that the administration has released -- doesn't have much remaining to spend on middle class and poor families. For them, the package is a mix of pluses and minuses. Many face a lower tax rate, but some face a higher one, and many families lose deductions.
The combination creates a lot of losers. Reduced deductions for children, for example, hurt large families, notes N.Y.U.'s Lily Batchelder. And the deduction for state and local taxes -- also a target for cuts -- now benefits 30 percent of households nationwide. It was the main reason for last week's House defections, and the tensions over it haven't been resolved.
Then there are the long-term problems I mentioned earlier. First, Trump's plan takes a skimpy approach to inflation adjustments, which will push many families into higher tax brackets over time. Second, the plan would radically increase the federal deficit, and when it comes to the deficit, what goes up must eventually come down. At some point, the government will need to pay its bills, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.
Virtually any future deficit-reduction plan -- except for a repeal of the Trump tax plan -- would hurt most families more than his plan helps them. This chain of events has happened before. The Reagan and George W. Bush tax cuts may have at first seemed to help the middle class and poor. But the deficits led to later cuts in education, medical research, transportation and anti-poverty programs that almost surely erased the benefits of a modest tax cut. Already, today's congressional leaders are talking about sizable cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.
Trump and his allies are feverishly trying to claim their plan really would benefit the middle class. Their latest talking point is the notion that corporate tax cuts will create an indirect windfall for workers. Funny, though, how the wealthy get most of the direct benefits, while everyone else has to hope for indirect ones somehow to materialize.
The main lesson of this year's health care battle was the political power of facts. They don't always win the day, but it's better to have them as an ally than an enemy. Right now, facts are the biggest problem for Trump's tax plan.

Cuban's Not Done Trolling Trump

Full text: If you want to know just how surreal things have gotten, consider this: In 2015, Donald Trump had to decide between playing the president in "Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!" and running to be the actual president. And it wasn't an easy choice.
A "Sharknado" producer got tired of waiting for Trump -- he was the second choice, after Sarah Palin turned down the gig -- to sign his contract. So the role was offered to Mark Cuban and Trump's lawyer threatened to sue, the producer told The Hollywood Reporter.
Cuban ended up in the cinematic White House with the sharks circling, and Ann Coulter as his veep, and Trump ended up in the real White House with the sharks circling, and Ann Coulter as his frenemy.
"I think it's funny as hell, yeah," Cuban says with a grin.
Maybe deploying a shotgun and grenades to save the White House from a shower of sharks -- while simultaneously starring on "Shark Tank" -- gave Cuban the scent of chum in the Potomac. He puts the odds that he will challenge his fellow loud billionaire, master salesman and reality TV star in 2020 at 10 percent -- "maybe 11."
"I'm considering it, yes," he tells me. "I would put the odds against it right now for family reasons, but there is still plenty of time."
A few weeks after Trump took office, The New York Post reported that Steve Bannon had identified Cuban as the No. 1 threat for 2020 because he could appeal to Republicans and independents.
"Bannon is a smart man," smiles Cuban, who has huddled with the strategist.
I met the voluble owner of the Dallas Mavericks at Jean-Georges in the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle, where he keeps an apartment. It seemed a bit dicey to be discussing a possible coup at the same elegant eatery where the president-elect tortured Mitt Romney by dangling the secretary of state job over sautÃ©ed frogs' legs.
But Cuban is nothing if not brazen. He ambles into the three-star Michelin restaurant in his usual jeans and Adidas kicks, wearing a T-shirt someone had sent him that read "Stronger Than Lions."
When I ask if he would run as an independent, he replies: "Probably, or a Republican. I'm registered as an independent. I mean, I'd rather do it as an independent." But running as an independent has not proved successful in modern times. You just become a spoiler like Ross Perot. (Who is Cuban's neighbor in Dallas, along with W.)
Cuban epitomizes a tantalizing question: Will Trump's election open the floodgates to celebrities who are thinking, "Wow, if that dude can do it...," and who can titillate the media by delivering what Cuban calls "headline porn," or will it send voters scurrying back to more traditional pols?
The 59-year-old, who got rich with one of the first online streaming companies, has been described as "Trump without the crazy." He calls Trump batty but has also written that it's good to have "the edge," when "people think you're crazy and they are right, but you don't care what they think."
He gives free rein to his goofball side. He once bought a six-month supply of toilet paper at a store in Dallas to hedge against inflation. "I order 36 tubes of Theodent toothpaste at a time and they just stack up," he says. "When I buy razor blades, I buy a load of them because it doesn't take much space and they're expensive."
He also confesses to having been naked in front of his computer, hitting the refresh button, waiting for his stock price to reach the point where he was a billionaire -- a moment recreated by Cuban's mentally unhinged doppelgÃ¤nger on HBO's "Silicon Valley," Russ Hanneman.
"Look, there are people who are saying we don't need another business person," he says, sipping iced tea. "But it's about what you do with it, what you learn, what you can contribute and what value you can add. I'd want to come in with proof of an agenda, 'Here's a health care solution and I've already paid my own money to have it scored.'
"They always say that people vote against what they didn't like about the previous president, right? And I think he's so ineffective, people will look for somebody who can get something done who's not a politician. If that's a celebrity, that's just an easier platform to work from. The best example is tax reform, right?"
He says he would call the top 5,000 profitable companies and say: If I'm going to give you a 20 percent corporate tax rate, I'm going to need a commitment from you that you're going to increase the wages of your lowest-paid workers.
"If you did that," he says, "you'd be a hero."
Asked if he would send the Mavericks' former player Dennis Rodman to negotiate with Little Rocket Man, he replies, "Why not?"
Trump and Cuban are testosterone twins in some ways. Both savor poking elites and flouting convention. Both have owned sports teams and love making movie and TV cameos. Both say the government has conspired against them, Trump with the Deep State and Cuban when he fended off insider-trading charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2008.
But Cuban is more charitable. He recently lent his jet to the Mavericks' point guard J. J. Barea to take emergency supplies to Puerto Rico. He is also fairer in business. Forbes said that on "Shark Tank," Cuban had the best record of following through with the terms of a deal.
He is more reflective than Trump. In a 2012 blog post, he wrote that he regretted cracking a gay joke in an interview: "I think being the person I want to be includes not blurting out throwaway jokes about sexuality, race, ethnicity, size, disability or other things people have no say in about themselves."
In 2014 he came under pressure for a comment perceived as racially insensitive, saying while discussing bigotry, "If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street," and if he sees a white guy who "has tattoos all over his face," he'd do the same. He apologized to the family of Trayvon Martin.
But Cuban can empathize with Trump. "If you just put on the eyes of a sales guy and an entrepreneur who struggled a lot, that's Donald Trump," Cuban says. "He's overselling all the time. Most people when they sell, they try to solve problems. Donald Trump is not a problem solver. Never was. Never will be. To Donald Trump, people are fungible. Where's the list of entrepreneurs who say, 'He mentored me, he helped me, he invested in me'?"
I note that Trump has trolled us both on Twitter, calling me a "neurotic dope" and Cuban an "arrogant, crude, dope" who is "not smart enough to run for president."
"There are three Donald Trumps," he says. "Donald Trump, the president. Donald Trump, the salesperson. Donald Trump, the troll. Trolls are going to troll." Trump's Twitter personality, Cuban says, is just like a guy "screaming at a sporting event." (He himself has paid the N.B.A. hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for screaming courtside.)
Cuban said during the primaries that he would accept a position as Hillary's running mate or Trump's. "I wasn't a Hillary fan, by the way," he says, but he was less of a Donald fan, so he campaigned for her and sat in the front row for the first debate.
Cuban likes to say whining is underrated, but what did he think of Hillary blaming Comey, Sanders, Obama, Biden, Putin?
"They didn't see it coming at all," he says of the arrogant Clinton camp. "I remember right before the election, they invited me to the party in Brooklyn. I'm like, are you kidding me? You do not plan the parade before you win the championship.
"In sports, matchups matter, right? Hillary was prepared to have a policy-against-policy matchup against a politician. She was not prepared to have a matchup against a movement."
He scoffs: "The Russians had no effect on the election. Look, if you spotted Donald Trump two pieces of bread and behind him was a refrigerator full of ham, he couldn't collude with the Russians to make a ham sandwich. Right?"
Since both he and Trump had shows produced by Mark Burnett, I wonder if Cuban had ever pressed the producer to hand over that alleged compilation tape from "The Apprentice" with Trump's sexist and racist comments. Yes, Cuban says, but Burnett told him he didn't have such a tape.
His friendly relations with Trump frayed amid the campaign trolling. "Last time I talked to him was via email when he asked me why I went negative on him," Cuban says. "And I sent him an email back saying, 'At some point, you have to learn the issues.' Does he really understand the ins and outs of health care? No, he mixes health insurance up with life insurance, right?" He sent Trump a congratulations email after he got elected, but has had no further contact.
Still, he says he would serve as a tech adviser to the White House if asked. "If China and Russia are able to advance their A.I. further than ours," he says, "they're going to kick our ass."
Cuban always says he's lucky and his anthem is Joe Walsh's "Life's Been Good." He lives in a Dallas mansion with five wet bars, three kids and his wife, Tiffany, whom he describes as a "smart, funny and beautiful" and "a badass." His wife lets him live like Tom Hanks in "Big." "We've got a basketball dribble machine and there is a basketball court in the ballroom," he says.
He did well, I say, with his samba to the "I Dream of Jeannie" theme on "Dancing With the Stars," especially given that he had just had hip replacement surgery.
"I told my wife," he says, "I don't want to look back and say I would've, could've, should've."
Maybe that's what Cuban is thinking about 2020.

Full text: The United States economy is showing increased signs of resilience. The nation's gross domestic product, a key indicator of economic strength, expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. The expansion defied concerns that hurricanes in Texas and Florida would put a damper on output.
Republicans called the report a sign that businesses were already spending more in anticipation of a corporate tax cut, and evidence that the economy could grow faster over the long term than currently forecast.
"If you look at the G.D.P. data, it's clear that is a major reason," Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, asserted on Friday.
Many economists, however, are reluctant to give Congress or the administration too much credit for the economy's trajectory.
"There hasn't been anything concrete in terms of spending or tax cuts that we can point to that's fueling the acceleration," said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. If anyone deserves credit for the good news, he said, it is the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
The economy is experiencing its fastest growth spurt in two consecutive quarters since 2014, after hitting 3.1 percent in the spring, a level that prompted President Trump to suggest that "we're really on our way" to sustaining that pace year-round. "On a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent," Mr. Trump said during a speech in Missouri in August.
But economists say it is highly unlikely that growth for the year will reach 3 percent. The first quarter was tepid, and projections for the current quarter hover around 2.8 percent.
With legislation embodying the party's tax proposals expected next week, the figures released on Friday also highlight the fine line Republicans are walking in selling their policy: They are celebrating faster growth while arguing that tax reform is needed to accelerate it further.
Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement on Friday that "our economy produced solid growth last quarter" and went on to say that tax reform was a way to "continue this growth" and "reinvigorate America's economy."
On Friday, Mr. Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers released projections of how one prospective provision of the tax plan -- a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20 percent from 35 percent -- would affect economic growth. They said it would expand output by 3 to 5 percent over the long run, a period left unspecified.
The complication is that faster growth could undermine the party's case that tax cuts are needed to add fuel to an economy that is already running with low unemployment -- and it could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly, which could dampen the effects of any tax bill.
Liberal economists said the report showed the success of Ms. Yellen at the Fed and undermined the case for the Republican tax bill. "The underlying trend in G.D.P. growth is clearly telling us two things," Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama who is now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email. "Keep on rockin' steady with Yellen at the Fed, and there's no need for a big, wasteful tax cut."
The Fed, judging that the economy is growing about as fast as it can, is on course to raise its benchmark interest rate in December to a level Fed officials have described as likely neither to encourage nor to discourage growth. The Fed's plans do not reflect the potential economic impact of a tax cut.
Aside from the details of the legislation, the Fed's reaction may also depend on its leadership. Mr. Trump is expected to announce next week whom he will nominate to lead the Fed after Ms. Yellen's term ends in early February.
The growth figure released on Friday was the government's first estimate of economic output for the quarter, and it will be revised twice. Economists initially expected that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma would deal a blow to the country's steady growth -- a prospect reinforced by a net job loss in September -- but became more optimistic in recent weeks.
After the shock dissipates, the recovery from an extreme weather event can help the economy by creating new reasons for consumer spending, which represents roughly 70 percent of national output. After the damage is done, people must often rebuild their homes or replace their cars, an effect that began to show up in the third quarter and will most likely continue through the end of the year.
"If you don't go out to eat during a hurricane, maybe you bought plywood for your house," said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. "If you have the insurance and support, that tends to be a stimulus to the economy."
The destruction wrought by the storms was outweighed by the continued spending of consumers and businesses. The job market is lively, and the stock market has rallied to record highs. Chief executives and consumers are more confident than they have been in more than a decade, recent surveys show.
"There are no real headwinds to growth for the first time since the expansion began," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "We are at full employment and we are in full swing; let the good times roll."
Spending on equipment increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, as companies poured money into capital improvements. One reason companies may be investing more in their business is that the labor market has tightened and wages are rising.
"Businesses are going to be looking for more ways to produce than just adding bodies," said Mr. Anderson of Bank of the West.
Personal consumption, although down from the previous quarter, grew at a 2.4 percent rate, and nonresidential fixed investment, a measure of business spending, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent. Mr. Zandi said the numbers were "a sign that consumers are hanging tough."
At the same time, with a weak dollar making American goods more competitive abroad, international trade contributed positively to output for the third quarter in a row. Imports decreased.
The weak dollar through much of this year has been a boon to exporters like David Ickert, vice president for finance at Air Tractor Inc. The company, which is based in Olney, Tex., a town of about 3,100 people west of Dallas, makes crop dusters and forestry firefighting planes for markets including European countries along the Mediterranean Sea, sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Half of its sales are international.
"Things are picking up -- I sense it in Europe," Mr. Ickert said. He emphasized that the positive impact of trade at a broad level filtered down to rural communities. "Trade helps create and sustain jobs in small-town America with a small business," he said.
The American economy has performed considerably better this year than in 2016, when it grew at a halting 1.5 percent. And things have been looking up, economically, for much of the world, which is enjoying a rare moment of widespread expansion. The International Monetary Fund upgraded its forecast for the pace of world growth twice this year.
"This is happening globally," Mr. Zandi, the Moody's economist, said. "There isn't a single major economy that is in recession."

Full text: PARIS -- The people running France would like to clear up what they contend is an unfortunate misunderstanding: They are not ditching the egalitarian ideals of French society for the ravages of global capitalism. Yes, the investment banker turned president, Emmanuel Macron, has decreed alterations to the famously voluminous French labor code that make it less of an expensive hassle for employers to fire workers. He unabashedly champions greater risk as a key to rejuvenating the moribund economy.
But the changes unleashed are supposed to come with greater support for workers via expanded unemployment benefits and revamped training programs. It is a plan modeled on that veritable workers' paradise, the Nordic countries, and not on brutal, winner-take-all societies like the United States and Britain.
To sell its changes to a dubious French public, Mr. Macron's administration has even imported a term coined in Denmark: flexicurity, a portmanteau of flexibility and security.
"We need to adapt France to globalization while still being French," said Antoine Foucher, chief of staff to the French labor minister, pushing back against the notion that neoliberal economics has seized the land of Rousseau. "We need flexibility, but also a new kind of welfare system, with more rights for people taking risks, and more rights for people who are not finding their place in globalization."
Yet in draping labor reforms under the banner of the Nordic way, Mr. Macron's administration confronts considerable skepticism.
Economists doubt that the Nordic model can be transplanted from Scandinavia -- where dealings between unions and employers are convivial -- to France, where strikes that bring life to a halt are a cherished ritual.
Major unions see a plot to strip away labor protections with happy talk of government support that will never materialize. Many doubt that Mr. Macron can find the money to bolster the safety net.
"Flexicurity is just fancy packaging," said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at the Institute for European Studies at the Free University of Brussels. "So far, it's all flexibility and no security.
"Mr. Macron is handing out tax cuts to the richest 10 percent," she continued. "They will do the labor reforms, and then they will tell you that there is no money for anything else."
That France needs change is a given. Its unemployment rate is 9.5 percent, and has risen even as the picture has improved in countries worst hit by the European crisis like Spain, Italy and Portugal. Nearly one in four young people is unemployed.
But how to generate more jobs provokes fierce argument.
Unions pin blame for high unemployment on weak demand for goods and services. Pay workers more, they say, and spending will be unleashed through the French economy, generating jobs.
The unions are often caricatured as intransigent obstacles to progress, and they have a way of amplifying that image. Ask the CGT -- a major union that has struck the most combative stance against the changes -- for its plan to fix France. Its leaders call for cutting the workweek from the current 35 hours to a mere 32. Then, they say, more people will be needed.
To the government, this type of thinking -- prime material for French lampooning -- exemplifies how the country has failed to adapt. Renault, the French automaker, now manufactures cars in Romania, where wages are a fraction of those in France. Restricting work invites an exodus of jobs to lower-wage countries.
What France needs, Mr. Macron asserts, is flexibility that can free entrepreneurs from the strictures of an outmoded labor code. The changes are supposed to make it possible for start-up companies to pay lower wages in their early stages, rather than having to hew to national labor contracts that govern janitors, agricultural workers and people on assembly lines.
In contrast to years past, when labor militancy killed stabs at an overhaul, the government has this time won the cautious assent of some unions. Strikes in recent weeks have failed to inflict much disruption, underscoring a sense that the changes are essentially a done deal.
Still, the CGT vows to battle on, accusing the government of an appalling attack on the rights of laborers.
"Macron is suggesting a total societal change that goes against what has guided French society since the end of World War II," said Manu Blanco, a board member of the CGT. "He is suggesting a model of extreme individualism, where workers earn hardly anything."
Whatever the merits, Mr. Macron's move does pose a historic challenge to power dynamics between working people and their bosses. Under a law adopted in 1884, unions were enshrined as the sole official representatives of French employees. They have maintained broad authority over national wages and working conditions ever since.
Over the last two decades, companies have extracted the right to hire temporary workers. The fresh changes allow smaller companies to negotiate directly with workers, while enabling larger companies to work out agreements with unions tailored to local conditions.
"The fundamental inspiration of these reforms is the idea that protection of workers has gone too far," said Michel Pigenet, an expert in the history of labor movements at the Sorbonne in Paris. "That, in a globalized system, these protections are a constraint on competitiveness and the economy."
The government and its advisers frequently cite Germany as an inspiration for their labor plan. After German employers gained greater latitude over wages in the 1990s, joblessness dropped significantly. German companies became more competitive.
But much of that boost came via a drop in pay. Poverty has risen in Germany along with the numbers of people depending on government aid. This has corresponded with an increase in part-time work.
"It's not a model," said Eric Beynel, a spokesman for Solidaires, a French union that opposes the labor changes. "It's been a catastrophe."
The new rules are directed at lowering the unemployment rate. But joblessness is at best an incomplete indicator of economic health.
In many major economies -- strikingly, in the United States and Britain -- the unemployment rate has fallen sharply, yet average wages are lower than a decade ago, after accounting for inflation. Many new jobs are low-paying, part-time positions.
French unions cite these realities as backing for their fight. In their vernacular, competitiveness and flexibility are just euphemisms for diminished livelihood and anxiety.
But only 8 percent of the French work force belongs to a union. The unions opposing the new rules are vulnerable to charges that they accept joblessness for the masses as the price of protecting their narrow segment of French workers -- a group that trends white and male.
"Their clients are insiders, so they defend insiders," said AgnÃ¨s BÃ©nassy-QuÃ©rÃ©, an economist who chairs the Economic Analysis Council, which advises the French government on policy.
On a recent morning at the unemployment office in the 19th Arrondissement of Paris -- an area home to many North African immigrants -- people lining up for assistance tended not to see unions as a force in their lives.
"It's hard to find jobs," said Sara Omari, 36, a Tunisian immigrant. "It's easier for French people."
Economists doubt the central premise of the labor plan -- that easing firing will inspire companies to hire. "In the short term, it will actually make it easier to destroy jobs," said Eric Heyer, an economist at SciencesPo, a university in Paris. "A lot of businesses have too many people."
The Nordic-style support system is posited as a cushion against joblessness while allowing workers to make a transition to more fruitful careers.
Given that France already has national health care, a minimum wage and generous social welfare programs, this is not fanciful. Mentioning the Nordic model to a labor economist tends to elicit the same reaction as references to ProvenÃ§al cuisine for a gastronome.
But the Nordic model is as much a cultural phenomenon as a set of codified rules, a spirit of collective prosperity spanning labor and management.
"The level of confidence between the social partners is at a very high level," said Oystein Dorum, chief economist at NHO, the main employers' association representing Norwegian businesses in negotiations with unions. "There's a sense from the other side of the table that wage claims must be reasonable so we can protect enterprises, and profitable enterprises lead to more jobs."
The unpleasantries of budget arithmetic may pose the biggest challenge of all.
Mr. Macron has vowed to trim spending as he strives to comply with European limits on public debt. That imperative has special force as the French president woos German support for his proposals to further integrate the countries that share the euro currency. Winning Germany's blessing requires that France demonstrate a commitment to European budget rules, which are revered in Berlin (except when Germany is breaking them).
Mr. Macron appears to have wrested the upper hand. Parliament will most likely ratify his changes before the end of the year. Then, the tougher challenge commences -- proving that greater risk translates into greater security in a nation that has long revered equality.

Full text: Few American industries are as invested in the decades-long political battle over immigration as agriculture. Paying low wages for backbreaking work, growers large and small have historically relied on immigrants from south of the Rio Grande. These days, over one-quarter of the farmhands in the United States are immigrants working here illegally. This is how the growers will respond to President Trump's threatened crackdown on immigration: They will lobby, asking Congress to provide some legal option to hang on to their foreign work force. They will switch to crops like tree nuts, which are less labor-intensive to produce than perishable fruits and vegetables. They will look for technology to mechanize the harvest of strawberries and other crops. And they will rent land in Mexico.
There is one thing they won't do. Even if the Trump administration were to deploy the 10,000 immigration agents it plans to hire across the nation's fields to detain and deport farmhands working illegally, farmers are very unlikely to raise wages and improve working conditions to attract American workers instead.
"Foreign workers will always be harvesting our crops," Tom Nassif, who heads the Western Growers Association, told me. The only question for policymakers in Washington is whether "they want them to be harvesting in our economy or in another country." If they choose the latter, he warned, they might consider that each farmworker sustains two to three jobs outside the fields.
Most of what we know about the effect of immigration on American-born workers is based on studies of what happens when immigrants arrive. Almost 30 years ago, the economist David Card found that the Mariel boatlift of 1980, in which more than 100,000 Cubans fleeing the island landed in Florida, did little damage to either the employment or the wages of the Americans they competed with.
A flurry of research since then has tried to find fault with that counterintuitive conclusion. Yet despite the claims from the Trump administration that immigrants have decimated the working class, Mr. Card's analysis has emerged pretty much unscathed: With few exceptions, economists agree that even less-educated natives suffer little when immigrants arrive.
What if the shock goes the other way, though? We know less about what happens when immigrant workers are kicked out. But a series of studies over the past year are also coming to something of a consensus: Expelling immigrants does not open opportunities for workers born in the United States, either. Rather, the shock leaves them worse off than when the immigrants were here.
In a forthcoming study, Giovanni Peri and Annie Laurie Hines of the University of California, Davis, take advantage of an underappreciated fact of American immigration policy: President Barack Obama went on a deportation spree in his first term. The number of unauthorized immigrants detained far from the border -- on the job, at home, in public spaces -- more than tripled, to nearly 350,000 from 2007 to 2011, after which Mr. Obama changed tack to focus more narrowly on unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.
The researchers found that employment and wages in states like Arizona, where apprehensions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement surged, did no better than in states where apprehensions changed little, like Delaware, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The results suggest that in regions where enforcement intensified the most, the wages of American-born workers actually did worse.
The argument of Professor Peri and Ms. Hines is intuitive. Raids and deportations are disruptive. They can scare away other workers -- leaving employers scrambling to maintain production. When immigration agents raided a mushroom farm in Pennsylvania this year, they scared away workers in nearby farms -- which had to cut their own production.
These sorts of events can increase uncertainty among businesses and depress investment. "The uncertainty and the disruption of labor market activities caused by the surge in apprehensions is likely to have generated the departure of firms and the relocation of production," the researchers wrote. Think of California avocado farmers checking out plots in MichoacÃ¡n.
One could argue that growers will eventually get over the shock of immigration raids. Once the dust settles, they may have more jobs at better wages for American workers. But the evidence is not promising.
Another study published last month by Professor Peri and two colleagues examined the effect of forced repatriation of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in 893 cities between 1929 and 1934. It was sold as an effort to reduce unemployment and give jobs to Americans who had been clobbered by the Great Depression. But unemployment rates for American-born workers were actually higher in cities that repatriated more Mexicans -- a consequence that persisted until 1940.
As my colleague Binyamin Appelbaum has noted, a separate study this year looked at the end of the Bracero program in 1964, when Mexican farmhands who had been invited to work the fields in place of American men shipped off to World War II were asked to leave. It found that the exclusion of Mexican farmworkers "had little measurable effect on the labor market for domestic farmworkers." Instead, growers mechanized some crops and dropped crops that remained labor intensive.
Another exclusion seems to be at hand. Immigration enforcement has become increasingly severe since Mr. Trump took office. The Department of Homeland Security is no longer focused on criminal immigrants, as it was at the end of the Obama administration, and is casting a wider net. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said its agents had made 43 percent more arrests of unauthorized immigrants than they did last year. From Jan. 22 through Sept. 2, there were 28,000 arrests of "noncriminal immigration violators" -- three times as many as during the same period in 2016.
It's not only businesses that are brainstorming about how to navigate the changing immigration politics. The hotel employees' union, for instance, wants labor contracts to assert that employers will not allow ICE agents into workplaces without warrants. Hoteliers and the union are talking about jointly training supervisors about what to do when immigration authorities show up.
From California to Florida, they are trying to figure out how to respond if, come January, Haitians lose the temporary protected status that allows them to work in the United States. In that case, "1.1 to 1.2 million people could become undocumented overnight," said MarÃ­a Elena Durazo, vice president for civil rights, diversity and immigration with Unite Here, the hospitality workers' union.
The Trump administration will cast these efforts as a sign of success: immigrants cowering before an American administration finally willing to stand up for its own.
But American workers might not want to hold their breath as they wait for the great new jobs to appear. Consider agriculture. There were 30,000 fewer workers in the industry this past spring than there were a year before, according to government statistics. Yet for all the complaints from farmers about labor shortages that forced them to pay more, the wages of field workers failed to keep up with inflation.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The two men that President Trump is considering as replacements for Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen of the Federal Reserve have sharply different views on monetary policy, offering a stark test of Mr. Trump's economic priorities. The choice pits a status quo candidate, a current Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, against a Stanford University economics professor, John B. Taylor, who is celebrated by many conservative Republicans for his insistence that the economy would produce stronger growth if the Fed would just get out of the way.
Mr. Trump said last week that he also might nominate Ms. Yellen, whom he said he liked "a lot," to a second term. He said Monday that a decision is "very, very close."
At a meeting with Senate Republicans on Tuesday, Mr. Trump conducted an informal poll, asking for a show of hands in support of Mr. Powell and Mr. Taylor. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the exercise showed Mr. Trump is taking the decision "very seriously."
Picking Mr. Powell could allow Mr. Trump to install a Republican Fed chairman without significantly altering monetary policy. Mr. Trump prizes the fact that the economy is growing and the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent.
The Fed's current path includes a gradual increase in the benchmark interest rate, which it slashed to nearly zero in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed has raised rates four times since then and is expected to approve another increase before the end of the year. It has also begun slowly reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of United States Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities that it purchased during the crisis to help lower borrowing costs.
Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed in 2012, has generally supported the Fed's expansive efforts to stimulate growth. Analysts regard him as likely to continue the Fed's gradual unwinding of that campaign, although perhaps pressing to raise interest rates a little more quickly.
"Our view is Powell is the G.O.P. version of Yellen, with the added kicker of wanting to reduce regulation," said Tom Porcelli, chief United States economist at RBC Capital Markets. He said Mr. Powell was "the easy choice if you want to maintain continuity."
But some Republicans in Congress and some of Mr. Trump's advisers, including Vice President Mike Pence, want to overhaul the central bank, beginning right at the top.
Mr. Taylor has been one of the Fed's most outspoken critics in recent years, repeatedly arguing that its stimulus campaign has done little good, considerable harm and should be ended as soon as possible. He also advocates structural reforms to prevent a repeat.
He says the Fed helped to cause the 2008 financial crisis and then impeded recovery. "One clear lesson from this historical experience is that the Fed should normalize policy and get back to the kind of policy that worked well in the past," he said in March.
Mr. Taylor's signature proposal is that the central bank should adopt a policy rule -- a mathematical formula to guide the movement of its benchmark rate. Mr. Taylor, who developed the first such rule in the early 1990s, argues that this would make monetary policy more predictable and thus more effective.
Because such rules are calibrated in normal times, that approach could have curtailed the Fed's stimulus campaign. Mr. Taylor's rule, for example, suggests the Fed by now should have raised its benchmark rate to around 3.5 percent. The rate currently sits between 1 percent and 1.25 percent.
Mr. Powell, along with most Fed officials, argues that policy rules are useful benchmarks, but human judgment is indispensable. "Simple policy rules are widely thought to be both interesting and useful, but to represent only a small part of the analysis needed to assess the appropriate path for policy," he said in February. "I am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation."
Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, estimated last year that if the Fed had followed Mr. Taylor's rule, 2.5 million more Americans would still have been unemployed, "enough to fill all 31 N.F.L. stadiums at the same time."
Mr. Taylor also favors restraints on other aspects of the Fed's post-crisis response, including the bond-buying campaign it undertook known as quantitative easing.
Mr. Taylor warned repeatedly at the time that the purchases would result in inflation. "We've got a high inflation down the road for sure," he said in June 2010. "When it will come, I can't predict. But unless there's a change in policy we're going to have inflation like back in the 1970s, or even more."
Instead, inflation has been persistently sluggish.
Mr. Taylor has since argued the purchases did no good and that the Fed should be restricted from buying mortgage bonds, because that provides support for a particular kind of borrowing -- a decision that belongs to fiscal policymakers.
He also wants to reverse a recent change in the mechanics of monetary policy. The Fed bought bonds from banks by increasing the reserves those banks hold at the Fed. That surge in reserve balances made it impossible to raise rates by limiting the availability of reserves, the traditional method, so instead the Fed paid banks not to use the reserves.
Mr. Taylor wants the Fed to revert to the minimalist mechanics.
Mr. Powell, by contrast, has defended the utility of the bond-buying campaign and argued that the new mechanics allow the Fed to control interest rates more effectively.
Theorizing about changing monetary policy is far easier than acting on it and academics who become policymakers often adopt a more pragmatic approach. Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, argued in the early 2000s that Japan should consider drastic actions to revive inflation. When he confronted weak inflation as Fed chairman, he did not attempt to pursue those policies.
Mr. Taylor, speaking earlier this month at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, suggested he might embrace that tradition. "I don't think of policy rules as tying central bankers' hands," he said. "I've never thought of rules as tying central bankers' hands. To me, they are ways of making monetary policy better."
Mr. Taylor also could find himself constrained by the Federal Open Market Committee, the group that sets Fed policy. As chairman he would set the committee agenda and run its meetings. Importantly, he would also direct the work of the Fed's staff, which produces the forecasts and background materials that undergird policy decisions.
Still, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to markedly reshape the Fed. There are currently just four members of the seven-member board, including Ms. Yellen and Mr. Powell. Mr. Trump's first pick for the board, Randal K. Quarles, the Fed's vice chairman of supervision, has expressed support for Mr. Taylor's approach to monetary policy. The remaining member, Lael Brainard, whose term expires in 2026, has said the Fed should take a cautious approach to raising rates.
Still, five regional presidents also vote at each policy meeting, which would help blunt any rapid change in approach.
"There's a lot of continuity at the Fed," John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a recent interview. "None of us are going anywhere, meaning the presidents. We have a deep bench of very professional staff and so I think that the idea that suddenly the Fed turns on a dime if certain positions change is not really accurate. It's a consensus-driven organization."

Full text: Last week John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, tried to defend President Trump against charges that he was grossly insensitive to the widow of a U.S. soldier killed in action. In the process, Kelly accused Frederica Wilson, the member of Congress and friend of the soldier's family who reported what Trump had said, of having behaved badly previously during the dedication of an F.B.I. building. Video of the dedication shows, however, that Kelly's claim was false, and that Representative Wilson's remarks at the ceremony were entirely appropriate. So Kelly, a former general and a man of honor, admitted his error and apologized profusely.
See? I made a joke!
In reality, of course, Kelly has neither admitted error nor apologized. Instead, the White House declared that it's unpatriotic to criticize generals -- which, aside from being a deeply un-American position, is ludicrous given the many times Donald Trump has done just that.
But we are living in the age of Trumpal infallibility: We are ruled by men who never admit error, never apologize and, crucially, never learn from their mistakes. Needless to say, men who think admitting error makes you look weak just keep making bigger mistakes; delusions of infallibility eventually lead to disaster, and one can only hope that the disasters ahead don't bring catastrophe for all of us.
Which brings me to the subject of the Federal Reserve. What?
The truth is that what I'm calling Trumpal infallibility -- the insistence on clinging to false ideas and refuted claims, no matter what -- is a disease that infested the modern Republican Party long before Trump. And one of the areas where the symptoms are especially severe is monetary policy.
You see, when the 2008 financial crisis struck, the Federal Reserve, led at the time by Ben Bernanke, took extraordinary action. It cut interest rates to zero and "printed money" on a huge scale -- not literally, but it bought trillions of dollars' worth of bonds by creating new bank reserves.
Many conservatives were aghast. TV pundits hyperventilated about hyperinflation, and even seemingly more respectable voices denounced the Fed's actions. In 2010 a who's who of conservative economists and pundits published an open letter warning that the Fed's policies would cause inflation and "debase the dollar."
But it never happened. In fact, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation has consistently fallen short of its target of 2 percent a year.
Now, every economist makes bad forecasts now and then -- if you don't, you're not taking enough risks. I've certainly made my share, including a bad market call on election night -- which I retracted three days later, acknowledging that my political dismay had gotten the better of my analytical judgment. But I always try to face up to my mistakes and learn from them.
But I guess I'm just old fashioned that way. Four years after that open letter to Bernanke, Bloomberg tracked down many of the signatories to ask what they had learned. None of them -- not one -- was even willing to admit having been wrong.
So what happens to economists who never admit mistakes, and never change their views in the light of experience? The answer, apparently, is that they get put on the short list to be the new Fed chair.
Consider, for example, the case of Stanford's John Taylor (one of the signatories of that open letter). Unlike some of the other names on the rumored list, he's a highly cited academic economist.
Since the financial crisis, however, he has repeatedly demanded that the Fed raise interest rates in line with a policy rule he devised a quarter-century ago. Failing to follow that rule was supposed to cause inflation, which it hasn't -- but seven years of being consistently wrong hasn't inspired any rethinking on his part.
What it has inspired is a descent into increasingly strange reasons the Fed should raise rates despite low inflation. Easy money, he declared, was part of a conspiracy to "bail out fiscal policy," that is, an effort to help President Barack Obama. Or maybe it was like the monetary equivalent of rent control, discouraging lending the way rent control discourages building apartments -- a bizarre analysis that had colleagues scratching their heads.
What these ever-odder interventions had in common was that they always offered some reason wrong was right -- why Taylor had been right to warn against easy-money policies even though higher inflation, the problem he predicted as a result of these policies, never materialized. And never, ever, an admission that maybe something was wrong with his initial analysis.
Again, everyone makes forecast errors. If you're consistently wrong, that should certainly count against your credibility; track records matter. But it's much worse if you can never bring yourself to admit past errors and learn from them.
That kind of behavior makes it all too likely that you'll keep making the same mistakes; but more than that, it shows something wrong with your character. And men with that character flaw should never be placed in positions of policy responsibility.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Since Janet L. Yellen became the Federal Reserve's chairwoman in February 2014, unemployment in the United States has steadily declined while inflation has remained low. Few Fed chairmen have achieved comparable success. Yet President Trump, who is scheduled to meet Ms. Yellen on Thursday, says he is still considering whether to nominate her for a second four-year term, and key White House aides are pressing for her to be replaced.
Ms. Yellen's peril reflects the polarization of American politics. The three previous Fed chairs were reappointed at least once by a president of the opposite political party, but some Republicans are eager to oust Ms. Yellen, a registered Democrat who has strongly defended post-crisis financial regulations.
She may also become a victim of her own success. Steady economic growth and the tranquillity of financial markets have emboldened some critics, who see an opportune moment for a transition to new leadership.
But Mr. Trump also faces warnings that replacing Ms. Yellen is an unnecessary risk to the economic growth the president has repeatedly pointed to as a primary success of his young administration.
"The economy is humming along," said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, a New York economic research firm. "The markets are humming along. Given all the other stuff that's going on, why mess with that?"
Mr. Trump is considering four candidates to replace Ms. Yellen. On that short list: Gary D. Cohn, the president's chief economic adviser; Jerome H. Powell, the only Republican on the Fed's board of governors; John B. Taylor, a Stanford University economist who has criticized the Fed for raising interest rates too slowly; and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.
"Honestly, I like them all," Mr. Trump said Tuesday. He added that he would choose a nominee "over the next very short period of time." The White House would like to make the nomination before he departs for a 12-day trip to Asia in early November. Ms. Yellen's term ends in early February, and the next chairman must be confirmed by the Senate.
Ms. Yellen, 71, has spent almost two decades at the Fed. She was a Fed governor in the mid-1990s, then returned to the Fed as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004. She became vice chairwoman in 2010 and chairwoman in 2014.
During her four-year term, the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.2 percent while inflation has remained below 2 percent. Both metrics are close to the levels the Fed regards as ideal. Indeed, it has seldom come closer. She also has presided over the gradual reduction of the Fed's stimulus campaign, which was implemented in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, as the economy struggled through a bruising recession with persistent unemployment that peaked at 10 percent in October 2009.
Ms. Yellen's calm and careful leadership style has won fans, both inside and outside of the Fed. John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that Ms. Yellen had been effective in building a consensus about the direction of policy among Fed officials, and in communicating policy to the markets and the public.
"When she came in there was a lot of concern about how would we unwind our policies and would that be disruptive and difficult, especially in the context of a global economy where other central banks were going in the other direction," he said. "Now it's almost like, 'That was easy!' But it wasn't. It took hard work."
Some of the other candidates, notably Mr. Taylor and Mr. Warsh, have argued the Fed should be raising interest rates more quickly. But financial regulation is the area in which a new chairman likely would make the largest changes. The Fed supervises the nation's largest banks and oversees the broader financial system.
Mr. Trump wants to loosen financial regulations, which he regards as an impediment to economic growth. Ms. Yellen, who played a key role implementing the new banking rules after the 2008 crisis, has acknowledged room for improvement. But in a high-profile speech in August, she also issued a warning against going too far.
The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has argued that installing a new Fed chairman would help Mr. Trump achieve his goal of reducing regulation.
Charles W. Calomiris, a finance professor at Columbia University, said that Ms. Yellen's approach to regulation was reason enough to replace her. "It's not just that regulation is excessively costly and complex," he said. "It's also failing to achieve its objectives."
But Ms. Yellen has faced relatively little public criticism. Mr. Trump criticized her on the campaign trail, but he has praised her since taking office.
House Republicans have been among Ms. Yellen's fiercest critics, regularly calling on her to increase interest rates and to reduce financial regulations.
Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter to Ms. Yellen in February demanding that the Fed stop crafting regulations until Mr. Trump appointed a new vice chairman for supervision.
Mr. Trump's choice, Randal K. Quarles, who was sworn in last week, will oversee the Fed's regulatory work, including its stress tests of large banks.
Mr. Hensarling also has criticized Ms. Yellen's approach to monetary policy. But he has not commented on whether Ms. Yellen should be nominated for a second term, and a spokeswoman did not respond to an email on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman for Senator Michael D. Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the Banking Committee, said he had not taken a position on Ms. Yellen's candidacy.
Even some of Ms. Yellen's critics favor her reappointment.
"She is an intelligent and levelheaded individual," said Deborah J. Lucas, an economics professor at M.I.T. who has criticized the Fed's bond purchases. "I trust her to make prudent decisions, particularly when it matters most, which is if there is another crisis. Continuity and experience seem especially valuable right now."
Presidents in recent decades have generally decided to reappoint Fed chairmen, even from the opposing political party, on the theory that stability would comfort markets. Ronald Reagan, the last Republican president to inherit a Fed chairman who was a Democrat, thought seriously about replacing Paul A. Volcker in 1983, but ultimately decided to nominate Mr. Volcker to a second term. "The financial market seems set on having him," Reagan wrote in his diary. "I don't want to shake their confidence in recovery."
President Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan in 1996 and in 2000 and President George W. Bush nominated Mr. Greenspan to a fifth term in 2004, before tapping Ben S. Bernanke to begin in 2006.
President Obama nominated Mr. Bernanke for a second term in 2010. When Mr. Bernanke stepped down in 2014, Mr. Obama named Ms. Yellen.
The last Fed chairman who did not serve a second term was G. William Miller, who is widely regarded as the least effective leader in the Fed's modern history. Mr. Miller was also the last person without an economics degree to run the central bank. He was nominated by President Carter in 1978. Both unemployment and inflation were high and rising, and he was replaced after just 17 months by Mr. Volcker.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said on Sunday that the American economy was in good health in an upbeat assessment that reinforced expectations the Fed is planning to raise its benchmark interest rate later this year. Job growth is strong, companies are increasing investment, and the United States is benefiting from the improved health of the global economy, Ms. Yellen said in remarks to the Group of 30, which hosts gatherings of international policy makers and private-sector bankers.
Referring to the Fed's benchmark rate, Ms. Yellen said, "We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective."
The Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate twice this year, in March and in June, to a range between 1 percent and 1.25 percent. Investors expect a third 0.25 percentage point increase at the Fed's final policy-making meeting of the year, in mid-December.
The Fed also announced in September that it would begin to reduce its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The Fed kept rates at a low level and bought the bonds to reduce borrowing costs, stimulating economic activity. It is pulling back from that stimulus campaign because officials think the economy can stand on its own.
Ms. Yellen said the prospect of tax cuts or other changes in domestic fiscal policy has not influenced the Fed's monetary policy plans at this point. "We're uncertain about the size, timing and composition of changes that will actually be put into effect," she said.
She said anticipation of changes like tax cuts has buoyed measures of consumer and business confidence, but there is little evidence so far of increased investment. She said the Fed similarly is taking "a kind of wait-and-see attitude."
Ms. Yellen's term as Fed chairwoman ends in early February. President Trump has said he is considering whether to appoint her to a second four-year term.
The American economy added an average of 171,000 jobs per month during the first eight months of the year, a little lower than the monthly average of 187,000 in 2016, but well above the growth of the working-age population.
Reported employment shrank in September for the first time in seven years, but that is most likely the result of Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida while the government was conducting its monthly survey.
Ms. Yellen said the damage from recent storms, while "terrible," was unlikely to leave a lasting imprint on the economy.
"History suggests that the longer-term effects will be modest and that aggregate economic activity will recover quickly," she said.
Other vital signs also are looking strong. The unemployment rate stands at 4.2 percent, and labor force participation has stabilized. While wage growth remains weak by historical standards, Ms. Yellen said, that was mostly the result of slow growth in productivity.
"The pace seems broadly consistent with a tightening labor market once we account for the disappointing productivity growth in recent years," she said.
Ms. Yellen also noted that domestic business investment has improved and stronger growth in other countries has increased demand for American exports.
"I perceive that risks to global growth have receded somewhat and expect growth to continue to improve over the near term," she said.
The most obvious cause for concern is the weakness of inflation, which has remained below the Fed's 2 percent annual target since the financial crisis. Other developed nations are grappling with the same phenomenon.
"The apparent disconnect between strong economic activity, on the one hand, and low inflation and wages on the other, is one of the standout characteristics of the ongoing recovery, almost everywhere," said Vitor Constancio, vice president of the European Central Bank, who spoke on the same panel as Ms. Yellen.
Some Fed officials regard weak inflation as evidence the Fed should retreat more slowly from its stimulus campaign.
Ms. Yellen reiterated on Sunday that she did not agree, because she regarded inflation as likely to increase as growth continued.
"My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist," she said.
She added that she saw little evidence soft inflation in the United States is the result of a change in the global economy.
