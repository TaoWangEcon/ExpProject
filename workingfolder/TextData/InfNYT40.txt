Full text: LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government received a sharp political jolt on Tuesday with the release of official figures showing that Britain's economy contracted slightly in the last three months of 2010, prompting some economists to warn that the country was at increased risk of a "double dip" recession after four consecutive quarters of modest growth.
While the economic figures are subject to revision, the 0.5 percent shrinkage fell well short of the 0.5 percent growth many economists had predicted. And the wider message seemed clear: The slowdown placed the Cameron government's $128 billion, four-year program of spending cuts and tax increases -- policies on which it has staked its survival -- at sharply heightened political risk.
The net effect of the new figures was to blunt the government's momentum and to recast -- at least until economic growth resumes -- the role Britain has played in the global debate about the best way back to prosperity.
Under Mr. Cameron, Britain has led the way in embracing fiscal retrenchment, while President Obama's administration has warned Britain and other European countries that they are at risk of tipping their economies, and possibly the Western world's, back into recession by cutting deficits too soon and too steeply.
Spokesmen for the opposition Labour Party and trade union officials leapt on the new figures, saying they showed that the government had lost its gamble that it could impose the harsh austerity measures and still keep the economy growing. "Now, we are seeing the first signs of what the Conservative-led government's decisions are having on the economy," said Ed Balls, the principal economic spokesman for Labour. It has urged easing the cutbacks, with some of its lawmakers suggesting that their full impact should be spread over a longer period, perhaps as much as 10 years.
The government responded by placing blame for the contraction on the economic disruptions caused by the severe snowstorms that hit Britain last month, the country's coldest December in 100 years. That message offered little cheer to the markets, especially since the Office for National Statistics, in announcing the figures for October to December, said the economic growth in the fourth quarter would have been flat even without the storms.
But George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said any retreat on the measures, the harshest adopted in any major Western economy, would endanger the "international credibility" the policies had earned Britain in global financial markets.
His stay-the-course approach did little to calm nerves in the markets. "This is a stunningly bad outcome," said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight in London. "Given that the contraction in G.D.P. in the fourth quarter occurred even before the fiscal tightening had really kicked in, it reinforces already serious concern over the economy's ability to grow significantly in the face of the spending cuts and tax hikes."
The immediate impact of the new figures was a fall in the pound's value against all major currencies including the dollar, and a retreat in Britain's leading share index.
While adamant about the spending cuts, Mr. Osborne pledged that spending plans in his budget next month would include measures to stir growth in the private sector. The government has said it is relying on private enterprise to carry Britain back to prosperity as the austerity measures reduce the jobs and spending power of the state, which accounts for about half of all economic activity in Britain.
It is that formula that has stirred allegations from the political left in Britain that Mr. Cameron and Mr. Osborne are embarked on an ideological crusade, using Britain's indebtedness, the worst in Europe, as an excuse to roll back the power of the state.
The government's rebuttals were not helped this week when a spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry accused the government of being driven as much by political objectives as by economic ones. Richard Lambert, the group's director general, said Mr. Cameron's administration had "been careless of the damage they might do to business and to job creation" with the cuts, and added, "It is not enough just to slam on the spending brakes."
At home, the Cameron government was already facing a tough year politically before the latest economic figures. After boasting that the modest growth in the British economy that began in the last six months of the previous Labour government had continued and strengthened after the shift of power in the May election, it entered 2011 facing a much tougher test.
The harshest of its new tax increases, in which Britain's valued-added tax rose to 20 percent from 17.5 percent, took effect with the new year. This will also be the first year in which an across-the-board reduction of 20 percent in the budgets of most government departments begins to bite. And recent figures showed a sharp rise in inflation, to 3.7 percent, nearly double the official target and enough to prompt some economists to warn that Britain risks entering a prolonged period of "stagflation" -- little or no growth, accompanied by sharply rising prices.
As long as the governing coalition holds together -- another uncertainty, given the deep unhappiness at the depth of the spending cuts among many Liberal Democrats, who are junior partners to Mr. Cameron's Conservatives in the coalition -- the government will hope to weather its sinking popularity and emerge in time for the next election, expected in 2015, vindicated by a new era of prosperity.
Recent polls, taken before the latest economic figures, have showed that Labour, after a bad beating in May, has surged ahead of the Conservatives by a narrow margin, with the Liberal Democrats a distant third.
Much may depend on what happens this spring and summer in the streets of London and other major cities. The government has already faced student protests in London, some of them turning violent, and union leaders have said they plan to turn up the pressure with "coordinated strikes," including transit shutdowns, that could produce Britain's widest labor unrest since the heyday of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.

Abstract: [...] the slowing increase in the number of new college graduates in the 1980s and '90s helped contribute to the slow economic growth of the last decade. (An additional $32 billion goes to Pell grants, scholarships for low- and middle-income families, which do appear to lift graduation rates by helping students stay enrolled.) Most of the $12 billion subsidizes student loans so that interest doesn't accrue while students are still in college.

Full text: Washington
President Obama wants to be sure that the United States keeps making the investments that help the economy grow. Congressional Republicans want the government to stop wasting so much money.
Education -- particularly higher education -- offers a great opportunity for a compromise that would let both sides claim victory and, even more important, help the economy.
Why? Education is the single best investment a society can make. High school became universal in the United States in the early 20th century, when other countries viewed universal schooling as wasteful, which goes a long way toward explaining our economy's 20th-century success. Likewise, the slowing increase in the number of new college graduates in the 1980s and '90s helped contribute to the slow economic growth of the last decade. So protecting higher education from across-the-board budget cuts, as Mr. Obama is urging, makes sense.
But the status quo is not worth protecting. Both the federal government and the states spend money on higher education in terribly wasteful ways. They don't offer incentives for success, and they demand little accountability from colleges. Colleges that do a masterful job of graduating students receive no reward, and those that do a subpar job -- of which there are many -- go unpunished, giving them little reason to improve.
"Colleges are very much like high schools," as Arne Duncan, the education secretary, says. "Some do a phenomenal job in building college-completion cultures and helping first-generation, low-income and minority students graduate, and some do a horrendous job." When I asked Mr. Duncan last year whether the Obama administration would consider changing federal financial aid to encourage success, he said, "Yes, stay tuned."
It has not happened yet, though, which makes it a good opportunity for the White House and Congress to work together now.
The basic problem is that colleges receive government money based largely on how many students they enroll. Perversely, colleges can even help their budgets by having a lot of dropouts. A college with a high dropout rate will have many more freshmen and sophomores than upperclassmen, and freshmen and sophomores are cheaper to have on campus, because they take big lecture classes.
Without any financial incentive to turn students into graduates, most colleges have paid far too little attention to their graduation rates. Nationwide, only about half of teenagers who enroll in college end up graduating.
The economic consequences have been severe. You often hear that income has stagnated in recent years, but it hasn't stagnated for four-year college graduates. They have received a 19 percent raise since 1979, on top of inflation. People who went to college without getting a four-year degree -- a combination of dropouts and two-year graduates -- suffered a 7 percent pay cut.
Fortunately, a few states have started to respond. Most intriguingly, West Virginia's biggest merit scholarship requires students to remain on track to graduate in four years. The policy has lifted the four-year graduation rate of recipients by almost 7 percentage points, according to research by Judith Scott-Clayton of Columbia University.
Indiana, meanwhile, has tweaked its formula for financing public colleges, to give more money to those with higher graduation rates. The formula also takes into account students' economic backgrounds, in an effort to recognize that some colleges have an inherently tougher job turning freshmen into graduates. But even in Indiana, the amount of public money that depends on results is small, less than 10 percent of the total. And virtually no federal funding is tied to results.
In the federal budget, the obvious candidates for cutbacks come from a grab bag of programs that cost about $12 billion a year and make up about one-fourth of federal spending on colleges. (An additional $32 billion goes to Pell grants, scholarships for low- and middle-income families, which do appear to lift graduation rates by helping students stay enrolled.)
Most of the $12 billion subsidizes student loans so that interest doesn't accrue while students are still in college. That may be a nice little benefit, but it does not help students stay in school. For one thing, it is too complicated to persuade people worried about tuition costs to enroll in college anyway. Even without the subsidy, their loan repayment would not begin until later; the subsidy merely reduces future payments.
The remainder of the $12 billion is no better. Many of these dollars are matching funds for financial aid awarded by colleges, which means much of the money ends up going to wealthy private colleges. Sandy Baum, a George Washington University economist who led a recent financial aid commission, calls the allocation of this money "inequitable and inefficient."
It isn't hard to think of more productive ways to use the $12 billion. Some of it could pay for promising state programs like West Virginia's or Indiana's. Other money could turn into additional aid for Pell recipients who remain on track to graduate in four years. Yet other money could reward colleges that succeed in graduating large numbers of low-income students -- an idea the White House is considering, officials say.
The fairest objection to policies focused on graduation rates is that they could cause some colleges to graduate undeserving students. And it's true -- they could. But such cases would probably be the rare exception.
Kevin Carey of Education Sector, a Washington research group, points out that most dropouts today are not students unable to keep up with college work. Instead, they generally attend colleges that, research shows, are neither very rigorous nor very engaged in students' lives. Many of these colleges devote little energy to thinking about -- let alone improving -- their graduation rate. Changing the funding rules could help change that mind-set.
The historical returns to education have been so high that I would rather see Washington both increase higher education spending and make it less wasteful. If anything, the federal government's role is more important now, when many states are cutting education spending.
But even if Congress won't increase spending, it can still do a lot to improve spending. The same is true of states, which together spend much more on colleges than Washington. A dollar that's well spent on education today will more than pay for itself tomorrow, through faster economic growth. For that reason, a tougher approach to college funding is actually a form of deficit reduction as well.

Abstract: The Case-Shiller Index is a three-month average of prices, so shifts in the market take a long time to play out. "The enormous supply overhang of existing homes -- particularly factoring in all those in foreclosure or soon to be -- promises to keep pressure on prices for some time," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist of MFR Inc. Mitch Kaminer, the president-elect of the Atlanta Board of Realtors, said the November Case-Shiller numbers were ancient history.

Full text: A new slide in housing prices has begun in earnest, with averages in major cities across the country falling to their lowest point in many years.
Prices in 20 major metropolitan areas slid 1 percent in November from October, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index released Tuesday. The index has fallen 1.6 percent from a year ago.
Nine of the 20 cities in the index sank in November to new lows for this economic cycle: Chicago; Las Vegas; Detroit; Atlanta; Seattle; Charlotte, N.C.; Miami; Tampa; Fla.; and Portland, Ore. Only a handful of places -- essentially, California and the District of Columbia -- went counter to the trend and had rising prices over the last year.
Whether the long-predicted double dip is looming or has already arrived is a quibble of semantics.
David M. Blitzer, chairman of S.& P.'s Index Committee, does not count a downturn as a double dip until it exceeds the previous low. The index is still 3.3 percent above the low it reached in April 2009. Mr. Blitzer thinks a double dip could be confirmed before spring.
"We shouldn't kid ourselves," he said. "The last few months have been weak."
Cities that were never mainstays of the boom are suffering unduly in this latest bust. Atlanta, Chicago and Portland have dropped more than 7 percent over the last year, with much of the tumble in October and November.
By this point, the problems in the housing market are well known. Builders built too much, lenders lent too much, and people bought too much. The binge was epic and so is the hangover.
The era during the middle of the last decade when many people thought houses were a great investment is long gone. A house in Atlanta is worth almost exactly the same as it was 11 years ago, the Case-Shiller data shows. And that is before adjusting for inflation.
Cities like Minneapolis and Charlotte did not do much better. "I don't know if that's a disaster, but it's certainly a disappointment," Mr. Blitzer said.
The Case-Shiller Index is a three-month average of prices, so shifts in the market take a long time to play out. The market has been experiencing what S.&. P. called "an unambiguous deceleration" since last May. That, not coincidentally, was when the government's special tax credit for buyers was ending.
The tax credit particularly strengthened sales of cheaper houses, and now its absence is speeding their fall. In Atlanta, for instance, prices for lower-priced homes fell 32 percent over the last year, the Case-Shiller data shows.
"It's a direct reversal from the way things were during the credit," said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.
There are few calls to bring back the tax credit, even among the Realtors who championed it when it was first proposed and then when it was extended. Nor are other forms of stimulus or stabilization being widely proposed.
"There seems zero interest in doing anything along these lines," said the economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "My view is that we should just let the market adjust and try to help out the homeowners who are hurt most by this."
Mr. Baker has proposed letting foreclosed owners stay in their homes as renters. The idea has gained little traction.
One hopeful sign for real estate is that on both a seasonally adjusted and an unadjusted basis, the Case-Shiller declines measured in November were less than in October. The 20 cities fell 0.5 percent on seasonally adjusted basis in November after a 1 percent drop in October.
Nevertheless, analysts said the declines would continue, even if not as sharply as in 2007 and 2008. "The enormous supply overhang of existing homes -- particularly factoring in all those in foreclosure or soon to be -- promises to keep pressure on prices for some time," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist of MFR Inc.
Mitch Kaminer, the president-elect of the Atlanta Board of Realtors, said the November Case-Shiller numbers were ancient history. "Atlanta's a strong market," he said. "I'm expecting the January numbers to be much better. I can't say it often enough: this is a great time to buy."
Mr. Kaminer was speaking after he had just finished showing a house in Dunwoody, Ga., to a Chicago transplant. The agent ticked off its selling points: four bedrooms, three-and-a-half baths, a close-in location. The asking price of $439,000 was a sharp discount to the $525,000 it might have fetched a few years ago.
But the potential buyer did not go for it. "Just like every other buyer out there, he wants to make sure he's getting a great deal," Mr. Kaminer said.
In others words, today might be a great time to buy, but tomorrow might be even better. It is a conviction the housing market cannot seem to shake.

Profit Edges Up at McDonald's, and Its Prices Will, Too

Full text: The McDonald's Corporationposted a 2.1 percent increase in fourth quarter profit on Monday and said it would raise prices this year to cover rising commodity costs.
McDonald's said it earned $1.24 billion, or $1.16 a share, in the quarter, up from $1.22 billion, or $1.11 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue, including sales from company-owned restaurants and royalties from franchisees and other fees, rose 4 percent, to $6.21 billion from $6.0 billion.
McDonald's said it expected its costs to rise 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year in the United States and 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in Europe.
The chief financial officer, Peter J. Bensen, said McDonald's would "raise prices where it makes sense" to offset some, but not all, of the cost increases. McDonald's did not give a commodity forecast for Asia and its other markets.
Diners around the world remain cautious with their spending on food away from home, and McDonald's will be careful not to turn customers off with higher prices, Mr. Bensen said.
McDonald's raised prices last year in China to offset an increase in commodity costs there. It also increased prices in Britain to cover a Jan. 1 value-added tax increase.
Analysts expect McDonald's to make smaller increases than many rivals because it uses its size to its advantage.
"They're large enough to put some pressure on their suppliers and they also will, through direct price increases or perhaps changing portion sizes, try to pass some of it on to consumers," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer with OakBrook Investments.
McDonald's historically has been a strong performer in times of inflation. John Ivankoe, a J. P. Morgan analyst, said in a client note that McDonald's was "the most insensitive to commodities" from an earnings-per-share perspective.
Renovated stores, expanded value menus and new food items like lattes and smoothies appealed to diners and helped it increase its market share last quarter.
McDonald's said global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.7 percent overall in December. They gained 2.6 percent in the United States, slid 0.5 percent in Europe and rose 8.9 percent for the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa.
For January, the company expects global same-restaurant sales to increase 4 percent to 5 percent.

Odd Allies Join to Fight Cuomo Plan For Tax Cap

Full text: Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has vowed to rein in New York's taxes, declaring them a burden to residents and businesses, and proposing help in the form of a state-imposed cap on property taxes.
But many among the very constituencies he has been aiming to satisfy, homeowners and tax protest organizations, say they are deeply dissatisfied with his proposal.
And in recent weeks many have joined educators, school district officials and unions in mobilizing against the tax cap, trying to cut off the proposal even before the governor has officially submitted it.
These opponents are arguing that a tax cap would not lower anyone's tax bill, and could instead end up costing people more in fees for programs and services as schools and municipalities seek other ways to cover costs.
Many said they would prefer having property tax bills based partly on the income of the property owner, rather than just on the fluctuating real estate market.
"Most property tax reform groups that have been studying the issue for a long time understand that a tax cap is smoke and mirrors," said Susan Zimet, 56, an Ulster County legislator and a former New Paltz town supervisor. "It's making people believe their taxes will go down. It's setting them up to be incredibly disappointed when they get their tax bill."
The governor's proposal would cap the growth of the overall property tax levy at 2 percent a year or the rate of inflation, whichever was less. A poll conducted this month by Siena College found that 83 percent of New York State voters supported a 2 percent tax cap.
Nevertheless, New York has dozens of citizens groups, from Long Island to the Canadian border, with many claiming to represent hundreds, if not thousands, of like-minded taxpayers. By most accounts, some of these groups started banding together a few years ago when property taxes were rising steeply, and they have now stepped up their efforts with Governor Cuomo's push for a tax cap.
In recent weeks, groups have been trying to galvanize opposition to the proposal. In December, for example, representatives from the groups held a news conference in Albany and met with the editorial board of The Times-Union of Albany. They have appeared on radio shows in the Albany area and are blogging on taxnightmare.org.
In January they attended Mr. Cuomo's State of the State address to lobby legislators. They have also sent e-mails to the office of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, asking him to reject a tax cap, and plan to bombard Mr. Cuomo's office with mail.
The state's powerful teachers union, New York State United Teachers, has also opposed the tax cap, saying it could devastate local schools, especially as mandated costs can rise by more than 2 percent annually.
But union officials said last week that they were not providing money or working closely with the taxpayer groups -- some of which would be happy to see school budgets restrained.
Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement that "property taxes are suffocating New Yorkers" and that "passing a property tax cap is the best way to deliver relief and Governor Cuomo will move swiftly to see that one is passed."
Indeed, the governor has the support of many business and community leaders, who have formed their own group, the Committee to Save New York, to promote the tax cap, along with other fiscal measures.
The group is spending at least $10 million in television and radio ads, direct mailings, and other communications.
The Business Council of New York State has also broadcast radio commercials in the Albany area.
"A property tax cap is crucial to take the pressure off homeowners and businesses in those areas of the state that have seen taxes constantly rising and jobs and people constantly leaving," said William T. Cunningham, a spokesman for the Committee to Save New York.
While other states have adopted tax caps, experts in fiscal policy are divided over their effectiveness.
Supporters contend that tax caps, while they do not actually cut taxes, nevertheless slow the rate of increase and make them more affordable.
Opponents say tax caps fail to reduce the tax burden on middle-class families, who are already overburdened.
An analysis of census data by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a nonprofit research group in Albany, showed that in 2008 an estimated one in five New York households with incomes of $250,000 or less paid more than 10 percent of their income in property taxes; among households with incomes of $100,000 or under, that rose to more than one in four.
"The problem with the property tax is that there is no limit to how much you can pay," said Robert McKeon, 47, a cattle farmer and co-founder of the Tax Reform Effort of Northern Dutchess. He pays $10,000 a year in property taxes, more than 10 percent of his income, Mr. McKeon said.
Many tax protest groups have instead lobbied for a "circuit breaker" program, which would provide a tax credit for people based on their income and ability to pay.
In the long term, they say, they want the state to take over direct financing of schools and Medicaid, easing the pressure to increase property taxes.
But these proposals would require significant state funds and face formidable hurdles, particularly during a state budget crisis.
In addition, the circuit breaker would benefit only homeowners, while businesses have also demanded tax relief.
A co-founder of taxnightmare.org, Gioia Shebar, 78, says the state's property tax system is fundamentally unfair because it is based on home values, which fluctuate with the real estate market and reassessments, without regard to a homeowner's income.
Ms. Shebar, a retired New York City teacher, said school taxes on her three-bedroom home in Gardiner, N.Y., had nearly tripled, to $9,592, since 1997. Some of her neighbors, unable to afford such increases, have been forced to move or sell part of their land, she said.
"It's like having a sewer that's really overflowing and putting a cap on it and saying 'It's fixed,' " Ms. Shebar said. "It's still going to stink to high heaven."
John Whiteley, a retired Foreign Service officer who helped found the New York State Property Tax Reform Coalition, said his group was trying to educate people about the tax cap.
"It's popular because somebody comes up to you and says, 'Hey, we're going to put a cap on your property taxes,' " Mr. Whiteley said.
"Who's going to say no? They don't bother to explain really what it is because it's a sound bite, it's not sound policy."

Full text: CHINESE tanks and missiles rolled past the reviewing stand in Tiananmen Square, where I sat as a member of the foreign press corps in early October 1984. It was the annual National Day parade, and a phalanx of soldiers marched smartly by. So far, nothing out of the ordinary.
Then came a group of apple-cheeked students, waving and brandishing a sign with enormous Chinese characters: "Hello, Xiaoping," it said, in a startlingly warm and casual salute to Deng Xiaoping, then China's paramount leader. Years before the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in that very square, Deng was being celebrated for his advocacy of a new path of market reform, openness to the outside world and, eventually, prosperity. It was an unorthodox approach, exemplified by the bold, decidedly un-Maoist slogan, "Let some people get rich first."
After following Deng's economic path for decades, China has been watching its prosperity rise. And foreign politicians, corporate executives and investors have taken notice. Last week, in meetings with political and business leaders during his American visit, Hu Jintao, China's current president, was treated with the respect due a man who represents the second-largest economy on the planet.
In a joint news conference in Washington, for example, President Obama chided him about human rights issues, but did so gently, moving rapidly to a much happier subject: business. "We want to sell you all kinds of stuff," Mr. Obama said to Mr. Hu. "We want to sell you planes. We want to sell you cars. We want to sell you software."
And Mr. Hu indicated that he was happy to oblige.
In Washington and in Chicago, the Chinese president and his entourage announced a series of deals that, American officials said, amounted to $45 billion worth of American exports to China. Included in that total was $19 billion for 200 Boeing airplanes, plus railway and energy contracts for General Electric, and a joint venture between Honeywell and Haier, the giant Chinese appliance maker.
America's current $100 billion in annual exports to China "supports more than half a million American jobs," Mr. Obama said, noting that those exports are growing at nearly double the rate of exports to the rest of the world.
Mr. Hu did not go to New York, but his American visit was duly noted on Wall Street and its environs. At Goldman Sachs's headquarters on West Street on Thursday, Jim O'Neill, the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said he believed that the world's economic growth rate was rising sharply.
"At the core of all of this is the behemoth known as China," he said, adding that it must be part of every intelligent investor's long-term strategy.
Mr. O'Neill is perhaps best known as the economist who nearly a decade ago coined the acronym BRIC -- for Brazil, Russia, India and China -- developing economies that, he said, were big enough and growing rapidly enough that no investor could afford to neglect them. The giant in that group is still China, he said, whose transformation has been so thorough that "most people, and not just investors, don't realize the sheer dimension of its rapidly growing importance in the world economy."
Given its current size and growth rate -- a sizzling 10.2 percent in 2010 -- China's economy is likely to add roughly $1 trillion in G.D.P. in 2011, he said. To put that into perspective, he said it is "sort of like creating half of a United Kingdom." Over the last decade, he said, China's economy "has created three United Kingdoms, and that's really extraordinary."
What's more, China still has a long way to go. In one 2009 World Bank ranking of per capita income, China fit snugly between Tunisia and Turkmenistan. In some respects, it remains at a relatively early stage of economic development.
Many unresolved issues plague the Sino-American relationship, of course -- including disputes over human rights, intellectual property rights, access to domestic markets, the proper valuation of the renminbi, an imbalance in trade and capital flows, and a host of geopolitical problems. The economic flashpoints alone could easily flare into open conflict.
The United States Business and Industry Council, for example, which represents family-owned domestic manufacturing businesses, argues that President Obama should stop negotiating with China and start imposing taxes and tariffs. "We need to contain China's economic strength and to reduce China's military strength," said Alan Tonelson, research fellow at the council.
Mr. O'Neill, by contrast, points to the rich earnings that multinational companies like I.B.M. are garnering from sharply rising exports to China. "The notion that China grows at everybody else's expense is at least three years out of date," he said. China's rapid growth, he said, gives the United States economic recovery a very good chance of being more robust than expected over the next few years.
FOR investors, the short-term implications of the China growth story are not entirely straightforward. The Chinese stock market has had a bumpy year, and it may continue to be buffeted by the Chinese central bank's tighter monetary policy, which is aimed at reining in inflation. It's quite possible that the stock market in a slower-growing economy like Japan's will be more profitable for investors over the next year, according to a recent analysis by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
In any case, Mr. O'Neill said, investors can benefit from China's growth in multiple ways, by assessing valuations of specific stocks and assets, for example, and perhaps by betting on multinationals with significant China exposure. For a while to come, he said, the economic tide in China will rise, and investors should take note: some will be getting rich first.

Full text: To the Editor:
In "What Obama Should Say About the Deficit" (Economic View, Jan. 16), Christina D. Romer does not address the single greatest challenge to dealing with our accumulating deficits: the decline in American economic competitiveness and, thus, the increasing probability that the United States will not return to its historical growth path anytime soon.
There is barely a hint that anyone in Washington appreciates both how severe and dangerous this decline has become, or that it will take fully a generation to address it in a significant way. The simple reality is that restoration of American economic vitality must be at the very center of any strategy to address our fiscal challenges.

To the Editor:
Christina D. Romer hits home with her thoughts about curtailing the deficit, and the need to make sacrifices in order to do so. But I disagree with her belief in a gradual increase in the gasoline tax as one of the measures.
Although she notes that it should not be immediate, such an increase could lead to higher inflation and have an adverse affect on America's middle class. Gavin Burt

Full text: After months of rancor, China is suddenly talking up cooperation on North Korea, the economy, and other difficult issues. There are several possible explanations for the change in tone -- and, we hope -- substance.
Beijing's bullying has alienated pretty much everyone out there, and China's leaders may have finally figured that out. The Obama administration's recent tough talk, coupled with President Obama's pomp-filled welcome this week of President Hu Jintao, were also clear reminders of the cost of alienating the United States and the benefits of getting along.
Mr. Hu appeared eager to make his American hosts happy, pledging to work to resolve differences over market access and the protection of intellectual property. He also came bearing gifts. The White House announced $45 billion worth of American export deals to China, which it said would support 235,000 jobs. Many of these deals had been reached as far back as three years ago, but Mr. Hu and Mr. Obama were eager to claim credit.
It is too early to know how far China is really prepared to go, but Mr. Hu made several potentially significant concessions. He said the country would now audit government agencies' software purchases and publish their results in an attempt to end their widespread use of pirated software. And he signaled that his government is willing to temper the most controversial aspects of its "indigenous innovation" plan to favor domestic companies in government procurement deals.
The plan, as initially conceived, only allowed Chinese state entities to buy certain technology products if their patents were developed and registered in China, excluding foreign suppliers. According to the White House, China dropped the registration requirement and agreed government procurement would not be based "on where the goods' or services' intellectual property is developed or maintained," and that "there will be no discrimination against innovative products made by foreign suppliers operating in China."
If these policies change, it could defuse some of the biggest sources of tension in the growing economic relations between China and the United States.
There's even a modicum of good news on China's artificially cheap currency, the renminbi. Beijing has made a lot of promises, but is still refusing to let the renminbi rise by much. But higher Chinese inflation means that -- in real terms -- it is appreciating at a rate of about 10 percent a year, which is helping American exports.
President Hu was also more accommodating than usual on North Korea and publicly acknowledged that "a lot still needs to be done in China in terms of human rights." On both those issues, we'll take verify over trust. Mr. Hu could start by releasing Liu Xiaobo, the pro-democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner.
At Washington's urging, China finally expressed concern over North Korea's recently unveiled uranium enrichment plant. It still has not denounced North Korea's torpedoing of a South Korean warship. As the North's main supplier of fuel and food, China may be the only country that can rein in Pyongyang. American officials said that, in private talks, Mr. Hu agreed to try -- but only after Mr. Obama warned that the United States may have to redeploy its military forces in Asia to protect itself from the North's belligerence.
It is far too early to assume that the Chinese government has decided to turn a new strategic leaf. But it is clearly taking a second look at things. Regular contact is essential. Cajoling and flattery may also help. The lesson of the last few months is that they need to be backed up with regular, firm pushes in the right direction.

Full text: Petrobras, Brazil's energy giant, will pay bond investors about a percentage point more in yield than the government that controls it. With sovereign bond yields so low and Brazilian inflation flaring up, bond buyers interested in the South American country could be better off lending to its oil-backed corporate proxy.
The 10-year portion of Petrobras's $6 billion deal was priced Thursday evening at a yield of around 5.4 percent. That's compared with the yield on 10-year United States Treasuries of just under 3.5 percent. Despite being rated nine notches below top-rated United States government debt, Brazil's dollar-denominated government debt only earns about one percentage point more than Treasuries -- which are still among the safest and lowest yielding investments in the world.
Moreover, Brazil has an inflation problem. The latest reading of annual inflation, at 5.9 percent, showed consumer price increases at a six-year high. The central bank raised interest rates by a hefty half-percentage point on Wednesday to 11.25 percent, and more increases look to be on the way. That could weigh heavily on the value of government bonds, even those denominated in dollars, especially if investors lose confidence in Brazil's ability to fight inflation.
Petrobras carries its own risks: the price of oil could tumble, or it could suffer its own BP-like oil spill disaster. But if its $224 billion investment plans pan out, bondholders could be rewarded. Petrobras has its sights set on surpassing Exxon Mobil, one of four triple-A-rated companies left standing, by 2017 as the largest publicly traded producer of oil. As a majority stakeholder in Petrobras and with its future revenue riding on the company, the Brazilian government is sure to prioritize its energy champion's success.
It also doesn't hurt to have a bit of oil exposure, to capitalize on global economic growth, hedge against inflation, and reduce the impact of any investment exodus from emerging markets. Strong demand for the Petrobras bond offering, the largest from an emerging market issuer over the past year, suggests some investors may be thinking the same thing.

A Strict Approach
The visit of President Hu Jintao of China to Washington has started a debate about whether the United States should copy his country's hands-on economic model. But China's feisty "tiger mothers" may be a better guide. A new book extolling their tough-love approach to parenting could help America escape its debt trap and increase growth.
The United States is in a funk over the fear of decline and a still-wobbly economy. The financial crisis and subsequent government bailouts prompted some American policy makers to wonder if their steadfast belief in minimal state intervention had run its course. To make matters worse, while America plunged into its worst downturn since the Great Depression, China kept growing and adding to its huge dollar hoard.
But the solutions to America's long-term economic woes won't be found by imitating the mercantilist industrial policy coming out of Beijing. That's how poor countries play catch-up, not how rich countries lead and innovate. Even China understands that at some point it will need to export less, consume more and loosen its financial system to more efficiently allocate capital.
So rather than turn to Mr. Hu for answers, ask the author Amy Chua. In her book "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother," Ms. Chua begins with the premise that American parents have too lax a parenting style. The child of ethnic Chinese immigrants, she says Western parents are too quick to praise mediocrity and too reluctant to enforce sacrifice for better academics. In short, Americans are not preparing their children as well as the Chinese are to compete and succeed as adults.
Whether the thesis is true or not, Ms. Chua's critique still inadvertently manages to capture the essence of what's wrong with American economic policy. Too much spending and consumption today, too little savings for investment tomorrow -- and a dysfunctional education system and a tax code that rewards lobbying over productivity.
Americans need to demand more of themselves and of government, even if that means enduring some unpleasant sacrifice. Chinese mothers, according to Ms. Chua, have high expectations for their children because nothing helps confidence like achieving what didn't seem possible. That spirit would serve the United States well about now.

Full text: Paul A. Volcker is a giant of financial history. He played a behind-the-scenes role when the United States abandoned the gold standard in 1971. He restored credibility to the Federal Reserve and slew inflation a decade later.
In what would have been retirement years for anyone else, he became chairman of the group overseeing the International Accounting Standards Board and guided it to a level of independence that outraged French banks.
Now, at 83, he finally has something named for him. The question is whether it can be effective.
The Volcker Rule was part of the Dodd-Frank Act that Congress passed last year, barring banks from engaging in "proprietary trading."
When Mr. Volcker proposed it, the big banks at first wanted to kill it. But it became clear that the combination of his prestige and the bank's own bad reputations meant that something was going to pass.
So the banks settled for trying to hobble the rule with exceptions and qualifications.
Now it is up to regulators to adopt rules.
This week the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which was also created by Dodd-Frank and is led by the Treasury secretary and includes other financial regulators, put out a study and recommendations on the issue, providing at least a road map toward the rules that will come out within a few months.
The hurdle they face is simple: there is no easy way to tell a proprietary trade from another kind of trade, particularly given the exemptions worked into the law.
As the study noted on its first page, "These permitted activities -- in particular, market making, hedging, underwriting and other transactions on behalf of customers -- often evidence outwardly similar characteristics to proprietary trading."
To some extent, regulators have made it easier for banks to continue trading. The biggest potential loophole is market making, and the study took a broad view of that. It made clear that market makers may acquire securities because they expectcustomers to want them, not just because they already have orders.
That means, wrote Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with MF Global, that they "need not worry that miscalculating customer demand would result in large penalties." He added that "this seems even more positive than industry was expecting. The biggest banks would benefit the most from adoption of this type of proposal."
But that goody may be more than balanced by the overall tenor of the report, which repeatedly cautions that regulators must be on the outlook for efforts to evade the rules.
"I think it is a good-faith effort to enforce what the law asks for," Mr. Volcker told me this week, after reading the report. "It makes clear you cannot hide proprietary trading in other activities. It strikes me as very straightforward."
Straightforward may not be the word that some bankers will choose. They had hoped for clear rules that could be complied with -- or evaded, if you want to be cynical. Instead, they got a lot of advice for regulators on how to monitor bank trading to see if it complies, using statistics invented for other purposes, like risk measurement.
Do banks tend to make the most money from a trade on the first day, rather than over time? Does the inventory of securities turn over quickly? Are daily profits relatively consistent? Negative answers could indicate proprietary trading and provide a reason for bank examiners to descend on a trading desk.
I have another metric that they might consider. What are the traders paid? If a trader is collecting millions in salary and bonus, you have to wonder whether he or she is merely trying to satisfy customer demand, as opposed to time markets.
The use of all those metrics, along with requirements for banks to monitor them and have clear policies, sounds scary to some. Winthrop N. Brown, a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy who represents banks, said the council had done a good job in general, but "I would be troubled if I were a chief compliance officer. It seems to be very burdensome."
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002 accomplished something with a provision that I thought superfluous, and the council picks up on that by suggesting that chief executives be required to certify that their banks are in compliance with the Volcker Rule, just as the earlier law forces them to certify the accuracy of financial statements. It turned out that certification concentrates attention, even if it does not change the underlying legal requirements.
Some think the concentration on proprietary trading is a little ridiculous. It was not, after all, such trading that produced the financial crisis. That came from bad loans and botched securitizations of such loans. Nothing in the Volcker Rule affects lending, and the law specifically says it is not to be used to hamper securitizations.
When I put that to Mr. Volcker, he pointed both to the problems at Societe Generale, the French bank that lost billions of euros because of a rogue trader, and to Bear Stearns, the first casualty of the financial crisis. Bear's problems first emerged in a hedge fund it ran, which it bailed out in an effort to preserve its reputation. Eventually, a liquidity crisis brought the bank down.
The new law tries to limit that by restricting bank investments in hedge funds. They can start them, but within a year are supposed to have a stake of no more than 3 percent.
There would be a case for the Volcker Rule even if such trading had not caused problems in the past. Banks are special, simply because they have deposit insurance, and there are limits that need to be imposed on the risks that such government-guaranteed banks take.
Of course banks can take plenty of risks without engaging in proprietary trading. Bad loans have brought down many a bank. But bank lending is something that society wants to encourage. Other forms of speculation may be perfectly reasonable, and even highly profitable much of the time, but their societal benefit is far less clear. Those who wish to gamble in that way ought to do so without such insurance.
In the end, the Volcker Rule may work, even if there are ways around it. Is it really worth the effort to dodge rules to do things that would be perfectly legal if someone else did them? If the regulators do put in the effort, the answer may be that few banks will bother.
Mr. Volcker himself professes optimism.
"I may not understand modern financial attitudes," he said, "but I don't think a bank wants to be conducting financial activities that will be revealed as simply skirting the law."
That optimism is, however, based on the assumption that regulators will put in the effort. For now, that is probably a good assumption. But it is worth noting that regulators are being asked to do a lot without a commensurate increase in resources. That may not hurt the Fed, which sets its own budget, but the Securities and Exchange Commission is getting stretched very thin and the new Republican House leadership shows no interest in fixing that.
The S.E.C. this week put out a report on inspections of financial advisers, as required by Dodd-Frank. The staff concluded that the commission would not have the resources to do enough inspections, and asked Congress to either allow it to impose fees on advisers to pay for the inspections or assign the task to self-regulatory organizations, which could impose similar fees.
One commissioner, Elisse Walter, voted to release the study but argued that it did not go far enough.
"We need to address this issue now," she concluded. "For far too long, in the investment advisory area, the commission has been unable to perform its responsibilities adequately to fulfill its mission as the investor's advocate, and investment advisory clients have not been adequately protected. This must change."
Regulatory priorities come and go. For now the Volcker Rule seems important, but then we are only a couple of years removed from the Madoff scandal. Yet it seems unlikely Congress will provide the needed resources to assure there are adequate inspections of money managers.
It may not be that many years before some banker concludes the possible profits from speculative trading are attractive enough to justify trying to get around a rule whose enforcement no longer seems to be a priority.

Abstract: The proposal, from the Republican Study Committee, a conservative bloc that counts more than two-thirds of House Republicans as members, calls for immediate reductions of at least $100 billion, compared with cuts in the current fiscal year of up to $80 billion being sought by party leaders.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- House Republican leaders confronted pressure from conservatives on Thursday to take more aggressive steps to cut federal spending, with a large group of lawmakers calling for outlays to be slashed by $2.5 trillion over the next decade, far more than the party has sought so far.
The proposal, from the Republican Study Committee, a conservative bloc that counts more than two-thirds of House Republicans as members, calls for immediate reductions of at least $100 billion, compared with cuts in the current fiscal year of up to $80 billion being sought by party leaders.
"We want more," said Representative Mick Mulvaney, a freshman from South Carolina.
The $2.5 trillion in cuts would exclude the military, and would not touch the big entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security. As a result, its effect on the entire array of government programs, among them education, domestic security, transportation, law enforcement and medical research, would be nothing short of drastic.
Committee leaders said this was appropriate and necessary, given the government's $14 trillion debt and annual deficits at their highest levels since the years just after World War II.
The cuts would require the agreement of the Democratic-controlled Senate and the White House, which is highly unlikely.
The study committee proposed generally reducing agency budgets to their levels in 2006 -- the last time Congressional Republicans controlled the budget process -- and then freezing them, with no annual inflation adjustments. It also recommended slashing the federal workforce by 15 percent and canceling pay raises for five years, for a total of $2.29 trillion in savings.
It did not specify how each agency would carry out the reductions.
The study committee's proposal includes an additional $330 billion in cuts to specific programs, including Amtrak, foreign aid and even the Washington subway system.
The proposal, while not specifically endorsed by the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, or other leaders, offers the clearest picture yet of the cuts envisioned by Republicans as they seek to rein in spending, which they view as a mandate given to them by voters in November.
"I have never seen the American people more receptive, more ready for the tough-love measures that need to be taken to help fix the country," said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chairman of the study committee.
Some fiscal experts said the proposal was untenable, because it would cut much of the federal government nearly in half by 2020, including agencies like the Education Department. Some targets, like Amtrak, would potentially be put out of existence, they said.
The fight over federal spending levels is the highest priority for the new Republican majority other than repeal of the Democrats' health care overhaul.
And while party leaders said they welcomed all proposals for cuts, the pressure from the right -- including Tea Party-backed members and other new lawmakers elected on a platform of fiscal restraint -- threatened to complicate the battle with the Obama administration and to set unrealistic expectations among grass-roots conservatives eager to scale back government.
Even before the midterm elections, party leaders issued a "Pledge to America," promising, without providing details of which programs would be cut, to reduce nonsecurity discretionary spending to 2008 levels, a cut that Mr. Boehner had initially pegged at about $100 billion for this fiscal year.
But with a temporary spending measure in place until early March -- more than five months into the fiscal year -- Republican leaders, including the Budget Committee chairman, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have said that a more realistic goal would be cuts to 2008 levels prorated for the remainder of the fiscal year, or about $60 billion to $80 billion.
Conservative lawmakers, however, said that was not enough.
"Speaking with many of my freshmen colleagues, for us, myself included, the pledge, the $100 billion, was simply a start; it was simply a floor," Mr. Mulvaney, the South Carolina freshman, said at a news conference to unveil the study committee's proposal. He added: "Anybody who is up to speed on budget issues should be scared to death by what's happening with the debt and the deficit in this country. If you're not losing sleep over it, then you're simply not paying attention."
Some Republicans warned that the country was in danger.
"The greatest threat to the security and prosperity of the United States is our debt," said Representative John Campbell of California, a member of the study committee. "We are much closer to the Greece, Ireland, Spain precipice than I think any of us would like to believe."
A spokesman for Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel, said that Republican leaders were focused on fulfilling the pledge first. "Our immediate goal is to cut spending to pre-bailout, pre-stimulus levels," Mr. Steel said. "That's what we pledged, and that's what we'll fight for. But that will be the beginning, not the end."
Mr. Boehner was not alone in praising the study committee's efforts without backing its plan.
"I applaud the Republican Study Committee," the House majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, said in a statement. "I look forward to the discussion on reducing spending that our country so desperately needs."
Mr. Cantor said Republicans would also seek to end the system of financing presidential candidates and national party conventions with federal matching money. He said that the House would vote on the proposal next week and that it would save $520 million over 10 years if enacted.
The formal work on spending issues is scheduled to begin on the House floor next week when Republicans take up a resolution directing Mr. Ryan, the Budget Committee chairman, to set spending parameters at 2008 levels. The vote on that resolution is scheduled for Tuesday, just hours before Mr. Obama is due on Capitol Hill to give his State of the Union address and is intended to put Republicans squarely on offense in the spending fight.
Mr. Ryan has not put forward a specific plan for cuts. He is awaiting updated data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on current spending. He also did not endorse the study committee's plan.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who served with Mr. Ryan on Mr. Obama's commission on lowering the national debt, said in an interview that the study committee's plan was ill-conceived and unworkable because it focused only on cuts to discretionary spending and not on overhauling the tax code or addressing entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.
"The commission had about a trillion and a half of cuts, which I thought was at the edge of what could be done responsibly," Mr. Conrad said in an interview. "They obviously have chosen to go beyond the edge."

Full text: With Hu Jintao, China's president, currently visiting the United States, stories about growing Chinese economic might are everywhere. And those stories are entirely true: although China is still a poor country, it's growing fast, and given its sheer size it's well on the way to matching America as an economic superpower.
What's also true, however, is that China has stumbled into a monetary muddle that's getting worse with each passing month. Furthermore, the Chinese government's response to the problem -- with policy seemingly paralyzed by deference to special interests, lack of intellectual clarity and a resort to blame games -- belies any notion that China's leaders can be counted on to act decisively and effectively. In fact, the Chinese come off looking like, well, us.
How bad will it get? Warnings from some analysts that China could trigger a global crisis seem overblown. But the fact that people are saying such things is an indication of how out of control the situation looks right now.
The root cause of China's muddle is its weak-currency policy, which is feeding an artificially large trade surplus. As I've emphasized in the past, this policy hurts the rest of the world, increasing unemployment in many other countries, America included.
But a policy can be bad for us without being good for China. In fact, Chinese currency policy is a lose-lose proposition, simultaneously depressing employment here and producing an overheated, inflation-prone economy in China itself.
One way to think about what's happening is that inflation is the market's way of undoing currency manipulation. China has been using a weak currency to keep its wages and prices low in dollar terms; market forces have responded by pushing those wages and prices up, eroding that artificial competitive advantage. Some estimates I've heard suggest that at current rates of inflation, Chinese undervaluation could be gone in two or three years -- not soon enough, but sooner than many expected.
China's leaders are, however, trying to prevent this outcome, not just to protect exporters' interest, but because inflation is even more unpopular in China than it is elsewhere. One big reason is that China already in effect exploits its citizens through financial repression (other kinds, too, but that's not relevant here). Interest rates on bank deposits are limited to just 2.75 percent, which is below the official inflation rate -- and it's widely believed that China's true inflation rate is substantially higher than its government admits.
Rapidly rising prices, even if matched by wage increases, will make this exploitation much worse. It's no wonder that the Chinese public is angry about inflation, and that China's leaders want to stop it.
But for whatever reason -- the power of export interests, refusal to do anything that looks like giving in to U.S. demands or sheer inability to think clearly -- they're not willing to deal with the root cause and let their currency rise. Instead, they are trying to control inflation by raising interest rates and restricting credit.
This is destructive from a global point of view: with much of the world economy still depressed, the last thing we need is major players pursuing tight-money policies. More to the point from China's perspective, however, is that it's not working. Credit limits are proving hard to enforce and are being further undermined by inflows of hot money from abroad.
With efforts to cool the economy falling short, China has been trying to limit inflation with price controls -- a policy that rarely works. In particular, it's a policy that failed dismally the last time it was tried here, during the Nixon administration. (And, yes, this means that right now China is going to Nixon.)
So what's left? Well, China has turned to the blame game, accusing the Federal Reserve (wrongly) of creating the problem by printing too much money. But while blaming the Fed may make Chinese leaders feel better, it won't change U.S. monetary policy, nor will it do anything to tame China's inflation monster.
Could all of this really turn into a full-fledged crisis? If I didn't know my economic history, I'd find the idea implausible. After all, the solution to China's monetary muddle is both simple and obvious: just let the currency rise, already.
But I do know my economic history, which means that I know how often governments refuse, sometimes for many years, to do the obviously right thing -- and especially when currency values are concerned. Usually they try to keep their currencies artificially strong rather than artificially weak; but it can be a big mess either way.
So our newest economic superpower may indeed be on its way to some kind of economic crisis, with collateral damage to the world as a whole. Did we need this?

Full text: Grade inflation -- a term normally associated with students -- is widespread among Bay Area teachers, who receive so many favorable evaluations that it is impossible to tell how well they are performing, some educators say.
For the 2009-10 school year, just 40 out of 1,924 teachers -- or 2 percent -- reviewed by the San Francisco Unified School District received below-satisfactory performance reviews, district records show. Those figures are consistent with recent years: an average of 2.7 percent of teachers evaluated over the past five years received marks of "unsatisfactory" or "needs improvement," records show. And education scholars say that in a system where all teachers are winners, a crucial gauge of teacher quality is essentially lost.
A similar pattern has emerged in nearby school districts. In the San Jose and Oakland Unified School Districts, for example, about 1 percent of teachers received ratings of "ineffective" or "unsatisfactory," records for 2009-10 show.
Administrators emphasized that weaknesses in the evaluation system did not diminish the work of teachers who educate students under difficult conditions exacerbated by a state budget crisis that has increased class sizes and reduced financing for schools.
But the numbers reveal that the review process is effectively broken, parents and administrators said, at a time when the Obama administration is seeking to tie federal money for education to the use of teacher evaluations based on student performance. That policy is controversial, particularly among teachers, who say that a variety of factors -- some beyond their control -- should be taken into account.
"We have to create a better evaluation system that really names what high-quality instruction looks like," said Superintendent Anthony Smith of the Oakland district. He favors including student performance as a factor in evaluations.
Linda Shaffer, a parent of two children in San Francisco schools and a founder of Educate Our State, an advocacy group led by parents seeking more accountability, said, "The numbers tell me that there is a low bar to jump over, which doesn't tell me anything about the teachers in the classroom."
Some districts across the country -- including Oak Grove in south San Jose -- have begun to change how they evaluate teachers, incorporating student-achievement data to assess a teacher's performance.
But those districts are in the minority. Partly because of resistance from teachers unions, most districts do not factor student test scores into evaluations.
Educators said the wide-ranging and sometimes-vague standards weaken the evaluation process. "A majority of districts in the state and the nation currently have dysfunctional evaluation systems," said Eric A. Hanushek, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. "They neither help any teachers to get better nor point to teachers that should move out of teaching."
Until this school year, San Francisco lacked detailed criteria for evaluating teacher performance. Under a revamped system put into effect last fall, teachers will be evaluated according to how well they engage students, maintain decorum, grasp subject matter, plan lessons, help students progress and expand their teaching expertise. The evaluations do not hinge on student achievement.
Principals and assistant principals observe teachers in the classroom before drafting evaluations. Teachers are then ranked as "outstanding," "highly satisfactory," "satisfactory," "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory."
Most veteran teachers in San Francisco are evaluated every two years. Teachers who rank "satisfactory" or above on their most recent evaluation are eligible to receive a "short-form review" the next time. In it, principals have limited space to describe a teacher's strengths and challenges.
Superintendent Carlos A. Garcia of the San Francisco district said that in the past administrators might have been less demanding in their assessments because they had concluded that the system was ineffective. "People felt, What's the point in trying to be tough in evaluations?" Mr. Garcia said.
"We have to create a cultural shift for principals and assistant principals to be more honest with us," he said.
Mr. Garcia said he believed that the new benchmarks were likely to improve the process. He added that he "wouldn't be opposed" to test scores' being factored into staff evaluations.
San Francisco's 's new standards will, however, have to be recalibrated to meet federal expectations. In an effort to reward states that link student achievement to teacher performance, Mr. Obama and the Republicans will probably negotiate a compromise this year to overhaul evaluations, the federal education secretary, Arne Duncan, wrote on Jan. 3 in The Washington Post.
In San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland, teacher evaluations are not used to determine merit raises or advancement, union representatives from those districts said. But administrators said they were an important measure of the quality of teaching. Even more rigorous standards would help administrators take disciplinary action against teachers who consistently underperform, educators said.
California's education code, contractual obligations and the threat of expensive legal battles can sometimes prevent veteran teachers from being fired. No "tenured" teachers in San Francisco, those on the payroll for two years or more, have been fired in the last three years, records show. In contrast, teachers can be fired for any reason in their first two years. Of the 252 new teachers hired last year, 42, or 17 percent, were let go for various reasons, district records show.
Leaders of the San Francisco teachers' union say their evaluation system should be left alone. "I don't think using student achievement as part of teacher evaluations is effective," said Dennis Kelly, president of United Educators of San Francisco, which represents 6,000 teachers and other staff members.
Teachers should not be penalized for myriad factors affecting student, including parental involvement, Mr. Kelly said.
Linking student growth and teacher performance could also drive teachers from struggling schools, some teachers say.
"Everybody blames teachers for the problems in public schools," said Dennis Klein, a third-grade teacher at Bret Harte Elementary School in Bayview. "We need smaller classes and more time to plan lessons and teach."
Regardless of the criteria in use, however, it is difficult for San Francisco parents to assess their child's teachers. Evaluations are protected by privacy laws.
"Getting teacher-level information is impossible," Ms. Shaffer said. "It should be publicly available. It is a public system, paid for by taxpayers."
In the push for more teacher accountability, a growing number of school systems nationwide are trying different approaches. The value-added method, for example, rates teachers from best to worst using students' test scores. The Los Angeles Times enraged teachers last year when it published a series that included the rankings of about 6,000 elementary school teachers based on a value-added analysis. In south San Jose, administrators at the Oak Grove district say including student achievement in evaluations has helped bolster the district's Academic Performance Index, the state's measure of academic performance.
"Most of our students' scores have increased," said KC Walsh, president of the Oak Grove Educators Association, which represents 620 teachers and other employees. "The accountability has improved student achievement."

Full text: BEIJING -- China's economy grew at a higher-than-expected rate of 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter and inflation eased only slightly last month, its National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.
The agency said the economy grew at a rate of 10.3 percent for the full year, while the rate of inflation was 3.3 percent. Inflation fell in December to 4.8 percent, from 5.1 percent in November. G.D.P. growth rose from 9.6 percent in the third quarter and topped the 9.2 percent forecast by market analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The report did little to quell concern that China's economy was growing too rapidly. Analysts say that the numbers mean the government will have to further tighten monetary policy, which could lead the Chinese currency to appreciate against the dollar.
Chinese officials conceded that inflation was a result of rising food costs. Chinese citizens have been complaining of rising food prices, with some staples increasing 25 percent in the last few months.
"It's clear that the government policy stance has shifted" from worrying about growth to controlling inflation, said Arthur Kroeber, head of the economics research company Dragonomics, based in Beijing.
Over the last few months, the government has taken incremental steps to tighten growth and curb inflation. But bank lending continues to surge, and on Thursday, the government reported that fixed-asset investment rose 23.8 percent, while property investment soared 33.2 percent.
Some analysts said that they thought one way to combat inflation would be to allow the Chinese currency to strengthen.
The American government has been pushing China to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate, and it has been a major topic at the current visit of President Hu Jintao of China's trip to the United States.
Still, analysts said they do not expect immediate changes. The G.D.P. figures were not drastically different from predictions, and Chinese leaders will like want to gauge inflation further before acting, Mr. Kroeber said.
Seen broadly, the numbers offer another insight into China's changing economy. The government now seems able to avoid the boom-bust cycles, unlike in the 1980s and 1990s, that were prominent during the first decades of economic reforms.
"The cycles have flattened out," said Helen Qiao, an economist with Goldman Sachs, "so the swings are not so dramatic."

Abstract: Many companies can now come much closer to setting the terms of their relationship with employees, letting them go when they become a drag on profits and relying on remaining workers or temporary ones when business picks up.

Full text: Alone among the world's economic powers, the United States is suffering through a deep jobs slump that can't be explained by the rest of the economy's performance.
The gross domestic product here -- the total value of all goods and services -- has recovered from the recession better than in Britain, Germany, Japan or Russia. Yet a greatly shrunken group of American workers, working harder and more efficiently, is producing these goods and services.
The unemployment rate is higher in this country than in Britain or Russia and much higher than in Germany or Japan, according to a study of worldwide job markets that Gallup will release on Wednesday. The American jobless rate is also higher than China's, Gallup found. The European countries with worse unemployment than the United States tend to be those still mired in crisis, like Greece, Ireland and Spain.
Economists are now engaged in a spirited debate, much of it conducted on popularblogslikeMarginal Revolution, about the causes of the American jobs slump. Lawrence Katz, a Harvard labor economist, calls the full picture "genuinely puzzling."
That the financial crisis originated here, and was so severe here, surely plays some role. The United States had a bigger housing bubble than most other countries, leaving a large group of idle construction workers who can't easily switch industries. Many businesses, meanwhile, are reluctant to commit to hiring workers out of a fear that heavily indebted households won't spend much in coming years.
But beyond these immediate causes, the basic structure of the American economy also seems to be an important factor. This jobless recovery, after all, is the third straight recovery since 1991 to begin with months and months of little job growth.
Why? One obvious possibility is the balance of power between employers and employees.
Relative to the situation in most other countries -- or in this country for most of the last century -- American employers operate with few restraints. Unions have withered, at least in the private sector, and courts have grown friendlier to business. Many companies can now come much closer to setting the terms of their relationship with employees, letting them go when they become a drag on profits and relying on remaining workers or temporary ones when business picks up.
Just consider the main measure of corporate health: profits. In Canada, Japan and most of Europe, corporate profits have still not recovered to precrisis levels. In the United States, profits have more than recovered, rising 12 percent since late 2007.
For corporate America, the Great Recession is over. For the American work force, it's not.
Unfortunately, fixing the job market will take years. Even if job growth accelerated to the rapid pace of the late 1990s and remained there, the unemployment rate would not fall below 6 percent (which some economists consider full employment) until 2016. We could now be in only the first half of the longest stretch of high unemployment since World War II.
The best way to put people back to work is to lift economic growth. For Washington, lifting growth will first mean avoiding the mistakes of 2010, when the Fed, the White House and some members of Congress prematurely assumed that a solid recovery was under way. The risk this year is that they will start reducing the budget deficit immediately by cutting federal programs, rather than having the cuts take effect in future years.
Policy makers could also help the unemployed by spreading economic pain more broadly among the population. I realize this idea may not sound so good at first. Who wants pain to spread? But the fact is that this downturn has concentrated its effects on a relatively narrow group of Americans.
In Germany and Canada, some companies and workers have averted layoffs by agreeing to cut everyone's hours and, thus, pay. In this country, average wages for the employed have risen faster than inflation since 2007, which is highly unusual for a downturn. Yet unemployment remains terribly high, and almost half of the unemployed have been out of work for at least six months. These are the people bearing the brunt of the downturn.
Germany's job-sharing program -- known as "Kurzarbeit," or short work -- has won praise from both conservative and liberal economists. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, has offered a bill that would encourage similar programs. So far, though, the White House has not pursued it aggressively. Perhaps Gene Sperling, the new director of the National Economic Council, can put it back on the agenda.
Restoring some balance to the relationship between employers and employees will be more difficult. One problem is that too many labor unions, like the auto industry's, have been poorly run, hurting companies and, ultimately, workers. Of course, many other companies -- AT&T, General Electric, Southwest Airlines -- have thrived with unionized workers, and study after study has shown that unions usually do benefit workers. As one bumper sticker says, "Unions: The folks who brought you the weekend."
Today, unions are clearly playing on an uneven field. Companies pay minimal penalties for illegally trying to bar unions and have become expert at doing so, legally and otherwise. For all their shortcomings, unions remain many workers' best hope for some bargaining power.
The list of promising solutions to the jobs slump can go on and on. Reforming the disability insurance system so it does not encourage long-term joblessness would help. "Once people enter the system," as Mr. Katz of Harvard says, "they basically never come back." Improving high schools and colleges -- reclaiming the global lead in education -- would help even more. Remember, the jobless rate for college graduates is only 4.8 percent, and some highly skilled jobs continue to go unfilled.
The jobs slump has become too severe to disappear anytime soon. It will be part of the American economy and American politics for years to come. But there is no reason to treat it as a problem that's immune from solutions. For starters, it would be worth figuring out what other countries are doing right.

U.S. Shifts Focus to Press Chinese to Open Markets

Abstract: A series of trade restrictions imposed by the Chinese government within China, including administrative controls, requirements to transfer sophisticated technology, state subsidies to favored domestic companies and so-called indigenous laws meant to favor homegrown businesses, have angered many American manufacturing and high-tech companies, which are rapidly finding themselves cut out of the world's fastest growing market.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A year ago, the fight over how China's cheap currency was hurting American companies in marketplaces at home and abroad was shaping up to be the epic battle between the world's biggest power and its biggest economic rival.
But when President Hu Jintao walks into the Eisenhower Executive Office Building with President Obama on Wednesday to face a group of 18 American and Chinese business leaders, much of the clash will be about a new economic battlefield -- inside China itself.
A series of trade restrictions imposed by the Chinese government within China, including administrative controls, requirements to transfer sophisticated technology, state subsidies to favored domestic companies and so-called indigenous laws meant to favor homegrown businesses, have angered many American manufacturing and high-tech companies, which are rapidly finding themselves cut out of the world's fastest growing market.
The result is that the two countries have to resolve a wider range of economic tensions, including what American multinational corporations see as a deteriorating environment for investing and making money in what has become the world's second largest economy.
So it is no longer just a fight over cheap Chinese textile, electronic and toy imports. China won that battle years ago. Now the question -- reminiscent of trade tensions with Japan in the 1980s -- is whether General Electric and Microsoft and other American companies that dearly want to expand into China's rapidly expanding markets will find themselves beaten at their own game by Chinese companies, backed by the Chinese government, "competing at every point in the technology spectrum," said Eswar Shanker Prasad, a former economist with the International Monetary Fund who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.
Myron Brilliant, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, "It's no longer just a question of Nucor complaining about dumping," referring to the American steel manufacturing company that has accused China of selling steel fasteners and bolts at below-market prices abroad. "Those concerns may not be going away, but the noise out there now has additional voices. The voices are not just low-cost products coming here; the competition is about China's marketplace."
For Mr. Obama, the shift gives him stronger backing from American businesses for a tougher approach to China when he sits down with Mr. Hu. The Chinese president arrived in Washington on Tuesday afternoon for two full days of high-level meetings that began with a private dinner at the White House on Tuesday evening.
"The business community has historically been the bastion of support for the U.S.-China relationship," said Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, in an interview. "Now that support is more qualified." Mr. Froman said that Mr. Obama and American officials would be "underscoring the importance of addressing these issues if we're going to have a level playing field."
American companies have always had a love-hate relationship with China -- with the manufacturing companies in the South and steel companies in the Midwest urging the government to take tough action against China, and advanced manufacturers and high-tech companies that want access to the Chinese marketplace pressing for a more conciliatory tone.
Now, both sides seem to want the administration to get tough. Last year, Jeffrey R. Immelt of G.E. complained to a meeting of business leaders in Rome that it was getting harder for foreign companies to do business in China, and he expressed a growing irritation that China was protecting its own national companies at the detriment of American companies.
Google last March moved its Chinese service out of mainland China to avoid censorship rules. The American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing has also complained that is members are facing an increasingly difficult regulatory environment.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner signaled the Obama administration's stance in a speech last week, when he said that the United States would grant China more access to high-tech American products and expand trade and investment opportunities within the United States only if China opened its own domestic market to American products. That push for market access, administration officials said, will be at the top of Mr. Obama's agenda with Mr. Hu, both during their one-on-one meetings and when they meet with the business leaders.
American multinational corporations, experts said, are hurt by Chinese regulations that openly favor Chinese companies over foreign ones for government contracts. These rules, which are intended to stimulate technological innovation in China, have the effect of cutting American and other non-Chinese companies out of many of the big contracts there.
"U.S. companies have issues with China in many different business sectors," said John Frisbie, president of the U.S.-China Business Council in Washington. "But if I were to point to one single issue over the last year, it has been China's innovation policies and how they link to government procurement."
Under pressure from the United States and other countries, the Chinese have paused in their rollout of the rules. But Beijing has not scrapped them, and the administration will raise the issue again this week with Mr. Hu.
Mr. Frisbie also pointed to intellectual property rights as another "existential issue" for software developers and movie producers. There is some evidence of progress on this issue: at a meeting in Beijing last month, the Chinese government pledged to use only properly registered software in government offices.
As important as these issues are, some economists argue that they pale when compared with the distortions caused by an undervalued currency. While nationalistic rules that favor Chinese companies affect technology and entertainment giants, China's cheap currency undercuts tens of thousands of small-scale American manufacturers -- companies that still make their products at home.
"The small mom-and-pop companies, which are getting crushed by the renminbi, you never hear from them," said Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "They don't really have a voice. They just shrink and go out of business."
While the renminbi, China's currency, has risen 3.6 percent against the dollar since China loosened its link to the dollar last June, Mr. Lardy estimates that it is still undervalued by 15 percent to 17 percent on a trade-weighted basis.
Mr. Geithner has argued that it is in China's self-interest to allow its currency to rise, to curb building inflationary pressures in the Chinese economy. The Chinese government has also declared that it wants to reduce the share of exports in overall economic growth.
But Mr. Lardy said he was skeptical that the Chinese would take the advice, given that they had not accelerated the rise in the currency last fall, when inflation began heating up. And in the wake of a financial crisis that originated in the United States, he said, China would be even less inclined to listen to economic prescriptions from Washington.
"They learned that the advice they've been getting from previous Treasury secretaries wasn't worth the paper it was printed on," Mr. Lardy said.

Abstract: The loud criticism of Mr. Singh, who sits atop the coalition government led by the Indian National Congress Party, is partly the white noise of India's raucous democracy, and partly a reprise of old complaints. [...] 20 months later, the Congress Party has suffered setbacks in elections in the state of Bihar and is wounded by corruption scandals linked to the Commonwealth Games, the government's allotment of 2G telecommunications spectrum and other cases of official malfeasance.

Full text: NEW DELHI -- Few leaders are more respected globally than Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India. President Obama has described him as a historic figure, close friend and valued adviser. (So, for that matter, did President George W. Bush.) When Newsweekranked world leaders, Mr. Singh ranked first, winning praise for his modesty and incorruptibility. He was described as the "leader that other leaders love."
But if he is lauded overseas, Mr. Singh is now under attack at home, as critics blame his administration for indecision and inaction. His government is besieged by corruption scandals, runaway inflation and bickering among senior ministers. Amid the clamor, Mr. Singh has often seemed silent or aloof, even as his political enemies have portrayed him as the weak captain of a rudderless administration.
The loud criticism of Mr. Singh, who sits atop the coalition government led by the Indian National Congress Party, is partly the white noise of India's raucous democracy, and partly a reprise of old complaints. But the public perception of disarray is one reason the prime minister is expected to reshuffle his cabinet as early as Wednesday.
Many analysts say Mr. Singh must recharge his administration to tackle major issues like food security, power supply and infrastructure, as well as to push through reforms on land and governance. More than that, they say, he must seize the moment to address larger, systemic failures in governing that foster corruption and could eventually undermine India's aspirations to become a global power.
For now, India's economy is sizzling, growing at roughly 9 percent a year. Many economists are forecasting a long boom that, if handled properly, could transform the nation. Many Indian entrepreneurs have learned to thrive despite governmental dysfunction, but few analysts believe India can thrive long term if the government maintains the status quo.
"There are so many uncertainties over the next four or five years that if you don't fix things while the going is good, it is going to be that much harder, later," said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Center for Policy Research, a leading independent research institute in New Delhi. "Given the historic opportunity that India has, they are frittering away precious time."
Mr. Singh, now 78, usually floats above the rancor of India's daily politics. Trained as an economist, he is considered a father of the economic reforms credited for setting off India's current boom. As finance minister, beginning in 1991, he dismantled socialist-era restraints and oversaw India's transition to a more open, market-based economy. By 2004, after Sonia Gandhi had guided the Congress Party back to power, she made Mr. Singh her surprise choice for prime minister.
Indeed, Mr. Singh's critics have long disparaged him as a caretaker prime minister beholden to Mrs. Gandhi, the Congress Party president, and to her son, Rahul Gandhi, the party's heir apparent as prime minister. Yet Mr. Singh proved otherwise, especially when Congress Party leaders and coalition allies wavered on a landmark civilian nuclear agreement with the United States. Mr. Singh threatened to resign if the Congress Party did not back him on the deal -- which it promptly did.
In the 2009 elections, opposition leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., depicted Mr. Singh as India's weakest prime minister, but voters re-elected his Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. When the new government took office, public expectations were high.
Now, 20 months later, the Congress Party has suffered setbacks in elections in the state of Bihar and is wounded by corruption scandals linked to the Commonwealth Games, the government's allotment of 2G telecommunications spectrum and other cases of official malfeasance.
Mr. Singh must no doubt operate at the mercy of the imperfections of India's coalition politics. But his cabinet has witnessed periodic infighting, while the prime minister himself has seemed slow to respond to certain crises, his critics say.
When Kashmir erupted in violence and demonstrations last summer, Mr. Singh waited for months before strongly intervening. And though he has not been personally linked to any scandals, he has been criticized for his inability, or unwillingness, to crack the whip on corruption and push through reforms.
"In spite of a clean personal image," said Nirmala Sitharaman, a B.J.P. spokeswoman, "he is heading a government that is responsible for unbelievable amounts of treasury loss."
Sanjaya Baru, a former spokesman for the prime minister, said the scandals had come as Mr. Singh's political influence already seemed diminished. He was forced to make a public reversal after making an overture to Pakistan that apparently exceeded the dictates of other Congress Party leaders. His signature achievement -- the nuclear deal -- was passed with a liability clause that may prevent many foreign nuclear suppliers from building power plants in India.
"He is damaged, he is quite damaged," said Mr. Baru, who is now editor of Business Standard, a financial newspaper. "In the last year, the feeling is that he has not been able to do what he would like to do. That he is not his own man. And he has to overcome that for his own legacy."
For weeks, the political gossip mill in New Delhi was filled with speculation that Mr. Singh might be pushed out, though most analysts say such a situation was never likely, given Mr. Singh's global stature and his standing in the country.
Mrs. Gandhi is widely perceived to be positioning her son as the party's prime ministerial candidate in 2014, but her commitment to Mr. Singh seems unshaken for the current term. Moreover, the prime minister's allies dispute any suggestion that he is a diminished figure.
"Externally, he may appear to be weak," said Jairam Ramesh, the environment minister. "But internally, I can tell you, he is very clear in what he is doing."
Harish Khare, the prime minister's spokesman, dismissed the criticism as "democratic noise" and noted that India's parliamentary system, as well as the traditions of the Congress Party, act to preclude any prime minister from acting with sole authority.
"The decision making is a collective process," he said. "People expect the prime minister to be a president, of the United States presidential model. That's not Mr. Singh's style. His style is quiet leadership and delivering."
Still, most analysts say Mr. Singh's government must restore its credibility with the public. On Monday, a group of corporate leaders and prominent citizens published an open letter calling on "our leaders" to confront corruption and institute reforms and accountability. Mr. Baru, the former spokesman, said reshuffling the cabinet could be a first step.
"Right now, everybody is saying he is doing nothing," Mr. Baru said. "That is the real crisis. He needs a new team and a new agenda to establish that he is back in control."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As the fight over health care returned to the House floor on Tuesday, the debate could largely be stripped down to four questions that are relatively simple to ask, if not to answer:
Will the health care law, approved last year by Democrats with no Republican support, increase or reduce future federal deficits?
Will the law lead to the elimination of jobs by overburdened employers as Republicans assert, or will it create jobs as Democrats maintain?
Will the law raise or lower the cost of medical care for individuals and families, employers, and state and federal governments?
And, will the law achieve President Obama's goal of providing coverage to more than 30 million uninsured Americans?
Given the complexity of the issues, none of these questions can yet be answered definitively.
More certain is the fate of the Republicans' bill to repeal the law, which contains 24 lines of legislative text and 38 lines of the names of the lawmakers sponsoring it. While House Republicans will vote to approve it on Wednesday, the Democratic-controlled Senate is highly unlikely to act on it.
Still, the assertions from the two sides highlight their radically different views about the proper role of government and market forces in the health care system. It is a policy fight that is likely to rage for the next two years in Congress and to figure prominently in the 2012 presidential campaign.
As floor debate on the repeal measure opened on Tuesday, Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the Budget Committee, who is a respected voice on fiscal issues, declared that the health care law would "accelerate our country's path toward bankruptcy."
Mr. Ryan expressed one of the Republicans' main complaints: that Democrats and independent Congressional budget analysts have underestimated the costs of the law, which Republicans say will ultimately add hundreds of billions of dollars to future federal deficits.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office disagrees.
In its official analysis, the budget office estimated that the cost of new benefits in the health care law would be more than offset by revenues from new taxes and by cuts in projected Medicare spending, reducing future deficits. Repealing the law, the budget office has predicted, would add $230 billion to federal deficits from 2012 to 2021.
Republicans dispute that, saying the cost will be far higher than expected.
"We believe that it is an unsustainable, open-ended entitlement that could very well bankrupt this country and the states," the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The budget office has said that its estimates are based on the most likely outcomes, and that the eventual cost of the bill is equally likely to be higher or lower.
The office has also said that lawmakers may find it difficult to follow through with some aspects of the law, particularly cuts in projected Medicare spending. If the cuts do not take hold, the cost of the law could soar.
Democrats, meanwhile, say the law could save even more money than expected because the budget office does not give them credit for likely improvements in the delivery of medical services that could slow the growth in costs for individuals, businesses and the federal and state governments.
Weighing into the debate, Mr. Obama said Tuesday that Americans were already enjoying many benefits of the new law, and that he would not let Republicans dismantle it.
"I'm willing and eager to work with both Democrats and Republicans to improve the Affordable Care Act," Mr. Obama said in a statement. "But we can't go backward."
The White House and Congressional Democrats said the law would create more than 300,000 jobs, by slowing the growth of health costs so employers would have more to spend on wages and hiring. In addition, they said, the law provides tax credits to help many small businesses buy insurance for their employees.
By contrast, Representative Sam Graves, Republican of Missouri and chairman of the House Committee on Small Business, said the law "could cost our economy 1.6 million jobs, one million of which could come from small businesses."
Many economists say the effects on jobs are likely to be modest. Most large companies already provide health benefits to employees. And many small businesses will be exempt from penalties if they fail to do so.
While employers often pay premiums for their employees, economists say, the cost of health benefits is, over time, generally passed on to workers, through reductions in wages or other compensation. But employers cannot reduce the wages of people earning the minimum wage.
Thus, the Congressional Budget Office says, the new law "will probably cause some employers to respond by hiring fewer low-wage workers," or by using more part-time and seasonal workers.
But Democrats say that if the law provides coverage to more than 30 million currently uninsured people, as intended, it will increase demand for medical services, thus creating new job opportunities in the health care industry.
Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, said, "There is not a single area of health care" that will experience job losses as a result of the law.
Republicans have emphasized the jobs issue, even naming their bill the "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act." But they have also pressed an argument that the law does not do much to slow the growth of health spending.
The law includes many provisions intended to restrain medical costs, which have long grown faster than general inflation.
For example, it would trim Medicare payment rates for hospitals and many other health care providers; create an independent advisory board to recommend further savings in Medicare; and encourage doctors and hospitals to coordinate care, eliminate duplicative tests and reduce the readmission of patients to hospitals.
But experts say they are not sure how effective these provisions will be, and note that countries around the globe have struggled to control medical costs.
Republicans say the law is geared less to limiting costs than to extending coverage to the uninsured. The budget office has estimated that by 2019 the law will have reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 32 million.
But even with a provision in the law requiring that most Americans obtain insurance, it is possible that the law will not cover as many people as expected. Some supporters of the law have questioned whether federal subsidies will be adequate to make insurance affordable for lower- and middle-income Americans. And while the law includes a broad expansion of Medicaid eligibility, many people now eligible do not enroll.
In addition, the continuing political controversy around the law has created even more uncertainty about how people will respond to it.

Full text: The euro fell on Monday, ending a five-day rally against the dollar, and Spanish bonds dropped as the region's ministers debated a bailout plan. United States stock futures declined abroad after Apple said that its chief executive, Steve Jobs, was taking a medical leave of absence.
Futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, of which Apple is the second-biggest member, lost 0.3 percent.
The Shanghai Composite index tumbled 3 percent, leading Asian shares lower, on concern that China's anti-inflation measures would curb growth. The MSCI Emerging Markets index fell 0.4 percent. Markets in the United States were closed for Martin Luther King's Birthday.
European finance ministers met in Brussels on Monday and discussed ways to increase the financing capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility. They also addressed ways to broaden its role to allow it to buy bonds or extend credit to countries, perhaps to help in future bank restructuring.
"There's plenty of reasons to be circumspect on the euro after the rally last week," said Jeremy Stretch, executive director of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London.
The Nasdaq 100 index futures expiring in March sank 1.3 percent in electronic trading. Apple accounts for about 21 percent of the Nasdaq 100, a gauge of the largest companies that trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The index closed last week at its highest level since February 2001. Apple shares tumbled 6.2 percent in Germany after the shares closed at a record $348.48 last week in New York.
Apple said its chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, would be responsible for the company's day-to-day operations, with Mr. Jobs, Apple's co-founder, continuing as chief. Mr. Jobs took a nearly six-month break to have a liver transplant in 2009.
"Apple shares will obviously be getting hit, as shareholders rightfully command a premium for a C.E.O. like Steve Jobs," said David Lutz, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. "Any sell-off will be used as a buying opportunity, as Steve Jobs has high confidence in Tim Cook, and the two have worked closely defining Apple's strategy and vision. Last time Jobs had to take time, that proved a huge buying opportunity for the stock."
Apple, as well as companies including Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, are scheduled to release earnings this week.
Most Canadian stocks fell, led by energy producers, as an Alaska pipeline prepared to restart and Chinese stocks dropped the most in two months. The S&P/TSX Composite index slipped 0.2 percent.
The euro was down 0.7 percent to $1.3289 at 4:27 p.m. in New York. The euro weakened versus all but two of its most-traded counterparts, sliding 0.9 percent against the yen. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against those of six trading partners, advanced 0.3 percent, rising for the first time in six days.
Spain's 10-year bonds decreased as the government halted auctions on Jan. 20 in favor of selling debt through banks.
The cost of credit-default swaps, or insuring debt, sold by Europe's so-called peripheral nations rose, ending four days of declines. The Euro Stoxx 50 was down 9.77 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,910.63. BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto led mining companies lower. BP climbed 0.2 percent in London, and OAO Rosneft rallied 5.2 percent in Russia after the oil companies agreed to swap equity stakes as part of a drive to extract billions of barrels of Arctic petroleum.
Britain's FTSE 100 closed down 16.37 points, or 0.3 percent, and France's CAC 40 dropped 7.87 points, or 0.2 percent. In Germany, the DAX ended the day 2.36 points, or less than 0.1 percent, higher.
Oil fell as much as 0.8 percent to $90.83 a barrel as the operators of a pipeline from Alaska prepared to restore flows to the United States.

Abstract: The government's success in overcoming political obstacles to make the cuts and its willingness to risk social upheaval suggest that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may have consolidated power after the internal fractures that followed his bitterly disputed re-election in 2009 -- a development that some analysts believe could influence Iran's position at nuclear talks in Istanbul this month.

Full text: TEHRAN -- After months of false starts, dire warnings and political wrangling, Iran has embarked on a sweeping program of cuts in its costly and inefficient system of subsidies on fuel and other essential goods that has put a strain on state finances and held back economic progress for years.
The government's success in overcoming political obstacles to make the cuts and its willingness to risk social upheaval suggest that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may have consolidated power after the internal fractures that followed his bitterly disputed re-election in 2009 -- a development that some analysts believe could influence Iran's position at nuclear talks in Istanbul this month.
"The initial success of the subsidy reform will increase the regime's confidence generally," said Cliff Kupchan, a former State Department official who is now a director at the Washington-based Eurasia Group. "This could make them more assertive in the talks. But more importantly, a confident and unified regime is better positioned to reach consensus on some initial agreement."
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintonsaid recently that international sanctions had slowed Iran's nuclear program, and the restrictions do seem to have disrupted sectors of the economy, particularly banking and export-related industries. But the sanctions do not seem to be the driving force behind the subsidy cuts.
Iran's foreign exchange revenues also sank in recent years as oil prices fell from prerecession highs, creating greater budget pressures. But Tehran has long sought to cut the subsidies -- even under the reformist administration of President Mohammad Khatami -- and particularly for oil.
The logic is compelling: artificially low prices encourage greater consumption, leaving less oil to export for cash. And the higher oil prices rise, the greater the "opportunity costs" in lost exports. But the timing, whether for political or economic reasons, was never right to cut the subsidies.
While the government may be feeling economic pressure now, analysts say, the current program of cuts is principally a sign of its political strength, having vanquished the opposition that sprang up after the 2009 elections and stared down the government's traditional conservative wing, which has challenged Mr. Ahmadinejad's authority.
"This was something the two previous administrations wanted to do but could not accomplish," said Kevan Harris, a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University who has written extensively on Iran's economy and social welfare system. "Now that the liberals have been sidelined, like any good politician, Ahmadinejad has taken the most popular ideas from the opposing side and implemented them himself."
The success of the subsidy cuts so far also seems to have contributed to a continuing reassessment of Mr. Ahmadinejad. He emerged in the diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks as something of a sober pragmatist -- battling with retrograde forces in the government -- rather than as the ranting extremist he seemed when he called for Israel to be wiped off the map. In October 2009, according to one of the cables, he argued for a nuclear compromise promoted by the United States that would have sent uranium out of the country for enrichment. And during the protests following the 2009 elections, he is reported to have argued for more freedom of the press -- until a general in the Revolutionary Guards slapped him and shouted, "It is you who created this mess!"
The subsidy cuts, which the International Monetary Fund says have amounted to $4,000 a year for the average Iranian family, began in earnest last month when the rationed price of gasoline jumped to about $1.44 a gallon from just 38 cents. With a ration of only 16 gallons a month at the subsidized rate, most motorists buy the bulk of their fuel now at the even higher market rate of $2.64 per gallon, significantly more than the $1.80 that people pay in nearby Dubai.
In recent weeks, subsidies have also been reduced on flour, water and diesel. But the spike in prices has not provoked the angry protests that followed the introduction of fuel rationing in 2007. The price of bread has tripled, on average, the government says; water, which used to be practically free, now costs between 10 cents and 85 cents per cubic meter, based on a sliding scale under which consumers pay a higher rate the more they use.
The government says these are just the first steps in what it calls an "economic transformation plan" that will also include banking reform, sweeping changes in Iran's tax and customs system, and ever more privatization of state-owned industries. And with officials already reporting drops in the consumption of gasoline, flour, diesel and electricity, even before the prices were raised, Mr. Ahmadinejad has been exultant.
"I believe that the Imam of Our Time has managed this plan and supports it," he said in a speech last week, citing the "hidden" 12th imam revered by Shiite Muslims as the embodiment of justice and righteousness.
Iran's state-directed economy has long been plagued by corruption, inflation, inefficiencies and unemployment, which is particularly high among young people. The problems have damaged Iran's ability to compete in world markets. Ending state controls and subsidies have long been seen as the first step in reviving a moribund economy that the C.I.A. estimates grew by an anemic 1.5 percent in 2009. Analysts say the unemployment and inflation rates are about 20 percent, nearly double the official figures of 11.8 percent and 12.2 percent respectively.
Energy use was the most obvious place to start in reducing subsidies. Iran's population has doubled since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, but energy consumption is five times higher. Few educated Iranians still believe in the old Khomeinist doctrine that Iranians have a right to free energy because of their country's oil wealth.
Until now, however, efforts to increase energy efficiency have been virtually nonexistent. Energy experts say that only 3 percent of buildings nationwide have adequate insulation, and until now it has been common for people to run their central gas heating 24 hours a day with their windows open to allow in fresh air. Official estimates put the cost of energy waste in Iran at $30 billion a year.
"I used to be the kind of person to have all the lights on because I liked the house to be very bright," says Fariba, 28, an office worker. "But now I've changed my ways. I think it's because they have been talking about it so much on the radio and television."
Some of the financial blow to consumers has been softened by cash payments of around $40 a month, which the government says it is paying to 60 million Iranians. The first two months' payments were deposited in bank accounts in late October, but the money was not available for withdrawal until the middle of last month.
"They made so much fuss about the $40, they made it seem like $40,000," said a senior economist at a government-run financial institution, who lauded government officials as "social psychologists" who made the public more receptive to the subsidy cuts. He asked not to be quoted by name because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.
"By putting the money in people's accounts but not letting them spend it," he said, "somehow people became eager for the plan to begin."
The public seems to have embraced the program. That includes Shahla, 50, a schoolteacher and mother of two who, like others interviewed, refused to give her last name for fear of the authorities, and who has long been critical of the government on just about everything.
"We've become very economical over the past months," she said. "I heard that it's a good thing, and that it will help us enter the world market."
She says she now washes only large loads of laundry and has urged her family to wear warmer clothes in winter instead of lighting a gas fireplace.
During an interview at his home, the financial manager of a medium-size steel-piping manufacturer told his daughter to turn off two lights in the living room right before he described how the subsidy cuts were beginning to show up on his company's balance sheet.
Transportation costs jumped 20 percent last month after diesel subsidies were cut, he said, and he expected that this month's electricity bill would be about three times the previous charge, if scheduled cuts go into effect. But he says these are just the latest in a long line of mounting financial pressures he has faced over the past year.
Even before the subsidy reforms began, the manager said, costs increased across the board this year by 15 percent, with scrap steel, the company's main raw material, nearly twice as expensive as it was a year ago. But despite the rising costs and the anticipation of more shocks to come, the manager fully accepts the logic of a plan that he says will make competition "realistic."
"We knew many years ago that prices would have to be normalized," he said after dinner in his modest home in Tehran's western suburbs. "It should have happened a long time ago."
"It has to happen; otherwise we will never learn the true value of raw materials," he said.
Depending on how well Iran's government can stave off the worst effects of the price shocks, the subsidy reforms could be a political victory for Iran's new right wing -- a success for Mr. Ahmadinejad where liberals, now almost entirely excluded from Iran's political scene, had failed.

Full text: BEIJING -- With President Hu Jintao at the helm, China has become a $5 trillion industrial colossus, a growing military force, and, it sometimes appears, a model of authoritarian decisiveness, navigating out of the global financial crisis and sealing its position as the world's fastest rising power.
But as Mr. Hu prepares to visit Washington this week in an attempt to defuse tensions with the United States, Obama administration officials are grappling with what they describe as a more complex reality. China is far wealthier and more influential, but Mr. Hu also may be the weakest leader of the Communist era. He is less able to project authority than his predecessors were -- and perhaps less able to keep relations between the world's two largest economies from becoming more adversarial.
Mr. Hu's strange encounter with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates here last week -- in which he was apparently unaware that his own air force had just test-flown China's first stealth fighter -- was only the latest case suggesting that he has been boxed in or circumvented by rival power centers.
American officials have spent years urging Mr. Hu to revalue China's currency, rein in North Korea, ease up on dissidents and crack down on the copying of American technology, and they have felt at times that Mr. Hu agreed to address their concerns. But those problems have festered, and after first wondering if the Chinese leader was simply deflecting them or deceiving them, President Obama's top advisers have concluded that Mr. Hu is often at the mercy of a diffuse ruling party in which generals, ministers and big corporate interests have more clout, and less deference, than they did in the days of Mao or Deng Xiaoping, who commanded basically unquestioned authority.
China's military has sometimes pursued an independent approach to foreign policy. So have many of China's biggest state-owned companies, sometimes to the United States' detriment. The result is that relations between the world's largest superpower and its fastest-rising one are at one of their lowest point in years, battered by confrontations that took Mr. Obama by surprise -- and, on occasion, Mr. Hu as well.
Speaking on Wednesday to students at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner hinted that jockeying for power and an coming leadership transition have degraded China's ability to set consistent policies.
"As China goes through this political transition over the next year or so," he said, picking his words carefully, "in some ways, it's having the effect of slowing the pace of reform because it's inducing a bit of caution."
Others are more stark. "There is a remarkable amount of chaos in the system, more than you ever saw dealing with the Chinese 20 years ago," Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser and Mr. Gates's mentor, said Saturday. "The military doesn't participate in the system the way it once did. They are more autonomous -- and so are a lot of others."
Divided leadership has made it harder to resolve disputes with China, much less strike grand bargains like the reopening of relations between the two countries under Mao.
In past meetings, Mr. Hu and his prime minister have indicated that they would let China's currency gradually rise. But the Commerce Ministry promptly labeled the move a "catastrophe" for the Chinese economy. Despite Mr. Hu's repeated assurances that the Chinese market would continue to open up to foreigners, business leaders complain that regulators have made it more difficult for foreign energy, communications and banking concerns to compete with China's state-backed favorites.
Not surprisingly, some of the biggest differences focus on how to deal with the United States and its power in the Pacific.
Mr. Hu has repeatedly asserted China's disinclination to challenge American power; his designated foreign policy coordinator, State Councilor Dai Bingguo, recently wrote an article reaffirming Mr. Deng's warning, made back when China's modernization was beginning, that the country should bide its time before seeking a global role.
On Friday, the article was cited by Mr. Obama's national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, who characterized it as "a definitive statement at this point of the leadership's approach to foreign policy generally and the United States specifically."
But even Mr. Donilon acknowledged debates "particularly in the blogosphere and in newspapers in China" that urge a far faster, more assertive rise, and that trumpet American decline. He said with some understatement that "following that debate is a very important thing to do."
Adding to the uncertainty about Mr. Hu's power is an expected leadership change in 2012. It is at once a choreographed transition to a new generation of leaders and a volatile minefield for all contenders, none of whom wish to be viewed as risk-takers, or as subservient to the United States.
Certainly, hopes that China and the United States, briefly dubbed the "G-2" when they started common action to counter the world economic crisis early in 2009, would suddenly find a coincidence of interests have turned out to be optimistic. Even when they agree, American officials report that turning talk into action is frustratingly slow.
By any measure, Mr. Hu is the most constrained Chinese leader in modern times. The notion that he could engineer a sweeping policy change the way that Mr. Deng threw open China's economy three decades ago is unthinkable; more often he is a negotiator, brokering deals in a collective leadership where he has never seemed to fully consolidate power.
Part of his problem is systemic. As Mr. Gates discovered in his meeting last week, the absence of the equivalent of a National Security Council in China meant that the military could operate by its own rules. "The leadership forced the military to start talking to us again," one senior administration official said, "but they couldn't force it not to pull a stunt like the test flight while we were still in Beijing."
Mr. Hu, of course, has the power, at least on paper, to reach across differing bureaucracies. Often, though, he cannot or will not. The debate over revaluing the renminbi, a constant thorn in the relationship with the United States, has not advanced much partly because of a fight between central bankers who want the currency to rise and ministers and party bosses who want to protect the vast industrial machine that depends on cheap exports for survival.
So far, the battle has made it impossible for China to act decisively -- and it is struggling with inflation as a result. Mr. Obama's aides now want to try a different tack: Rather than harp on currency, they are going to raise other economic issues and see if the pressure of rising inflation, and the fear that it could cause social unrest, will compel the Chinese to raise the value of their currency.
The rise of state-owned corporate behemoths, independent power centers in their own right, has also changed the politics in China and made it harder to address disputes with the United States and other big trading partners.
The administration's latest report on Chinese trade practices, issued last month, says that the growing influence of these corporate giants raises significant questions about China's support for "ongoing W.T.O. obligations, including core W.T.O. principles," referring to the World Trade Organization.
China's ban on exports of crucial rare earth minerals, cast by the government as a corporate decision made without state direction, is the most recent example of the tensions this drift toward state control has raised. But there are others: China Mobile, which dominates the nation's vast wireless market, is pressing phone makers to adopt a Chinese standard for wireless communications that ignores the accepted global standard.
And entire swaths of the Chinese market remain broadly closed to outside competition, including banking, mobile communications, electronic payment processing and the media. Overhauling protected sectors of the economy is no longer a priority of the leadership.
Mr. Hu, of course, is hardly a helpless bystander to many of the decisions that rankle the United States. He is an architect of China's growing repression of political dissidents and its recent efforts to expand its regional clout while the United States is on the economic ropes.
But Mr. Hu lacks the commanding authority of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, or Mr. Deng.
China's hawkish military undid years of careful diplomacy in the last two years as it flexed its muscles in the South China Sea, harassing American naval vessels and alarming neighboring countries.
No one questions China's civilian control of the military. Mr. Hu and his presumed successor, Xi Jinping, sit atop the Central Military Commission, the body that oversees the military. But as with other parts of the bureaucracy, it is unclear how firm his grip is.
Abraham M. Denmark of the Center for a New American Security in Washington says there are "many, many examples" in which the military has blindsided civilian leaders with weapons displays or statements that appear to flout official policy. The issue, he said, is not whether the military is loyal to its civilian leaders but whether Mr. Hu and others can make it bow to the government's broader foreign policy goals, like closer ties to the United States.

Give Me a 'P.' Give Me an 'E.' What Does It Spell? Trouble.

Abstract: In a recent strategy report, Mr. Parker noted a historical relationship between slowing earnings growth rates and lower market valuations. Since 1976, for example, when corporate profits have grown at a rate of 11 to 12 percent, the average P/E based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months has been 15.7.

Full text: STOCK market bulls have at least two reasons for optimism: Corporate earnings have continued to climb, and sentiment on Wall Street has improved sharply in the last several weeks.
In theory, this could provide more fuel for the stock market rally. After all, not only are earnings climbing, but the price that investors are willing to pay for those profits could also start to rise. And most investors now say they are optimistic about stocks, according to the American Association of Individual Investors.
Yet there's a problem with this argument: Price-to-earnings ratios based on current year earnings haven't been rising lately. According to Standard & Poor's, the P/E for the S.& P. 500-stock index, based on 2011 estimated operating earnings, stands at 13.3, down from the 15.1 at this time last year, based on 2010 estimated profits.
The situation has set off a Wall Street debate over whether investors should count on market valuations to rise at all this year. In fact, some strategists are even hinting that P/E's could slump, which would create a major headwind for this rally.
To be sure, taken as a group, investors are moving money back into stocks. After yanking $182 billion out of stock mutual funds between January 2007 and last November, they have put more than $3 billion back into equity portfolios since December. And greater demand for stocks should drive market multiples higher.
But Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said a $3 billion inflow is still a modest sum by historical standards and that he doesn't expect strong inflows into stock funds this year.
Moreover, he said Americans' new investments in stocks could be offset if foreign investors become more squeamish about the United States market. He noted that stocks "have been relying more on foreign investors to support valuations in recent years."
Although the S.& P. 500, in dollar terms, posted a strong double-digit gain in the second half of 2010, it was up significantly less in euros and yen. That could make foreign investors question whether they should invest heavily in the American market.
And while earnings have continued to rise, the pace of that growth has slowed as the recovery has matured. That could also keep P/E ratios in check, Mr. Kleintop added.
Adam S. Parker, domestic equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, agrees. In a recent strategy report, Mr. Parker noted a historical relationship between slowing earnings growth rates and lower market valuations. Since 1976, for example, when corporate profits have grown at a rate of 11 to 12 percent, the average P/E based on estimated earnings for the next 12 months has been 15.7. But when that profit growth slows to the 9 to 10 percent range, those P/E's have historically fallen to around 11.
Mr. Parker said he believes that by the middle to the end of 2011, investor expectations for year-over-year profit growth will be lower than today's consensus estimate of 12 percent. "As such, the market multiple, in our estimation, is more likely to contract than expand over the medium to long term," unless profit growth reaccelerates in 2012, he wrote last week.
There's yet another reason to worry that P/E's may contract. Let's assume that market bulls are correct and that the economy is well on the way to recovery, with a successful jump-start from policy makers. One would expect inflation and interest rates to rise, as they are natural byproducts of an expanding economy.
The problem is that higher inflation has generally led to lower market P/E ratios, because inflation eats away at the value of each dollar in corporate earnings.
Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, says that while there is a fundamental relationship between inflation and stock market valuations, current levels of inflation are so low that there is no reason to panic. "As long as inflation still hovers in the 1 to 3 percent range, that's actually a good time for P/E multiples," he said.
Indeed, since 1871, the market's P/E has hovered between 17 and 18, on average, in periods when inflation has grown at an annual rate of 1 to 3 percent. That's well above the current P/E of about 13.
But what about the potential for rising market interest rates? Couldn't higher rates pressure P/E ratios, by making bonds more attractive than stocks?
In general, the answer is yes, but Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, points out that bond yields are still low by historical standards.
And even though there's a strong correlation between rising bond yields and falling P/E's, that's not necessarily the case when the yield on 10-year Treasury securities is below 5 percent. Ten-year yields today are still only 3.3 percent.
"Yields are at a low-enough absolute level where it's not yet threatening P/E's," Ms. Sonders said.
AT some point, of course, that may no longer be the case. But Mr. Richardson said sufficiently high inflation and interest rates are "late 2011 or 2012 issues." In the meantime, he said, "investors can still be excited about stocks based on earnings growth alone."
If market valuations contract, corporate America could still keep the rally going by meeting and exceeding profit expectations, he said. And if market multiples expand? "That would be icing on the cake," he added.

Full text: Cables from American diplomats in Tunisia portray a deepening ambivalence toward the rule of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, expressing alarm about popular resentment of the blatant corruption of the country's first family but also gratitude for Mr. Ben Ali's cooperation against terrorism and the stability he long imposed.
Those cables, from the cache obtained by the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks and made public in recent weeks, helped fuel the anger on the streets that culminated Friday with Mr. Ben Ali's flight after 23 years in power. Posted on a site created last month called TuniLeaks, the diplomats' disgusted and lurid accounts of the kleptocratic ways of the president's extended family helped tip the scales, according to many Tunisian commentators.
"What's Yours Is Mine" was the wry title of a June 2008 cable reporting the brazen habits of the president's clan.
"Corruption in Tunisia is getting worse," the cable said. "Whether it's cash, services, land, property, or yes, even your yacht, President Ben Ali's family is rumored to covet it and reportedly gets what it wants," the cable said, reporting that two nephews of Mr. Ben Ali's had seized the yacht of a French businessman in 2006.
While the cable recounted routine demands for bribes by low-ranking government workers (the cost of a traffic stop, one Tunisian said, was up from 20 dinars to 40 or 50, or about $28 to $34), it said the flagrant thievery at the highest levels was most worrisome.
"Although the petty corruption rankles, it is the excesses of President Ben Ali's family that inspire outrage among Tunisians," the cable said. "With Tunisians facing rising inflation and high unemployment, the conspicuous displays of wealth and persistent rumors of corruption have added fuel to the fire."
Another cable, from July 2009, reported a "lavish" dinner of the American ambassador, Robert F. Godec, with Mr. Ben Ali's son-in- law, Mohamed Sakher el-Materi, in his beachfront home in Hammamet. There was "staff everywhere" and "ancient artifacts everywhere: Roman columns, frescoes and even a lion's head from which water pours into the pool," the cable said. The dinner included a dozen dishes, including ice cream and yogurt flown in from St. Tropez on the French Riviera.
"El Materi has a large tiger ('Pasha') on his compound, living in a cage," the ambassador reported. "He acquired it when it was a few weeks old. The tiger consumes four chickens a day. (Comment: The situation reminded the ambassador of Uday Hussein's lion cage in Baghdad.)," the cable added, referring to a son of Saddam Hussein.
The ambassador called the opulence of the evening "over the top," saying that his hosts' "behavior make clear why they and other members of Ben Ali's family are disliked and even hated by some Tunisians."
"The excesses of the Ben Ali family are growing," he added.
Some cables report how the "quasi mafia" of the country's ruling family muscled its way into the management of Tunisia's most profitable bank and how Mr. Ben Ali demanded a 50 percent share of a private university.
Others, however, make it clear just how much United States officials, preoccupied with the threat of terrorism in many other Muslim countries, valued Mr. Ben Ali's cooperation and ability to maintain order.
An upbeat August 2008 cable giving Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, a survey of Tunisia before a visit reported that "Tunisia styles itself 'a country that works' ." The writer added, "While Tunisians grumble privately about corruption by the first lady's family, there is an abiding appreciation for Ben Ali's success in steering his country clear of the instability and violence that have plagued Tunisia's neighbors."
The cable reported not only Tunisia's successes against terrorists but also its progressive social ways, calling it "a model for the region on women's rights."
Tunisian activists associated with the independent blog Nawaat.org (the core, in Arabic) created the TuniLeaks site on Nov. 28, the same day WikiLeaks, along with The New York Times and other news organizations, began posting the first of 251,287 confidential diplomatic cables the organization had obtained.
The Tunisian government subsequently tried to block access to the site, but the striking details of the cables circulated on Tunisian Web sites, adding to the ferment against Mr. Ben Ali.
On its Twitter feed, WikiLeaks has highlighted reports of its reported role in encouraging the Tunisian uprising. Foreign Policy magazine tagged the end of Mr. Ben Ali's rule "the first WikiLeaks revolution," and while that may be an overstatement, the cables' role in what President Obama lauded Friday as "this brave and determined struggle for the universal rights" underscores the awkward dilemma the WikiLeaks cables have posed for the administration.
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has been pressing an "Internet Freedom" initiative, emphasizing the power of the Web to expose injustice and promote democracy. But at the same time, the Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation of WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, including using subpoenas to try to obtain the private Internet activity, credit card numbers and bank account details of Mr. Assange and his associates.

Full text: Get ready for more theater on Capitol Hill. House Republicans plan to push through legislation this week to repeal the health care reform law.
In deference to the new vows of civility, the tone of the debate may be a bit more restrained. But Republicans have already said that they will not strip the word "killing" from the bill -- which is titled, "Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act." Civility apparently goes only so far.
While repeal will certainly pass the House, it has no chance in the Senate. So House Republicans are already planning other ways to undermine the reforms, like denying agencies enough money to hire personnel to carry out the program.
Americans will pay a high price if opponents get their way. Reform means that tens of millions of uninsured people will get a chance at security; and many millions more who have coverage can be sure they can keep or replace it, even if they get sick or lose their jobs.
Repeal would also take away the best chance for reining in rising health care costs -- and the government's relentlessly rising Medicare burden.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the reform law would drive up the deficit by $230 billion over the first decade and much more in later years.
For all his claims of fiscal rectitude, John Boehner, the House speaker, immediately dismissed the budget experts' report as "their opinion." In a particularly cynical move, Mr. Boehner and his new team have exempted the repeal bill from their own rule that any increase in spending be offset by cuts in other programs.
Many individuals and businesses are already benefiting from reform, and they will benefit even more once it goes into full effect in 2014.
Thanks to reform, it is now illegal for insurance companies to deny children coverage because they have pre-existing medical conditions, or to rescind a policy after a person becomes sick, or to cap the amount that insurers will pay for medical care over a lifetime. After 2014, it will be illegal for insurers to set annual limits on the amount they will pay for medical care or deny coverage to adults with pre-existing conditions.
Young people are now allowed to remain on their parents' policies until age 26. And insurers are now required to cover preventive care in new policies without cost-sharing, and to spend at least 80 percent of their premium income on medical care and quality improvements, not profits or administrative costs. Repeal would eliminate all of these new protections.
Repeal would also eliminate federal tax credits that are helping small businesses provide coverage to employees as well as a reinsurance program that is helping more than 4,700 employers, large and small, provide health coverage to early retirees.
Republicans are getting considerable traction with their claims that the reform law will drive up the price of insurance, and some are blaming the law for recent premium increases primarily caused by medical inflation. Once again, the official analysts and other experts disagree.
In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that repeal would cause premiums for coverage obtained through large employers to rise by a bit in future years, while premiums at small employers, on average, would be little affected. Projected premiums for people who buy their own policies would come down somewhat with repeal, mostly because the policies would provide skimpier coverage than required under reform. Many people in this group would end up paying more out of their own pockets for health insurance, because they would not get the subsidies provided under the reform law.
Until now, the Republicans have dominated this debate with scare tactics and posturing. Democratic political leaders say they are finally ready to mount a vigorous campaign arguing the case for reform. They should be prepared for a long fight.

Abstract: Some economists said that they expected a reduction in payroll taxes in 2011, under a new tax deal, could help consumption but they questioned how far that would go to sustain the upward trend in 2011 as a weak job market continued to pose a challenge. When taken together with the consumer price report, December's retail sales suggested that real consumption accelerated to its strongest quarter for four years, according to a research note from Capital Economics.

Full text: Retail sales rose in December, contributing to a quarter of stronger consumer spending during the holiday shopping season, economists and government reports said on Friday.
The Department of Commerce said that sales in December were helped by big gains in vehicles and furniture, and seasonally adjusted, were up 0.6 percent from the previous month. That was slightly less than the 0.8 percent forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Still, last month's retail sales were nearly 8 percent higher than December a year ago, while the fourth quarter figure rose 7.8 percent. For all of 2010, retail sales added 6.6 percent, the largest yearly gain since 1999.
"It was clearly a step up in growth in consumer spending for the quarter," the chief economist at MF Global, James O'Sullivan, said. Personal consumption was up as much as 4 percent in the last three months of 2010, economists said, the strongest quarter since 2006.
While the numbers were signs of a slowly improving economy, economists noted that the recovery was still not on solid ground. Reports on Friday for consumer prices and industrial production showed the tentativeness of the improvements.
Steve Blitz, the senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said most consumers "are still negatively impacted by too much debt, too little employment, and poor income growth, and therefore remain hunkered down as far as spending is concerned."
Another measure of retail sales that excludes automobile sales, gasoline and building materials showed a modest 0.2 percent rise in December, although that category was up nearly 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter. The figures suggest that retailers bolstered sales in October and November by using discounts, which shifted purchases forward. That, and the unusually cold weather, cut into December sales, economists said.
"Once we get January numbers and see the pick-up from sales lost due to weather, we will have a more complete picture of the holiday season," Mr. Blitz said. "Over all, however, retail sales are better and recovering but far from recovered."
Many retailers reported that their sales slowed in the latter part of the fourth quarter, and analysts said that was partly because of the weather. On Friday, the toy manufacturer Hasbro said its fourth-quarter sales were now expected to bring in $1.3 billion compared with $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009.
"We no longer believe we will grow revenues for the year due to a slowdown in U.S. consumer demand, which we experienced late in the fourth quarter," Hasbro's chief executive, Brian Goldner, said in a statement.
Consumer sentiment had been expected to improve, at least according to one gauge. Economists had envisioned an improvement to 75.5 in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, but instead it showed a decline to 72.7 this month, which some economists said could have been attributed to higher energy prices.
But the retail statistics, although softer than forecasts, were seen as vibrant enough to suggest that consumption in the fourth quarter of 2010, while not as robust as previously thought, would contribute to gross domestic product. Economists from Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Friday that they expected that the economy grew 3 percent in the last quarter of 2010.
Some economists said that they expected a reduction in payroll taxes in 2011, under a new tax deal, could help consumption but they questioned how far that would go to sustain the upward trend in 2011 as a weak job market continued to pose a challenge.
"Disposable incomes are going to get a bump because of payroll taxes, which might help in the first quarter," said Paul Ashworth, the chief United States economist for Capital Economics. "But overall income growth depends on what happens in the labor market, and we still have weak employment growth."
When taken together with the consumer price report, December's retail sales suggested that real consumption accelerated to its strongest quarter for four years, according to a research note from Capital Economics.
The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent last month, driven by an 8.5 percent rise in energy prices, according to the government statistics released on Friday. The increase topped expectations.
It was the largest rise in prices since June 2009. Consumer prices are now up an annualized 1.5 percent, the figures show. The core C.P.I., excluding food and energy, rose 0.1 percent. While rents accelerated, economists do not expect increases to be sufficient to build to a troubling level of inflation this year.
"The trend in inflation has been down," Mr. Sullivan said. "I think the net result is we may have seen the end of deceleration."
The Federal Reserve, which has set an unofficial goal of 2 percent inflation, reported on Friday that industrial production rose in December by the largest amount in five months. Manufacturing, utilities and mining sectors advanced in December, including revisions, pushing the country's overall industrial production up 0.8 percent in December, and nearly 6 percent in the year.
The monthly rise was slightly higher than forecast, with utilities output showing a notable rise because of adverse weather in December. Major manufacturing output was up 0.4 percent with the exception of vehicles and construction supplies.
The Federal Reserve statistics showed there was still excess capacity in manufacturing.
"The recovery is still moving forward, but there is little evidence here of any pending acceleration in the nation's overall output growth," said Brian Bethune, the chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight.
Thomas J. Duesterberg, the president and chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance, said some areas of the manufacturing sector could rebound in 2011, including vehicles, which could partly be helped by an aging car fleet, and energy equipment, for which global demand was accelerating and the United States had an advantage.

Full text: If you're considering taking out a jumbo mortgage, now may be a good time to get the loan.
According to data released last week from LendingTree, the difference in price between a conforming 30-year fixed mortgage and a jumbo mortgage for a higher amount was recently at around 60 basis points. (A basis point is one one-hundreth of a percentage point.)
That means that, for example, if you'd pay 5.0 percent for a smaller, conforming loan, a jumbo loan would be 5.60 percent. That's the smallest spread level relative to conforming 30-year fixed loans since mid-2007.
Technically, according to Keith Gumbinger, vice president of HSH.com, a "jumbo" mortgage is one with a loan amount above that which can be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those two entities can buy only "conforming" loans. Such conforming loans carry certain credit, documentation and insurance requirements, among other factors.
In most parts of the country, he said, a conforming loan can be no larger than $417,000. But the limit is higher, and can run as high as $729,750, for a so-called conforming jumbo mortgage or "expanded conforming" loan, which is available in 71 high-cost marketplaces around the country.
This is in contrast to a nonconforming jumbo mortgage, which would be a loan for a higher amount than the local conforming limit. And that is the type of loan whose premium over conforming 30-year fixed loans has shrunk, according to LendingTree.
If you live in one of the high-cost marketplaces and have a good credit score, you could get three different rates depending on how big your mortgage is; elsewhere, you could get two different rates. Regardless of where you are, the narrower premium means that now is a particularly good time to get the higher-amount loan since its rate is closer to the lower end than it has been in a while.
"Now is probably a really good time to start looking at jumbo rates if you are somebody who has been shopping for a jumbo mortgage," said Cameron Findlay, LendingTree chief economist, who attributed to the narrowing spread to lenders viewing the default rates in the higher-loan brackets as improving or less risky than in the lower-loan sector.
According to LendingTree's data from loan rates available from its network of lenders, the rate for a $417,000 conforming 30-year fixed mortgage with certain lock terms (a 30-day forward rate lock) was recently 4.89 percent. In contrast, the rate for a $729,750 mortgage with the same lock terms was recently 5.49 percent, or 60 basis points higher.
According to Mr. Findlay, the spread between conforming 30-year fixed loans and conforming jumbo loans was as narrow as 30 basis points in the early part of 2007 and expanded all the way up to around 190 basis points by the end of 2008.
Since reaching a peak at the end of 2008, the spread has been declining since then but Mr. Findlay said it was unlikely to go back down to 30 basis points unless the private market started buying mortgages again.
In fact, he said the spread was more likely to widen going forward and as of Monday, it had widened slightly to 69 basis points, the lowest level since April 2010.
"I wouldn't be too shocked to see them expand a little more, meaning jumbos will become a little more expensive over the course of the next couple months," he said, noting that there is little confirming evidence (such as additional liquidity in the market) for why jumbos should be as low as they are relative to conforming mortgages.
According to Mr. Gumbinger of HSH.com, the spread has been in the range of the mid-to-upper 60 basis points recently, "among the narrowest gaps since the onset of the crisis" except for a few weeks in April 2010.
He also similarly predicted that rates for mortgages of all kinds, including jumbos, would most likely be higher in 2011. He attributed this largely to "an improving economy, coupled with some concerns about future inflation (not to mention the still-palpable risks of investing in residential mortgages)," he said.
He also added that "like conforming loans, jumbo prices have recently visited (and exited) record-low territory, and absent a new fiscal catastrophe, probably won't revisit them anytime soon."
Have you recently, or are you considering, taking out a jumbo mortgage? Why or why not?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

South Korea Raises Rates As Inflation Stirs Concern

Full text: HONG KONG -- South Korea unexpectedly raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point Thursday and announced measures intended to curb rising prices, the latest sign that policy makers in Asia and other emerging markets were increasingly concerned about inflation.
While prices in the United States, Japan and the euro zone have been creeping up slowly, inflation in many developing nations has risen rapidly alongside overall economic growth. Climbing commodity prices -- in recent weeks, crude oil prices have increased to more than $90, the highest level since October 2008 -- and adverse weather have helped drive prices up in some areas.
For example, India reported Thursday that a crucial index measuring prices had risen 16.9 percent in the week ending Jan. 1 from the level of a year earlier, while in China, the latest available data showed that consumer prices in November were 5.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
In South Korea, consumer prices rose 3.5 percent in December from the level of a year earlier, driven by price increases in petroleum and farm products, and the central bank said Thursday that it expected inflation pressures to mount in coming months.
Double-digit price increases like those in India are the exception, and many economists argue that inflation remains manageable in many countries.
Still, food price inflation in particular is a sensitive issue in developing nations, where many people's incomes go directly to necessities like cooking oil, vegetables and other foodstuffs.
As a result, many emerging nations have started to nudge interest rates back toward precrisis levels and have instituted other measures meant to tamp down prices. South Korea's latest action -- its third rate increase since mid-2010 -- takes the country's key seven-day repurchase rate to 2.75 percent.
After an economic policy meeting Thursday, President Lee Myung-bak said the government would watch to make sure that prices for gasoline and other oil products were "at an appropriate level." In recent months, gasoline prices in South Korea have jumped to an average of $1.69 a liter, or $6.40 a gallon.
The government also announced a six-month freeze on charges for various utilities, including gas and electricity, and requested that colleges and universities not increase tuition this year.
The Bank of Korea's decision to raise rates on Thursday surprised many economists, who had not expected another increase until later in the year.
Still, many project that rates will gradually rise further in South Korea and other fast-growing economies as policy makers strive to battle higher prices.
"Inflation is on the rise, in Korea as elsewhere," Kim Song-yi, an economist at HSBC in Seoul, wrote in a note on Thursday, adding that the central bank's "pro-active stance" was a "good thing."
Thailand nudged up its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25 percent Wednesday, adding to similar moves in recent months, while China has raised rates twice recently and restricted lending by state-controlled banks, actions aimed at slowing its economy's breakneck growth.

Full text: JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, faces a luxury problem. The bank, which reports earnings on Friday, predicts it will generate up to $50 billion in excess capital over the next three years. The question is what should Mr. Dimon do with this windfall.
He already hopes to reinstate the dividend and may buy back shares, if regulators allow. But the veteran deal maker must be sorely tempted to go on a spending spree. Analysts are already talking up the benefits of acquisitions. Holding fire makes more sense.
The obvious target at home is Atlanta's SunTrust. The lender's Florida, Georgia and South Carolina branches would fill JPMorgan's remaining domestic retail banking hole. And JPMorgan could scoop it up and still remain under the cap forbidding banks from buying their way above a 10 percent share of deposits.
But a deal wouldn't be easy. JPMorgan would probably have to write down a big chunk of SunTrust's loan book, particularly commercial real estate, which would argue for paying a discount to SunTrust's current $14 billion market cap. That's what M&T Bank did when it bought Wilmington Trust at a 45 percent discount.
But SunTrust's financials are improving -- it posted a profit in the third quarter after a run of losses -- so the board would naturally be loath to sell on the cheap without regulators forcing its hand. And SunTrust still holds $4.9 billion of government capital from the Troubled Asset Relief Program that JPMorgan's owners would have to assume.
Moreover, it may not be the best use of capital. Retail banking is hardly a fast-growing business in the United States. Scoping out investment opportunities abroad may be better. Mr. Dimon is bulking up the firm's international businesses, last year promoting Heidi Miller to oversee its expansion of services to corporations around the world.
But there's no need to rush. Europe's fiscal woes have probably heightened the appeal of shifting business to JPMorgan's solid balance sheet already. The longer the Continent's crisis continues, the more chance there is it will throw up some good bank assets at bargain prices -- and not just in Europe. Spanish banks, for example, have some juicy assets in Mexico and Latin America.
For now, at least, patience may be Mr. Dimon's best path to pleasing shareholders.
Rate-Setting Hawks
Are hawks with votes more likely to get their way? This year's voting members of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee include three forming a stronger hawkish group than last year's lonely Thomas M. Hoenig. Rocking the boat on the current round of quantitative easing is unlikely. But their differences with Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, may emerge on interest rates.
The 11 Fed presidents from outside New York rotate onto the committee four at a time, while the others still attend meetings even though they can't vote. Though policy decisions are led by Mr. Bernanke and the other most important voices are the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, and the Fed vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, changes in the voting group can change the tone.
Mr. Hoenig, the Kansas City Fed boss, was the one member favoring less expansive monetary policy strongly enough to record his dissent publicly at every rate-setting meeting in 2010.
This year, Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas and Narayana R. Kocherlakota of Minneapolis have votes. Mr. Plosser and Mr. Fisher have indicated their preference for tighter monetary policy, while Mr. Kocherlakota's views seem to incline that way, too. The Philadelphia and Dallas representatives have, however, both indicated that they will probably not oppose the controversial bond purchasing program already in place -- known colloquially as QE2 -- although they want regular reviews before its scheduled expiration in June. Indeed, a sudden halt to such purchases, now priced into the bond market, could prove highly disruptive.
However, Mr. Plosser and Mr. Fisher have indicated that they would prefer rates above current levels -- to improve incentives for saving and to lessen the danger of inflation -- and they don't think a moderate rise in rates would hurt economic activity. Mr. Fisher has repeatedly proposed a rise in the Fed's discount rate, at which funds are lent to member banks. The committee next meets on Jan. 25-26. It's unlikely the new voting members will convert Mr. Bernanke. But if sharper private debate translates into public dissent, it's on interest rates that the new hawks may choose to show more talon.

Full text: WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States economy ended last year on an encouraging note, with all parts of the country showing improvements, according to the latest Federal Reserve survey.
Factories produced more, shoppers spent more and companies hired more, all of which pointed to a stronger economy in 2011, the Fed reported in its survey of nationwide economic conditions, which was released on Wednesday.
Still, risks loom. Declining home prices and millions of foreclosures are depressing housing markets around the country, the survey said.
Companies are also paying more for materials, including oil, food products, steel, textiles and chemicals, the survey noted. However, competitive pressures prevented the companies from passing those increased costs on to customers with higher prices.
And even though employers are slowly hiring more, workers lack bargaining power to win bigger paychecks because of high unemployment.
Price increases remained tame. The Fed will monitor inflation as it reviews its $600 billion Treasury bond-buying program, which is intended to bolster the economy by lowering interest rates, encouraging spending and lifting stock prices.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has been optimistic that the economy will strengthen this year, but warned last week that it would take up to five years for unemployment, now at 9.4 percent, to drop to a historically normal level of around 6 percent.
The bond-buying program will come under scrutiny at the Fed's first meeting of 2011, on Jan. 25 and 26. Four regional Fed presidents become voting members of the its policy-making group at that meeting. Two of them -- Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia -- have voiced concerns that the bond-buying program could spur inflation.
Mr. Fisher and Mr. Plosser have reputations for being "inflation hawks," meaning they are more concerned about the prospects of rising inflation than they are about high unemployment. Both men are likely to put pressure on Mr. Bernanke to scale back the $600 billion program, especially later this year if the economy continues to gain momentum as expected.
The Fed indicated there would be a high hurdle to changing the program, according to minutes from its Dec. 14 meeting. Mr. Bernanke offered no signals that any changes would be forthcoming when he testified before Congress last Friday.
The Fed survey also said:

Hiring was firming, and businesses in most regions planned to increase hiring at the same or faster rate this year.

Retailers across all regions experienced better-than-expected sales after a strong holiday shopping season.

Factories across the country increased production, with demand growing for cars and high-tech equipment.

Businesses said they no longer feared there would be a double-dip recession. In a summer survey, many expressed concerns of a second downturn.
Economists have said that a tax-cut package signed into law last month should encourage people and businesses to spend more this year, leading, in turn, to more hiring.
Mr. Bernanke has warned Congress and the White House to refrain from big spending cuts or tax increases in the near term because the economy is still fragile. But he has urged them to come up with a plan now to reduce the budget deficit over the long run.
The government ran a budget deficit of $80 billion last month, down from a year earlier, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday. Still, economists predict the government will run up a deficit of about $1.3 trillion in the current fiscal year. That would be the third consecutive year of deficits exceeding $1 trillion.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Wednesday suggested a fresh start in relations between the United States and China, aimed at mutually beneficial economic growth.
In a speech at Johns Hopkins University, one week before the state visit of China's president, Hu Jintao, Mr. Geithner said the two countries would benefit by being more than rivals.
"We have a great deal invested in each other's success," Mr. Geithner said.
His main points -- that China should reduce the government's control of the economy, lower barriers to imports from the United States, crack down on the pilfering of American technology and stop holding down the value of its currency -- were nothing new.
But Mr. Geithner, in a tone that alternated between deference and feistiness, outlined two main objectives: expanding opportunities for American companies to sell to the Chinese, and shifting the emphasis in China from exports to domestic consumption and investment as the basis for the nation's growth.
China's management of its exchange rate, and its restrictions on capital flows in and out of China, "have the effect of keeping the Chinese currency substantially undervalued," imposing burdens on other emerging economies that allow their currencies to float, Mr. Geithner said. He added, "This is not a tenable policy for China or for the world economy."
Since June, when China pledged to allow its currency, the renminbi, to move more freely, it has appreciated by about 3 percent against the dollar in nominal terms, or an annualized rate of about 6 percent, though the appreciation is greater in real terms because inflation in China is higher than in the United States.
Failure to allow more rapid appreciation could accelerate inflation in China, lead to asset price bubbles and undermine the rebalancing of the Chinese economy, Mr. Geithner said.
The United States is willing to grant China more access to American-made high-technology products and to expand trade and investment opportunities in the United States -- top priorities for the Chinese -- "but our ability to move on these issues will depend on how much progress we see from China," he added.
The speech, at the university's School for Advanced International Studies, where Mr. Geithner received a master's degree in 1985, was intended to signal that economic and strategic considerations were expected to equally share the agenda during the visit next week.
It was sandwiched between a visit to Beijing on Tuesday by Robert M. Gates, the defense secretary, and an address scheduled for Friday by Hillary Rodham Clinton, the secretary of state, events that highlight the political and strategic tensions. Mr. Gates's appeals for a closer military dialogue between the two powers were overshadowed by a test flight of a new Chinese stealth fighter, and Mrs. Clinton is expected to outline strategic priorities, notably how to handle North Korea.
Elizabeth C. Economy, director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Geithner's speech "smart and to the point" after reading it.
"Too often in the U.S.-China relationship, it appears as though the United States gives and hopes that China will give back," she said. "I think Secretary Geithner is making it clear that those days are over."
All the same, Mr. Geithner did not leave Washington unscathed, saying it was imperative for the government to invest more in education, infrastructure and research and development, and for it to improve the incentives for business investment and to "restore fiscal responsibility."
Margaret M. Pearson, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, said that theme was likely to go over well. "The Chinese love it when we talk about our own problems and do not focus just on them," she said.
William J. Norris, a political scientist at the Princeton-Harvard China and the World Program, said the financial crisis "has been interpreted in China as evidence that the Western model of liberalization, with less of a role for the government in managing the economy, has been discredited."
He said of President Obama and President Hu: "Both want to move the relationship forward, but both are facing increasing domestic pressure to take a tougher line vis-a-vis the other country."
China's government is not a monolith, and scholars say the ruling Communist regime has been torn between powerful export interests, who favor a managed exchange rate and measures to promote Chinese industry, and economic reformers, who see greater market flexibility and stronger enforcement of trade and intellectual property rules as the way to advance the Chinese economy over the long run.
"The compromise for now is that much state spending accompanies gradual market liberalization," said Peter A. Petri, who teaches finance at the International Business School of Brandeis University. "This will work as long as the Chinese don't feel too threatened by the U.S. and the economy stays reasonably strong. The Geithner speech will help the good guys."
China has already taken steps to combat the theft of intellectual property and discrimination against foreign firms, and to expand public spending on health care and education so that Chinese consumers do not feel compelled to save so much -- actions that Mr. Geithner cautiously praised.

Full text: WASHINGTON
When China's president, Hu Jintao, visits here next week, the exchange rate between Chinese and American currency will inevitably become a big topic of conversation.
China has been holding down the value of its currency, the renminbi, for years, making Chinese exports to the United States cheaper and American exports to China more expensive. The renminbi's recent rise has been too modest to change the situation, and Mr. Hu's state visit is sure to highlight the real tensions between the countries.
Yet the focus on the currency has nonetheless become excessive. The truth is that the exchange rate is not the main problem for American companies hoping to sell more products in China and, in the process, create more jobs in this country. The exchange rate does not need to be the focus of next week's meetings.
For the United States, the No. 1 problem with China's economy is probably intellectual property theft. Technology companies, for example, continue to notice Chinese government agencies downloading software updates for programs they have never bought, at least not legally.
No wonder China has become the world's second-largest market for computer hardware sales -- but is only the eighth-largest for software sales.
Next on the list, say people who work in China or do business there, is the myriad protectionist barriers China has put up. These barriers make this country's recent efforts at "buy American" protectionism look minor league. In some cases, Beijing has insisted that products sold in China must not only be made there but be conceived and designed there. The policy goes by the name "indigenous innovation."
The renminbi certainly matters, too. It affects the price of every American product sold there and every Chinese product sold here. But discussion of the renminbi typically ends up exaggerating the problem somewhat by relying on an imperfect measure.
The most relevant comparison of two currencies is one that is adjusted for inflation in the two countries. When inflation is higher in one country, as in China today, it means that country's products are becoming more expensive -- and imports into the country become relatively cheaper. In effect, the real price of Chinese-made goods is rising faster than the exchange rate suggests.
Without taking inflation into account, the renminbi has risen 3 percent against the dollar since last summer, when China began letting it rise. Once inflation is accounted for, the real increase has been about 5 percent. At that pace, the renminbi could erase its artificial undervaluation -- as some economists estimate it -- in less than two years.
Of course, one reason for the rise is the political pressure from the United States and other countries. As much as China's Communist Party leaders may claim otherwise, they really do respond to international lobbying sometimes.
The obvious question now is how the Obama administration can apply similar pressure on intellectual property theft and trade barriers. Arthur Kroeber, a Beijing-based consultant and editor of the China Economic Quarterly, goes so far as to call the currency discussion a distraction. "What exactly there is to be gained by quibbling over a point or two in the annual appreciation rate," Mr. Kroeber says, "is beyond me."
The best hope for getting another country's leaders to do anything is to persuade them that it's in their interest. That task is not so easy with trade barriers, because every time an American company is kept from making a sale in China, a Chinese company presumably benefits. It makes the sale instead or, in the case of piracy, it saves money that it would have spent on the authentic product.
Still, China's leaders have reason to be nervous about all the barriers they have built. China's elite, in government and business, are deeply concerned that their companies remain unable to create truly innovative products. The obsession with the fact that no Chinese citizen has won a scientific Nobel Prize stems partly from this worry.
Opening up your economy to more competition may bring some short-term pain, but it also forces companies to become stronger and more creative -- or to wither. Competition breeds innovation.
This self-interest argument is the one that Mr. Obama and his advisers are most comfortable making. They worry that outright pressure on China will put it on the defensive and ultimately backfire. Sometimes, they may worry too much. Pressure clearly can work, as the last few months have demonstrated.
The United States should be able to round up some allies on these issues, just as it has with recent military matters relating to China. BASF and Siemens, two big German companies, have already complained about Chinese protectionism, as have some European leaders. Other countries also have reason to be frustrated with the exchange rate: relative to many currencies other than the dollar, the renminbi has actually lost value in recent months.
But even by itself, the United States is big enough -- and important enough to Chinese companies -- to exert some pressure. That is why the recent "buy American" provisions in a couple of bills, small as they may be, are useful. The same goes for continued discussion of Congressional bills that would penalize China.
If anything, the Republican takeover of the House offers a new chance to hold hearings on those bills. Representative Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who will become chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has been a vocal critic of China's protectionism.
Finally, both Republicans and Democrats can use Mr. Hu's coming visit to emphasize -- to him and to the many Chinese citizens who will be following -- just how frustrated many Americans are with the economy's woes. As the scholar Zhang Guoqing wrote in a Chinese newspaper recently, "A high unemployment rate and the trouble in stimulating the economy" are helping to create "enormous hidden dangers" in the United States.
One of those dangers is the possibility that American politicians will eventually decide that tough talk isn't enough to satisfy voters' anger. If that day comes, the United States and China could end up in a trade war that only worsens the situation for both countries.

Rising Chinese Inflation to Show Up in U.S. Imports

Abstract: Victor Fung, the group chairman of Li & Fung in Hong Kong, a 35,000-employee trading company that supplies most of the world's big retailers with Asian goods, said that contracts signed late last year would produce a jump of 10 to 20 percent in the import prices of consumer goods arriving at American ports by the second quarter of this year. A holdover from the days of central planning, the Chinese consumer price index includes apartment rents but excludes soaring costs for owner-occupied housing.

Full text: BEIJING -- When garment buyers from New York show up next month at China's annual trade shows to bargain over next autumn's fashions, many will face sticker shock.
"They're going to go home with 35 percent less product than for the same dollars as last year," particularly for fur coats and cotton sportswear, said Bennett Model, chief executive of Cassin, a Manhattan-based line of designer clothing. "The consumer will definitely see the price rise."
Inflation has arrived in China. And after Tuesday's release of crucial financial statistics by China's central bank, few economists expect Beijing officials to be able to tame rising prices any time soon.
While American importers of Chinese goods will feel the squeeze, the effect on American consumers may be more subtle and the overall impact on United States inflation may be minimal.
There are simply too many other markups along the way -- from transportation to salesclerks' wages -- that affect the American retail prices of Chinese-made products. Excluding those markups, imports from China are equal to little more than 2 percent of the overall American economy.
The bigger consumer impact is in China itself. As China's booming economy enables more of its own citizens to buy the goods pouring out of its factories, Chinese consumers are feeling inflation directly. And Beijing is increasingly worried about the social unrest that could result.
In China, consumer prices were 5.1 percent higher in November than a year earlier, according to official government data. And many economists say the official figures actually understate the rate of inflation, which might in reality be twice as high.
"Four percent, China can bear it -- beyond 5 percent, people will complain a lot," said Huo Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation here.
Higher global commodity prices, as well as rising wages in China, play roles in the increasing cost of Chinese goods. But economists say the main reason for the inflation now is China's foreign exchange reserves, which surged by a record amount in the fourth quarter.
The central bank has been pumping out currency at an ever-accelerating pace over the past decade to limit the renminbi's appreciation against the dollar. That strategy has helped preserve a competitive advantage of Chinese exporters by keeping their prices relatively low on global markets -- while also protecting the jobs of tens of millions of Chinese workers in export factories.
Now, though, that cheap currency policy seems to be reaching its limits. The extra renminbi are feeding inflation. That is starting to undermine exporters' price competitiveness -- just as a stronger renminbi would do if Beijing was not intervening to begin with.
Money supply figures for December, which the central bank released on Tuesday, showed that cash and bank deposits were increasing at a rate twice as fast as even China's soaring economy. Ever more renminbi are available to buy goods and services.
Victor Fung, the group chairman of Li & Fung in Hong Kong, a 35,000-employee trading company that supplies most of the world's big retailers with Asian goods, said that contracts signed late last year would produce a jump of 10 to 20 percent in the import prices of consumer goods arriving at American ports by the second quarter of this year.
"By the middle of this year, you'll see considerable diversion of trade away from China," which will start to bring down the United States trade deficit with China, Mr. Fung said in an interview.
But there are only limited alternatives to China as a supplier of cheap goods. As American retail chains scramble to shift orders to other countries like Bangladesh and the Philippines, they are finding that inflation is emerging as an issue across much of Asia.
What is more, the far smaller factories in other Asian countries have little capacity to absorb the huge orders that Chinese factories routinely handle, corporate executives and economists said.
In China, there is little question that the consumer price index understates the true extent of inflation.
A holdover from the days of central planning, the Chinese consumer price index includes apartment rents but excludes soaring costs for owner-occupied housing. And it is based heavily on the prices of an outdated list of consumer products that are no longer popular. Garments qualify for inclusion only once they have been on sale continuously for at least six months, for example, which frequently means that they are no longer in style.
Hu Xingdou, an economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said that a more accurate gauge of inflation would show consumer prices rising 10 percent a year. The National Bureau of Statistics has said it is actively studying ways to improve the consumer price index.
Inflation in China is not just the result of China's currency market intervention, although Mr. Hu and other economists describe it as the biggest single cause. Another cause is aggressive lending by Chinese banks, despite repeated demands by regulators to slow things down.
Rising prices for exports are also caused by wage increases for Chinese blue-collar workers, whose pay has been climbing as much as 15 percent a year. Those workers have more clout than they once did because the supply of factory labor from rural areas, which once seemed inexhaustible, is starting to dry up -- a result of three decades of China's "one child" policy of family planning, as well as a big expansion in university enrollment.
And globally, strong demand from consumers in China and other emerging economies is pushing up not only gasoline prices, but also the prices of cashmere, rabbit fur, cotton, copper and many other commodities.
Candy Chen, the sales manager of the Zhenjiang Weishun Toys Company in Zhenjiang, China, said that the cost of plastic stuffing for the company's toy animals had nearly doubled in the past year, while wages were up 10 to 15 percent.
The effect of higher prices in China on broad measures of American inflation is far from clear. The rule of thumb for many consumer products, from shoes to garments to toys, is that the import price is only a quarter to two-fifths of the final retail price, which also includes transportation within the United States and the wages, rent, electricity bills and other costs incurred by stores.
After showing little change for nearly two years, import prices for goods arriving from China at American docks rose from September to November at a rate equivalent to an annual rise of 3.6 percent.
In another indicator that the Chinese central bank released Tuesday, China's foreign reserves leaped by $199 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase was much larger than economists had expected, and they suggested that China had roughly doubled its intervention in currency markets to around $2 billion a day.
China's reserves, at $2.85 trillion, dwarf those of the world's second-largest holder, Japan, with $1.04 trillion. The United States, by contrast, holds only $46.4 billion of foreign reserves because it prints dollars, the main reserve currency.
Mr. Model of Cassin, who is visiting Beijing this week from his company headquarters just off Seventh Avenue, said that the world had changed and that Chinese manufacturers were now more interested in catering to their domestic market than in offering rock-bottom prices to big American companies.
"All of a sudden, they're more interested in selling domestically," he said. "The American wholesaler will fight them on $5. The domestic retailer doesn't care as much."

Full text: Deep inside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the $600 billion man is fast at work.
In a spare, government-issue office in Lower Manhattan, behind a bank of cubicles and a scruffy copy machine, Josh Frost and a band of market specialists are making the Fed's ultimate Wall Street trade. They are buying hundreds of billions of dollars of United States Treasury securities on the open market in a controversial attempt to keep interest rates low and, in the process, revive the economy.
To critics, it is a Hail Mary play -- an admission that the economy's persistent weakness has all but exhausted the central bank's powers and tested the limits of its policy making. Around the world, some warn the unusual strategy will weaken the dollar and lead to crippling inflation.
But inside the Operations Room, on the ninth floor of the New York Fed's fortresslike headquarters, there is no time for second-guessing. Here the second round of what is known as quantitative easing -- QE2, as it is called on Wall Street -- is being put into practice almost daily by the central bank's powerful New York arm.
Each morning Mr. Frost and his team face a formidable task: they must try to buy Treasuries at the best possible price from the savviest bond traders in the business.
The smallest miscalculation, a few one-hundredths of a percentage point here or there, could unsettle the markets and cost taxpayers dearly. It could also embolden critics at home and abroad who say QE2 represents a dangerous expansion of the Fed's role in the markets.
"We are looking to get the best price we can for the taxpayer," said Mr. Frost, a buttoned-down 34-year-old in a striped suit and rimless glasses.
Whether Mr. Frost will reach that goal is uncertain. What is sure is that market interest rates have risen, rather than fallen, since the Fed embarked on the program in November. That is the opposite of what was supposed to happen, although rates might have been even higher without the Fed program.
Mr. Frost's task is to avoid paying top dollar for bonds that could be worth less when the Fed tries to sell them one day.
Louis V. Crandall, the chief economist at the research firm Wrightson ICAP, said Wall Street bond traders were driving hard bargains. The Fed has tipped its hand by laying out which Treasuries it intends to buy and when, giving the bond houses an edge.
"A buyer of $100 billion a month is always going to be paying top prices," Mr. Crandall said of the Fed. "You can't be a known buyer of $100 billion a month and get a good price."
Nevertheless, Mr. Frost and his team have been praised on Wall Street for creating a simple, transparent program. Neither the Fed nor Wall Street wants any surprises. The central bank is even disclosing the prices at which it buys.
Mr. Frost and his team work out of a small, beige corner office with arched windows that used to be a library. There, at about 10:15 most workday mornings, one of them pushes a button on a computer. Across Wall Street, three musical notes -- an F, an E and a D -- sound on trading terminals, alerting traders that the Fed is in the market.
On one recent Tuesday morning, what Mr. Frost and his five young colleagues did over a 45-minute period might have unsettled even a seasoned Wall Street hand: they bought $7.8 billion of Treasuries.
Mr. Frost and his team drew up the daily schedule for what the Fed calls its Large-Scale Asset Purchase program. And that program is, by any measure, large scale: through next June, these traders will buy roughly $75 billion of Treasuries a month -- on top of another $30 billion it is reinvesting in Treasuries from its mortgage-related holdings.
But depending on daily market conditions, Mr. Frost can decide not to buy certain bonds if they are already in short supply.
As offers to sell Treasuries flash on a bank of trading screens, a computer algorithm works out which ones to accept. The computer compares the offers from Wall Street against market prices and the Fed's own calculation of what constitutes a "fair value" price.
The real work is done by three traders who are referred to during the operation as trader one, trader two and trader three. They sit at a long table against the wall, tapping at seven screens.
On one recent morning, trader one was Tiffany Wilding, 26. While she reviewed the stream of offers and then the prices finally accepted by the algorithm, trader two, Blake Gwinn, 29, double-checked her decisions and trader three, James White, 29, made a duplicate of everything in case the computers crashed.
All the while, Mr. Frost stood behind his colleagues, ready to intervene -- and even cancel the Fed's purchases -- at any sign of trouble.
They have their work cut out, trying to outwit the 18 investment firms that deal directly with the Fed. These so-called primary dealers -- the Goldmans and Morgans of the world -- employ some of the sharpest minds on Wall Street.
Mr. Frost -- a Rutgers math grad who has worked at the Fed for 12 years, lives in the Borough Hall area of Brooklyn and takes the subway each day to work -- is fairly well known within the dealer community. He and his team talk to the big banks most days.
The job carries great responsibility and is prominent within the Fed. But outside the Fed he and his colleagues are still seen more as staid central bankers doing a job, bankers say, not necessarily Wall Street hotshots likely to be snapped up by the likes of Goldman Sachs.
When devising the program, Mr. Frost and his team decided to focus most on buying Treasury notes with an average maturity of five to six years. That is because the yields on these notes have the biggest impact on interest rates for mortgage holders, consumers and companies issuing debt, and on banks' decisions to lend to businesses. Over the weeks and months of the program, his purchases should drive up the prices of these securities -- because they will be in greater demand -- and consequently push down their yields.
The trouble is, though yields fell sharply between August and November as the markets anticipated the new program, they have risen since it was formally announced in November, leaving many in the markets puzzled about the value of the Fed's bond-buying program.
Mr. Frost, and his boss, Brian P. Sack, insist the program has succeeded. Mr. Sack, 40, joined the Fed 18 months ago to run the entire markets group. He has a Ph.D. from M.I.T. and worked most recently for a Washington consulting firm. In 2004, he wrote a paper with Ben S. Bernanke, the future chairman of the Federal Reserve, and another economist about unconventional measures for stimulating the economy in extraordinary times -- just like large-scale purchases of Treasuries.
"We didn't know then that the Fed would be putting it to the test," he said.
He said the Obama administration's $858 billion tax compromise with Congressional Republicans in December complicated the macroeconomic picture.
But the biggest reason for the rise in interest rates was probably that the economy was, at last, growing faster. And that's good news.
"Rates have risen for the reasons we were hoping for: investors are more optimistic about the recovery," said Mr. Sack. "It is a good sign."

Full text: A Manhattan judge ruled Monday that the city may release performance rankings of thousands of teachers to the public, denying a request by the teachers union to keep the teachers' names confidential.
But the public is unlikely to see the rankings soon. The union, the United Federation of Teachers, said Monday that it would appeal the ruling, and lawyers for the city said the rankings would be withheld pending the outcome.
The rankings, known as Teacher Data Reports, grade more than 12,000 of the city's 80,000 public school teachers based on how much progress their students made on standardized tests. They were developed four years ago as a pilot program to improve instruction; this year they have become a factor in tenure decisions. Several news organizations, including The New York Times, have requested access to the data.
Because the rankings are based on limited snapshots of student work, many education experts caution against making them the sole or primary measure of teachers. In practice, the rankings of many teachers in the city have varied widely from year to year, and their performance generally falls within a broad range.
The city's Department of Education agrees that the rankings should not be used in isolation, but it has defended them as the best available quantitative measure of teacher performance, particularly for teachers who rank consistently high or low.
Some experts, however, like Daniel Koretz, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, question that assertion, noting that the rankings are based on state tests that have been marred by score inflation.
In her decision, the Manhattan judge, Cynthia S. Kern of State Supreme Court, wrote that the union had failed to prove that the city's decision to release the names was "arbitrary and capricious," the high bar for preventing their release under state disclosure laws.
"This information is of interest to parents, students, taxpayers and the public generally," Justice Kern wrote.
Jesse I. Levine, a lawyer for the city, said the court had "affirmed the city's belief that the public has a right to this information under New York's Freedom of Information Law."
"We are disappointed," the union president, Michael Mulgrew, said. "The reports, which are largely based on discredited state tests, have huge margins of error and are filled with inaccuracies, will only serve to mislead parents looking for real information."

Abstract: In the peak year of 2004, according to the group, which is an industrywide consortium of technology and entertainment companies, consumers spent about $21.8 billion to rent and buy DVDs, Blu-ray discs, digital downloads and other forms of home entertainment.

Full text: Probably the best thing about last week's dreary annual summary of home entertainment revenue from the Digital Entertainment Group is that the numbers weren't adjusted for inflation. That made the six-year tumble in cumulative spending on DVDs and other forms of home entertainment look only about half as bad as it really was.
In the peak year of 2004, according to the group, which is an industrywide consortium of technology and entertainment companies, consumers spent about $21.8 billion to rent and buy DVDs, Blu-ray discs, digital downloads and other forms of home entertainment.
Under pressure from piracy, competing entertainment and economic weakness, the number has fallen every year since, for a total drop of about 13.8 percent, to $18.8 billion in 2010.
Unless, of course, you adjust to reflect the erosion in buying power of the dollar over the last six years. Plug the same $21.8 billion into an inflation calculator from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics - a reality check that fantasy-minded Hollywood would love to avoid - and you find that it would take about $25.3 billion in current dollars to match that figure today.
That means home entertainment spending in 2010, when adjusted for inflation, was actually down almost 26 percent from 2004 - which helps explain all the layoffs, shutdowns and studio sales in the interim.
The domestic motion picture box office, meanwhile, rose nearly 14 percent, to roughly $10.6 billion last year from about $9.3 billion in 2004. Unless you adjust for inflation.
The federal government's inflation calculator says it would take about $10.8 billion today to match the buying power of the 2004 box office. So, in real terms, the box office has fallen nearly 2 percent since 2004.
The lines were long for "Toy Story 3," and "Avatar" was a smash hit on Blu-ray and DVD. The entertainment industry, however, is still far below its recent peak.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
IF there is ever a class in how to remain calm while trapped beneath $250,000 in loans, Michael Wallerstein ought to teach it.
Here he is, sitting one afternoon at a restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a tall, sandy-haired, 27-year-old radiating a kind of surfer-dude serenity. His secret, if that's the right word, is to pretty much ignore all the calls and letters that he receives every day from the dozen or so creditors now hounding him for cash.
"And I don't open the e-mail alerts with my credit score," he adds. "I can't look at my credit score any more."
Mr. Wallerstein, who can't afford to pay down interest and thus watches the outstanding loan balance grow, is in roughly the same financial hell as people who bought more home than they could afford during the real estate boom. But creditors can't foreclose on him because he didn't spend the money on a house.
He spent it on a law degree. And from every angle, this now looks like a catastrophic investment.
Well, every angle except one: the view from law schools. To judge from data that law schools collect, and which is published in the closely parsed U.S. News and World Report annual rankings, the prospects of young doctors of jurisprudence are downright rosy.
In reality, and based on every other source of information, Mr. Wallerstein and a generation of J.D.'s face the grimmest job market in decades. Since 2008, some 15,000 attorney and legal-staff jobs at large firms have vanished, according to a Northwestern Law study. Associates have been laid off, partners nudged out the door and recruitment programs have been scaled back or eliminated.
And with corporations scrutinizing their legal expenses as never before, more entry-level legal work is now outsourced to contract temporary employees, both in the United States and in countries like India. It's common to hear lawyers fret about the sort of tectonic shift that crushed the domestic steel industry decades ago.
But improbably enough, law schools have concluded that life for newly minted grads is getting sweeter, at least by one crucial measure. In 1997, when U.S. News first published a statistic called "graduates known to be employed nine months after graduation," law schools reported an average employment rate of 84 percent. In the most recent U.S. News rankings, 93 percent of grads were working -- nearly a 10-point jump.
In the Wonderland of these statistics, a remarkable number of law school grads are not just busy -- they are raking it in. Many schools, even those that have failed to break into the U.S. News top 40, state that the median starting salary of graduates in the private sector is $160,000. That seems highly unlikely, given that Harvard and Yale, at the top of the pile, list the exact same figure.
How do law schools depict a feast amid so much famine?
"Enron-type accounting standards have become the norm," says William Henderson of Indiana University, one of many exasperated law professors who are asking the American Bar Association to overhaul the way law schools assess themselves. "Every time I look at this data, I feel dirty."
IT is an open secret, Professor Henderson and others say, that schools finesse survey information in dozens of ways. And the survey's guidelines, which are established not by U.S. News but by the American Bar Association, in conjunction with an organization called the National Association for Law Placement, all but invite trimming.
A law grad, for instance, counts as "employed after nine months" even if he or she has a job that doesn't require a law degree. Waiting tables at Applebee's? You're employed. Stocking aisles at Home Depot? You're working, too.
Number-fudging games are endemic, professors and deans say, because the fortunes of law schools rise and fall on rankings, with reputations and huge sums of money hanging in the balance. You may think of law schools as training grounds for new lawyers, but that is just part of it.
They are also cash cows.
Tuition at even mediocre law schools can cost up to $43,000 a year. Those huge lecture-hall classes -- remember "The Paper Chase"? -- keep teaching costs down. There are no labs or expensive equipment to maintain. So much money flows into law schools that law professors are among the highest paid in academia, and law schools that are part of universities often subsidize the money-losing fields of higher education.
"If you're a law school and you add 25 kids to your class, that's a million dollars, and you don't even have to hire another teacher," says Allen Tanenbaum, a lawyer in Atlanta who led the American Bar Association's commission on the impact of the economic crisis on the profession and legal needs. "That additional income goes straight to the bottom line."
There were fewer complaints about fudging and subsidizing when legal jobs were plentiful. But student loans have always been the financial equivalent of chronic illnesses because there is no legal way to shake them. So the glut of diplomas, the dearth of jobs and those candy-coated employment statistics have now yielded a crop of furious young lawyers who say they mortgaged their future under false pretenses. You can sample their rage, and their admonitions, on what are known as law school scam blogs, with names like Shilling Me Softly, Subprime JD and Rose Colored Glasses.
"Avoid this overpriced sewer pit as if your life depended on it," writes the anonymous author of the blog Third Tier Reality -- a reference to the second-to-bottom tier of the U.S. News rankings -- in a typically scatological review. "Unless, of course, you think that you will be better off with $110k-$190k in NON-DISCHARGEABLE debt for a degree that qualifies you to wait tables at the Battery Park Bar and Lounge."
But so far, the warnings have been unheeded. Job openings for lawyers have plunged, but law schools are not dialing back enrollment. About 43,000 J.D.'s were handed out in 2009, 11 percent more than a decade earlier, and the number of law schools keeps rising -- nine new ones in the last 10 years, and five more seeking approval to open in the future.
Apparently, there is no shortage of 22-year-olds who think that law school is the perfect place to wait out a lousy economy and the gasoline that fuels this system -- federally backed student loans -- is still widely available. But the legal market has always been obsessed with academic credentials, and today, few students except those with strong grade-point averages at top national and regional schools can expect a come-hither from a deep-pocketed firm. Nearly everyone else is in for a struggle. Which is why many law school professors privately are appalled by what they describe as a huge and continuing transfer of wealth, from students short on cash to richly salaried academics. Or perhaps this is more like a game of three-card monte, with law schools flipping the aces and a long line of eager players, most wagering borrowed cash, in a contest that few of them can win.
And all those losers can remain cash-poor for a long time. "I think the student loans that kids leave law school with are more scandalous than payday loans," says Andrew Morriss, a law professor at the University of Alabama. "And because it's so easy to get a student loan, law school tuition has grossly outpaced the rate of inflation for the last 20 years. It's now astonishingly high."
Like everything else about the law, however, the full picture here is complicated. Independent surveys find that most law students would enroll even if they knew that only a tiny number of them would wind up with six-figure salaries. Nearly all of them, it seems, are convinced that they're going to win the ring toss at this carnival and bring home the stuffed bear.
And many students enroll for reasons other than immediate financial returns. Mr. Wallerstein, for instance, was drawn by the prestige of the degree. He has no regrets, at least for now, even though he seems doomed to a type of indentured servitude at least through his 30s.
"Law school might not be worth it for another 10 or 15 years," he says, "but the riskier approach always has the bigger payoff."
True, say Professor Henderson and his allies. But he contends that law schools -- which, let's not forget, require students to take courses on disclosure and ethics -- have a special moral obligation to tell the truth about themselves. It's an obligation that persists, he says, even if students would sign on the dotted line no matter what.
"You're beginning your legal education at an institution that is engaging in the kind of disreputable practices that we would be incredibly disappointed to discover our graduates engaging in," he says. "What we have here is powder keg, and if law schools don't solve this problem, there will be a day when the Federal Trade Commission, or some plaintiff's lawyer, shows up and says 'This looks like illegal deception."'
WHEN he started in 2006, Michael Wallerstein knew little about the Thomas Jefferson School of Law, other than that it was in San Diego, which seemed like a fine place to spend three years.
"I looked at schools in Pennsylvania and Long Island," he says, "but I thought, why not go somewhere I'll enjoy?"
Mr. Wallerstein is chatting over lunch one recent afternoon with his fiancee, Karin Michonski. She, too, seems unperturbed by his dizzying collection of i.o.u.'s. Despite those debts, she hopes that he does not wind up in one of those time-gobbling corporate law jobs.
"We like hanging out together," she says with a laugh.
If love paid the bills, these two would be debt-free tomorrow. But it doesn't, and Mr. Wallerstein has no money in the bank, no assets and -- aside from the occasional job as a legal temp -- no wages to garnish. He and Ms. Michonski live rent-free in a nearby brownstone, in return for keeping an eye on the elderly man who owns the place.
"Sometimes the banks will threaten to sue," he says, "but one of the first things you learn in law school, in civil procedure class, is that it doesn't make sense to sue someone who doesn't have anything."
He remembers little about the promotional materials the Thomas Jefferson school sent when he applied in 2006, other than a pamphlet with lots of promising numbers. That was before the economy crumbled, but the school's postgraduate data still looks fabulous, particularly given its spot in the fourth and bottom tier of U.S. News's rankings. The most recent survey says 92 percent of Thomas Jefferson grads were employed nine months after they earned their degrees.
Beth Kransberger, associate dean of student affairs at Thomas Jefferson, stands by that figure, noting that it includes 25 percent of those graduates who could not be located, as well as anyone who went on to other graduate studies -- all perfectly kosher under the guidelines.
Like lots of administrators, she defends the figures she gathers and laments that so many other schools are manipulating results.
"You need to take the high road," she said. "Schools that are behaving the most ethically want students who come to law school with their eyes open."
Even students with open eyes, though, will have a hard time sleuthing through the U.S. News rankings. They are based entirely on unaudited surveys conducted by each law school, using questions devised by the American Bar Association and the National Association for Law Placement. Given the stakes and given that the figures are not double-checked by an impartial body, each school faces exactly the sort of potential conflict of interest lawyers are trained to howl about.
The surveys themselves have a built-in bias. As many deans acknowledge, the results are skewed because graduates with high-paying jobs are more likely to respond than people earning $9 an hour at Radio Shack. (Those who don't respond are basically invisible, aside from reducing the overall response rate of the survey.)
Certain definitions in the surveys seem open to abuse. A person is employed after nine months, for instance, if he or she is working on Feb. 15. This is the most competitive category -- it counts for about one-seventh of the U.S. News ranking -- and in the upper echelons, it's not unusual to see claims of 99 percent and, in a handful of cases, 100 percent employment rates at nine months.
A number of law schools hire their own graduates, some in hourly temp jobs that, as it turns out, coincide with the magical date. Last year, for instance, Georgetown Law sent an e-mail to alums who were "still seeking employment." It announced three newly created jobs in admissions, paying $20 an hour. The jobs just happened to start on Feb. 1 and lasted six weeks.
A spokeswoman for the school said that none of these grads were counted as "employed" as a result of these hourly jobs. In a lengthy exchange of e-mails and calls, several different explanations were offered, the oddest of which came from Gihan Fernando, the assistant dean of career services. He said in an interview that Georgetown Law had "lost track" of two of the three alums, even though they were working at the very institution that was looking for them.
As absurd as the rankings might sound, deans ignore them at their peril, and those who guide their schools higher up the U.S. News chart are rewarded with greater alumni donations, better students and jobs at higher-profile schools.
"When I was a candidate for this job," said Phillip J. Closius, the dean of the University of Baltimore School of Law, "I said 'I can talk for 10 minutes about the fallacies of the U.S. News rankings,' but nobody wants to hear about fallacies. There are millions of dollars riding on students' decisions about where to go to law school, and that creates real institutional pressures."
Mr. Closius came from the University of Toledo College of Law, where he lifted the school to No. 83 from No. 140, he said. Among his strategies: shifting about 40 students with lower LSAT scores into the part-time program. Because part-time students didn't then count in the U.S. News survey -- the rules have since been changed -- Toledo's bar passage rate rose, which helped its ranking.
"You can call it massaging the data if you want, but I never saw it that way," he says. Weaker students wound up with lighter course loads, which meant that fewer of them flunked out. In his estimation, a dean who pays attention to the U.S. News rankings isn't gaming the system; he's making the school better.
Unfortunately, he says, not all schools play fair.
Of course, fair play is hardly encouraged. Any institution with the guts to report, say, a 4 percent drop in postgraduate employment would plunge in the rankings, leaving the dean to explain a lot of convoluted math, and the case for unvarnished truth, to a bunch of angry students and alums.
Critics of the rankings often cast the issue in moral terms, but the problem, as many professors have noted, is structural. A school that does not aggressively manage its ranking will founder, and because there are no cops on this beat, there is no downside to creative accounting. In such circumstances, the numbers are bound to look cheerier, even as the legal market flat-lines.
"We ought to be doing a better job for our students and spend less time worrying about whether another school is five spots ahead," says David N. Yellen, dean of the Loyola University Chicago School of Law. "But in the real world you can't escape from the pressures. We're all sort of trapped. I don't know if anyone is out-and-out lying, but I do know that a lot of schools are hyping a lot of misleading statistics."
WHEN Mr. Wallerstein started at Thomas Jefferson, he was in no mood for austerity. He borrowed so much that before the start of his first semester he nearly put a down payment on a $350,000 two-bedroom, two-bath condo, figuring that the investment would earn a profit by the time he graduated. He was ready to ink the deal until a rep at the mortgage giant Countrywide asked if his employer at the time -- a trade magazine publisher in New Jersey -- would write a letter falsely stating that he was moving to San Diego for work.
"We were on a three-way call with my real estate agent and I said I didn't feel comfortable with that," he says. "The Countrywide guy chuckled and said, 'Everyone lies on their mortgage application.' "
Instead, Mr. Wallerstein rented a spacious apartment. He also spent a month studying in the South of France and a month in Prague -- all on borrowed money. There were cost-of-living loans, and tuition of about $33,000 a year. Later came a $15,000 loan to cover months of studying for the bar.
Today, his best guess is that he should be sending $2,000 to $3,000 a month in total, to lenders that include Wells Fargo, Citibank and Sallie Mae.
"There are a bunch of others," he says. "I'm not really good at keeping records."
Mr. Wallerstein didn't know it at the time, but Thomas Jefferson leads the nation's law schools in at least one category: 95 percent of students graduate with debt, the highest rate in the U.S. News rankings.
The reason, Ms. Kransberger says, is that many Thomas Jefferson students are either immigrants or, like Mr. Wallerstein, the first person in their family to get a law degree; statistically those are both groups with generally little or modest means. When Ms. Kransberger meets applicants engaged in what she calls "magical thinking" about their finances, she advises them to defer for a year or two until they are on stronger footing.
"But I don't think you can act as a moral educator," she says. "Should we really be saying to students who don't have family help, 'No, you shouldn't have access to law school'? That's a tough argument to make."
It's an argument complicated by the reality that a small fraction of graduates are still winning the Big Law sweepstakes. Yes, they tend to hail from the finest law schools, and have the highest G.P.A.'s. But still.
"Who's to say to any particular student, 'You won't be the one to get the $160,000-a-year job,' " says Steven Greenberger, a dean at the DePaul College of Law. "I think they should have all the info, and the info should be accurate, but saying once they know that they shouldn't be allowed to come, that's predicated on the idea that students are really ignorant and don't know what is best for them."
Based on the seething and regret you hear from some law school grads, more than a few wish that someone had been patronizing enough to say, "Oh no you don't." But it's often hard to convince students about the potential downside of law school, says Kimber A. Russell, a 37-year-old graduate of DePaul, who writes the Shilling Me Softly blog.
"This idea of exceptionalism -- I don't know if it's a thing with millennials, or what," she says, referring to the generation now in its 20s. "Even if you tell them the bottom has fallen out of the legal market, they're all convinced that none of the bad stuff will happen to them. It's a serious, life-altering decision, going to law school, and you're dealing with a lot of naive students who have never had jobs, never paid real bills."
Graduates who have been far more vigilant about their finances than Mr. Wallerstein are in trouble. Today, countless J.D.'s are paying their bills with jobs that have nothing do with the law, and they are losing ground on their debt every day. Stories are legion of young lawyers enlisting in the Army or folding pants at Lululemon. Or baby-sitting, like Carly Rosenberg, of the Brooklyn Law School class of 2009.
"I guess I kind of assumed that someone would hook me up with something," she says. She has sent out 15 to 20 resumes a week since March, when she passed the bar. So far, nothing.
Jason Bohn, who received his J.D. from the University of Florida, is earning $33 an hour as a legal temp while strapped to more than $200,000 in loans, nearly all of which he accumulated as an undergraduate and while working on a master's degree at Columbia University.
"I grew up a ward of the state of New York, so I don't have any parents to call for help," Mr. Bohn says. "For my sanity, I have to think there is an end in sight."
AS a student, Mr. Wallerstein assumed that the very scale of law school -- all the paperwork, all the professors, all the tests -- implied that pots of gold awaited anyone with smarts, charm and a willingness to work hard. He began to doubt that assumption when the firm where he had interned told him that it hadn't been profitable for two years and could not offer him a full-time job.
Mr. Wallerstein and his fiancee moved back East after graduation, and he landed a job at a small firm in Queens. He says he was paid $10 an hour and worked for a manager who seemed to have walked straight out of a Dickens novel. Over a firm-wide lunch, as Labor Day approached, she asked employees to thank her, one at a time, for giving them the holiday off.
"When it was my turn, I said, 'Labor Day is about celebrating the 40-hour workweek, weekends, that sort of thing,' " Mr. Wallerstein recalls. "She said, 'Well, workers have that now so you don't need a day off to celebrate it.' "
He lasted less than a month.
Since then, he has found jobs at temporary projects reviewing documents. The latest of these gigs is in office space rented on the 11th floor of the Viacom building in Times Square. He sits in a small, windowless room with five other lawyers, all clicking through page after page of documents on computers under fluorescent lights. The walls are bare except for the name of each lawyer, tacked overhead.
"Welcome to the veal pen," said one during a tour two weeks ago.
The job is set up through a company called Peak Discovery, which put an ad on Craigslist, seeking 100 lawyers. "We got about 300 responses overnight," said John Thacher, who is managing the project.
Mr. Thacher has managed about 2,500 people in his six years in the temporary legal business, and maybe five of them have gone on to associate jobs in law firms, the kind of work that nearly everyone aspires to when entering law school.
"Most of us either went to the wrong law school, which is the bottom two-thirds, or we were too old when we graduated," he said. "I was 32 when I graduated, and at 32 you're washed up in this field, in terms of a shot at the real deal. They perceived me as somebody they can't indoctrinate into slave labor and work to death for seven years and then release if they don't like you."
This gets to what might be the ultimate ugly truth about law school: plenty of those who borrow, study and glad-hand their way into the gated community of Big Law are miserable soon after they move in. The billable-hour business model pins them to their desks and devours their free time.
Hence the cliche: law school is a pie-eating contest where the first prize is more pie.
Law school defenders note that huge swaths of the country lack adequate and affordable access to lawyers, which suggests that the issue here isn't oversupply so much as maldistribution. But when the numbers are crunched, studies find that most law students need to earn around $65,000 a year to get the upper hand on their debt.
That kind of money is hard to earn hanging a shingle in rural Ohio or in public defenders' offices, the budgets of which are often being cut. As elusive, and inhospitable, as jobs in Big Law may be, they are one of the few ways for new grads to keep out of delinquency.
The mismatch of student expectations and likely postgraduate outcomes is starting to yield some embarrassing headlines. In October, a student at Boston College Law School made news by posting online an open letter to the dean, offering to leave the school if he could get his tuition money back.
"With fatherhood impending," wrote the student, whose name was redacted, "I go to bed every night terrified of the thought of trying to provide for my child AND paying off my J.D., and resentful at the thought that I was convinced to go to law school by empty promises of a fulfilling and remunerative career."
After a few years of warnings by concerned professors, the American Bar Association is now studying whether it should refine the questions in its surveys in order to get more realistic and useful statistics for the U.S. News rankings. In mid-December, the organization held a two-day hearing in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., about the collection of job placement data.
"There is a legitimate question about whether we're asking for detailed-enough info and displaying that info for those who use it," says Bucky Askew of the bar association. "I think it's fair to say we're aware of the criticism and have a committee working to getting to the bottom of this."
And what about U.S. News? The editors could, but won't unilaterally demand better data from law schools. "Do we have the power to do that? Yes, I think we do," said Robert Morse, who oversees the law school rankings. "But we'd have to create a whole new definition of 'employed,' and it would be awkward if U.S. News imposed that definition by itself. It would be preferable if the A.B.A. took a leadership role in this."
Instead of overhauling the rankings, some professors say, the solution may be to get law schools and the bar association out of the stat-collection business. Steven Greenberger of DePaul recommends a mandatory warning -- a bit like the labels on cigarette packs -- that every student taking the LSAT, the prelaw standardized test, must read.
"Something like 'Law school tuition is expensive and here is what the actual cost will be, the job market is uncertain and you should carefully consider whether you want to pursue this degree,' " he says. "And it should be made absolutely clear to students, that if they sign up for X amount of debt, their monthly nut will be X in three years."
Another approach would be to limit class sizes or the number of new law schools. But the bar association, which is granted accrediting authority by the Department of Education, says that it would run afoul of antitrust law if it imposed such limits.
Today, American law schools are like factories that no force has the power to slow down -- not even the timeless dictates of supply and demand.
Solving the J.D. overabundance problem, according to Professor Henderson, will have to involve one very drastic measure: a bunch of lower-tier law schools will need to close. But nobody inside of the legal establishment, he predicts, has the stomach for that. "Ultimately," he says, "some public authority will have to step in because law schools and lawyers are incapable of policing themselves."
MR. WALLERSTEIN, for his part, is not complaining. Once you throw in the intangibles of having a J.D., he says, he is one of law schools' satisfied customers.
"It's a prestige thing," he says. "I'm an attorney. All of my friends see me as a person they look up to. They understand I'm in a lot of debt, but I've done something they feel they could never do and the respect and admiration is important."
Compared with the life he left four years ago, he has lost ground. That research position in Newark, he figures, would pay him $60,000 a year now, with benefits. Instead, he's vying with a crowd for jobs that pay at rates just a little higher, but that last only a few weeks at a time, with no benefits. And he's a quarter-million dollars in the hole.
Unless, somehow, the debt just goes away. Another of Mr. Wallerstein's techniques for remaining cool in a serious financial pickle: believe that the pickle might somehow disappear.
"Bank bailouts, company bailouts -- I don't know, we're the generation of bailouts," he says in a hallway during a break from his Peak Discovery job. "And like, this debt of mine is just sort of, it's a little illusory. I feel like at some point, I'll negotiate it away, or they won't collect it."
He gives a slight shrug and a smile as he heads back to work. "It could be worse," he says. "It's not like they can put me jail."
Correction: January 16, 2011, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about law schools misstated the educational history of Jason Bohn, a recent law school graduate.While Mr. Bohn took classes at Columbia Law School, his law degree is from the University of Florida. And while nearly all of his student loan debt was accumulated at Columbia University, it was incurred while he was an undergraduate and while working on a master's degree, and not at Columbia Law.

Full text: FEAR dominated many headlines in the fourth quarter, as unemployment in the United States, a debt crisis in Europe and inflation in China nagged at investors. But hope for an economic resurgence bubbled up, too, and a variety of market sectors had positive returns.
Three of last quarter's top-performing mutual funds, for example, found rising prices among commodity producers and foreign companies. One even made money on a bet that the jobs market would soon revive.
An Energy Boost
The Van Eck Hard Assets fund invests in diggers, drillers and tillers. It prospects in all of the commodities-producing sectors -- metals, energy, agriculture and timber -- but energy investments accounted for about 65 percent of the portfolio at year-end. Metals producers made up an additional 30 percent.
The fund's energy stake stemmed partly from a contrary bet on the gulf oil spill, which battered the shares of oil services outfits held by Van Eck, like Halliburton, Cameron International and Weatherford International.
"By the middle of June, we thought the sell-off had been overdone," said Shawn Reynolds, one of the fund's co-managers. "So we added to our Halliburton, Weatherford and Cameron holdings." All three provided double-digit returns in the fourth quarter, led by Weatherford, up more than 30 percent.
Rising gold prices helped the fund, too, with Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold in the top 10 holdings as of November. Mr. Reynolds said he and his co-manager, Charles T. Cameron, believe that gold can keep rising as long as economic uncertainty prevailed in the United States and Europe. "We're not gold nuts," he said. "We're mild gold bulls."
The fund returned 23.5 percent in the quarter, versus 10.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Its Class A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.39 percent, compared with an average of 1.36 percent for domestic stock funds tracked by Morningstar.
Gold as Insurance
David A. Nadel, co-manager of Royce Global Value, has lately favored gold miners, too. He says he sees gold as a form of insurance in a world where governments are printing money to lubricate their economies. "You can take the view that gold is the real money," he said. "It's been a currency for 5,000 years."
His fund specializes in small-cap investing, so he skips over stalwarts like Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, opting instead for Medusa Mining. "Medusa is producing gold at less than $250 an ounce," versus a spot price of about $1,400, he said. "The rub is that all of their mines are in the Philippines -- some people worry about political risk."
Mr. Nadel and his co-manager, W. Whitney George, range across the globe seeking stocks. Their search in the developing world has led them beyond oft-hyped places like the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. At the end of November, their largest developing-world stake was in South Africa, at 4.2 percent. (They had about 15 percent of the fund's money invested in the United States.)
South Africa "is at the nexus of all things sub-Saharan Africa," Mr. Nadel said. "For global multinationals, it will drive any Africa strategy."
The country has problems, like high levels of H.I.V. incidence and consumer debt, but also advantages like top-quality companies and rich resources, he said.
Among the fund's South African investments is Adcock Ingram Holdings, a maker of drugs and hospital supplies. It has lately traded at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 10. Among well-managed drug companies, Mr. Nadel said, "you can't find that kind of valuation in the developed world or the BRIC countries."
Mr. Nadel and Mr. George pride themselves in uncovering overlooked companies, often in ho-hum industries. Thus the fund owns two old-line Austrian manufacturers -- Semperit, a maker of specialized rubber gear like escalator handrails and high-strength hoses, and Mayr-Melnhof Karton, a paper and packaging producer. "Austrian companies tend to be debt-averse, and they're disciplined cost managers," Mr. Nadel said. "We like companies that can survive economic cycles without needing financing."
The fund returned 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter and has an expense ratio of 1.69 percent, versus 1.54 percent for the average international stock fund followed by Morningstar.
Balance-Sheet Basics
Francis X. Claro and James M. Tringas, co-managers of the Wells Fargo Advantage Global Opportunities fund, also seek companies with the financial strength to tough out hard times.
"The balance sheet is where we begin our analysis," said Mr. Tringas, who is a certified public accountant. "A lot of investors look to the income statement and underestimate the impact of the balance sheet, but the balance sheet is what allows the investment thesis to play out." If a company finds itself desperate for funding, its plans go can awry.
That thinking led them to IAC/InterActiveCorp, owner of Web sites like Match.com and Ask.com. "It has retired 40 percent of its shares, and it's still sitting on a billion and a half of cash with no debt," Mr. Tringas said.
Their belief in new media plays out in international bets, too, including 51job, their largest holding at the end of November. The company publishes online and print classified employment ads in China and helps Chinese companies with their employee benefits. It is benefiting from workers' migration from the countryside to cities. "It's like the Monster.com of China," Mr. Claro said.
Their interest in Monster Worldwide, owner of Monster.com, led them to 51job. Their stake in Monster, their fourth-largest holding as of the end of November, might surprise, given the sorry state of employment in the United States. But Mr. Claro said many investors were too pessimistic. "In my experience, you get the same rhetoric in every downturn -- the jobs will never return," but eventually, they do, he said, and sooner than many commentators predict.
The fund returned 17.1 percent in the fourth quarter, and its Class A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.72 percent.

Full text: JOHN TEMPLETON may be known as the father of global investing, but the Templeton Growth fund, which he started in 1954, is finding top holdings closer to home these days.
Four American giants -- Microsoft, Oracle, Amgen and Pfizer -- were among the fund's top five holdings as of Nov. 30. The fifth is Accenture, the consulting company that operates widely in the United States but is domiciled in Dublin.
"Ten years ago, we probably had less than 20 percent exposure to the U.S. Now it's in excess of 40 percent," said Cindy Sweeting, a manager of the $16.7 billion fund, which can invest in companies located anywhere in the world. "Many U.S. companies are well positioned globally, and valuations are about as attractive as they have been in a decade."
Mutual funds that invest in United States stocks outperformed international equity funds in 2010, and some investment managers say that is likely to continue this year as American companies, highly profitable and flush with cash, benefit from a strengthening economy. In contrast, debt worries in Europe, inflation fears in China and persistent economic doldrums in Japan suggest that the outlook for major international markets is mixed at best, some money managers say.
"I am more optimistic on the U.S. market," said James P. Goff, director of research at Janus Capital and manager of the $254 million Janus Global Research fund. "We have had a lot of bad news in the United States with high unemployment and low confidence in the government and the markets, but when you take a step back, our companies are in great shape," he said. Top holdings of Janus Global Research at the end of November included Apple and I.B.M. as well as Isuzu Motors of Japan and MRV Engenharia e Participacoes of Brazil.
Domestic equity funds returned 17.5 percent, on average, in 2010, compared with 13.3 percent for international stock funds, according to Thomson Reuters, only the third time in the last 10 years that domestic stock funds have outpaced international ones. Part of the domestic advantage in 2010 was found in the dollar, as the euro's 6.5 percent decline against the greenback left European stock markets like Spain's and Italy's down by roughly 20 percent for the year in dollar terms.
But currency factors aside, money managers say a driving force behind international equities -- big gains in emerging-market stocks -- may be running out of steam as a huge capital flows into countries like Brazil, India and China have made these markets more expensive.
"In emerging markets, quality companies with good corporate governance can trade at 20 to 30 times earnings, much higher than the low double-digit valuations of blue-chip companies in the developed world," said David Herro, manager of the $6 billion Oakmark International fund. Mr. Herro has reduced his exposure to emerging markets to about 5 percent of the fund and is focusing instead on finding promising stocks in troubled economies like those of Japan and Europe. His top holdings at the end of September included Daiwa Securities and Toyota. He also owned shares of Grupo Televisa of Mexico and Banco Santander of Spain, which has a large part of its business in Latin America.
Emerging-market equity funds returned 19 percent last year, according to Thomson Reuters. They attracted more than $92 billion from investors in 2010, a record amount, according to EPFR Global, a research firm based in Cambridge, Mass. At the same time, investors, still smarting from the collapse in developed-world equity markets in 2008, pulled more than $36 billion from United States stock funds and added nearly $180 billion to bond funds.
But people who are still jumping into emerging markets in Asia and other parts of the world -- on the belief that faster economic growth will translate into stock market gains -- are likely to be disappointed, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal at the Vanguard Group.
"We don't believe this emerging-markets G.D.P growth story," Mr. Kinniry said. Ten years ago, he said, price-to-earnings multiples for emerging-market stocks were in the single digits, while earnings multiples in developed markets were at record highs. "That discount has now been closed," he said. "We shouldn't expect to see anywhere near the level of performance from emerging markets that we have seen in recent years."
Stock fund managers say an effective way to participate in the growth of emerging economies may be by holding blue-chip multinational companies.
"When you can get dividend yields in excess of bond yields in blue-chip companies that have exposure to fast-growing emerging markets, that is a pretty attractive proposition at today's prices," said Ms. Sweeting at Templeton Growth. She cited drug makers like Merck and Pfizer, which she said received 10 to 15 percent of their revenue from emerging markets and had "lots of growth potential."
ALONG with the market reversal that sent domestic stock funds higher than international ones in 2010, some managers say similar dynamics may allow lagging sectors of the American stock market to shine in 2011.
Over the last decade, funds that invest in value stocks, equities that trade cheaply relative to company earnings, have outperformed growth funds, which look for companies expected to increase profits at an above-average rate. Large-company growth funds truly experienced a lost decade, with a negative return of nearly 1 percent a year over the period, according to Thomson Reuters.
But that may be changing. "After a long period of lagging, domestic large-cap growth stocks are poised to perform well," said Larry J. Puglia, manager of the $11.3 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth fund, which returned 16.4 percent in 2010. "These stocks are attractively valued, they have better access to capital than smaller companies and they benefit from rapidly growing economies abroad."
John Templeton said in 1994 that bull markets "are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria." For 2011, many money managers are pulling back from what they see as euphoria in emerging markets.
Ms. Sweeting, the Templeton manager, suggested that domestic stock investors might still be in Stage Two. Despite market gains in 2010, "sentiment in the U.S. is in some ways still pretty tenuous -- you still have that proverbial wall of worry," she said. "And that makes it a good time to buy stocks."

Full text: WHEN the stock market plummeted in 2008, investors began to pour money into bond mutual funds, which generally performed quite well -- at least until this past December.
In that month, taxable bond funds lost an average 0.6 percent, according to Morningstar, compared with an average total return of 7.7 percent for all of 2010. In contrast, stock funds gained 5.9 percent in December, and had an average return of 17.8 percent for the year.
Faced with the prospect of losses, many investors moved quickly. In the first week of December, there were net outflows of $403 million from taxable bond funds, followed by $3.77 billion the next week, according to the Investment Company Institute.
Were the sellers responding nimbly to a drop in share prices, or were they overreacting? And should bonds remain a significant part of a diversified portfolio? There are no quick, simple answers to these questions, but three analysts discussed their views.
Miriam Sjoblom, Morningstar's lead bond fund analyst, said interest rates could well rise, making this year "a turbulent one for bond investors." People who "own bond funds as part of a long-term asset-allocation scheme should still get the benefit of diversification relative to stocks that bonds offer," she said, "so I see no reason for them to throw that plan out the window."
She warned, however, that investors should not "expect to see the same ebullient returns they got from their bond portfolios for much of the past two years," or even the past 20 years.
Not surprisingly, the strongest returns in the past year were achieved by high-yield bond funds, known colloquially as junk -- and that is the sector that is most vulnerable to the risk of default.
Jason T. Thomas, chief investment officer at Aspiriant, a wealth management firm with offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, said that some high-yield shareholders were "being lulled to sleep." Default rates have been artificially low in recent months, he added, because of "the very easy terms of much of the lending from 2005 through 2007 and banks that extend and pretend," rather than foreclosing on loans. Such banks hope that the economy will strengthen and that the loans will eventually be repaid, he said, but "the default rate could change rapidly if the economy slows even modestly."
Mr. Thomas also had this warning for investors: Don't overlook the risk of settling for after-tax yields that are below the level of inflation. At the end of November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, the Consumer Price Index was up at an annual rate of 1.1 percent. That is very low by historical standards, but many economists expect the pace to pick up if the economy continues to recover. "A bond or bond fund that is yielding less than inflation is locking in a decline in purchasing power -- a negative real return," he said.
For taxable accounts, he said, he favored the Pimco Total Return fund, the world's largest mutual fund, with some $250 billion in assets. It "has extremely broad capabilities and is looking for opportunities as diverse as mortgages, emerging-markets debt and municipal bonds," he said. Pimco recently raised its 2011 forecast for United States economic growth by a full percentage point, to 3 to 3.5 percent.
The fund's long-term outperformance "has been lumpy, with long periods of mediocre performance," Mr. Thomas said. Because of that unevenness, he advised, "Don't plan to trade in and out of this fund."
Pimco, a unit of Allianz, the German insurer, is based in Newport Beach, Calif.
The fund had net outflows in November, according to Morningstar, its first in two years. And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in December to allow investments of up to 10 percent of assets in equity-linked securities, including preferred stock and convertible bonds, but not common stock, as early as April. William H. Gross, the fund's manager and Pimco's co-chief investment officer, has not disclosed the fund's specific plans.
As an alternative to money market funds, which are now paying minimal yields, Mr. Thomas said he favored an exchange-traded fund, iShares Barclays 1-3 Year Credit Bond. It is broadly diversified, and although its credit rating is triple-B, he said he considered the yield, 2.48 percent, enough compensation for the credit risk.
MICHAEL STOLPER, head of Stolper & Company, an investment manager in San Diego, said that because the economy was "in the early stages of a recovery," he favored good-quality, corporate bond funds like the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Investment-Grade fund as a counterweight to equities and to provide reasonable returns. That fund had a yield of 4.67 percent.
He also uses taxable bond funds from Payden & Rygel and T. Rowe Price. For most individual investors, traditional no-load mutual funds offer more clarity than exchange-traded funds, he said.
At current yields, he said, there may be no great alternatives. "You hope for the least offensive choice," he said. "The returns aren't wonderful, but they're tolerable," and, if you're careful, they are still relatively safe.

Abstract: A FEW weeks after I started a tenure-track job last semester at the State University of New York at New Paltz, an e-mail message landed in faculty in-boxes relaying the news that an online textbook-rental company had requested records for all grades awarded on campus since 2007. Chegg, a rapidly growing company backed by more than $221 million in venture and debt capital, sent similar requests to 533 colleges and universities, according to Tina Couch, its vice president of public relations.

Full text: A FEW weeks after I started a tenure-track job last semester at the State University of New York at New Paltz, an e-mail message landed in faculty in-boxes relaying the news that an online textbook-rental company had requested records for all grades awarded on campus since 2007.
The company, Chegg.com, wanted grade distributions -- how many A's, B's, C's, etc., were given -- organized by semester, course section and instructor, without individual student information. The request was made under New York's Freedom of Information Law, which allows the public to access state government records. That definition covers grades at state universities, according to SUNY New Paltz lawyers. So the administration had to give up the goods.
Chegg, a rapidly growing company backed by more than $221 million in venture and debt capital, sent similar requests to 533 colleges and universities, according to Tina Couch, its vice president of public relations. The company is in the process of uploading the grades on CourseRank.com, a class planning Web site that Chegg acquired in August. Students who register for CourseRank will be able to take into account a professor's grade distribution, along with peer reviews and ratings, when deciding whether to take a class.
I am well accustomed to online scrutiny. When I started teaching, part time, seven years ago, I found out about RateMyProfessors.com, the go-to site for students to dish about their teachers. I cruised it regularly at first. I was elated when I got a good comment ("sweetest/smartest lady ever"), crushed when I got a disparaging one ("avoid her like the plague") and vaguely disappointed that no one had ever awarded me a chili pepper, the icon of professor "hotness."
But the CourseRank plan would take the concept of RateMyProfessors into an entirely different dimension. In addition to the free-for-all of user comments and ratings, students would be getting some real goods, a bar graph version of my grade book.
The thought of it made me squeamish. I had always considered grades a private matter. I didn't dwell on the question of whether I was an easy grader or a hard one -- I simply tried to be fair. My grade distributions changed semester by semester, as my students did. I felt pride when I could give an abundance of A's and disappointment when I passed out a heavy dose of C's. I pondered what went right and what I could do better. But ultimately I saw my grades as a measure of what my students achieved. Presented online to students, my grades would now be a mark of my achievement.
The irony was glaring. The Freedom of Information Act, long cherished by investigative reporters, had become a tool for a textbook-rental company to draw traffic to one of its Web sites. And there I was, a professor of journalism, being muckraked.
Not that there was anything scandalous to find, as it turns out. I requested my grade distribution for the six sections of Journalism 1 that I had taught since 2007. About a third of my students got A's, 40 percent got B's, and close to 20 percent got C's, with a D or F here and there. My median grade was 3.22, in between a B and B plus and slightly below the average department median grade for all sections of Journalism 1, which was 3.31.
On the surface, it didn't look like my grades would present much of an issue for students. But I would be moving forward with a new awareness that students could judge me on my grades. With that might come the temptation to grade more gently, to make a play to increase my likability and to encourage students to flock to my classes.
What students think of me has an impact, after all, on my job security. I am junior faculty at a university that takes student evaluations into account in the tenure and promotion process. Though I want to be a professor with high standards, I also want to please. And I want to keep my job.
There are signs that giving students information about grade distributions does stimulate grade inflation. Some universities already make median grades or grade distributions available to students. A 2009 study at Cornell showed that since it began making median course grades available in 1998, more students had enrolled in classes with higher median grades; the percentage of courses with median grades in the A range also increased.
But Stuart Rojstaczer, a former Duke University professor who monitors grading trends, says that going public with grade distributions could eventually turn the tide against grade inflation by outing professors who grade too leniently. "Right now, there are still a significant percentage of administrators who maintain grade inflation is not a problem," he says. "But when asked for grade distribution information, they don't want to put it out there. Sunlight is good."
But students shopping for classes would be getting only a little sunlight at a time -- that is, data without statistical ballast. Most professors don't teach the same course six times in a row, as I had with Journalism 1. My grade distribution was taken from more than a hundred students -- enough to result in a significant median. A handful of wayward students out of a class of 16, or an abundance of gifted ones, could make a professor's grading standards seem artificially high, or low.
What we faculty are up against is something journalists and scholars struggle with all the time: information out of context. On the surface, providing students with grading practices may seem like full disclosure. But what students are really receiving might best be called (with a nod to their beloved Stephen Colbert) "factiness" -- something that looks and smells like facts, but in reality is far from truth.
For grade distributions to be useful, students need to know whether the information is compiled from 10 students or 300. They need to be aware of all the variables that an online grade graph can't possibly show: the quality of the students enrolled in the class, the level of difficulty of the subject matter, the resolutions many professors make at the end of the previous semester to be more (or less) demanding the next time around.
Students also should appreciate that the courses that frustrate them now -- with their high expectations and "unfair" grades -- are sometimes the ones that, years later, become the most valuable.

Full text: Now that the Obama administration has forced the Pentagon to gradually freeze its budget in response to economic pressures, the question in Washington is: How long will the deal hold up?
In announcing plans to cut $78 billion in spending over five years, phasing out any growth above inflation, the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, made it clear on Thursday that he hoped to keep the military budget from shrinking.
Many analysts said he did an artful job in picking areas to trim, but they doubted that the Pentagon would be able to prevent the budget from actually dropping in two or three years, particularly if deficit-reduction efforts gathered steam.
Political and military analysts said even some of the new Republicans in the House might find it difficult to trim government expenditures without including the Pentagon's base budget, which the White House would like to increase to $550 billion in fiscal 2012.
The new House Republican leaders -- who have said that military spending should not be off limits -- and newcomers backed by the Tea Party could join with Democrats who have long bridled at the surge in military spending since the Sept. 11 attacks. And with troops coming home from Iraq, legislators could win support for more cuts from a public weary after a decade of war, even as the fighting continues in Afghanistan.
Mr. Gates acknowledged the new political reality, saying tough choices were "more important than ever at a time of extreme fiscal duress, when budget pressures and scrutiny fall on all areas of government, including defense."
But even as Mr. Gates drew a new line in the sand on "the minimum level of defense spending that is necessary," the latest reductions seemed to fuel the sense that the military budget was now in play.
Just last fall, Mr. Gates had seemed confident that he could ease such pressures by shifting money inside the Pentagon. He had pushed the armed services and the bureaucracy for $150 billion in savings over five years that could be used for military priorities. He announced many of those changes, including facility consolidations and a reduction in contractors, on Thursday.
But in agreeing with the White House decision to reduce the Pentagon's budget request for 2012 to $553 billion, excluding the costs of the wars, from the $566 billion that he thought he had been promised, Mr. Gates took "a sort of one-step-back concession to reality," said Gordon Adams, a former Clinton administration official who served on Mr. Obama's transition team.
"The finger in the dike didn't work," Mr. Adams said, referring to Mr. Gates's efforts. "And now he is acknowledging that pressure from outside is impinging on defense."
Mr. Adams and other analysts said that stopping the budget's growth could lead to substantial cuts in spending and in the size of the military's forces.
"If you think about the defense budget as having a wide turning radius like an aircraft carrier, it is just about 20 percent into a turn that could take years to finish," said Loren B. Thompson, a consultant to military contractors. "But at least Gates is now acknowledging that the turn is coming."
Mr. Gates said the $78 billion in reductions from previous budget proposals would enable Pentagon spending to keep growing slightly faster than inflation through fiscal 2014 and at a rate equal to inflation in the two years after that.
He said some of the savings would be achieved by cutting 47,000 Army troops and Marines in those last two years. But just staying ahead or even with inflation would produce nominal increases that could seem eye-popping to lawmakers worried about the nation's debt.
Excluding war costs, the administration's new budget proposal for the Pentagon would total $2.9 trillion over five years. The annual totals would rise to $571 billion in fiscal 2013, $586 billion in 2014, $598 billion in 2015 and $611 billion in 2016.
And Mr. Gates, who is widely respected by members of both parties, has said he is likely to retire this year, a move that would leave the Pentagon without its most forceful advocate.
The defense secretary said that even as the growth slows, the United States military would be far more powerful than any other, especially as other nations cut back more severely. But he also cautioned that further reductions would amount to "math, not strategy."
Other Pentagon officials wondered what could be cut while 100,000 American troops are in Afghanistan, the United States faces crises with North Korea and Iran, and China and Russia are beefing up their forces.
But the new House speaker, John A. Boehner, and majority leader, Eric Cantor, have said that trims in military spending were a possibility. Other Republicans would prefer to limit budget cuts to domestic programs.
Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he would resist military spending cuts.
Congress also could reject Mr. Gates's plan to increase health insurance fees for retired veterans. Representative Norm Dicks, Democrat of Washington, said the health care changes would be "very sensitive in my district."
Ohio and Michigan lawmakers also have begun to rally support for the Marines' Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, a $14.4 billion program that Mr. Gates would like to kill. It could provide thousands of jobs in those states.
Military contractors' stocks gained Friday, with investors relieved the cuts were not deeper. But as past downturns have unfolded, it has often proved easier to reduce weapons systems than personnel and benefits.

Full text: Goldman Sachs's rivals must be kicking themselves. The firm's nearly $2 billion investment connection with Facebook is relatively small financially, but it's big in franchise terms. After the lumps Goldman took last year, the deal showed the firm could still wrap its tentacles around an important client for mutual benefit.
Goldman could still lose money on the deal for its shareholders, partners and clients. And questions remain as to whether its plan to invest $450 million of its own capital alongside $1.5 billion from others through a single investment entity violates the spirit of Securities Exchange Act disclosure rules. That means there's still a chance the deal could backfire financially or in the realm of public opinion.
But taking calculated risks is what separates Goldman from run-of-the-mill competitors. The Facebook effort also involved stitching its sometimes conflicting strands of business into a fabric that suited a priority customer. That's a way both to fend off rivals and to mitigate risk in the deal.
The Goldman coup surely started with an investment banking relationship with Facebook's executives and its board, including the early venture capital supporters Peter Thiel and Jim Breyer.
Other banks can do that, too, however. So something more was required: capital. Even without the backing of some of its in-house money managers, Goldman found the cash. Its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, carved out a slice of the balance sheet -- a bold call given that many bank executives are paralyzed trying to figure out the impact of regulatory changes on proprietary investments.
Moreover, Goldman's Silicon Valley bankers enlisted the private wealth management division to bring in customers as investors. That doesn't just generate fees, it allows Goldman to boast that it brings clients deals other banks can't match. The firm's powerful network of alumni also played a role. Digital Sky Technologies, a Facebook shareholder that's investing at least $50 million more, counts former partners of the bank among its executives.
There are other tentacles poised for the future, too. Goldman will probably take Facebook public eventually, for a juicy fee. And its private bank may make new customers of the social network's founders and employees when that happens. The likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse should be wondering whether and how they can coordinate their various appendages on such A-list deals so successfully.
Balancing Act
Commodities markets should like economic growth. Yet despite positive data from Germany and the United States, prices are wobbling. The problem is that oil, food and metals prices have all thrived on a weak dollar, cheap money and inflows into real rather than financial assets. Recovery, a firmer dollar and higher interest rates are giving investors more to think about. There could be a lot of volatility ahead.
This week's lurches come at the end of a superstrong run. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodity index jumped 10 percent in December, taking its annual rise for 2010 to 15 percent. Commodities were ripe for a correction. But their fall may signal more than that.
Dollar weakness and central bank money printing helped lift a broad range of commodities, as well as gold, last year. Hedge funds made hay with trades that shorted the dollar and went long on commodities. Steep price gains had a marked speculative element.
Now, however, a dollar rally looks on. Yields on Treasuries have risen strongly since October, making dollar assets more appealing. The euro zone periphery crisis is another reason to switch out of the single currency and into the dollar. As the dollar rises, commodities, which are priced in dollars, tend to fall.
But the influence of real levels of supply and demand must also be taken into account. Real demand for many commodities should be well supported if global growth is indeed firm. Yet stronger growth, too, has its negative side. Inflation is up in China, India and even the euro zone. Asia has already seen interest rate rises. The liquidity taps that provided investors with cheap money are closing.
Stronger growth, but probably a stronger dollar, higher global inflation and interest rates, and perhaps less liquidity: that sums up the countervailing forces in commodity markets in 2011. The tide of money that surged into commodities last year may no longer flow so reliably.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday that the nation's "extreme fiscal duress" now required him to call for cuts in the size of the Army and Marine Corps, reversing the significant growth in military spending that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
The White House has told the Pentagon to squeeze that growth over the next five years, Mr. Gates said, reducing by $78 billion the amount available for the Pentagon, not counting the costs of its combat operations.
The decision to go after the Pentagon budget, even while troops remain locked in combat overseas, is the clearest indication yet that President Obama will be cutting spending broadly across the government as he seeks to reduce the deficit -- and stave off attacks from Republicans in Congress who want to shrink the government even more.
Republicans have for the most part resisted including military spending as they search for quick reductions in federal spending.
To make ends meet, Mr. Gates also announced that he would seek to recoup billions of dollars by increasing fees paid by retired veterans under 65 for Defense Department health insurance, even though Congress has rejected such proposals in the past. And he outlined extensive cuts in new weapons.
Cutting up to 47,000 troops from the Army and Marine Corps forces -- roughly 6 percent -- would be made easier by the withdrawal under way from Iraq, and the reductions would not begin until 2015, just as Afghan forces are to take over the security mission there. But Mr. Gates said the cuts in Pentagon spending were hardly a peace dividend, and were forced by a global economic recession and domestic pressures to find ways to throttle back federal spending.
"This department simply cannot risk continuing down the same path where our investment priorities, bureaucratic habits and lax attitudes toward costs are increasingly divorced from the real threats of today, the growing perils of tomorrow and the nation's grim financial outlook," Mr. Gates said at an afternoon news conference.
The president's budget for the 2012 fiscal year, which is due by mid-February, would freeze discretionary spending, but that would not apply to military, veterans and Homeland Security programs. Last fall, a majority of the members of Mr. Obama's bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, including three Republican senators, said military spending also should be reduced as part of a long-term debt-reduction plan.
The Pentagon's proposed operating budget for 2012 is expected to be about $553 billion, which would still reflect real growth, even though it is $13 billion less than expected. The Pentagon budget will then begin a decline in its rate of growth for two years, and stay flat -- growing only to match inflation -- for the 2015 and 2016 fiscal years. (The Pentagon operating budget is separate from a fund that finances the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.)
"This plan represents, in my view, the minimum level of defense spending that is necessary, given the complex and unpredictable array of security challenges the United States faces around the globe: global terrorist networks, rising military powers, nuclear-armed rogue states and much, much more," Mr. Gates said.
To be sure, the actual size and shape of future military budgets will continue to be reset by annual spending proposals from the president, and those in turn will be based on shifting economic factors -- decline or growth -- and threats around the world, as well as by Congressional action.
But for now, the Army is expected in 2015 to begin cutting its active-duty troop levels by 27,000, and the Marine Corps by up to 20,000. Together, those force reductions would save $6 billion in 2015 and 2016.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that all four service chiefs supported the proposals, and that the military would still be able to manage global risks. "We can't hold ourselves exempt from the belt-tightening," he said. "Neither can we allow ourselves to contribute to the very debt that puts our long-term security at risk."
The Army's ranks number 569,600, and the Marine Corps has just over 202,000 members; both would remain larger than when Mr. Gates became defense secretary four years ago.
Mr. Gates already had instructed the armed services and the Pentagon bureaucracy to find ways to operate more efficiently, with the savings plowed back into the budget to make up for anticipated shortfalls; otherwise the cuts in troops and weapons would have been even steeper.
The armed services have identified about $100 billion in savings over five years.
Separately, the Defense Department bureaucracy had identified about $54 billion more, from things like reducing contractor hiring, freezing personnel rolls, reducing the number of generals and admirals and closing or consolidating headquarters.
Many of those changes can be carried out unilaterally by the Pentagon or the armed services.
But some -- especially increases in fees for the military's health-care system, called Tricare -- require Congressional approval, and have been rejected before.
Proposals to increase Tricare fees will pit Mr. Gates against those in Congress -- and veterans' groups -- who say retired military personnel already have paid up front with service in uniform. Ten years ago, health care cost the Pentagon $19 billion; today, it tops $50 billion; five years from now it is projected to cost $65 billion.
But Tricare fees have not increased since 1995.
Mr. Gates was expected to press for increasing the cost of health insurance premiums and spot fees only for working-age retirees and their families, not for those on active duty or those 65 and older, to save $7 billion over five years.
Mr. Gates also announced cuts in several weapons systems, led by the cancellation of the Marines' $14.4 billion Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, a combined landing craft and tank for amphibious assaults.
Mr. Gates said the Pentagon would add $4.6 billion to the cost of developing the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, made by Lockheed Martin, and would cover much of that expense by delaying purchases of 124 of the planes.
He said that one of the three versions of the aircraft might need to be redesigned, and that he was placing that model, made for the Marines, "on the equivalent of a two-year probation."
Federal officials said Mr. Gates had been seeking to increase the basic Pentagon budget, excluding war costs, to $566 billion for the 2012 fiscal year, but had to push the White House to approve $553 billion.
Gordon Adams, a Clinton administration budget official who served on Mr. Obama's transition team, said he understood that White House budget officials initially wanted to shave the Pentagon's original, larger request by at least $20 billion for 2012.
Mr. Adams said Mr. Gates met with Mr. Obama three times before Christmas to get at least $7 billion restored. Mr. Gates was also able to persuade the White House to reduce its demands for cuts over the next five years to $78 billion from $150 billion. Even so, Mr. Adams said, "I think the floor under defense spending has now gone soft."

Full text: World food prices continued to rise sharply in December, bringing them close to the crisis levels that provoked shortages and riots in poor countries three years ago, according to newly released United Nations data.
Prices are expected to remain high this year, prompting concern that the world may be approaching another crisis, although economists cautioned that many factors, like adequate stockpiles of key grains, could prevent a serious problem.
The United Nations data measures commodity prices on the world export market. Those are generally far removed from supermarket prices in wealthy countries like the United States. In this country, food price inflation has been relatively tame, and prices are forecast to rise only 2 to 3 percent this year.
But the situation is often different in poor countries that rely more heavily on imports. The food price index of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization rose 32 percent from June to December, according to the report published Wednesday. In December, the index was slightly higher than it was in June 2008, its previous peak. The index is not adjusted for inflation, however, making an exact comparison over time difficult.
The global index was pushed up last year by rising prices for cooking oils, grains, sugar and meat, all of which could continue to remain high or rise.
"We are at a very high level," said Abdolreza Abbassian, an economist for the organization, which is based in Rome. "These levels in the previous episode led to problems and riots across the world."
Mr. Abbassian said that bad weather affecting commodity crops in many exporting countries might help keep prices high over the next several months.
"The concern is that the long duration of the high prices for the months to come may eventually result in these high prices reaching the domestic markets of these poorer countries," he said. "In the event of that, there is the chance of the repeat of the events of 2007 and 2008."
At that time, high petroleum prices, growing world demand for food and poor harvests in some areas combined to sharply push up food prices in poorer importing countries. That led to shortages and sometimes deadly riots in several countries, including Egypt, Haiti, Somalia and Cameroon.
Mr. Abbassian said there were several crucial differences this year.
Countries in central, western and southern Africa have had generally good harvests from crops planted last year, easing reliance on imports. And grain prices remain significantly below the highs they hit in 2007 and 2008. Export prices for rice are 40 to 50 percent below those highs, he said.
Grain prices have a much greater impact on the food budgets of people in poor countries than prices for commodities like sugar or meat, which tend to make up a much smaller portion of their diet.
In addition, global supplies of rice and wheat are much more robust today than during the crisis.
But ensuring sufficient grain supplies depends on good harvests this year in major exporting countries. Dry conditions in Argentina that could hurt corn, and soybean crops are worrisome, Mr. Abbassian said. Heavy rains in Australia delayed the wheat harvest there, resulting in a poorer crop. In the United States, harsh, dry weather is expected to hurt the winter wheat crop.
Gawain M. Kripke, policy director of Oxfam America, said the food price increases were a polite warning. "We may get much more rude warnings soon," he said.
The United Nations estimates that nearly one billion people worldwide do not get enough food, Mr. Kripke noted. "That's almost certain to increase as prices rise, especially if they rise in an aggressive manner, which they are," he said. In the United States, meanwhile, the Agriculture Department has predicted that retail food prices will rise 2 to 3 percent in 2011. That is a higher rate than in the last two years but less than the 5.5 percent food inflation that hit American consumers in 2008. In November, the last month for which data is available, food prices in the United States rose 1.5 percent compared with the same month the previous year.
Joseph Glauber, the Agriculture Department's chief economist, said that rising world commodity prices could be expected to have their greatest impact in this country on meat and dairy prices because they can push up the price of livestock feed.
As feed prices go up, farmers often cut the size of herds, meaning less meat ultimately reaches the market. Beef, pork and dairy prices rose faster last year than overall food prices and are expected to continue that trend this year.

Full text: Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, left, struggled to muster support for his government on Monday, a day after a second ally left his governing coalition. But at a time when the economy is teetering, discontent is growing over inflation, and the United States is seeking greater military cooperation, no political party seems eager to join the government. A consensus seemed to be emerging among opposition politicians and analysts that Mr. Gilani would remain in office, but weakened and even less able to govern.

Full text: If there's one piece of economic wisdom I hope people will grasp this year, it's this: Even though we may finally have stopped digging, we're still near the bottom of a very deep hole.
Why do I need to point this out? Because I've noticed many people overreacting to recent good economic news. What particularly concerns me is the risk of self-denying optimism -- that is, I worry that policy makers will look at a few favorable economic indicators, decide that they no longer need to promote recovery, and take steps that send us sliding right back to the bottom.
So, about that good news: various economic indicators, ranging from relatively good holiday sales to new claims for unemployment insurance (which have finally fallen below 400,000 a week), suggest that the great post-bubble retrenchment may finally be ending.
We're not talking Morning in America here. Construction shows no sign of returning to bubble-era levels, nor are there any indications that debt-burdened families are going back to their old habits of spending all they earned. But all we needed for a modest economic rebound was for construction to stop falling and saving to stop rising -- and that seems to be happening. Forecasters have been marking up their predictions; growth as high as 4 percent this year now looks possible.
Hooray! But then again, not so much. Jobs, not G.D.P. numbers, are what matter to American families. And when you start from an unemployment rate of almost 10 percent, the arithmetic of job creation -- the amount of growth you need to get back to a tolerable jobs picture -- is daunting.
First of all, we have to grow around 2.5 percent a year just to keep up with rising productivity and population, and hence keep unemployment from rising. That's why the past year and a half was technically a recovery but felt like a recession: G.D.P. was growing, but not fast enough to bring unemployment down.
Growth at a rate above 2.5 percent will bring unemployment down over time. But the gains aren't one for one: for a variety of reasons, it has historically taken about two extra points of growth over the course of a year to shave one point off the unemployment rate.
Now do the math. Suppose that the U.S. economy were to grow at 4 percent a year, starting now and continuing for the next several years. Most people would regard this as excellent performance, even as an economic boom; it's certainly higher than almost all the forecasts I've seen.
Yet the math says that even with that kind of growth the unemployment rate would be close to 9 percent at the end of this year, and still above 8 percent at the end of 2012. We wouldn't get to anything resembling full employment until late in Sarah Palin's first presidential term.
Seriously, what we're looking at over the next few years, even with pretty good growth, are unemployment rates that not long ago would have been considered catastrophic -- because they are. Behind those dry statistics lies a vast landscape of suffering and broken dreams. And the arithmetic says that the suffering will continue as far as the eye can see.
So what can be done to accelerate this all-too-slow process of healing? A rational political system would long since have created a 21st-century version of the Works Progress Administration -- we'd be putting the unemployed to work doing what needs to be done, repairing and improving our fraying infrastructure. In the political system we have, however, Senator-elect Kelly Ayotte, delivering the Republican weekly address on New Year's Day, declared that "Job one is to stop wasteful Washington spending."
Realistically, the best we can hope for from fiscal policy is that Washington doesn't actively undermine the recovery. Beware, in particular, the Ides of March: by then, the federal government will probably have hit its debt limit and the G.O.P. will try to force President Obama into economically harmful spending cuts.
I'm also worried about monetary policy. Two months ago, the Federal Reserve announced a new plan to promote job growth by buying long-term bonds; at the time, many observers believed that the initial $600 billion purchase was only the beginning of the story. But now it looks like the end, partly because Republicans are trying to bully the Fed into pulling back, but also because a run of slightly better economic news provides an excuse to do nothing.
There's even a significant chance that the Fed will raise interest rates later this year -- or at least that's what the futures market seems to think. Doing so in the face of high unemployment and minimal inflation would be crazy, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.
So back to my original point: whatever the recent economic news, we're still near the bottom of a very deep hole. We can only hope that enough policy makers understand that point.

Abstract: The Postal Service's request for an emergency 2-cent increase to cover financial losses was turned down by the Postal Regulatory Commission in the fall, although the post office is allowed to raise first-class rates by an amount not exceeding the annual inflation rate without approval.

Full text: About 70 new stamp designs that the United States Postal Service plans to issue this year will commemorate familiar themes and subjects: famous people, historic events, America's cultural heritage and holidays. But in a twist, nearly every new first-class stamp will bear the word "Forever" in place of a monetary denomination, and will remain valid regardless of any price increases.
President Ronald Reagan, former Representative Barbara Jordan, the actor Gregory Peck and the singer Selena are all due to be honored on stamps in 2011, along with the Lunar New Year, the Indianapolis 500, jazz music, American industrial designers and the 150th anniversaries of Kansas' statehood and the outbreak of the Civil War.
The volume of first-class mail has declined precipitously in recent years, but collecting stamps is still big business.
The Postal Service reported delivering 170 billion pieces of mail in the year ending Sept. 30, down from 202 billion two years earlier. It also reported a net loss of $8.5 billion. But the sale of stamps to collectors brought in an estimated $300 million last year, said Roy A. Betts, a Postal Service spokesman. In 2005, collectors bought about $200 million worth of stamps.
When the Postal Service announced its lineup of 2011 stamps in August, it planned for most of them to be inscribed with "44," or whatever the rate would be at the time for a first-class letter.
The Postal Service's request for an emergency 2-cent increase to cover financial losses was turned down by the Postal Regulatory Commission in the fall, although the post office is allowed to raise first-class rates by an amount not exceeding the annual inflation rate without approval. That would translate to a 1-cent increase from the current rate, which is still 44 cents. The rate had been expected to go up in February, but Mr. Betts said that was "not going to happen." The new postmaster general, Patrick R. Donahoe, plans to make an announcement when he is sworn in Jan. 14.
Mr. Reagan was honored by a 37-cent stamp in 2005, shortly after his death. That design was reissued the following year, when the rate was 39 cents. Those stamps are still valid, but users must add postage to equal the full current rate. That would be unnecessary with the new stamp, which will mark the centennial of Mr. Reagan's birth in February.
The Postal Service issued its first "Forever" stamp in 2007 with a generic Liberty Bell design. Other countries have issued nondenominated commemorative stamps for years: Britain inscribes its issues with "1st," and Canada's stamps have a small red maple leaf and a "P" for permanent.
The stamp commemorating Ms. Jordan, the Texas congresswoman, who died in 1996, is to be issued in September as part of the annual Black Heritage series. The Peck stamp, to be issued in April, is also part of a continuing series, Legends of Hollywood.
Selena, who was killed in 1995, will be honored as part of a Latin music set that will include stamps for Tito Puente, Carmen Miranda, Carlos Gardel and Celia Cruz. Other issues will pay tribute to 12 "pioneers of American industrial design" as well as Mark Twain, the painter Edward Hopper, the astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr., the actress Helen Hayes and a dog named Owney, a 19-century post office mascot who resides, stuffed, in the Smithsonian Institution's National Postal Museum.

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The second-largest party in the ruling coalition here announced late Sunday that it was ending its partnership with the Pakistan Peoples Party, putting into question the fate of Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani's government, which is grappling with a fragile economy as it tries to ward off political and terrorism-related troubles.
Although the coalition partner, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, or M.Q.M., cited rising fuel prices, inflation and mismanagement by the government as the reasons for the move, some analysts said it was a pretext to negotiate a larger role in the national coalition and in Sindh Province, whose capital, Karachi, is the country's financial hub.
"This is not going to lead to the fall of the government," said Najam Sethi, one of the country's leading political analysts, but he conceded that "this is a very tricky situation."
Although the M.Q.M. left the national coalition, depriving it of a majority in the National Assembly, it remained in the coalition government in Sindh.
"These guys are just trying to negotiate to extract maximum concessions and are playing to the national sentiment," Mr. Sethi said. "These are just political tactics, and if there was a move to bring down the government, then there would have been better coordination between opposition parties."
Other analysts agreed that the opposition was too fragmented to oust the government. The M.Q.M has indicated that it will not try to destabilize the government.
Although the government is expected to survive, for now, the move further weakens a coalition that is struggling to govern and that the United States is pressing to cooperate more fully in the war in Afghanistan and in opposition to the Taliban.
President Asif Ali Zardari, who is a co-chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, has spent the last several days in Karachi trying to iron out differences with the M.Q.M., which traditionally has had a hold over the city.
Mr. Gilani tried to assure the nation, rather despairingly, that his government would survive despite the sudden turn of events. "I don't see any crisis," he was quoted as saying by local news media outlets.
In theory, the loss of the M.Q.M. leaves Mr. Gilani's government susceptible to a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly. But such a vote would require cooperation among all opposition parties, and that is seen as unlikely.
Ejaz Haider, a leading political commentator and a contributing editor of The Friday Times, a Lahore-based weekly, said the political crisis could unfold in various ways, subject in large part to decisions by the M.Q.M. "The next week is going to be interesting," Mr. Haider said.
Mr. Sethi said: "Nobody wants an election right now. All political actors want the government to deal with difficult questions like the economy, relations with America, terrorism."
Arif Rafiq, a political analyst based in Washington, agreed. "No one wants to rule in Islamabad right now," Mr. Rafiq said. "The economy is a mess, and the International Monetary Fund is pushing the federal government to impose deeply unpopular taxes. I do not anticipate a push for a confidence vote or the fall of the government in the next few months."
"What we'll have is an extremely weak Gilani government vulnerable to exploitation from a number of parties, including religious parties and the M.Q.M.," he added.
"These parties will continue to oppose new taxes and a military operation in North Waziristan. The P.P.P. government will be sandwiched between the U.S. and I.M.F. on one side and the opposition parties on the other."
Mr. Haider predicted, however, that the government would not be able to complete its five-year term, which began after elections in 2008.
There has been some speculation that President Zardari has had differences with Mr. Gilani, who has started to act more independently despite having been nominated by the president.
"I think President Zardari is not too concerned right now," Mr. Sethi said. "The heat is off Zardari and it is on Prime Minister Gilani. Either this will eventually lead to a change of the prime minister or Mr. Gilani would have to get his act together."

Abstract: To finance these expectations, we have continued to borrow extensively from the future -- think subprime mortgages, household credit card balances, the federal debt, the trade deficit and more -- with turbulent and, at times, nearly disastrous results. With that as his starting point, Mr. Whalen sets out on a high-speed chase through specific moments in the nation's economic and political history: the longstanding debate about a national bank in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the issuance of paper money to finance the Union effort during the Civil War; the panic of 1893 and resulting depression; the government debt issued to finance both world wars; and the stagflation and the changing world order that began in the 1970s.

Full text: "THE past is never dead," William Faulkner wrote in 1951. "It's not even past." Six decades later, R. Christopher Whalen takes up the gauntlet implied in those words in "Inflated: How Money and Debt Built the American Dream" (John Wiley & Sons, $34.95).
Mr. Whalen, a consultant and former investment banker, marches zealously back in time to try to understand the long-term viability of the American economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
The author sees a conflict at the heart of Americans' attitudes toward money and debt. We tend to view ourselves "as reasonably prudent and sober people," he writes, while "the choices we make at the ballot box seem to be at odds with that self-image."
"As a nation," he says, "we seem to feel entitled to a national agenda and standard of living that is beyond our current income."
To finance these expectations, we have continued to borrow extensively from the future -- think subprime mortgages, household credit card balances, the federal debt, the trade deficit and more -- with turbulent and, at times, nearly disastrous results.
With that as his starting point, Mr. Whalen sets out on a high-speed chase through specific moments in the nation's economic and political history: the longstanding debate about a national bank in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; the issuance of paper money to finance the Union effort during the Civil War; the panic of 1893 and resulting depression; the government debt issued to finance both world wars; and the stagflation and the changing world order that began in the 1970s.
In each of these instances, Mr. Whalen bemoans Americans' reliance on paper money and debt financing -- a reliance, he contends, that is often fostered to expand political, business and financial leaders' power and wealth.
The book is lively and opinionated throughout. In the first half, which runs roughly up to World War I, the author recounts the long-simmering debate, initiated by Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, about the benefits and costs of consolidated financial power. He also criticizes Abraham Lincoln for "taking the United States down the road to political control over the nature of money via the Legal Tender Act of 1862," which authorized the federal government to pay its bills in paper money not backed by an equal amount of gold or silver.
And his descriptions of the enormous -- and, at times, audacious -- power of J. P. Morgan and others in the Gilded Age call to mind bankers in some of our largest financial institutions today.
But when the book turns in its second half to the 20th century, it is less successful. It appears so intent on impugning government indebtedness and what it sees as sloppy monetary management that it seems to lose sight of the larger historical context and the importance of presenting plenty of supporting evidence for its passionate contentions.
Mr. Whalen argues that America's present-day troubles date back to the days when it entered World War I. Decision makers -- public and private -- chose to finance the war's cost through an enormous increase in the federal debt. In an easy, almost painless way, "the country accepted the idea of prosperity via borrowing," he writes.
This is a thought-provoking but somewhat narrow reading of history. It is nigh impossible for any power to finance a major war without raising debt -- usually lots of debt. Always has been. Given the importance of these choices to Mr. Whalen's larger argument, he should deal much more fully with the imperatives confronting the crucial actors. He could also offer more supporting evidence that big increases in federal indebtedness translated into collective acceptance of a prosperity achieved through borrowing.
In his eyes, such acceptance aggravated the Great Depression, ushering in the New Deal -- which he calls the "rise of the corporate state." The attitude also encouraged deficit spending, driving what he calls "an underlying rate of inflation that has steadily sapped the purchasing power of the dollar."
The book is on thin ice here. Explaining the causes of the Depression and its larger legacy is one of the thorniest, most crowded topics in economic history. Mr. Whalen should bring much more support to bear on his particular reading of history and present such evidence more systematically.
The aftermath of World War II witnessed continued federal government intervention in the economy. "Members of both major political parties in the United States," Mr. Whalen writes, "became convinced that deficit spending would employ unused resources, correct market failures and produce optimal economic results."
In the final chapters, the author recounts the emergence of stagflation in the 1970s and describes several downturns since 1980. In recent decades, he writes, financial and economic trends "have merely confirmed the pattern set in the preceding years, with public-sector debt and other government obligations, and inflation, growing at a pace much faster than the real economy."
Mr. Whalen concludes that we need to develop frameworks that distinguish between "real economic growth and the illusions of growth created by inflation and credit-driven speculation."
We have borrowed heavily against the future to fund our historically high standard of living, he says -- a standard that we have not previously been willing to finance in real time, through fiscal austerity or more household industry.
Much of this borrowing has been from foreign lenders, who may not always be willing to finance American consumption, he points out. "Do we have the courage," he asks, "to lead another global discussion with other nations about the dollar and America's infatuation with inflation and debt?"
Mr. Whalen raises timely, important issues. But he might have made his case for financial responsibility and prudent monetary oversight with a slower, more careful reading of American political and economic history.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
New year, new you.
You've heard it before and probably said it out loud as part of various resolutions you've made over the years. But now, an increasing number of employers want to get into the act: They want to shape you up by paying you or otherwise bribing you to do so.
Over the last decade or so, some companies have made sporadic efforts to adopt workplace wellness programs, some of which had incentives of various sorts attached. Their hope was that the cost of rewarding good behavior would be dwarfed by the cost savings that come from lower medical costs and higher productivity later on.
Two things have happened recently that will probably bring more incentives to more people.
First, the new health care law explicitly grants permission to employers to offer rewards of up to 30 percent of the total cost of health insurance to employees. Those winnings, often in the form of lower premiums, will go to people who join wellness programs and hit certain health goals.
Second, UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest insurance companies, now has its own program, called Personal Rewards. Companies like Pitney Bowes and Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate services firm, have signed up.
For people already taking reasonably good care of themselves, the rewards can't come fast enough. "Health insurance is the only one that doesn't have a good-driver discount," said Sean Forbes, president of Virgin HealthMiles, an incentive program that companies can use alongside any insurance plan.
Employers, however, are less worried about those people than they are about the sedentary, the overweight and the fried-chicken addicted. A big percentage of the costs employers face for people with diabetes and hypertension springs from behavior, not genetics. So their big question is this: Just how much do they have to pay to get people to shape up enough to make the incentive programs worthwhile?
The value of the perks, which can include discounted travel and merchandise, can spiral well into the four figures annually for employees. So it may be worth lobbying your employer to try one of the programs. But even if you work for yourself or an employer who doesn't want to take this on, there are plenty of ways to create your own incentive program, from seeking sponsorships to placing outright wagers.
First, however, you need to know what behavior it is you want to incentivize. UnitedHealth suggests rewarding people for having a variety of vital signs tested and then giving them more points for hitting goals for things like blood pressure, body mass index and cholesterol.
You might get more points for undergoing various screenings, including breast, colorectal and prostate. People with chronic conditions could earn even more points for further testing and completing disease management programs.
Some companies tack on their own extras. Jones Lang LaSalle added a reward for participating in a back health program, since chronic back conditions are one of the company's biggest sources of insurance claims.
Then, companies need to decide what to give away in exchange for the points that employees earn -- and how much of it. Pitney Bowes will give $350 each to employees and covered spouses or domestic partners who hit all their marks this year.
The company plans to distribute the money in a lump sum via paychecks at the end of the year. But to my mind, the image of the boss walking around the office handing out stacks of hundred-dollar bills might increase participation even further.
The outfit that seems to have more experience with these kinds of incentive programs than any on the planet is a South African company called Discovery. When I last wrote about the company, in a 2006 Wall Street Journal article, it was storming the shores of the United States with high-deductible health insurance plans coupled with a wellness incentive program called Vitality.
That proved to be an act of hubris, because it's very difficult for a start-up insurer to win market share without access to the physician and hospital discounts that larger competitors can command. The company is now out of the insurance business in the United States but is rebuilding its American operation around its wellness program.
Now known here as the Vitality Group, the company encourages corporate customers to sign everyone up. It offers to refund as much as 20 percent of its fees if client companies don't see improvement in the health of their workers.
The thing I like most about Vitality, however, is that it allows you to earn various levels of elite status, depending on how many of your goals you reach, how often you go to the gym, whether you take a C.P.R. course and any number of other things.
This is taken straight from the playbook of airline frequent-flier programs, and, as is almost always the case with AAdvantage and Mileage Plus, you need to requalify annually for Vitality's bronze, silver, gold and platinum status. That helps force people to take care of themselves year after year.
The rewards are pretty good, too, including deeply discounted nights at the Ritz-Carlton for platinum members. Vitality's president and chief executive, Arthur Carlos, estimates that a platinum member who works hard at taking advantage of the program can extract more than $5,000 in annual value through the company's network of gym, travel and other discounts.
If you want your own vacation at the Ritz but, say, work for yourself, there may be a way to get it. You can set a goal for yourself, perhaps losing 20 percent of your body weight or greatly lowering your cholesterol. Then let a skeptical friend bet a few hotel nights that you can't pull it off.
You could also use a site like stickk.com, which helps you to penalize yourself financially for not hitting goals. Or you can ask 100 people to sponsor you for $10 each and donate the money to a worthy cause once you hit the mark you've set.
Then again, you might just do what my rapidly disappearing colleague Brian Stelter did: Take to Twitter and use the prospect of public failure to keep you in line. The guy has lost about 90 pounds and now weighs in at a comparatively svelte 180.
The one question that employers and individuals want answered, however, is whether any of this works over the long haul. UnitedHealth says that its projections for its new program show a positive return on its investment in year two on the money that client companies are paying to enroll their workers.
The Vitality Group points to a series of studies its parent company published in 2008 using its own data, all of which I've linked to here in the online version of the column. One study shows that employees of client companies who were enrolled and highly engaged in Vitality and had multiple chronic conditions had, in most cases, lower rates of hospital admission and shorter stays than people with the same conditions who were not participating as aggressively.
Dana Goldman, a senior economist with the RAND Corporation and a professor of medicine and public policy at the University of Southern California, said that the Vitality study can tell you only so much until you compare the employees in its study with others who had no option to join a wellness program and then study both groups over much longer periods.
Corporate benefits managers get this, but they're willing to try anyway in the face of annual increases in health care costs that far outpace inflation. "I think it leans more toward a leap of faith," said Mary Bradley, director of health care planning for Pitney Bowes.
Then again, employers may not be interested in long-term data (or long-term results). In the medium term, many of their employees may leave for other jobs or get laid off. At that point, they become someone else's cost burden. And over the long haul, most people end up in the hands of the federal government and its Medicare program anyhow.
That's why Mr. Goldman wishes the government would find new ways to encourage people to exercise more. "Medicare should be paying people to take 45-year-olds for walks," he said, with only the slightest hint of a chuckle. "People look at you like you're crazy when you say that, but it would help lots of people get better."
Indeed, that wouldn't be just a health program. It could solve the jobs problem in the coming year as well.
Correction: January 5, 2011, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Your Money column on Saturday, about health incentives in the workplace, referred imprecisely to a provision of the new federal health law. The law allows employers to offer rewards to employees of up to 30 percent of the total cost of health insurance (or up to 50 percent in some circumstances); 30 percent is not the minimum amount of rewards allowed.

Abstract: To be sure, investors still have roughly $4 trillion in domestic stock funds, but that flight from the market is reflected in other figures, like shrinking trading volume. Typically, bond prices go up and yields drop when economic growth is anemic, reversing course when economic activity picks up and the threat of inflation reawakens.

Full text: An economy stuck in neutral. Unemployment that refused to go down. And a near financial disaster in Europe.
Despite all the negatives -- and a few surprises, like the terrifying "flash crash" of the stock market in May -- 2010 proved in the end to be a pretty good year for investors, especially if you were lucky enough to own shares in highflying technology stocks, old-fashioned industrials or gold.
"In many cases, the conventional wisdom was wrong," said Byron R. Wien, a veteran market strategist at the Blackstone Group. "The market still managed to do well, and the rise in gold and other commodities was a big surprise."
The typical equity fund in the United States returned nearly 19 percent in 2010, while the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.8 percent. That was below the gains of 2009, when the markets rebounded from the financial crisis and the S.&P. index soared 23 percent.
Few expected such robust results for 2010 when the year began, said Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup.
"People were worried about interest rates going up, double dips and the housing market falling," Mr. Levkovich said, just to name a few of the concerns. Those fears have not disappeared, "but a level of optimism has returned. We didn't go off the cliff."
So why did stocks do well this year when so much seemed to be going wrong?
One factor, analysts say, was the unexpected surge in corporate earnings throughout the year, helped largely by cost-cutting. Then the government pitched in: The Federal Reserve's decision in early November to pump $600 billion into the economy by buying Treasury assets, along with tax cuts passed by the lame-duck Congress in December, helped propel a year-end rally, lifting the benchmark S.&P. index by about 6.5 percent in December alone.
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.8 points, to 11,577.51. That made for an 11 percent gain in 2010. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was less than a point lower, at 1,257.64. The Nasdaq lost 10.11 points, or 0.38 percent, to finish at 2,652.87.
While stocks performed well over all, a small group of listings played an outsize role. Within the S.&P. 500, Mr. Levkovich said, the top 50 performing stocks contributed about 60 percent of the jump in the index.
Technology was again a star, paced by Netflix, up 219 percent, making it the single best performer in the index. F5 Networks, which makes equipment to manage Internet traffic, was No. 2, rising about 146 percent.
Cummins, the engine maker, took third place with a 140 percent gain. Automakers also did well, with Ford rising about 68 percent even as General Motors returned to the stock market in a $23 billion initial public offering, the biggest in United States history.
But many individual investors missed the party, having taken their money out of stocks. They were scared off, it seems, because of the volatility that followed the brief 1,000-point drop on May 6, the so-called flash crash, as well as lingering concerns from the financial crisis of 2008, including a housing and unemployment hangover.
"Investors in general tend to have a reduced tolerance for risk," said Brian Reid, chief economist of the Investment Company Institute.
The institute estimates that investors withdrew $80 billion from domestic equity mutual funds in 2010, while they added more than $250 billion to bond funds. To be sure, investors still have roughly $4 trillion in domestic stock funds, but that flight from the market is reflected in other figures, like shrinking trading volume.
Total volume was down 16 percent from 2009, and was 24 percent below the levels of 2008, according to Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with Standard and Poor's. That ate into the results of major banks and brokerage firms, like Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab, which rely on trading commissions.
The government bond market was precarious as well. Typically, bond prices go up and yields drop when economic growth is anemic, reversing course when economic activity picks up and the threat of inflation reawakens.
Indeed, as it became clear the economy was sputtering in the spring and the European debt crisis worsened, investors began pouring money into bonds, eventually sending yields to all-time lows by early October. The yield on the two-year government bond, for example, fell below 0.4 percent in early October, a record low.
On Friday, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 20/32, to 94 13/32, and the yield fell to 3.29 percent from 3.36 percent late Thursday.
But with the announcement of the Federal Reserve's aggressive asset-purchase program and the extension of Bush-era tax cuts that were due to expire, bonds began to sell off in November and December even as stocks rallied, sending yields higher.
James Caron, head of global interest rate and currency strategy at Morgan Stanley, said 2010 was a year of reversals in the bond market. He added, "You had a 180-degree shift from gloom and doom to optimism."
For the year, the typical bond fund returned 5.6 percent, according to Morningstar.
Bonds may be a traditional refuge in turbulent markets, but it was gold, a haven for value since ancient times, that really shined. Like bonds, gold benefited from a flight to safety spurred by the European debt crisis. But it also raced higher on fears that budget deficits in Western countries, including the United States, are unsustainable and that lax monetary policies would weaken the value of paper currencies over time.
"People are disenchanted with paper currencies. They want to own something real, and over centuries gold has proven to be real," Mr. Wien said.
The returns were real too, with the typical gold mutual fund, including mining companies and a range of precious metals, moving higher by 40 percent. Gold itself rose from $1,096.95 at the start of the year to $1,420.78 on Friday. Crude oil, another closely watched commodity, rose from $79.86 a barrel to $91.38 a barrel on Friday, after rising 78 percent in 2009.
Underpinning the rally, most analysts said, were strong earnings, but in what is likely to be a worry for next year, the profits were bolstered by job cuts and other restructuring efforts, rather than revenue growth.
In the third quarter of the year, for example, earnings were 31 percent higher than last year, but revenue increased by just 8 percent. The disparity was even greater in the first quarter, as earnings jumped 58 percent but revenue rose only 11 percent.
With only so much room to cut costs, analysts say that kind of performance will be difficult to repeat, perhaps boding ill for stocks this year. Analysts expect profits to increase by 13.4 percent in 2011, far lower than the estimated 37.8 percent gain for 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
To make matters worse, Wall Street is brimming with optimism, which in the looking-glass world of investing can actually be a signal to sell.
"The good news has been priced in, and the potential negatives have been ignored," said Jason Hsu, chief investment officer of Research Affiliates, a money manager in Newport Beach, Calif., that oversees $70 billion in assets. "The market is going to get more nervous at these valuations."

Full text: As the last few days of 2010 play out, it appears that the movie box office will be down for the year, but not by much.
Paul Dergarabedian, the box-office analyst for Hollywood.com, estimates that total ticket sales for 2010 will weigh in at $10.556 billion, just under the $10.6 billion posted last year, which was a record. The revenue number, as has been usual in recent years, was helped along by ticket price inflation.
Attendance, Mr. Dergarabedian estimates, fell 5.36 percent from last year. The big hit was "Toy Story 3," which has posted about $415 million in ticket sales since its release by Disney in June.
Meanwhile, the number of films released in the United States has continued to fall. As of Wednesday, Boxofficemojo.com had tracked 517 releases, down from a recent peak of 631 in 2007.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Washington
It was the year that the economy started to recover and then slid back into a slump -- only to offer reason for renewed hope in the final weeks.
When 2010 began, hiring and consumer spending were finally picking up. But then something changed in the spring -- a combination of the debt troubles in Europe, the fading of stimulus spending and the usual caution by businesses and consumers after a financial crisis. By the summer, the unemployment rate was rising again, and Americans' attitudes about the future were again souring.
Making matters worse, many of the economy's long-term problems also became more severe this year. Health care costs continued to rise faster than inflation, and the number of uninsured continued to grow. The most recent climate data suggested 2010 would be the hottest or second-hottest year ever recorded; the 10 hottest have all occurred in the last 13 years, creating serious risks for the planet and its economy. The federal budget deficit ballooned further (though it should grow during an economic slump).
The reasons for optimism about 2011 come from both Washington and the private sector. The Federal Reserve and Congress have finally taken more action to lift economic growth, and the latest data -- on consumer spending and jobless claims, among other things -- has been good. The housing market remains weak, but sales and prices are no longer plunging.
On the longer-term issues, the recent work by President Obama's bipartisan deficit commission suggested that Democrats and Republicans might eventually find some common ground on the issue. And the health care overhaul passed in March -- assuming it survives legal challenges -- is likely to cut the number of uninsured sharply and to reduce cost growth modestly. The one issue that offers little reason for optimism is climate change.
Among the big questions for 2011 are: How severe will state and local budget crises turn out to be? Will Europe's debt troubles spread to Spain, Portugal or elsewhere? Will Congress and the White House manage to focus on the long-run causes of the deficit -- or instead cut federal spending immediately and jeopardize the recovery? Will consumers continue to increase their spending and give businesses the confidence to hire?
To look back at 2010 and to look ahead, we have put together a series of charts. If there is an overall message, it's that the economy still needs a whole lot of work.

Full text: LONDON -- "We told you so."
When the treaty establishing Europe's common currency was approved in the early 1990s, Europe's political and business elite had high hopes that it would bind the Continent's disparate economies and often bickering nations as never before.
And as the euro made its debut in the early 2000s, there was an outpouring of support from many citizens pleased that they would no longer have to change Spanish pesetas to French francs or Dutch guilders to German marks as they crossed borders from one country to another.
But not everybody was caught up in the celebration. A noisy band of dissenters, many of them economists from outside the Continent, issued a warning: the euro was doomed to struggle, they proclaimed, maybe not immediately but certainly before long. Different countries would pursue such different economic policies, they argued, that it would ultimately place an unbearable strain on the currency and some of its members.
Today, many of those predictions -- handily dismissed at the time -- are coming true.
For most of 2010, Europe struggled to contain a debt crisis that has prompted investors to drive up the yield on government bonds. And despite two bailouts -- for Greece and for Ireland -- the anxiety has not dissipated, and attention has turned to other faltering economies like Portugal and Spain.
Last Friday, the cost of insuring Greek debt pushed higher on speculation that Athens might restructure its debt in 2013. That followed a warning on Thursday by Fitch, a major credit rating agency, that a downgrade of Greek debt was imminent. Fitch had already downgraded Portugal's debt on concerns about its growth prospects and its ability to cut its deficit.
"I knew from the very beginning that putting all these heterogeneous countries together would not work," said Wilhelm Nolling, a member of Germany's Bundesbank governing council before the establishment of the European Central Bank who is now a professor of economics at the University of Hamburg.
If history is any guide, these critics say, even more troubles could be on the way. They point to a handful of little-known and less ambitious common currency efforts that failed in the past.
To be sure, Europe's decision to embrace the euro was widely debated at the time, and even supporters worried that a monetary union without more political and social cohesion to back it up might founder.
But the criticisms were glossed over in the euphoria at the cold war's end and the hope that firm rules for countries joining the common currency would secure a unified economy and forge an unbreakable European identity.
The most forceful opposition was centered in Britain, which, along with Denmark, agreed to sign the Maastricht treaty in 1991 setting out the path to a European single currency only after insisting on the right to opt out of any final step.
And it was not just the perennial euro skeptics of Britain's Conservative Party who warned of troubles ahead. Ed Balls, then an obscure editorial writer for The Financial Times, wrote a report in 1992 identifying what he termed a crucial flaw in the plans for the euro: Europe lacked the type of federal taxes and transfer payments used in the United States to ease economic divergences among its many states.
Published by the Fabian Society, a left-of-center research group in London, the paper caught the eye of Gordon Brown, then shadow chancellor for the out-of-power Labour Party.
Mr. Brown hired Mr. Balls and then seized on his core argument when the Labour Party gained power in 1997 to insist that Britain stick with the pound -- despite general support for the euro from Prime Minister Tony Blair and a majority of the Labour Party hierarchy.
"Having the political will is not enough," Mr. Balls, who remains an important figure in the Labour Party, said. "You need a level of integration and commitment that goes well beyond that."
That it was a Labour and not a Tory government that kept Britain from joining the euro no doubt grates on the nerves of Britain's traditional euro skeptics.
For example, Norman Lamont, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer and the recognized leader of this pack, says he has "never heard of Balls's paper."
Mr. Lamont, who as chancellor from 1990 to 1993 led the British side in the Maastricht negotiations and pushed for the provision to opt out of the currency, points instead to a speech he gave in 1990 as the earliest and most specific public critique of plans to create the euro.
"The fact is that Europe is not ready for a single currency," Mr. Lamont said that November, a month after Britain joined the exchange rate system in Europe that preceded the euro.
The address was intended to bolster the flagging fortunes of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was on the verge of being ousted as leader by a growing pro-Europe faction within the Conservative Party.
Mr. Lamont highlighted the disparity in inflation, budget deficits and employment levels that separated poorer southern nations from core European economies. "So long as such divergence exists," he said, "a move to a single currency would represent a massive leap in the dark."
Mr. Lamont served as chancellor under Ms. Thatcher's successor, John Major, presiding over the pound's collapse and Britain's expulsion from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992.
As for his doubts about the euro, they have become even more pronounced.
"I have always said that the euro will break up," Mr. Lamont said in a recent interview. "Not after the first crisis today, but after the second crisis, which could be 10 years away. This is, after all a political project, not an economic project."
Mr. Lamont points out that previous currency projects in Europe, like the Latin monetary union formed by France, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland in 1865 and a similar one in Scandinavia, by Sweden, Denmark and Norway in 1875, lasted more than 30 years before they collapsed.
"The real problem is that the only way countries like Greece and Spain and Portugal can regain their competitiveness with Germany is to impose a decade of restrained living standards on their populations," he said. "That is the time bomb ticking inside the euro."
But for the euro's defenders, this crisis pales in comparison to the 20th century wars that tore Europe apart and represents little more than a speed bump on the road to an even more united Continent.
That view was put forward this month at the opening of the European Commission's new representative office in London. Called Europe House, the building is the former Tory headquarters where Mrs. Thatcher, Britain's most senior euro skeptic, celebrated three election wins -- a footnote that European officials highlighted smugly during the festivities.
"We remember what happened in the last big crisis -- it was something horrible, and such a threat is always waiting for us," said Jerzy Buzek, the former prime minister of Poland and current president of the European Parliament.
A glass of white wine in his hand, Mr. Buzek paid little mind to the notion that the current financial unrest in Europe would lead to the euro's collapse.
"Let us answer by having more solidarity," he said. "Overcoming history is an imperative for us."
Indeed, even in Ireland, which along with Greece has paid the steepest price for being tethered to the euro, economists are mostly uniform in their support of a single currency. They cite in particular the benefit of monetary stability and the fact that the euro zone has been saved from the harmful dynamic of competitive devaluations and capital controls that has flared up in emerging market economies.
"In an integrated world, having a common economic approach to policy has a lot of strength," said Philip R. Lane, an economist at Trinity College in Dublin who oversees the influential Irish Economy blog.
But Mr. Nolling insists that whatever the euro's advantages, in practice policy makers have gone too far in their effort to preserve the single currency. The financial rescues of Greece and Ireland, he contends, are "unconstitutional" because they violate the euro zone's no-bailout clause.
Germany's constitutional court is expected to rule on a case brought by Mr. Nolling and a group of like-minded economists and lawyers early next year. While few expect a decision that would reverse the Irish and Greek interventions, the challenge is a blunt reminder that Germany, the European nation with the deepest pockets, remains deeply divided over the merits of the single currency and that further financial rescues could face many obstacles, both political and legal.
"We were told that the euro would achieve peace in Europe forever," Mr. Nolling said, "but I am sad to say that the opposite is true."

MAP: Europe's Currency Club: The euro zone was created in 1999 with the establishment of the European Central Bank; the currency began to circulate in 2002. All European Union member states are committed to joining the euro zone once they meet certain criteria, with the exception of Britain and Denmark, which opted out before the zone was created. Of the 27 current members of the European Union, 16 use the common currency. So far, in addition to the 11 original members, five countries have joined and three others have set dates to join.

Full text: Alfred E. Kahn, a Cornell University economist best known as the chief architect and promoter of deregulating the nation's airlines, despite opposition from industry executives and unions alike, died Monday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 93.
The cause was cancer, Cornell said in a statement.
Mr. Kahn, a leading regulatory scholar who wielded his influence in both government and academia, helped spur a broad movement beginning in the mid-1970s toward freer markets in rail and automotive transportation, telecommunications, utilities and the securities markets.
Before deregulation, the airlines were tightly controlled by the Civil Aeronautics Board, which approved routes and set fares that guaranteed airlines a 12 percent return on flights that were 55 percent full. The changes Mr. Kahn orchestrated resulted in increased competition, lower fares and the rise of low-cost carriers like JetBlue and Southwest. But they also created severe financial problems for the industry, leading to bankruptcies and mergers.
"I have to concede that the competition that deregulation brought certainly was terribly, terribly hard on the airlines and their unions, who had heretofore enjoyed the benefits of protection from competition under regulation," Mr. Kahn said decades later.
He added that he accepted "some responsibility" for the industry's financial problems but said that it had eventually recovered, despite sharply rising oil prices and terrorist-related security costs.
Before he tackled such national issues, Mr. Kahn served as head of the New York State Public Service Commission, the regulator for electricity, gas, water and telephones. He introduced pricing that varied by season or time of day, producing efficiencies benefiting utilities and consumers.
But Mr. Kahn proved virtually helpless when, as the Consumer Price Index jumped in 1978 to 8 percent, President Jimmy Carter persuaded him to become inflation "czar" and to serve as chairman of the ill-fated Council on Wage and Price Stability, a job described by a sympathetic friend as serving as fire chief to a pyromaniac.
Before long in his new post, the voluble Mr. Kahn, shunning "recession" as a euphemism, warned of a "very serious depression" if inflation were not tamed, prompting a private rebuke by the president's chief domestic policy adviser, Stuart E. Eizenstat.
So instead, Mr. Kahn began referring in publicto a possible economic downturn as a "banana," only to be chided by the president of the United Fruit Company and induced to shift once again to a different euphemism, "kumquat."
Mr. Kahn, operating without staff of his own and with inflation accelerating to above 10 percent, became so frustrated in late 1979 that he asked to be relieved of the job. "I can't figure out why the president doesn't fire me," he joked grimly at the time. "Actually, I do know," he added. "Nobody would be foolish enough to take this job."
His most significant public policy impact was undoubtedly as chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which he joined in 1977 under pressure from Mr. Carter and Vice President Walter F. Mondale. What Mr. Kahn had really wanted was to head the Federal Communications Commission.
"I don't think it's my highest aspiration to make it possible for people to jet all over the world when the future clearly has to belong to substituting telecommunications for travel," he recalled in a 2008 interview for this obituary, explaining his lack of enthusiasm for the civil aeronautics job.
An academic, Mr. Kahn knew almost nothing about the airline business -- to him planes were just "marginal costs with wings" -- but he quickly mastered the arcana and politics of routes, pricing and costs.
"Fred was clearly the perfect man to lead the airline deregulation effort," said John H. Shenefield, a Washington lawyer, in a 2003 tribute as Mr. Kahn accepted an award from the American Antitrust Institute, describing him as "Carter's field general for deregulation."
Mr. Kahn, drawing on considerable gifts of persuasion and media insight, led the struggle for enactment of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the first total dismantling of a federal regulatory regime since the 1930s.
Washington, he argued in various settings, had long fostered airline inefficiency and by thwarting competition was enabling carriers to keep fares artificially high.
While the industry was financially battered by the new law and some smaller cities lost service, Mr. Kahn over the years stoutly defended his handiwork by saying that many more Americans were flying with greater choice of carriers and at lower fares than ever before.
Alfred Edward Kahn, known as Fred, was born on Oct. 17, 1917, in Paterson, N. J., the son of Russian immigrants, and came of age during the Depression, which prompted his interest in economics. His father worked in a silk mill, eventually owning one himself.
After taking degrees at New York University and a Ph.D. at Yale, Mr. Kahn went to Washington to work briefly as a economist for the Brookings Institution, the Justice Department's antitrust division and the War Production Board before a 1943 Army stint that ended with a discharge for poor eyesight after basic training.
He joined the Cornell faculty in 1947 after two years at Ripon College in Wisconsin, where he began an extended academic career distinguished by publication of "The Economics of Regulation," his landmark two-volume treatise, first published in 1970.
At Cornell, he served as dean of the college of arts and sciences and as a member of the board of trustees.
He became a favorite of colleagues and students, often holding forth while padding about in stocking feet or sitting with legs slung over the side of his chair.
Mr. Kahn was also an avid Savoyard, appearing in numerous campus productions of the light operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. "I was a ham," he acknowledged, which "made for a special relationship with the students."
For nearly 30 years the Kahns lived on a large waterfront property on Lake Cayuga in which, to justify what seemed to him an outrageous expense, he forced himself to swim every day until it was too cold. He continued swimming into his 90s.
Mr. Kahn is survived by his wife, Mary Simmons Kahn; two daughters, Rachel Kahn-Fogel of Colchester, Vt., and Hannah Kahn of Denver; a son, Joel, of Melbourne, Australia; a nephew for whom he and his wife were legal guardians, Peter S. Boone of Arlington, Va.; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
A longstanding revulsion to bureaucratic language, which he attacked in a widely reported episode four days after arriving at the C.A.B., never waned. Try to write, he told the staff in a memo, "in straight-forward quasi-conversational, humane prose -- as though you were talking to or communicating with real people."
This probably also impressed editors of the American Heritage Dictionary, on whose usage panel Mr. Kahn served for more than 25 years.

Abstract: American foreign-policy experts called for policies to secure access to this increasingly scarce resource; environmentalists advocated crash programs to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; companies producing power from wind and other alternative energies rushed to expand capacity. The past year the price has rebounded, but the average for 2010 has been just under $80, which is the equivalent of about $71 in 2005 dollars -- a little higher than the $65 at the time of our bet, but far below the $200 threshold set by Mr. Simmons.

Full text: Five years ago, Matthew R. Simmons and I bet $5,000. It was a wager about the future of energy supplies -- a Malthusian pessimist versus a Cornucopian optimist -- and now the day of reckoning is nigh: Jan. 1, 2011.
The bet was occasioned by a cover article in August 2005 in The New York Times Magazine titled "The Breaking Point." It featured predictions of soaring oil prices from Mr. Simmons, who was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the head of a Houston investment bank specializing in the energy industry, and the author of "Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy."
I called Mr. Simmons to discuss a bet. To his credit -- and unlike some other Malthusians -- he was eager to back his predictions with cash. He expected the price of oil, then about $65 a barrel, to more than triple in the next five years, even after adjusting for inflation. He offered to bet $5,000 that the average price of oil over the course of 2010 would be at least $200 a barrel in 2005 dollars.
I took him up on it, not because I knew much about Saudi oil production or the other "peak oil" arguments that global production was headed downward. I was just following a rule learned from a mentor and a friend, the economist Julian L. Simon.
As the leader of the Cornucopians, the optimists who believed there would always be abundant supplies of energy and other resources, Julian figured that betting was the best way to make his argument. Optimism, he found, didn't make for cover stories and front-page headlines.
No matter how many cheery long-term statistics he produced, he couldn't get as much attention as the gloomy Malthusians like Paul Ehrlich, the best-selling ecologist. Their forecasts of energy crises and resource shortages seemed not only newsier but also more intuitively correct. In a finite world with a growing population, wasn't it logical to expect resources to become scarcer and more expensive?
As an alternative to arguing, Julian offered to bet that the price of any natural resource chosen by a Malthusian wouldn't rise in the future. Dr. Ehrlich accepted and formed a consortium with two colleagues at Berkeley, John P. Holdren and John Harte, who were supposed to be experts in natural resources. In 1980, they picked five metals and bet that the prices would rise during the next 10 years.
By 1990, the prices were lower, and the Malthusians paid up, although they didn't seem to suffer any professional consequences. Dr. Ehrlich and Dr. Holdren both won MacArthur "genius awards" (Julian never did). Dr. Holdren went on to lead the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and today he serves as President Obama's science adviser.
Julian, who died in 1998, never managed to persuade Dr. Ehrlich or Dr. Holdren or other prominent doomsayers to take his bets again.
When I found a new bettor in 2005, the first person I told was Julian's widow, Rita Simon, a public affairs professor at American University. She was so happy to see Julian's tradition continue that she wanted to share the bet with me, so we each ended up each putting $2,500 against Mr. Simmons's $5,000.
Just as Mr. Simmons predicted, oil prices did soar well beyond $65. With the global economy booming in the summer of 2008, the price of a barrel of oil reached $145. American foreign-policy experts called for policies to secure access to this increasingly scarce resource; environmentalists advocated crash programs to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; companies producing power from wind and other alternative energies rushed to expand capacity.
When the global recession hit in the fall of 2008, the price plummeted below $50, but at the end of that year Mr. Simmons was quoted in The Baltimore Sun sounding confident. When Jay Hancock, a Sun financial columnist, asked if he was having any second thoughts about the wager, Mr. Simmons replied: "God, no. We bet on the average price in 2010. That's an eternity from now."
The past year the price has rebounded, but the average for 2010 has been just under $80, which is the equivalent of about $71 in 2005 dollars -- a little higher than the $65 at the time of our bet, but far below the $200 threshold set by Mr. Simmons.
What lesson do we draw from this? I'd hoped to let Mr. Simmons give his view, but I'm very sorry to report that he died in August, at the age of 67. The colleagues handling his affairs reviewed the numbers last week and declared that Mr. Simmons's $5,000 should be awarded to me and to Rita Simon on Jan. 1, but Mr. Simmons still had his defenders.
One of his friends and fellow peak-oil theorists, Steve Andrews, said that while Mr. Simmons had made "a bet too far," he was still correct in foreseeing more expensive oil. "The era of cheap oil has ended," Mr. Andrews said, and predicted problems ahead as production levels off.
It's true that the real price of oil is slightly higher now than it was in 2005, and it's always possible that oil prices will spike again in the future. But the overall energy situation today looks a lot like a Cornucopian feast, as my colleagues Matt Wald and Cliff Krauss have recently reported. Giant new oil fields have been discovered off the coasts of Africa and Brazil. The new oil sands projects in Canada now supply more oil to the United States than Saudi Arabia does. Oil production in the United States increased last year, and the Department of Energy projects further increases over the next two decades.
The really good news is the discovery of vast quantities of natural gas. It's now selling for less than half of what it was five years ago. There's so much available that the Energy Department is predicting low prices for gas and electricity for the next quarter-century. Lobbyists for wind farms, once again, have been telling Washington that the "sustainable energy" industry can't sustain itself without further subsidies.
As gas replaces dirtier fossil fuels, the rise in greenhouse gas emissions will be tempered, according to the Department of Energy. It projects that no new coal power plants will be built, and that the level of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States will remain below the rate of 2005 for the next 15 years even if no new restrictions are imposed.
Maybe something unexpected will change these happy trends, but for now I'd say that Julian Simon's advice remains as good as ever. You can always make news with doomsday predictions, but you can usually make money betting against them.

Full text: Oil is back above $90 a barrel. Copper and cotton have hit record highs. Wheat and corn prices are way up. Over all, world commodity prices have risen by a quarter in the past six months.
So what's the meaning of this surge?
Is it speculation run amok? Is it the result of excessive money creation, a harbinger of runaway inflation just around the corner? No and no.
What the commodity markets are telling us is that we're living in a finite world, in which the rapid growth of emerging economies is placing pressure on limited supplies of raw materials, pushing up their prices. And America is, for the most part, just a bystander in this story.
Some background: The last time the prices of oil and other commodities were this high, two and a half years ago, many commentators dismissed the price spike as an aberration driven by speculators. And they claimed vindication when commodity prices plunged in the second half of 2008.
But that price collapse coincided with a severe global recession, which led to a sharp fall in demand for raw materials. The big test would come when the world economy recovered. Would raw materials once again become expensive?
Well, it still feels like a recession in America. But thanks to growth in developing nations, world industrial production recently passed its previous peak -- and, sure enough, commodity prices are surging again.
This doesn't necessarily mean that speculation played no role in 2007-2008. Nor should we reject the notion that speculation is playing some role in current prices; for example, who is that mystery investor who has bought up much of the world's copper supply? But the fact that world economic recovery has also brought a recovery in commodity prices strongly suggests that recent price fluctuations mainly reflect fundamental factors.
What about commodity prices as a harbinger of inflation? Many commentators on the right have been predicting for years that the Federal Reserve, by printing lots of money -- it's not actually doing that, but that's the accusation -- is setting us up for severe inflation. Stagflation is coming, declared Representative Paul Ryan in February 2009; Glenn Beck has been warning about imminent hyperinflation since 2008.
Yet inflation has remained low. What's an inflation worrier to do?
One response has been a proliferation of conspiracy theories, of claims that the government is suppressing the truth about rising prices. But lately many on the right have seized on rising commodity prices as proof that they were right all along, as a sign of high overall inflation just around the corner.
You do have to wonder what these people were thinking two years ago, when raw material prices were plunging. If the commodity-price rise of the past six months heralds runaway inflation, why didn't the 50 percent decline in the second half of 2008 herald runaway deflation?
Inconsistency aside, however, the big problem with those blaming the Fed for rising commodity prices is that they're suffering from delusions of U.S. economic grandeur. For commodity prices are set globally, and what America does just isn't that important a factor.
In particular, today, as in 2007-2008, the primary driving force behind rising commodity prices isn't demand from the United States. It's demand from China and other emerging economies. As more and more people in formerly poor nations are entering the global middle class, they're beginning to drive cars and eat meat, placing growing pressure on world oil and food supplies.
And those supplies aren't keeping pace. Conventional oil production has been flat for four years; in that sense, at least, peak oil has arrived. True, alternative sources, like oil from Canada's tar sands, have continued to grow. But these alternative sources come at relatively high cost, both monetary and environmental.
Also, over the past year, extreme weather -- especially severe heat and drought in some important agricultural regions -- played an important role in driving up food prices. And, yes, there's every reason to believe that climate change is making such weather episodes more common.
So what are the implications of the recent rise in commodity prices? It is, as I said, a sign that we're living in a finite world, one in which resource constraints are becoming increasingly binding. This won't bring an end to economic growth, let alone a descent into Mad Max-style collapse. It will require that we gradually change the way we live, adapting our economy and our lifestyles to the reality of more expensive resources.
But that's for the future. Right now, rising commodity prices are basically the result of global recovery. They have no bearing, one way or another, on U.S. monetary policy. For this is a global story; at a fundamental level, it's not about us.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- As the Federal Reserve debates whether to scale back, continue or expand its $600 billion effort to nurse the economic recovery, four men will have a newly prominent role in influencing the central bank's path.
One is an economist who fears that the Fed's easy-money policies could lead to manias like the housing bubble that burst in 2007. Another is a Texas Democrat who served in the Clinton White House, but is wary of the Fed's aggressive efforts to combat unemployment.
A third is a precocious economist who graduated from Princeton at 19. And the fourth is the only one who agreed wholeheartedly with the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the economy was at risk of falling into a dangerous cycle of deflation last summer and that an additional monetary boost was needed.
The four men are presidents of regional Fed banks, and under an arcane system that dates to the Depression, they will become voting members in 2011 on the Federal Open Market Committee, which gathers eight times a year around a 27-foot mahogany table to influence the supply of credit in the economy.
While Mr. Bernanke remains the dominant voice on which route the Fed takes, the change in voting composition is likely to give the committee a somewhat more hawkish cast. This could amplify anxieties about unforeseen effects of Mr. Bernanke's policies and potentially contribute to the increasingly politicized atmosphere surrounding the Fed.
Since the Fed embarked last month on a second round of quantitative easing -- a strategy of buying government securities to hold down mortgage and other long-term interest rates -- it has faced an outpouring of criticism from foreign central banks and conservative Republicans.
One of them, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, who is in line to become chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he thought that dissenters within the Fed would influence whether Mr. Bernanke "throttles back, or keeps going," with the bond-buying plan.
"We're playing with fire, flirting with disaster," Mr. Ryan said of the plan, which he believes could jeopardize the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency and touch off future inflation.
Most economists think the Fed is unlikely to drastically alter its policy direction, though some of the new members could nudge policy toward more restraint and less activism. Two of the four new voters are viewed as hawkish on inflation, meaning that they tend to be more worried about unleashing future inflation than they are about reducing unemployment in the short run.
The committee will be "a little more hawkish, on net, although I don't think it's a sea change," said Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs.
Of the four new voting members, the one drawing the most attention is Charles I. Plosser, 62, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia since 2006.
Mr. Plosser, who formerly taught at the University of Rochester, argued in a speech at the libertarian Cato Institute last month that monetary policy "went off track" a few years ago, an acknowledgment of the criticism that the Fed kept interest rates too low from 2003 to 2005, contributing to the housing bubble.
"I'd like the recovery to be faster, but I'm not sure monetary policy can do much about that," he said in an interview.
Mr. Plosser said that he has thought all along that the economic slowdown over the summer was temporary and that he "wasn't a big fan" of Mr. Bernanke's asset-purchase plan. He wants the Fed to move back toward normal policy.
"If we wait too long, and the economy really begins to pick up and we are too late in reacting, we could end up behind the curve and we could end up with more instability," he said.
Most economists expect Mr. Plosser to dissent, possibly repeatedly, in 2011, inheriting a role played by Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, who was the lone dissenter eight times this year but does not have a vote next year.
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed since 2005, is another potential dissenter. A former investment banker, he was the Democratic nominee for the Senate in 1994, but lost to Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican. He was a deputy United States trade representative during President Bill Clinton's second term.
Compared with most Democratic politicians, Mr. Fisher, 61, is wary of the Fed's latest moves. "The remedy for what ails the economy is, in my view, in the hands of the fiscal and regulatory authorities, not the Fed," he said in a speech last month.
His views are also in line with those of fiscal conservatives, like Mr. Ryan, who think the Fed is abetting huge government deficits by "monetizing the federal debt."
Narayana R. Kocherlakota, 47, the Princeton graduate, who became president of the Minneapolis Fed last year, will be voting for the first time. He has been more measured about quantitative easing. In a speech last month, he called it "a move in the right direction" but said the ultimate effects were "likely to be relatively modest."
The fourth new voting member, Charles L. Evans, 52, has led the Chicago Fed since 2007. Unlike the other three, he is associated with the camp of so-called doves within the Fed, who are worried about chronic, long-term joblessness and think the recovery is still quite fragile.
Mr. Evans has advocated price-level targeting, a strategy that would allow inflation to run slightly above the desired level in the future to make up for inflation's being too low today. But in an October speech, he conceded that the proposal would be "a hard pill to swallow" for an institution whose credibility rested on its successes at taming high inflation in the early 1980s.
Mr. Evans is likely to side with Mr. Bernanke on the bond purchases; if anything, he might even push to expand them beyond $600 billion if the recovery weakened again.
The Federal Open Market Committee comprises the Fed's seven-member board of governors in Washington, including Mr. Bernanke; the president of the New York Fed, who is a permanent member; and four members drawn from the heads of the 11 other banks, who share votes through a rotation.
"It's true that voting members get more attention in the press, but whether people are voting or nonvoting members, everyone has an equal voice at the table and an equal part in the discussions," said Randall S. Kroszner, a former Fed governor and a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. "It's a consensus-based organization."
For now, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other major forecasters expect the Fed will carry out its plan to buy $600 billion in securities -- neither scaling back the program early, nor extending it past June. But Mr. Bernanke has left his options open, and the committee is likely to wait until the spring before deciding.
Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor who advises the Potomac Research Group, an economic research firm, said he thought the new members would introduce "slightly more uncertainty," but predicted that the ultimate effect would be limited.
"The chairman has a strong voice in the outcome of the meeting, and there is a tradition that not too many people are going to dissent at any one time," he said.
What could cause the Fed to scale back, Mr. Gramley said, is an unexpected and sharp rise in inflation expectations. If the markets come to believe that inflation will eventually rise higher than the Fed's unofficial long-range target of 2 percent, they could drive up interest rates -- and inflation. So far, there have been few signs of that, but the situation could change quickly.

Full text: PYONGYANG, North Korea -- Girls' soccer teams waged a fierce battle outside a huge gymnasium. Two young brides, one resplendent in a white gown and the other in deep pink, married sweethearts in a snowy square. Parents pulled toddlers on plastic sleds. Pedestrians lined up at kiosks to buy baked sweet potatoes and pancakes.
A six-day visit to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, that ended last Tuesday offered carefully monitored glimpses of a land where reality and fantasy are routinely conflated. While there were no obvious signs of impending collapse or political intrigue swirling around the fate of North Korea's ailing leader, the visit offered hints of why the North might be particularly eager now to resume international aid and trade.
For nearly four years, an unrelenting barrage of government propaganda has promised that North Korea will be strong and prosperous by 2012, the centennial of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the nation's founder and the father of the current leader, Kim Jong-il.
That is now 18 months away. And prosperous is the last word one would use to describe North Korea's shuttered factories, skimpy harvests and stunted children.
Perhaps with that deadline in mind, North Korea's leaders last week made what might be a bid to reduce their isolation. They offered concessions that could help open up and limit the country's increasingly sophisticated nuclear program.
And after promising to retaliate militarily should South Korea renew artillery drills near disputed waters, they have reacted -- so far -- only with words. But North Korea has made conciliatory gestures before, to extract aid at times of economic need or political transition, only to turn hostile later.
Of the nation's 24 million citizens, the three million in Pyongyang are the most privileged. North Koreans need a special permit to live or come here. Still, signs of hardship are evident.
Commuters crammed into decrepit electric buses, packed as tightly as boxes of toothpicks. Pedestrians bowed beneath huge bundles strapped to their backs, apparently stuffed with goods for trade in private markets that have eclipsed the ill-supplied state stores. Most were women; one collapsed on the sidewalk under the weight of her load.
Economists say coal production is, at best, half that of two decades ago, and Pyongyang has regular power shortages. At the elite Foreign Language Revolution School, students warmed themselves around stoves fed by coal or wood. In much of the city, residents report only a few hours of electricity daily.
New apartment buildings -- apparently for officials -- grace the city center. But the pyramid-shaped, 105-story Ryugyong Hotel remains a shell nearly 25 years after construction began. While it was recently sheathed in glass, other abandoned construction projects scar roads outside the city.
Elsewhere, especially in northern provinces, residents report that child beggars haunt street markets, families scavenge hillsides for sprouts and mushrooms and workers at state enterprises receive nominal salaries, at best. Workers in Pyongyang are said to be much better compensated.
Signs of that relative good fortune were evident on Pyongyang's streets. Some pedestrians chatted on cellphones, something unknown just two years ago. Koryolink, a cellphone network controlled by an Egyptian firm, has 310,000 North Korean subscribers. North Koreans can call only one another, but the network is expanding fast. Residents report more cars and traffic lights than three years ago, although traffic remains sparse.
Most pedestrians appeared well fed. Although malnutrition has improved in the past decade, one in three North Korean children is stunted, and nearly one in five is underweight, according to the World Food Program. Residents of the Pyongyang area are the nation's best nourished.
North Korea's isolation is striking from the moment of arrival at Pyongyang's utilitarian airport. With a 40-plane, primarily Russian-made fleet, Air Koryo schedules just two daily outbound flights, to Beijing and to Vladivostok in far eastern Russia. Although visitors were allowed to bring laptops, inspectors immediately confiscated cellphones.
Journalists are rarely granted visas to North Korea, one of the world's most secretive and militaristic societies. The government allowed two journalists to accompany Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former ambassador to the United Nations, on a private mission to meet senior officials in Pyongyang.
Mr. Richardson sought to reduce the threat of conflict between North and South Korea and to persuade the North to abandon its aggressive behavior if it wants outside assistance.
Visiting Pyongyang as an outsider is a bit like entering a parallel reality. Official escorts stuck to visitors like Velcro. The rules were clear: No interviews without permission. No exploring beyond the hotel parking lot.
Everyone was closely watched, with tactics reminiscent of a bad cold war spy movie. Opposite a journalist's spacious room at the mostly empty Potonggang Hotel, men with briefcases left keys dangling in doors and appeared to rotate shifts. Other guests warned that dining room tables were bugged and that a dark, out-of-place wall panel was in fact a two-way mirror. Calls from the United States were blocked. Outgoing overseas calls cost $8.27 a minute.
Some events seemed obviously staged. On a dazzlingly sunny Saturday, a crowd packed the auditorium of Pyongyang's ornate central library for a lecture on the life of Kim Jong-il's mother. Nearly every seat in the reading room was also taken. When one reader nodded off, a watchful monitor quickly poked him.
But the Foreign Ministry also showed surprising flexibility at times, allowing visits to the foreign language school, a crowded subway station and a silk-thread factory. Long-time visitors say they see a growing openness to journalists.
State stores were off limits, either because barren shelves hinted at economic difficulties or because only lucky government-coupon holders could take advantage of their artificially low prices. Window-shopping only, journalists were warned.
Better-stocked but costlier private markets were also out of bounds. Hundreds have sprung up nationwide, but officials play down their importance because they flout the socialist credo.
One, the huge, arch-roofed Unification Market in Pyongyang, sports row after row of stalls. Merchants say three-fourths of the wares come from China.
With paltry harvests, inflation of food prices is a chronic problem. Last month, the World Food Program reported that at that market a kilogram of rice, or 2.2 pounds, cost $10, about 10 times the price in Beijing. By the agency's rough estimates, a typical household's income would allow one person to eat two and a half cups of rice a day, assuming he had no other expenses.
North Koreans pride themselves on juche, or self-reliance, and government officials greeted Mr. Richardson with declarations of a thriving society.
"Everything is going well," Vice President Kim Yong-dae assured the governor before reporters were shooed out of a meeting. "Thanks to our powerful military deterrence," he said, "we can now concentrate on development" and achieve prosperity by 2012.
But privately, Mr. Richardson said, officials acknowledge that the country is desperate for fuel, food and an easing of economic sanctions imposed after North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, beginning roughly five years ago. Some North Korea analysts warn that unless aid and trade resume, the North may raise cash by selling nuclear technology and materials to Iran, Syria or others -- if it has not already.
Interviews in the past six months with nearly 20 North Koreans who recently left for China, including several Communist Party members, suggest that faith in the leadership's economic policies is shaken, if not lost. North Koreans know well that South Koreans live much better, while their own government demands constant sacrifice.
A few criticize the military's pre-eminence, and hope that Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il's son and chosen successor, will shift policy. "I heard a rumor that he said we have more bullets than food. So maybe he will be a good leader and feed the people," one 59-year-old North Korean trader said, hopefully, in an interview last month in China.
But most seemed to support Kim Jong-il's 15-year-old "military-first" policies. They regard the United States as an implacable enemy and South Korea as an American tool, barred by Washington from uniting with the North. They insist that Japan's 35-year occupation of the peninsula, followed by the Korean War, proves the need for an invincible defense.
Billboards, patriotic songs, newspapers and movies continually reinforce that message. Every North Korean man spends up to 10 years in the military. Soldiers were spotted helping out at a Pyongyang construction site and heading through a nearby village toting shovels as a loudspeaker mounted on a tree blared patriotic messages.
"Even if we don't eat, we give the military everything we can," said a former humanities professor from the northern city of Chongjin, who now works as a maid in China but plans to return home. "Nuclear weapons mean we cannot be invaded. I really want to say that. We cannot be touched."
At one Pyongyang subway stop, called Prosperity Station, commuters read news on the threat of military conflict with South Korea from newspaper pages posted on a stand-up carousel. "We want peace," one man declared passionately. "But we are not afraid of war. We are ready for anything."
Such statements aside, he and other residents were surprisingly friendly to journalists. So were government escorts. The six-day visit ended with a cognac-fueled celebration in the hotel's karaoke bar in which the North Koreans belted out "You Are My Destiny" and Korean love songs.
The days were marked by odes to Kim Jong-il. Choi Hyok, 43, the rail-thin chief engineer at the Kim Jong-suk Silk Factory, which is named after the chairman's mother, recalled Kim Jong-il's visit in January 2009. "I felt like I had come out of the darkness and into the light," he said.
Nam Dae-yong, 20, a geology student at Kim Il-sung University, marveled at 2,000 new desktop computers installed in April. "This is a very good present from Chairman Kim Jong-il," she said.
The university is a showpiece. So is the silk factory, with its well-oiled machinery and 2,000 women at work in blue, pink and green scarves. Economists estimate that three of four North Korean factories are idle, lacking power and materials.
"Everyone knows the environment," the former humanities professor said of her university in Chongjin. "No electricity, no light, no heat. The government doesn't give anything, so we have to ask the parents for money."
"People talk a lot about 2012, how we will become a strong and prosperous country," one 45-year-old trader from Hwanghae Province told the advocacy group Human Rights Watch last month. "If we find a gold mine, yes, I guess it would happen."
"Nobody really believes it," he said. "We just get by."

N.F.L. POSTPONES GAME
Because of Blizzard
Some of the most memorable games in N.F.L. history have been played in terrible weather. But the league made a different kind of history, postponing the Sunday night game between the Eagles and the Vikings in Philadelphia until Tuesday because of a blizzard in the Northeast. Moving an outdoor N.F.L. game because of snow is exceedingly rare. The league said the last time it had happened was in 1932, and it will be the first N.F.L. game on a Tuesday since 1946. PAGE D1

Full text: BEIJING -- China's central bank announced on Saturday that it was raising interest rates for the second time in about two months in what appears to be a long-term campaign to suppress inflation as many ordinary Chinese express discontent with rising consumer prices.
The People's Bank of China said it would raise the one-year benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.81 percent, and the benchmark deposit rate by the same amount to 2.75 percent.
The Chinese economy has been awash in liquidity due to government stimulus money and generous lending by state banks. Chinese officials are now concerned about an overheated economy and the inflationary pressures that come with that.
The fact that China's economy has remained robust during the global recession gives Chinese officials leeway to rein in liquidity. The country has been growing at an average of 10 percent a year, and the strength of the export industry remains high despite a dip in late 2008, when the financial crisis first roiled the United States and then other parts of the world.
But investment in large capital-intensive projects has also been fueling the economic engine and driving up prices.
Analysts have been saying for months that they expect China to raise interest rates throughout 2011.
Earlier this month, the government reported that the consumer price index rose 5.1 percent in November, compared with the same period a year ago. It was the largest increase in three years. Since the spring, the year-on-year increase in the index has been above 3 percent, despite the government's desire to keep the average increase below 3 percent for the entire year.
Chinese leaders are aware of the political dangers of high inflation. Xinhua, the state news agency, reported on Dec. 17 that Li Keqiang, the vice premier, said at a conference of government officials that "more efforts should be provided to stabilize prices next year." He added that over the next five years, growth rates should be defined "reasonably." Mr. Li is expected to take over as prime minister in 2012 from Wen Jiabao, who now oversees the economy.
Officials have signaled throughout the month that moves will be taken to better control spending across the country. China announced on Dec. 3 that it would tighten monetary policy next year, shifting it from "relatively loose to prudent." That was a clear sign that Chinese officials were intensely concerned about inflation.
On Dec. 15, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a prominent research organization based in Beijing, reported that high inflation and housing prices had contributed to a deepening sense of popular disaffection. The findings of the report were based on a survey of 4,143 people.
Commodity prices were the main concern of urban residents, followed by health care and housing prices, according to the findings, which were reported by Xinhua. Rural residents in this year's survey said health care was their top concern, followed by commodity prices.
Job satisfaction among those surveyed was at its lowest in four years, according to the academy.
Also on Dec. 15, the central bank said that satisfaction among people with the current level of prices had dropped to an 11-year low. The bank's findings were based on a survey of 20,000 people during the fourth quarter in 50 cities across China.
The real estate market is another concern. The property market in China has been booming. Rising property prices, along with the government stimulus money and loose bank lending, have spurred new developments across the country. Even long-term residents on the tropical southern island of Hainan have had to grapple with soaring real estate prices from outsiders coming in to buy up land.
Some analysts say this growth has resulted in a gargantuan bubble in the real estate market, while others argue that the capacity will be put to good use.
A record $560 billion of residential property was sold in 2009, an increase of 80 percent over 2008, according to government statistics.
In October, the government increased its benchmark lending rate, in what appeared to be an effort to tamp down real estate speculation.
Until now, low wages have helped to hold down inflation and keep China's export industry competitive. But those wages in the context of soaring real estate prices mean that migrant workers from the interior of China are becoming less tolerant of poor work conditions on the coasts, where many of China's export manufacturing factories are located. Many workers are now choosing to stay closer to home in the interior provinces, and some companies are moving their manufacturing centers inland.

Abstract: The United States spends nearly as much on military power as every other country in the world combined, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The intelligence community is so vast that more people have "top secret" clearance than live in Washington, D.C. The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War combined.

Full text: We face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government spending that Democrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.
It's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:
The United States spends nearly as much on military power as every other country in the world combined, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend more than six times as much as the country with the next highest budget, China.
The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a legacy of a world war that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany, Russia might invade?
The intelligence community is so vast that more people have "top secret" clearance than live in Washington, D.C.
The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War combined.
This is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized new directions, requested about 6 percent more for the military this year than at the peak of the Bush administration.
"Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime in, they'll lose votes," said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston University. He is author of a thoughtful recent book, "Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War."
The costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich knows well. His son, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.
Let me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But the implication is that we need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we have a billionaire military and a pauper diplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign service -- and that's preposterous.
What's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is that military power often isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea or an Iran that is on the nuclear path. Indeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often counterproductive.
After the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they would enhance American security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden into attacking the U.S. In other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our money have been better spent helping American kids get a college education?
Paradoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against overinvestment in arms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: "Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed." And in the Obama administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that military spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has argued most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.
American troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there because they see firsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And here's the trade-off: For the cost of one American soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build about 20 schools.
There are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting money for armaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a signature project, the quadrennial diplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.
"Leading through civilian power saves lives and money," Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right. The review is a great document, but we'll see if it can be implemented -- especially because House Republicans are proposing cuts in the State Department budget.
They should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in many ways: financing research against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime later, boosting support for community colleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.
As we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of Americans than a military base in Germany.

How Superstars' Pay Stifles Everyone Else

Full text: This article was adapted from "The Price of Everything: Solving the Mystery of Why We Pay What We Do," by Eduardo Porter, an editorial writer for The New York Times. The book, to be published on Jan. 4 by Portfolio, examines how pricing affects all of our choices.
IN 1990, the Kansas City Royals had the heftiest payroll in Major League Baseball: almost $24 million. A typical player for the New York Yankees, which had some of the most expensive players in the game at the time, earned less than $450,000.
Last season, the Yankees spent $206 million on players, more than five times the payroll of the Royals 20 years ago, even after accounting for inflation. The Yankees' median salary was $5.5 million, seven times the 1990 figure, inflation-adjusted.
What is most striking is how the Yankees have outstripped the rest of the league. Two decades ago. the Royals' payroll was about three times as big as that of the Chicago White Sox, the cheapest major-league team at the time. Last season, the Yankees spent about six times as much as the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had the most inexpensive roster.
Baseball aficionados might conclude that all of this points to some pernicious new trend in the market for top players. But this is not specific to baseball, or even to sport. Consider the market for pop music. In 1982, the top 1 percent of pop stars, in terms of pay, raked in 26 percent of concert ticket revenue. In 2003, that top percentage of stars -- names like Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera or 50 Cent -- was taking 56 percent of the concert pie.
The phenomenon is not even specific to the United States. Pele, from Brazil, the greatest soccer player of all time, made his World Cup debut in Sweden in 1958, when he was only 17. He became an instant star, coveted by every team on the planet. By 1960, his team, Santos, reportedly paid him $150,000 a year -- about $1.1 million in today's money. But these days, that would amount to middling pay. The top-paid player of the 2009-10 season, the Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, made $17 million playing for the Spanish team Real Madrid.
Of course, the inflated rewards of performers at the very top have to do with specific changes in the underlying economics of entertainment. People have more disposable income to spend on entertainment. Corporate sponsorships, virtually non-existent in the age of Pele, account today for a large share of performers' income. In 2009, the highest-earning soccer player was the English midfielder David Beckham, who made $33 million from endorsements on top of a $7 million salary from the Los Angeles Galaxy and AC Milan.
But broader forces are also at play. Nearly 30 years ago, Sherwin Rosen, an economist from the University of Chicago, proposed an elegant theory to explain the general pattern. In an article entitled "The Economics of Superstars," he argued that technological changes would allow the best performers in a given field to serve a bigger market and thus reap a greater share of its revenue. But this would also reduce the spoils available to the less gifted in the business.
The reasoning fits smoothly into the income dynamics of the music industry, which has been shaken by many technological disruptions since the 1980s. First, MTV put music on television. Then Napster took it to the Internet. Apple allowed fans to buy single songs and take them with them. Each of these breakthroughs allowed the very top acts to reach a larger fan base, and thus command a larger audience and a bigger share of concert revenue.
Superstar effects apply, too, to European soccer, which is beamed around the world on cable and satellite TV. In 2009, the top 20 soccer teams reaped revenue of 3.9 billion euros, more than 25 percent of the combined revenue of all the teams in European leagues.
Pele was not held back by the quality of his game, but by his relatively small revenue base. He might be the greatest of all time, but few people could pay to experience his greatness. In 1958, there were about 350,000 television sets in Brazil. The first television satellite, Telstar I, wasn't launched until July 1962, too late for his World Cup debut.
By contrast, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, in which Ronaldo played for Portugal, was broadcast in more than 200 countries, to an aggregate audience of over 25 billion. Some 700 million people watched the final alone. Ronaldo is not better then Pele. He makes more money because his talent is broadcast to more people.
IF one loosens slightly the role played by technological progress, Dr. Rosen's framework also does a pretty good job explaining the evolution of executive pay. In 1977, an elite chief executive working at one of America's top 100 companies earned about 50 times the wage of its average worker. Three decades later, the nation's best-paid C.E.O.'s made about 1,100 times the pay of a worker on the production line.
This has separated the megarich from the merely very rich. A study of pay in the 1970s found that executives in the top 10 percent made about twice as much as those in the middle of the pack. By the early 2000s, the top suits made more than four times the pay of the executives in the middle.
Top C.E.O.'s are not pop stars. But the pay for the most sought-after executives has risen for similar reasons. As corporations have increased in size, management decisions at the top have become that much more important, measured in terms of profits or losses. Top American companies have much higher sales and profits than they did 20 years ago. Banks and funds have more assets.
With so much more at stake, it has become that much more important for companies to put at the helm the "best" executive or banker or fund manager they can find. This has set off furious competition for top managerial talent, pushing the prices of top-rated managers way above the pay of those in the tier just below them. Two economists at New York University, Xavier Gabaix and Augustin Landier, published a study in 2006 estimating that the sixfold rise in the pay of chief executives in the United States over the last quarter century or so was attributable entirely to the sixfold rise in the market size of large American companies.
And therein lies a big problem for American capitalism.
CAPITALISM relies on inequality. Like differences in other prices, pay disparities steer resources -- in this case, people -- to where they would be most productively employed.
Despite the great danger and cost of crossing the border illegally into the United States, hundreds of thousands of the hardest-working Mexicans are drawn by the relative prosperity they can achieve north of the border -- where the average income of a Mexican-American household is more than $33,000, almost five times that of a family in Mexico.
In poor economies, fast economic growth increases inequality as some workers profit from new opportunities and others do not. The share of national income accruing to the top 1 percent of the Chinese population more than doubled from 1986 to 2003. Inequality spurs economic growth by providing incentives for people to accumulate human capital and become more productive. It pulls the best and brightest into the most lucrative lines of work, where the most profitable companies hire them.
Yet the increasingly outsize rewards accruing to the nation's elite clutch of superstars threaten to gum up this incentive mechanism. If only a very lucky few can aspire to a big reward, most workers are likely to conclude that it is not worth the effort to try. The odds aren't on their side.
Inequality has been found to turn people off. A recent experiment conducted with workers at the University of California found that those who earned less than the typical wage for their pay unit and occupation became measurably less satisfied with their jobs, and more likely to look for another one if they found out the pay of their peers. Other experiments have found that winner-take-all games tend to elicit much less player effort -- and more cheating -- than those in which rewards are distributed more smoothly according to performance.
Ultimately, the question is this: How much inequality is necessary? It is true that the nation grew quite fast as inequality soared over the last three decades. Since 1980, the country's gross domestic product per person has increased about 69 percent, even as the share of income accruing to the richest 1 percent of the population jumped to 36 percent from 22 percent. But the economy grew even faster -- 83 percent per capita -- from 1951 to 1980, when inequality declined when measured as the share of national income going to the very top of the population.
One study concluded that each percentage-point increase in the share of national income channeled to the top 10 percent of Americans since 1960 led to an increase of 0.12 percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth -- hardly an enormous boost. The cost for this tonic seems to be a drastic decline in Americans' economic mobility. Since 1980, the weekly wage of the average worker on the factory floor has increased little more than 3 percent, after inflation.
The United States is the rich country with the most skewed income distribution. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average earnings of the richest 10 percent of Americans are 16 times those for the 10 percent at the bottom of the pile. That compares with a multiple of 8 in Britain and 5 in Sweden.
Not coincidentally, Americans are less economically mobile than people in other developed countries. There is a 42 percent chance that the son of an American man in the bottom fifth of the income distribution will be stuck in the same economic slot. The equivalent odds for a British man are 30 percent, and 25 percent for a Swede.
NONE of this even begins to account for the damage caused by the superstar dynamics that shape the pay of American bankers.
Remember the '80s? Gordon Gekko first sashayed across the silver screen. Ivan Boesky was jailed for insider trading. Michael Milken peddled junk bonds. In 1987, financial firms amassed a little less than a fifth of the profits of all American corporations. Wall Street bonuses totaled $2.6 billion -- about $15,600 for each man and woman working there.
Yet by current standards, this era of legendary greed appears like a moment of uncommon restraint. In 2007, as the financial bubble built upon the American housing market reached its peak, financial companies accounted for a full third of the profits of the nation's private sector. Wall Street bonuses hit a record $32.9 billion, or $177,000 a worker.
Just as technology gave pop stars a bigger fan base that could buy their CDs, download their singles and snap up their concert tickets, the combination of information technology and deregulation gave bankers an unprecedented opportunity to reap huge rewards. Investors piled into the top-rated funds that generated the highest returns. Rewards flowed in abundance to the most "productive" financiers, those that took the bigger risks and generated the biggest profits.
Finance wasn't always so richly paid. Financiers had a great time in the early decades of the 20th century: from 1909 to the mid-1930s, they typically made about 50 percent to 60 percent more than workers in other industries. But the stock market collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression changed all that. In 1934, corporate profits in the financial sector shrank to $236 million, one-eighth what they were five years earlier. Wages followed. From 1950 through about 1980, bankers and insurers made only 10 percent more than workers outside of finance, on average.
This ebb and flow of compensation mimics the waxing and waning of restrictions governing finance. A century ago, there were virtually no regulations to restrain banks' creativity and speculative urges. They could invest where they wanted, deploy depositors' money as they saw fit. But after the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt set up a plethora of restrictions to avoid a repeat of the financial bubble that burst in 1929.
Interstate banking had been limited since 1927. In 1933, the Glass-Steagall Act forbade commercial banks and investment banks from getting into each other's business -- separating deposit taking and lending from playing the markets. Interest-rate ceilings were also imposed that year. The move to regulate bankers continued in 1959 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who forbade mixing banks with insurance companies.
Barred from applying the full extent of their wits toward maximizing their incomes, many of the nation's best and brightest who had flocked to make money in banking left for other industries.
Then, in the 1980s, the Reagan administration unleashed a surge of deregulation. By 1999, the Glass-Steagall Act lay repealed. Banks could commingle with insurance companies at will. Ceilings on interest rates vanished. Banks could open branches anywhere. Unsurprisingly, the most highly educated returned to banking and finance. By 2005, the share of workers in the finance industry with a college education exceeded that of other industries by nearly 20 percentage points. By 2006, pay in the financial sector was again 70 percent higher than wages elsewhere in the private sector. A third of the 2009 Princeton graduates who got jobs after graduation went into finance; 6.3 percent took jobs in government.
Then the financial industry blew up, taking out a good chunk of the world economy.
Finance will not be tamed by tweaking the way bankers are paid. But bankers' pay could be structured to discourage wanton risk taking. Similarly, superstar effects are not the sole cause of the stagnant incomes of regular Joes. But the piling of rewards on our superstars is encouraging a race to the top that, if left unabated, could leave very little to strive for in its wake.

Full text: THE love affair of American investors with the stock market appears to have ended.
The year now ending will be the fourth consecutive year in which mutual funds that invest primarily in American stocks experienced net outflows of funds, meaning that investors as a group withdrew more money than they put in.
That has happened even though the stock market has flourished over the last two years as it bounced back from lows reached in the spring of 2009 amid worries that the recession at the time would turn into Great Depression II.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks had a total return of 26 percent in 2009, assuming reinvestment of dividends, and is on pace to post another double-digit gain this year. If current prices hold, they will be the best back-to-back years since 1998-99.
The accompanying charts show that investors took out $81 billion from such funds so far this year, significantly more than they took out in 2009 but well below the withdrawals of more than $150 billion in 2008, the year that Lehman Brothers failed.
The withdrawals this year were partly offset by money flowing into foreign stock funds and hybrid funds, which invest in both stocks and bonds. Investors seem more willing to trust in overseas markets, and a growing number are choosing so-called target-date funds, in which fund companies promise to choose the right mix of stocks and bonds depending upon when an investor expects to retire.
The figures come from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group of mutual funds that has been compiling the totals since 1984. They include estimates of trades through mid-December.
Before 2007, there had been net withdrawals from domestic stock funds only in 1988 and 2002.
The first of those years came after the 1987 crash, which scared many investors as the market fell more than 20 percent in one day. But it recovered all of that loss and more in 1988, and many investors learned from that experience that market declines presented buying opportunities, not reasons to sell. The assumption that stocks were sure to rise, at least in the long run, became widely accepted.
That confidence was challenged by the collapse of the technology stock bubble in 2000 and 2001, and in 2002 Americans were again net sellers of stock mutual funds. But the market rallied starting in late 2002, and by the next year Americans were back to investing in stock funds.
The stock market collapse in 2008 and early 2009 appears to have inflicted far more psychological damage -- damage that may have been intensified by the collapse of home values and the deep recession that hit the country, and by the fact that many stocks had not recovered the highs they had reached in 2000. For perhaps the first time since the late 1970s, many Americans seem to have become pessimistic about the future of their country.
For the 10 years through 2010, figures for the final two weeks of the year will determine whether there was any net investment in domestic stock funds. (The estimate so far is that $4 billion flowed out.) By contrast, in the prior 10 years, Americans put $1.3 trillion into such funds.
In some ways, the current mood is reminiscent of the one that prevailed then. In 1979, Business Week had a cover article on the "Death of Equities," which it attributed in large part to rising inflation. By 1982, inflation had begun to fall, but the country was in a deep recession. That is when the great bull market of the 1980s began. Few investors seem confident that such a renewal of optimism is likely this time.

Full text: Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday that they saw no need to supply the world with more crude as oil prices approached a two-year high, and some consumers said they feared that a rally above $100 a barrel would spur inflation. The most influential OPEC minister, Ali al-Naimi, of Saudi Arabia, said he was still happy with prices at $70 to $80 a barrel. He also said there was no need for an extra OPEC meeting before the next scheduled one in June. Crude closed at over $91 a barrel on Thursday in the United States, and Brent fell 48 cents at $93.46 on Friday after hitting $94.74 a barrel, its highest level since October 2008. Arab OPEC ministers are meeting in Cairo this weekend, where they are expected to discuss production and prices. There will be no decision on output. The United Arab Emirates oil minister said he wanted OPEC to comply better with output cuts the group agreed to in late 2008, and he added that the current price did not reflect fundamentals. Only Iraq's new oil minister, Abdul Kareem Luaibi, said the cartel could meet before June if market conditions changed.

Abstract: [...] many Bavarian businesses say their biggest problem these days is a shortage of skilled workers to fill positions that would help meet a growing demand for German quality goods.

Full text: ERLANGEN-HOCHSTADT, Germany -- By nearly every measure this industrial region in Bavaria, home to exporting giants like Siemens Healthcare, Adidas and Puma, is at the center of Germany's resilient economic success, driving the nation's growth even as much of Europe struggles to stay solvent.
With an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent and Christmas markets full of shoppers and revelers, "Bavaria is the planet of the happy," said Katrin Schmidt, a labor analyst with the Federal Employment Agency based in Nuremberg.
Except that many people in this region, and around the nation, seem subdued and uncertain about their own financial health. Germany's good fortune, however conspicuous to other Europeans, is widely viewed here as having come at the expense of its workers, who for the past decade have sacrificed wages and benefits to make their employers more competitive. "I don't believe that the economic situation really improved," said Karl-Hans Diem, a 60-year-old metal worker.
This disconnect -- bullish economic indicators combined with simmering discontent even among the employed -- is at the core of the conflict between Germany and some of its euro zone allies over how to handle the continuing European financial crisis. German leaders have been confronted with the opposing forces of a strong economy and a work force that has seen its real wages, adjusted for inflation, decline over the past decade.
When Greece was in crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized from abroad for moving too slowly to help reassure markets that it stood behind the euro, and at home for agreeing to dole out too much aid. With the more recent Irish crisis, she came under attack around Europe for demanding that private investors share the burden of future bailouts, while at home for not insisting on that kind of accountability sooner.
"They should better spend the money here; we have problems of our own," said Sabine Striegel, 45, who is living with her parents in nearby Baiersdorf, having recently lost a temporary job with Siemens.
Anti-euro sentiments have run so hot that the finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, told the daily newspaper Bild this month the "danger of an anti-euro party needs to be taken seriously."
Germany's political leaders and business executives argue that the economy has benefited from the common currency. For a nation that derives nearly half of its gross domestic product from exports, a stable currency has greatly eased crossborder commerce in the unified euro zone.
And yet there is broad sentiment across Germany that the euro has not been good for individuals. A recent survey by one of Germany's premier research companies, Infratest dimap, of 1,004 people found this month that 57 percent feel Germany should have kept the mark, while 60 percent said the euro was a disadvantage to them personally.
"I do think that a lot became more expensive" with the euro, said Jonas Molzberger, 21, an apprentice at the hotel Grauer Wolf on the main street of Erlangen. "We feel that too in the hotel industry, especially in the restaurant. There are less people, less is being ordered."
Low salaries -- and higher prices -- are a core complaint of German workers who are increasingly demanding wage increases after a decade in which their real earnings dropped by 4.5 percent when adjusted for inflation, according to a recent report by the International Labor Organization. Exports have grown robustly in part because workers agreed years ago to reduced wages and reduced hours to make Germany more competitive.
Like workers in other industrialized nations, including the United States, Germans also have had to accept that the jobs available are not as secure as they once were. The number of people in nonstandard or atypical employment in Germany increased to 7.72 million in 2008 from 5.29 million in 1998, according to the Federal Statistical Office.
"I see how families are struggling," said Eberhard Irlinger, administrator for Erlangen-Hochstadt, a district of about 130,000 people around the city of Erlangen. "In fact, part of the economic prosperity comes from people not getting the social security they should have. Germans are very reluctant to help other people when they have had to step back from their own demands."
Yet these feelings of insecurity do not fit neatly into the picture of a nation that has strikingly outperformed its neighbors. In fact, many Bavarian businesses say their biggest problem these days is a shortage of skilled workers to fill positions that would help meet a growing demand for German quality goods.
Across the nation, Germany has experienced a severe shortage of skilled workers, in part because of its low unemployment rate, but also because of a low birth rate and a relatively unwelcoming environment for immigrants, said officials, business leaders and experts.
"We have lost contracts because we just don't have the people," said Karl-Heinz John, chief executive officer of the small software developer called Infoteam in the nearby village of Bubenreuth. "I know that all my industry partners are having trouble finding adequately educated people."
Mr. John said he had to walk away from $1 million in contracts last year. But Infoteam still grew.
Germany's economy is on track to expand at nearly 4 percent this year, while many of its southern neighbors struggle through recession. The national unemployment rate is at an 18-year low of 7 percent. The country's industrial output rose faster than expected and although exports fell unexpectedly in October by 1.1 percent, imports rose to a new post-war high.
That rise in imports spurred some optimism that the consumer sector may play a larger role in fueling Germany's future economic growth as demand for its products stalls in the financially troubled euro zone nations.
Growth is expected to continue in 2011, and last week a key monitoring institute reported that business confidence was up compared with a year ago.
German policy makers have struggled, at times awkwardly, to keep from inflaming public sentiment at home while at the same time recognizing that German support for some weaker neighbors is vital to preserving the euro and keeping exports strong. Mr. Schauble, the finance minister, said that the public needed to better understand that the euro was not the enemy of prosperity, but that it drove prosperity. "Without the euro, every German would be poorer," he told Bild. "Without the euro, the labor market would look a lot worse."
Many people do say that the euro is in Germany's broader interest, but that has not been accompanied by enthusiasm for the currency or support for spending German money to help other nations.
"I also feel that with the euro all -- or let's say much -- has become more expensive," said Peter Kern, a hairdresser in Erlangen. "And if one also takes into account that people often do not earn more, then of course problems become visible."

Full text: In 2010, little more than a year after celebrations of the euro's 10th birthday, the very survival of the currency of the world's largest economic bloc came under threat. It's a reminder that the world's economic foundations are never completely stable. So making a prediction that the world will do better than expected in 2011 comes with big caveats.
It has taken extreme measures, primarily ultra-loose monetary policy and much debt creation in the United States and Europe, to recover from the Great Recession. In the process, the seeds of future crises may have been sown -- perhaps even in China, the bastion of growth through the recent crisis.
As the year turns, the edges of the euro zone remain the world's central economic drama. Greece and Ireland have received bailouts. Portugal is making efforts to cut its fiscal deficit, but weak banks and its poor trade position make a bailout a near-certainty early in 2011.
Spain may need one, too. It suffers from big government spending and trade deficits. Madrid's repair efforts are complicated by the autonomy enjoyed by regional governments and by unemployment of 20 percent. If a Spanish bailout happens, Italy and Belgium could be next. But these countries should be more resilient. They have stronger industrial sectors, lower external financing needs and higher savings levels.
Despite the continuing upheaval, the euro zone will still grow in 2011. Germany's pickup in growth reflects the world's. France and Italy aren't in such bad shape, either. German exports are growing fast and will receive further impetus from a weak euro. That's likely given the continuing uncertainty and low European Central Bank interest rates. A substantial drop to a level of, say, $1.10 by the end of 2011 isn't impossible.
The dollar, meanwhile, should be on the road to recovery. The Fed's printing of money and ultra-low Treasury yields have weakened it. Both should end in 2011. After a relatively dormant three years, the American consumer will stir, cheered by a housing market that appears to have reached its bottom. A virtuous circle of falling unemployment and rising consumer spending looks possible. Growth in the United States may be stronger than markets expect.
That will help Asia's exporters, led by Japan and China. Chinese growth looks set to remain strong, even though the government is trying to reduce the pace of money supply growth. India, too, is racing ahead, despite high inflation and rising interest rates. New consumers are emerging in Asia. The demand for food, copper, cement, electricity and oil keeps growing.
So the commodity price inflation seen in the second half of 2010 may continue and could worsen. Inflation is already a big problem in some emerging economies. It's likely to break out soon in the West.
In the United States, inflation -- especially coupled with accelerating growth -- would force the Fed to consider raising interest rates. Though it seems unlikely now, that could happen before the end of 2011. Bond markets that prospered through the deflationary crisis would be hit. Stock investors would have to weigh higher growth against more expensive money.
The result: a resuscitated world, but not a wholly healthy one. In almost every major economy, government deficit and debt will have climbed steeply. The United States will have shown its great capacity to borrow, but even Uncle Sam will have to shift toward unaccustomed austerity. Until that happens, the American consumer and a mammoth trade deficit of some $40 billion a month will again be one side of the world's imbalances.
For its part, China has maintained growth by permitting soaring foreign exchange reserves and money supply while increasing exports. China's controlled currency is another cause of global economic imbalances. The government might allow the renminbi to appreciate sharply if it finds inflation rising fast, which may well happen. But the leadership will also be wary of damaging the export sector and its jobs.
The structure of China's economy and the staggering money supply growth everywhere during the recession might stoke future crises. But faster global recovery and the return of inflation should be the main themes in 2011, punctuated by euro zone aftershocks. Not to mention the inevitable unforeseen surprises, both good and bad.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Eighteen months after the recession officially ended, the government's latest measures to bolster the economy have led many forecasters and policy makers to express new optimism that the recovery will gain substantial momentum in 2011.
Economists in universities and on Wall Street have raised their growth projections for next year. Retail sales, industrial production and factory orders are on the upswing, and new claims for unemployment benefits are trending downward.
Despite persistently high unemployment, consumer confidence is improving. Large corporations are reporting healthy profits, and the Dow Jones industrial average reached a two-year high this week.
The Federal Reserve, which has kept short-term interest rates near zero since the end of 2008, has made clear it is sticking by its controversial decision to try to hold down mortgage and other long-term interest rates by buying government securities.
President Obama's $858 billion tax-cut compromise with Congressional Republicans is putting more cash in the hands of consumers through a temporary payroll-tax cut and an extension of unemployment insurance for the long-term unemployed.
It is also trying to address one of the biggest impediments to the recovery -- the reluctance of companies to invest their piles of cash in new plants and equipment -- by granting tax incentives for business investment.
The measured optimism is reminiscent of the mood a year ago, when the economy seemed to be reviving, only to stall again in the spring amid widespread fears caused by the debt crisis in Greece and other European countries.
Even so, economists are increasingly upbeat about the outlook, saying that while the economy in 2011 will not be strong enough to drive unemployment down significantly, it should put the United States on its soundest footing since the financial crisis started an economic tailspin three years ago.
Phillip L. Swagel, who was the Treasury Department's chief economist during the administration of George W. Bush and teaches at the University of Maryland, said, "The recovery in 2011 will be strong enough for us to see sustained job creation that will finally give Americans a tangible sense of an improving economy."
A prominent forecaster, Mark Zandi of Moody'sEconomy.com, predicted that the economy would be "off and running" next year. "The policy response, in its totality, has been very aggressive," he said, "and I think ensures that the recovery will evolve into a self-sustaining expansion early in 2011."
The recession officially ended in June 2009, when the economy started to grow again. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the country's output, grew at an annualized rate of 3.7 percent in the first quarter of this year. But then it stalled, with the rate falling to a mere 1.7 percent in the second quarter and 2.6 percent in the third quarter.
Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, said the economy was likely to grow at an annualized rate of around 3 percent this quarter. Goldman projected last week that the growth rate would be 4 percent for most of 2011. Morgan Stanley, which raised its growth forecast for 2011 to 4 percent, is even more optimistic, forecasting a rate of 4.5 percent this quarter.
Administration officials, who have been burned by premature optimism in the past, were reluctant to make predictions for next year. But Austan D. Goolsbee, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers since September, said that a shift in sentiment quickly followed the news of the tax deal
"There aren't many policies which, on the day Washington announces them, lead most private-sector forecasters to publicly and significantly revise their forecasts upward," he said. "This one did."
There are significant caveats to the more positive outlook. The housing market remains weak, and another sustained drop in prices could badly undercut the economy. Financial markets and the banking system remain vulnerable to a new round of jitters in Europe over the debt burdens of countries like Ireland and Spain. There is mounting concern about the tattered balance sheets of state and local governments.
While fiscal and monetary policy seems to be helping the economy in the short turn, the tax-cut compromise essentially deferred looming battles over how to cut federal spending and address the government's huge debt burden.
The Fed's bond-buying efforts have not prevented long-term interest rates from rising -- a phenomenon that is interpreted by optimists as a reaction to higher growth and by pessimists as a demonstration of the ineffectiveness of the central bank's efforts and the potential for inflation.
And for most of the roughly eight million Americans who have lost their jobs since the recession began in December 2007, it hardly feels like a recovery.
The unemployment rate remains at its highest level since the early 1980s; it rose to 9.8 percent this month and is likely to remain above 9 percent through all of next year, confirming the view that the United States is in another jobless recovery like the ones that followed the last two recessions, in 1990-91 and in 2001.
"Historically, unemployment rates come down slowly, so even with 4 percent growth, you would expect to see the unemployment rate come down maybe a percentage point a year, probably less," said Alan B. Krueger, who was the Treasury Department's top economist until last month when he returned to Princeton. "Given how high the unemployment rate is, that's going to seem very slow."
Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University and a member of the committee that sets the start and end dates of business cycles, cautioned against excessive optimism, noting the huge burdens on state and local governments, rising costs of health care and other long-run fiscal challenges. "The rise of the stock market is mainly because there are no other good investments in sight, not because the stock market has some unique talent in predicting what's wrong with the economy."
N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist who was chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Bush, said that "anything that spooks consumers and businesses from spending" could threaten the recovery, including "a worsening of the fiscal crisis in Europe or the increased fear that a similar crisis will soon infect U.S. cities and states."
The Fed is likely to end its $600 billion bond-buying program in mid-2011, meaning monetary policy might be providing less of a kick to the economy by the end of the year. Officials in the Obama administration also seem to agree that after the $787 billion stimulus last year and the $858 billion tax-cut compromise just approved by Congress, the government's arsenal of fiscal tools has just about been used up.
"We went through a year and a half period, at least, with the private sector in free fall and government taking a much more significant role than anybody in normal times would want," said Mr. Goolsbee. "And the president's oft-repeated view is that we don't want to be in that circumstance forever -- the government should not be the primary driver of long-run growth in the country. We've got to have the private sector stand up."
Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said he believed his party's gains in the midterm elections had bolstered consumer and business confidence, arguing that Republicans have advocated fiscal discipline and opposed onerous regulations and tax increases.
"Consumer confidence seems to be on the upswing and business angst is dropping," he said. "It hasn't swung into the confidence column yet, but the negativity is lowering."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- In a move to protect consumers, the Obama administration said Tuesday that it would require health insurance companies to disclose and justify any rate increases of 10 percent or more next year.
State or federal officials will review such increases to determine if they are unreasonable, the administration said in proposing a regulation to enforce the requirement.
The proposed rule represents a major expansion of federal authority in an area long regulated by states.
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said the reviews would "help rein in the kind of excessive and unreasonable rate increases that have made insurance unaffordable for many families."
The new health care law, signed in March by President Obama, calls for the annual review of "unreasonable increases in premiums for health insurance coverage."
The law did not define unreasonable -- a gap the administration is now trying to fill.
Under the rule issued Tuesday, insurers seeking increases of 10 percent or more in the individual or small-group market next year must publicly disclose the planned increases and the justifications for them.
In recent years, individual and small-group premiums have been rising more than 10 percent a year, on average, and many increases far exceed national measures of medical cost inflation, federal officials said.
The 10 percent threshold may change in later years. Starting in 2012, the federal government will set a threshold for each state, reflecting trends in its insurance and medical costs.
Consumer advocates welcomed the rules as a way to hold insurers accountable for skyrocketing premiums. In the last year, they noted, state officials in California and Connecticut, among other states, have denied big rate increases sought by some insurers.
It was not immediately clear whether the rule would help insurers hold down costs.
Karen M. Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said that in their zeal to review premiums, "the administration and Congress have largely ignored factors driving up the cost of coverage."
These factors, Ms. Ignagni said, include the power of doctors and hospitals to negotiate higher reimbursement rates, new benefit mandates and the tendency of younger, healthier people to drop coverage, leaving sicker people in the insurance pool.
Under the proposed regulation, the federal government will assess each state's procedures for reviewing insurance rates. If it finds that a state has an "effective rate review system," the state would conduct the annual reviews of premium increases. But, the administration said, "if a state lacks the resources or authority to do thorough actuarial reviews, the Department of Health and Human Services would do them."
Thus, it said, "all rate increases that meet or exceed the 10 percent threshold would be reviewed."
The department will post information about the results of all rate reviews on its Web site, and insurers must post the data prominently on their Web sites.
States are beefing up their ability to review rates, with the help of $46 million in federal grants -- the first installment of $250 million that will be distributed over five years.
Under the new federal law, insurers that show "a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium increases" can be excluded from the centralized insurance market, or exchange, to be set up in each state by 2014.
Ms. Sebelius, a former Kansas insurance commissioner, said that shining a spotlight on rates would discourage exorbitant increases.
State officials have repeatedly said that premiums must be not only affordable to consumers, but also adequate to guarantee the solvency of insurance companies.
"From a consumer protection standpoint, the most important thing we do is ensure the solvency of companies," said Sandy Praeger, the Kansas insurance commissioner and chairwoman of the health committee of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
"Closer scrutiny can help hold down rates," Ms. Praeger said, "but it will not control costs resulting from the overuse or inappropriate use of health care."
Jay Angoff, the director of the federal Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, said, "We are not setting an absolute numerical standard for whether a rate is unreasonable." Instead, the proposed rule lays out factors to be considered.
Under the proposal, a rate increase will be considered unreasonable if it is excessive, unjustified or "unfairly discriminatory."
A rate increase is defined as excessive if it "causes the premium charged for the health insurance coverage to be unreasonably high in relation to the benefits provided."
The rule envisions a two-step review process. An insurer must file a "preliminary justification" for an increase of 10 percent or more in the rates for any products sold to individuals or small groups. If state or federal officials find the increase unreasonable, the carrier must then file a final justification.
To justify rate increases, insurers will have to submit data on claims experience, projected medical costs, executive compensation and many other factors.
"The statute does not give us authority to disapprove rates," Mr. Angoff said. "We do not have that authority. The regulation leaves state laws intact. It does not interfere with state law."
In some states, rates cannot be put into effect unless the state affirmatively approves them. In other states, insurers must file rates with a state agency before using them, but the state does not approve or disapprove them.
Whether an insurer can carry out a particular rate increase "is entirely a matter of state law," the rule says.
Moreover, Ms. Sebelius said, "there may be rates well above 10 percent that are justified by underlying cost trends."

Full text: DETROIT -- Toyota on Monday agreed to pay two more fines, totaling $32.4 million, for failing to swiftly recall millions of defective vehicles, the Transportation Department said.
The fines are the maximum allowed by law and are in addition to the $16.4 million Toyota paid earlier this year in a related matter. The sum of the fines, $48.8 million, amounts to about $30 for each vehicle Toyota has sold this year in the United States.
The new fines are the result of two separate investigations: one into the recall of nearly five million vehicles with accelerator pedals that could become trapped under the floor mat and a second involving a 2005 recall to fix steering relay rods that could crack or break in some models. Toyota waited a year after initiating a recall on the relay rods in Japan before conceding that models in the United States also were affected.
"I am pleased that Toyota agreed to pay the maximum possible penalty and I expect Toyota to work cooperatively in the future to ensure consumers' safety," the transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, said in a statement.
While agreeing to pay the fines, Toyota did not admit committing any violations, but they are another blow to a company that has faltered this year after appearing invincible for decades. The payments could pale in comparison to the billions of dollars in liabilities it could face if lawsuits related to the recalls succeed.
Since November 2009, Toyota has recalled more than 11 million vehicles worldwide, including popular models like the Prius hybrid and the Camry and Corolla sedans. The recalls have prompted some shoppers to shy away from Toyota, causing its sales in the United States to be flat on the year, while the rest of the industry is up 13 percent.
Steve St. Angelo, Toyota's chief quality officer for North America, said in a statement that the company had "worked very hard over the past year to put these issues behind us and set a new standard of responsiveness to our customers." He said resolving the investigations would allow Toyota to forge a better relationship with regulators and "focus even more on listening to our customers and meeting their high expectations for safe and reliable vehicles."
In May, Toyota paid what was a record fine in connection with the government's investigation of a January recall for so-called sticking accelerator pedals. Automakers are required to notify the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days of discovering a defect.
The fines levied Monday are $16.375 million for the floor-mat recall in late 2009, and $16.05 million for the steering relay rod recall. Both amounts are the maximum allowed but differ because of adjustments for inflation.
The problems in each of the three recalls for which Toyota has been fined were connected to numerous reports of crashes that resulted in injuries and deaths.

Abstract: How, after the experiences of the Clinton and Bush administrations -- the first raised taxes and presided over spectacular job growth; the second cut taxes and presided over anemic growth even before the crisis -- did we end up with bipartisan agreement on even more tax cuts?

Full text: When historians look back at 2008-10, what will puzzle them most, I believe, is the strange triumph of failed ideas. Free-market fundamentalists have been wrong about everything -- yet they now dominate the political scene more thoroughly than ever.
How did that happen? How, after runaway banks brought the economy to its knees, did we end up with Ron Paul, who says "I don't think we need regulators," about to take over a key House panel overseeing the Fed? How, after the experiences of the Clinton and Bush administrations -- the first raised taxes and presided over spectacular job growth; the second cut taxes and presided over anemic growth even before the crisis -- did we end up with bipartisan agreement on even more tax cuts?
The answer from the right is that the economic failures of the Obama administration show that big-government policies don't work. But the response should be, what big-government policies?
For the fact is that the Obama stimulus -- which itself was almost 40 percent tax cuts -- was far too cautious to turn the economy around. And that's not 20-20 hindsight: many economists, myself included, warned from the beginning that the plan was grossly inadequate. Put it this way: A policy under which government employment actually fell, under which government spending on goods and services grew more slowly than during the Bush years, hardly constitutes a test of Keynesian economics.
Now, maybe it wasn't possible for President Obama to get more in the face of Congressional skepticism about government. But even if that's true, it only demonstrates the continuing hold of a failed doctrine over our politics.
It's also worth pointing out that everything the right said about why Obamanomics would fail was wrong. For two years we've been warned that government borrowing would send interest rates sky-high; in fact, rates have fluctuated with optimism or pessimism about recovery, but stayed consistently low by historical standards. For two years we've been warned that inflation, even hyperinflation, was just around the corner; instead, disinflation has continued, with core inflation -- which excludes volatile food and energy prices -- now at a half-century low.
The free-market fundamentalists have been as wrong about events abroad as they have about events in America -- and suffered equally few consequences. "Ireland," declared George Osborne in 2006, "stands as a shining example of the art of the possible in long-term economic policymaking." Whoops. But Mr. Osborne is now Britain's top economic official.
And in his new position, he's setting out to emulate the austerity policies Ireland implemented after its bubble burst. After all, conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic spent much of the past year hailing Irish austerity as a resounding success. "The Irish approach worked in 1987-89 -- and it's working now," declared Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute last June. Whoops, again.
But such failures don't seem to matter. To borrow the title of a recent book by the Australian economist John Quiggin on doctrines that the crisis should have killed but didn't, we're still -- perhaps more than ever -- ruled by "zombie economics." Why?
Part of the answer, surely, is that people who should have been trying to slay zombie ideas have tried to compromise with them instead. And this is especially, though not only, true of the president.
People tend to forget that Ronald Reagan often gave ground on policy substance -- most notably, he ended up enacting multiple tax increases. But he never wavered on ideas, never backed down from the position that his ideology was right and his opponents were wrong.
President Obama, by contrast, has consistently tried to reach across the aisle by lending cover to right-wing myths. He has praised Reagan for restoring American dynamism (when was the last time you heard a Republican praising F.D.R.?), adopted G.O.P. rhetoric about the need for the government to tighten its belt even in the face of recession, offered symbolic freezes on spending and federal wages.
None of this stopped the right from denouncing him as a socialist. But it helped empower bad ideas, in ways that can do quite immediate harm. Right now Mr. Obama is hailing the tax-cut deal as a boost to the economy -- but Republicans are already talking about spending cuts that would offset any positive effects from the deal. And how effectively can he oppose these demands, when he himself has embraced the rhetoric of belt-tightening?
Yes, politics is the art of the possible. We all understand the need to deal with one's political enemies. But it's one thing to make deals to advance your goals; it's another to open the door to zombie ideas. When you do that, the zombies end up eating your brain -- and quite possibly your economy too.

Full text: EVEN some market bears are no longer sounding entirely gloomy.
Consider David Rosenberg. Now based in Toronto with Gluskin, Sheff and formerly an economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, he was an outspoken critic of Wall Street's excesses in the years leading to the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Rosenberg still has many cogent reasons for worrying about the markets and the economy.
Among them, he cites the mounting United States debt burden, cutbacks by local and state governments, the protracted European debt crisis, a Federal Reserve monetary policy he considers overly expansive, and the prospect of currency wars and incipient inflation in China. And that's just a start.
He says he believes that the stock market will retrench eventually, contending that we are in a long-term, or secular, bear market.
Nonetheless, he wrote last week in a newsletter that "for now, the equity markets are clearly enjoying a Santa rally." And, in an interview, he said that for the short term, investors who are "overwhelmingly exuberant" are propelling a cyclical bull market.
They certainly are. The tax package enacted last week in Washington is enhancing the festive mood, which has sent the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its highest levels since late 2008, before Lehman Brothers' collapse. For the year so far, the index has risen 11.6 percent, and the S.& P. 600, which tracks small-cap stocks, is up 24.8 percent. In December alone, both indexes are up more than 5 percent.
The tax package, which contains a grab-bag of provisions including an extension of Bush-era cuts for all taxpayers, has helped fuel the markets for two apparent reasons. First, in addition to the income tax cut and a patch that will prevent the alternative minimum tax from ensnaring an additional 21 million taxpayers, it contains features that are directly beneficial to investors and businesses. It will, for example, extend the 15 percent rate on capital gains and dividends, which was due to expire at the end of this month, and would let businesses accelerate depreciation of capital expenditures.
It also contains other provisions that should have a directly stimulative effect on the economy: extending jobless benefits to the long-term unemployed, and cutting the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax, producing net savings of up to $2,136 for a worker next year.
While the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts was widely anticipated, the payroll tax cut was not. For example, Ray Fair, the Yale economist whose econometric models have predicted strong growth in 2011 and 2012, did not include the effects of that payroll cut in his calculations. Nor were they factored into his prediction of a consequent Obama election victory -- a forecast I described in a recent column.
Without factoring in the payroll tax cut, the model forecasts real annualized growth in gross domestic product of 3.69 percent for the first three quarters of 2012. "As it's turned out, the actual tax package would make the outcome marginally more bullish, and marginally better for Obama," he says.
If bears like Mr. Rosenberg are acknowledging a certain zing in the markets now, many of those who started out with a more bullish disposition are now positively buoyant. In fact, for Wall Street forecasters as a group, the tax package, on top of the Republicans' midterm election victory and the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy, has helped to produce quite sunny forecasts.
A Bloomberg survey last week of strategists at major Wall Street brokerage firms found an average year-end 2011 prediction of 1,379 for the S.& P. 500. That would be a gain of nearly 11 percent, not including dividends. The consensus called for earnings per share of $92, versus less than $80 a share now.
Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, the big asset management firm, said last week that he "hasn't yet firmed up an S.& P. number for 2011," but that it was likely to be in the consensus range, perhaps about 1,350, "with the risks more to the upside than the downside" -- the reverse of this year's situation. In other words, despite the risk of continuing financial crises in Europe and the probability of volatile markets for some time, he thinks it's more likely that the S.& P. will end 2011 above 1,350 than lower.
A year ago, the economy was still staggering from a credit shock, he says, and Washington policy wasn't friendly to capital markets. Now, by contrast, he says, the political climate has shifted and corporate America has vastly "increased amounts of cash on its balance sheets and free cash flow in its income statements." In addition, he says, investor confidence levels "are slowly and surely improving."
In his view, the stock market is likely to rise along with corporate earnings, but may climb even faster if improved investor sentiment leads to higher valuations. Furthermore, he says, corporate America can use its cash hoard in ways that benefit investors: by returning cash through buybacks and higher dividends and by "actually hiring some more useful workers, and by making productive capital investments."
ETHAN HARRIS, chief North American economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, likewise says that the tax package has helped make him cautiously upbeat for the short term. But over the longer haul, he says, "the big downside in all of this is that it's clear there really is no plan in Washington for dealing with the budget deficit."
"There is no immediate crisis but we are playing with fire," he adds.
For his part, Mr. Rosenberg is projecting a moderate market correction, with a 2011 year-end target for the S.& P. 500 of 1,100 to 1,200. And he says that because the economy is still shaky, it's premature to declare the long-running bond rally over.
He favors defensive, classic hedging strategies. Eventually, there will be a deeper decline in the stock market, he says, but perhaps not yet. There may be too much enthusiasm at the moment.

Full text: Built in 1874, the indestructible Granite Lady at Mission and Fifth fought off staggering earthquakes and scorching infernos in its time. While money production and storage ceased in 1937, plans are afoot to make the structure a museum dedicated to the history of San Francisco.
Big and Busy
The 100,000-square-foot Old Mint encloses a huge courtyard that provides abundant sunlight to its offices, chambers and factories. Up to 200 employees once worked there around the clock, primarily in the production of coins.
Wealth of a Nation
By 1880, the Old Mint was producing 60 percent of the nation's silver and gold coins and contained about one-third of the United States' gold reserves -- $300 million, or $6 billion adjusted for inflation.
Cooking for Carats
Raw gold at the mint was melted and refined to remove impurities. Then, it was poured into a mold to produce a shape that was placed on a roller. "Blanks" were then cut out with a machine and stamped on the presses.
Access Denied
Gold and silver bars and ingots were generally kept in the basement's brick vaults. Bags of silver dollars were typically held in the even-more-secure steel-lined vaults. Each vault was protected by two sets of metal doors secured with combination locks with codes known to only two or three employees.
Guarding the Treasure
The Old Mint was a fortress with 24-hour armed security. It sits on a huge concrete-and-granite foundation and its brick walls are two-and-one-half-feet thick. Workers counted hundreds of bags of coins twice daily.
Chaos Control
After the 1906 earthquake, Gen. Frederick Funston, commander of the Presidio, feared that criminal gangs from the Barbary Coast would exploit the city's anarchy by looting the Old Mint. He sent 10 soldiers to protect the building, which was undamaged by the quake, due to reinforced masonry and a floating foundation.
White-Collar Crime
Thieves never ransacked the Old Mint, but there were occasional inside jobs. After fixing the books, a senior clerk is said to have walked out with two bags of silver, worth $30,000, in 1901.
Paying for Itself
San Francisco bought the Old Mint from the federal government in 2003 for one dollar -- a silver coin pressed here in 1879. The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society offers rooms for day-use rental.

Full text: BACK in October, when headlines in Britain were all gloom and doom about the pending cuts to public spending, a prominent New York art dealer manning a booth at the Frieze fair in London was grumbling about business. It seemed odd considering that before him stretched a sea of bodies: roaming mobs of ardent 20-somethings and middle-aged flaneurs (not a few of them trying to look 20-something). Dealers schmoozed with art consultants who were collecting info and photographs to send home to clients who might (possibly, perhaps, we'll get back to you, love your stuff, ciao) be interested in buying something.
But not much actual business, so said the prominent New York dealer. Meanwhile Larry Gagosian's people boasted that some collector shelled out $5.6 million for a Damien Hirst, a claim prompting much private skepticism among rival dealers. The spinmeisters of the art market, including fair promoters, are forever making assertions about their commercial conquests that have to be taken on blind faith. Notwithstanding the recession, art-worlders insist smart people still pay good money for great art. (Really? Smart? Hirst?) And then occasionally dealers or even artists themselves are discovered discreetly propping up prices at auction to maintain this rosy notion.
Who's to know the truth? That skeptical New York dealer wasn't the only dissenter. But then, there were all those gawkers, just looking around. The current art world, in the form of art fairs like Frieze, as well as the ubiquitous biennials and other festivals, is without debate succeeding at something now.
It's succeeding at providing relatively cheap forms of mild distraction for ever-larger masses of fashion-conscious people whose budgets cover dinner at PizzaExpress, but not works of art.
Escapism, in other words.
It's not a minor function of culture, in straitened times or flush ones. Britain ended up sparing the arts a cut as deep as others suffered; for the big national art institutions it will be about 15 percent over four years. Arts officials, like Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate, made ritual lamentations afterward about the unfortunate "sea change" this would bring about, but the government had basically bought their argument beforehand -- that unlike welfare or child care, culture generates revenue. It brings in tourist dollars. It is good public relations for the nation, critical to the future economy. Just how critical is fuzzy math? Museum directors and publicists, like art dealers, are also masters of creative accounting.
But whatever the true figures might be, the money argument clearly trumps squishy pleas for preserving civilization to save the soul of people when trying to bargain with besieged and parsimonious politicians. Especially in austere times, the winning argument is that, business-wise and propaganda-wise, the show must go on.
Is there a culture specific to this recession, as there was to the Depression, a culture in Europe and the United States, at least? Something memorable and distinct that will define the age? Not to belittle the present malaise, but can any recession inspire such a thing in the first place?
Depressions, sure. Wars, definitely. But recession? Granted, the current slowdown and high unemployment figures are grave for many art institutions, especially small ones, without private resources; and it's bad for who knows how many aspiring Jonathan Franzens and Sasha Waltzes and Tacita Deans who decide to steer clear of careers in the arts because they've got to make money, now, and jobs are scarce.
While Wall Streeters still rake in the dough, only a tiny bit of their booty will be passed on to the arts in the form of collecting and charity. So a recession is basically as lousy for many artists as it is for the rest of us.
The recessionary 1970s, for a long time derided culturally, in retrospect produced darkling riches across the board: in film, theater, music, television, fashion, dance, literature and art. But then, besides the oil crisis and runaway inflation, there was Vietnam, Watergate, the cold war and a slew of other soul-shaking events to add to that period's climate of disillusion and unrest, which, in turn, inspired artful responses.
About the present it's just too early to say. And maybe the question's wrong to begin with. Let history sort out what defines this era.
What can be said already is that some things never change. During the 1930s and '40s Americans forgot their cares for a few hours watching William Powell down martinis as "The Thin Man," Cary Grant court Katharine Hepburn in "The Philadelphia Story," Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan swing from tree branches and Esther Williams paddle around the Aquacade. People lost themselves for an afternoon or evening at Palisades Amusement Park or Coney Island. They laughed at Fibber McGee and Jack Benny and tracked the Lone Ranger on the radio. A beleaguered audience indulged in fantasies of vicarious wealth and in preposterous extravaganzas.
That's pretty much the cultural menu now, no? Movies and "Mad Men" aside, the art world, having become almost entirely extension of the fashion and entertainment industries, offers its own version of bygone Hollywood's outlandish riches and loopy entertainment. Instead of Esther Williams, it's Jeff Koons. Instead of Tarzan, there's Olafur Eliasson. At the same time a universe of computer games, smartphone gadgets and reality television shows have come to replace the Aquacade and the amusement park.
As I said, escapism.
If this were all that art produced, the era's legacy would look dire. But it would also be grim to contemplate the arts being serious and important all the time. We need both Pierre Boulez and Tokio Hotel, Richard Serra and also Turkish soap operas. Some modern Waugh or Daumier or Tati may even now be capitalizing on the delicious way Britons and French played to type in responding to the financial crisis this fall: the Britons initially stiffening their upper lips at word that half a million jobs would be lost and $130 billion in public spending cut; the French taking to the barricades, blocking airports and refineries, shutting down gas stations and schools, just to defy President Nicolas Sarkozy's initiative that the retirement age rise to 62 from 60.
As Anne Applebaum put it on Slate: "And thus did everyone, amazingly, conform to national stereotypes. In an age of supposed globalization when we are all allegedly becoming more alike -- listening to the same American music, buying the same Chinese products -- it is astonishing how absolutely British the British remain, and how thoroughly French are the French."
Right. And that's the grander truth about culture now: that it has only become more atomized, and impossible to generalize about, because of the very global forces we're told homogenize us today. We react against those forces to assert our own identities. And culture is how, consciously or otherwise, we express those identities.
Recession, double-dip inflation, whatever, that's the essence of art now, and perhaps forever.
There's no escaping it.

Full text: CHIDAMOYO, Zimbabwe -- People lined up on the veranda of the American mission hospital here from miles around to barter for doctor visits and medicines, clutching scrawny chickens, squirming goats and buckets of maize. But mostly, they arrived with sacks of peanuts on their heads.
The hospital's cavernous chapel is now filled with what looks like a giant sand dune of unshelled nuts. The hospital makes them into peanut butter that is mixed into patients' breakfast porridge, spread on teatime snacks and melted into vegetables at dinnertime.
"We literally are providing medical services for peanuts!" exclaimed Kathy McCarty, a nurse from California who has run this rural hospital, 35 miles from the nearest tarred road, since 1981.
The hospital, along with countless Zimbabweans, turned to barter in earnest in 2008 when inflation peaked at what the International Monetary Fund estimates was an astonishing 500 billion percent, wiping out life savings, making even trillion-dollar notes worthless and propelling the health and education systems into a vertiginous collapse.
Since then, a power-sharing government has formed after years of decline under President Robert Mugabe, and the economy has stabilized. Zimbabwe abandoned its currency last year, replacing it with the American dollar, and inflation has fallen to a demure 3.6 percent. Teachers are back in their classrooms and nurses are back on their wards.
But a recent United Nations report suggests how far Zimbabwe has to go. It is still poorer than any of the 183 countries the United Nations has income data for. It is also one of only three countries in the world to be worse off now on combined measures of health, education and income than it was 40 years ago, the United Nations found.
For many rural Zimbabweans, cash remains so scarce that the 85-bed Chidamoyo Christian Hospital has continued to allow its patients to barter. Studies have found that fees are a major barrier to medical care in rural areas, where most Zimbabweans live.
"It's very difficult to get this famous dollar that people are talking about," said Esther Chirasasa, 30, who hiked eight miles through the bush to the hospital for treatment of debilitating arthritis. Her son, Cain, 13, walked at her side carrying a sack of peanuts to pay for her care.
Mrs. Chirasasa said her family of seven was nearly out of the food they grew on their small plot, so she needed to get her pain under control to work in other farmers' fields to feed her children.
Bartering helps plug some of the holes. A May survey of more than 4,000 rural households found that each of them, typically a family of six, spent an average of only $8 for all their needs in April, the cost of a couple of cappuccinos in New York. To help them get by, more than a third of households surveyed in September 2009 had used bartering.
Still, United Nations agencies estimate that 1.7 million of Zimbabwe's 11 million people will need food aid in the coming months. And Mr. Mugabe's continued domination of political life, along with persistent violations of the rule of law and human rights, have deterred foreign aid and investment needed to rebuild the nation's shattered economy, analysts say.
Here in this rustic outpost with no phone service and often no electricity, the Chidamoyo hospital and the people who rely on it have entered an unwritten pact to resist the tide of death that has carried away so many. Life expectancy in Zimbabwe, plagued by AIDS and poverty, has fallen to 47 years from 61 years over the past quarter century.
Patients provide the crops they grow and the animals they raise -- food that feeds the thousands of patients who use the hospital -- and the hospital tends to their wounds, treats their illnesses and delivers their babies. Its two doctors and 15 nurses see about 6,000 patients a month and have put 2,000 people with AIDS on life-saving antiretroviral medicines.
Even during the hyperinflation of 2008, when government hospitals ceased to function as the salaries of their workers shriveled, the Chidamoyo hospital stayed open by giving its staff members food that patients had bartered.
"People are helped very well and the staff cares about the patients," said Monica Mbizo, 22, who arrived with stomach pains and traded three skinny, black-feathered chickens for treatment.
The hospital, founded over four decades ago by American missionaries, from the Christian Church and Churches of Christ, receives limited support from a government that is itself hurting for revenue. The hospital also gets up to $10,000 a month from American and British churches, enabling it to charge patients far less in cash or goods than the fees at most government facilities. The hospital charges $1 to see the doctor -- or a quarter bucket of peanuts -- while a government hospital typically charges $4, in cash only.
Short of cash like the people it serves, the hospital practices a level of thrift unheard of in the United States. Workers and volunteers steam latex gloves to sterilize them for reuse, filling the fingers with water to ensure against leaks. They remove the cotton balls from thousands of pill bottles to swab patients' arms before injections. And they collect the tissue-thin pages of instructions from the same bottles for use as toilet paper.
But there are limits to what even stringent economies can achieve. For most of the past year, the hospital did not have enough money to stock blood. Ms. McCarty said women who hemorrhaged after giving birth or experiencing ruptured ectopic pregnancies were referred to bigger hospitals, but often they had no blood either. Eight women died, she said. Just recently, the United Nations has begun paying for blood at the hospital to improve women's odds of surviving.
Standing over an anesthetized woman before a Caesarean section, Dr. Vernon Murenje recalled how frightening it was to operate without blood in stock. "You're operating," he said, "but then at the back of your mind, you'll be thinking, 'What if we have significant blood loss?' "
As he prepared to make the incision, the hospital was in the midst of almost two weeks without power. Its old generator, already used when the hospital bought it 20 years ago, lacked enough juice to run the X-ray machine or to keep the florescent lights from flickering. It was turned on just before the Caesarean section. The air-conditioner coughed weakly to life in the stifling room.
When a boy emerged, Ms. McCarty cried, "Welcome to Zimbabwe!" But the newborn made no sound. She pounded his back and suctioned his nose until he let out a cry like a quavering baby bird.
"Oh, you finally realized you were born in Zimbabwe," she said. "He thought he was born in South Africa, and he was happy."
Postscript: The Community Presbyterian Church of Ringwood, N.J., has raised $24,000, and the Rotary Club of Sebastopol, Calif., contributed $7,000 to buy the hospital a generator.

Abstract: [...] there was a widely spread housing bubble, not just in the United States, but in Ireland, Spain, and other countries as well.

Full text: When the financial crisis struck, many people -- myself included -- considered it a teachable moment. Above all, we expected the crisis to remind everyone why banks need to be effectively regulated.
How naive we were. We should have realized that the modern Republican Party is utterly dedicated to the Reaganite slogan that government is always the problem, never the solution. And, therefore, we should have realized that party loyalists, confronted with facts that don't fit the slogan, would adjust the facts.
Which brings me to the case of the collapsing crisis commission.
The bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was established by law to "examine the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States." The hope was that it would be a modern version of the Pecora investigation of the 1930s, which documented Wall Street abuses and helped pave the way for financial reform.
Instead, however, the commission has broken down along partisan lines, unable to agree on even the most basic points.
It's not as if the story of the crisis is particularly obscure. First, there was a widely spread housing bubble, not just in the United States, but in Ireland, Spain, and other countries as well. This bubble was inflated by irresponsible lending, made possible both by bank deregulation and the failure to extend regulation to "shadow banks," which weren't covered by traditional regulation but nonetheless engaged in banking activities and created bank-type risks.
Then the bubble burst, with hugely disruptive consequences. It turned out that Wall Street had created a web of interconnection nobody understood, so that the failure of Lehman Brothers, a medium-size investment bank, could threaten to take down the whole world financial system.
It's a straightforward story, but a story that the Republican members of the commission don't want told. Literally.
Last week, reports Shahien Nasiripour of The Huffington Post, all four Republicans on the commission voted to exclude the following terms from the report: "deregulation," "shadow banking," "interconnection," and, yes, "Wall Street."
When Democratic members refused to go along with this insistence that the story of Hamlet be told without the prince, the Republicans went ahead and issued their own report, which did, indeed, avoid using any of the banned terms.
That report is all of nine pages long, with few facts and hardly any numbers. Beyond that, it tells a story that has been widely and repeatedly debunked -- without responding at all to the debunkers.
In the world according to the G.O.P. commissioners, it's all the fault of government do-gooders, who used various levers -- especially Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored loan-guarantee agencies -- to promote loans to low-income borrowers. Wall Street -- I mean, the private sector -- erred only to the extent that it got suckered into going along with this government-created bubble.
It's hard to overstate how wrongheaded all of this is. For one thing, as I've already noted, the housing bubble was international -- and Fannie and Freddie weren't guaranteeing mortgages in Latvia. Nor were they guaranteeing loans in commercial real estate, which also experienced a huge bubble.
Beyond that, the timing shows that private players weren't suckered into a government-created bubble. It was the other way around. During the peak years of housing inflation, Fannie and Freddie were pushed to the sidelines; they only got into dubious lending late in the game, as they tried to regain market share.
But the G.O.P. commissioners are just doing their job, which is to sustain the conservative narrative. And a narrative that absolves the banks of any wrongdoing, that places all the blame on meddling politicians, is especially important now that Republicans are about to take over the House.
Last week, Spencer Bachus, the incoming G.O.P. chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told The Birmingham News that "in Washington, the view is that the banks are to be regulated, and my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks."
He later tried to walk the remark back, but there's no question that he and his colleagues will do everything they can to block effective regulation of the people and institutions responsible for the economic nightmare of recent years. So they need a cover story saying that it was all the government's fault.
In the end, those of us who expected the crisis to provide a teachable moment were right, but not in the way we expected. Never mind relearning the case for bank regulation; what we learned, instead, is what happens when an ideology backed by vast wealth and immense power confronts inconvenient facts. And the answer is, the facts lose.

Abstract: The main factors holding back wages in the West were shorter workweeks, either through company-level arrangements or work-sharing programs encouraged by governments; declining labor productivity; weak consumption; and rising unemployment, all of which limited the ability of unions and workers to negotiate higher wages, the report said.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
PARIS -- The global financial and economic crisis led to a "considerable slowdown" in the growth of real wages in the West last year, while accentuating gaps between the highest and lowest earners in many countries, according to a United Nations report released on Wednesday.
The International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency based in Geneva, estimated that growth in average monthly wages worldwide was 1.6 percent in 2009 and 1.5 percent in 2008, compared with 2.8 percent in 2007, before the crisis.
Stripping out the booming economy of China, where available data was limited to urban entities linked to the state, wage growth moderated to 0.7 percent in 2009, compared with 0.8 percent in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2007, the agency estimated.
The Global Wage Report covered 115 countries and territories and was the agency's second such survey, covering the crisis years of 2008 and 2009.
It found that the rate of wage growth slowed in most countries and turned negative in a quarter of the countries sampled in 2008 and a fifth in 2009.
But there were important regional differences, notably with average wages still powering ahead in Asia but treading water in the West.
In advanced economies, the report estimated, real wages fell 0.5 percent at the onset of the crisis in 2008 before growing 0.6 percent in 2009. In 2007, they rose 0.8 percent.
In Asia, real wages grew 8 percent in 2009 after 7.1 percent in 2008 and 7.2 percent in 2007 as growth remained robust in emerging economies like India and China, the agency said.
The main factors holding back wages in the West were shorter workweeks, either through company-level arrangements or work-sharing programs encouraged by governments; declining labor productivity; weak consumption; and rising unemployment, all of which limited the ability of unions and workers to negotiate higher wages, the report said.
In Eastern Europe and Central Asia, real wage growth contracted 2.2 percent in 2009 after growth of 10.6 percent in 2008 and 17 percent in 2007, when wages were still recovering from the collapse that took place early in the transition to a market economy.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, growth stood at 2.2 percent in 2009, compared with 1.9 percent in 2008 and 3.3 percent in 2007. For Africa, wages grew 2.4 percent in 2009, from 0.5 percent in 2008. The report said that it did not have enough data to make estimates for the Middle East.
Malcolm Sawyer, a professor of economics at the Leeds University Business School in Britain, said that the outlook for wage growth in the West was still moderate, as the effects of the crisis continued to feed through the economy, and as governments and companies sought to repair damaged balance sheets and budgets.
During previous cycles, static wages had been replaced to an extent by borrowing, particularly among low earners, Mr. Sawyer said. Now, that avenue is largely closed.
Looking ahead, if static wages combine with expected increases in the prices of energy and commodities, the result will be a further decrease in purchasing power and a possible rise in social tensions, he said.
The study did not delve too deeply into the correlation between prices and wages in many countries because of the huge variations in national data.
But it noted that in four Western countries -- Britain, Canada, Germany and the United States -- inflation outstripped nominal wage growth in 2008, mainly because of the increase in oil prices that year. Thereafter, sharp declines in inflation prevented a decline in real wages in 2009.
The report also discovered that the proportion of people earning low pay -- which was defined as less than two-thirds of median wages -- had increased since the mid-1990s in more than two-thirds of the countries for which data were available. These included China, Germany, Ireland, South Korea, Poland and Spain.
"In these and other countries with a high or growing share of low pay, there is a risk that a large number of people will be left behind," the report said. "The probability of moving into better-paid jobs remains low, and the risk of being trapped into low-paid jobs is high."

Full text: Early gains in the stock market evaporated Wednesday after worries about Europe's debt crisis overshadowed signs of growth in the United States. Bond prices fell, sending long-term interest rates higher again.
The euro fell 1.2 percent against the dollar after Moody's said that it might lower Spain's credit rating. The stronger dollar hurts United States companies that do a lot of business overseas. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the broadest measure of the stock market, fell 0.5 percent.
Stock prices started the day higher after reports showed that the manufacturing industry was growing and that inflation remained under control. The Federal Reserve said factory output rose for the fifth consecutive month in November. A separate report showed that consumer prices stayed flat last month.
In the late afternoon, the Senate overwhelmingly passed an $858 billion package that would extend tax cuts passed during the Bush administration for another two years. The measure now goes to the House, where it is expected to pass despite complaints by Democrats over what they see as overly generous estate tax rates for the rich.
The unfinished tax bill made some investors pause. "No one is going to make any major planning decisions until this bill gets passed," said Timothy Speiss, a partner at EisnerAmper, a financial planning firm.
"I'm working with a lot of companies who are postponing deals until they know what the tax rates will be," Mr. Speiss said.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.07 points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,457.47.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,235.23. The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.5 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,617.22.
Coca Cola rose 1.3 percent to lead the 30 stocks that make up the Dow index. Alcoa, which fell 1.7 percent, was the worst performing stock in the index.
Consumer staples companies were the only one of the 10 groups that make up the S.& P. 500 index to rise.
Boston Beer, the maker of Sam Adams beer, rose 12.1 percent to $94.97 after it raised its 2010 earnings forecast. The company said it was shipping 12 percent more products than last year.
Ryder System gained 4.8 percent after an RBC analyst raised his investment rating on the trucking company, saying he expected demand for its services to rise.
Treasury prices fell, pushing their yields higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 15/32, to 92 15/32, and the yield rose to 3.53 percent from 3.47 percent late Tuesday. That was the highest the yield had been since May 13.
Bond yields have been rising since early October because investors expect the economy to improve. They also expect higher budget deficits because of the tax cut package.

Full text: Consumer prices in the United States rose slightly less than expected in November, and prices excluding food and energy edged up for the first time since July, according to a report on Wednesday that implied virtually no inflation pressures as an anemic recovery continued.
Another report said the nation's industrial output rose 0.4 percent in November, its biggest gain since July and the latest sign of a firmer end to the year for the nation's economy.
On the inflation front, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Indexnudged up 0.1 percent as energy prices rose by the smallest amount in five months, slowing from a 0.2 percent increase in October. The core index, which excludes food and energy, ticked up 0.1 percent as expected, after being flat for three straight months.
Economists had expected overall consumer prices to rise 0.2 percent in November.
The rise in industrial output in November, reported by the Federal Reserve, was above a median forecast of 0.3 percent in a Reuters poll, and followed a downward revision of October's reading from flat to a decline of 0.2 percent.
Output rose 5.4 percent compared with one year earlier, according to the data. A spike in utilities partly offset a 6.0 percent decline in the production of motor vehicles and parts.
Capacity use, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose to 75.2 points in November from a revised 74.9 in October, but remained substantially below its long-term average.
Officials at the Fed tend to look at utilization measures as a signal of how much "slack" remains in the economy -- how much room growth has to run before becoming inflationary.
Also on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said its gauge of manufacturing in the state rebounded in December after falling sharply in the previous month, led by growth in new orders and shipments.
The Empire State Manufacturing Survey's general business conditions index climbed 22 points, to 10.57, in December from minus 11.14 in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 5 points for December.
The new-orders index rose to 2.60 points in December from a minus 24.38 last month, while shipments rebounded to 7.11 from minus 6.13.
Employment gauges deteriorated, however. The index for the number of employees fell to a negative 3.41 in December, the lowest in a year, from 9.09 in November. The average employee workweek index slipped to minus 14.77 from minus 12.99.
The index of business conditions six months ahead dropped to 48.86 in December from 54.55 in November.
The survey of New York manufacturing plants is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to factory conditions.

Abstract: Mr. Cuomo is proposing a limit on the total amount of property tax dollars that can be collected annually by a school district, municipality or special district by capping the increase in the local tax levy at 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is less, according to his campaign literature.

Full text: Governor-elect Andrew M. Cuomo has a full plate awaiting him when he is inaugurated next month, including a gaping budget deficit. But Mr. Cuomo is already making clear to legislative leaders that one of his priorities is to cap local property taxes, which would have large consequences statewide for homeowners and school districts.
Three New York governors have tried, and failed, to limit local taxes, which are among the highest in the nation and a primary reason suburbanites and upstate residents say the state has become unaffordable.
But with the Senate all but certain to be controlled by the Republicans and voters in a tax-rebellion mood, Mr. Cuomo may be facing a more favorable political climate for a cap.
"When this issue first came up, most people saw it as an arrow in the quiver of conservative Republicans," said Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat who is a former Nassau County executive and who headed the New York State Commission on Property Tax Relief in 2008. "Now it has a broader base of support among Republicans and Democrats, with the deteriorating economic situation and rising property taxes."
Mr. Cuomo is proposing a limit on the total amount of property tax dollars that can be collected annually by a school district, municipality or special district by capping the increase in the local tax levy at 2 percent or the rate of inflation, whichever is less, according to his campaign literature. Schools traditionally receive the largest share of property taxes. Over all, the amount that New York's schools have raised in property taxes -- their tax levy -- has climbed an average of 6.9 percent annually in the past decade, to a total of $29.1 billion in 2009, according to the state comptroller's office.
The proposal is tougher than tax cap efforts in some other states, allowing only "narrow, limited exemptions" to the cap, like for large legal settlements and extraordinary capital expenditures. It could, however, be overridden by local communities with a 60 percent vote.
School districts say a cap would have a devastating effect on their budgets, prompting layoffs, school closings and program cuts. The Democratic-controlled State Assembly and the powerful state teachers' union have opposed attempts to impose caps.
But in recent weeks, Mr. Cuomo and his staff have started promoting the cap in meetings and conversations with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver; the Senate Democratic and Republican leaders, John L. Sampson and Dean G. Skelos; and New York State United Teachers. The talks have not focused on specifics, but all parties involved have told Mr. Cuomo or his aides that they are "committed to finding common ground," according to legislative aides and union leaders.
By broaching the subject even before he picks his full cabinet or explains how he expects to close the state's budget gap, Mr. Cuomo is signaling the importance he places on a property tax cap.
"The property tax cap is a centerpiece of the governor-elect's agenda," said Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo. "And he will move aggressively to see it implemented upon taking office so New Yorkers can finally receive relief from skyrocketing property taxes that are driving them from their homes and out of the state." Mr. Vlasto declined to elaborate on how the cap would work.
A cap would not directly affect New York City, where property taxes are relatively low because of revenue from the city's personal income tax, and where the schools are financed through the general city budget. But outside the city, New York is among the most heavily taxed states in the country. A 2010 report by the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Washington, found that the median property tax in New York was $3,755, compared with $1,917 in the United States.
Broken down into counties nationwide, Westchester and Nassau topped the list with $9,044 and $8,940, respectively, while Rockland was fifth with $8,542.
But Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, said last week that his members, many of whom represent New York City, recognized the tax burden faced by homeowners. "While this is a complex issue," Mr. Silver said in a statement, "I believe that we'll be able to come to a meaningful agreement with Governor-elect Cuomo."
Advocates for reining in the state's property taxes say that a cap would force school districts to spend less and bring long-term tax relief to homeowners. But opponents contend that a cap would squeeze school budgets in a year that already promises to be the toughest financially in recent years, and would force the most drastic cuts in programs and services in two decades.
They also say that it would take away local control of school finances, and only deepen inequities between middle- or low-income districts and affluent districts, where residents are more likely to override the cap.
In recent years, taxpayers throughout the state have been pressuring school and municipal officials to trim costs and consolidate services to stifle the rate of property tax increases. Similar developments have occurred in New Jersey, where the property tax burden also ranks high.
As such, Mr. Cuomo's cap would hit suburban schools at a time when many districts have already shed attractive offerings like Advanced Placement courses and art and music electives. Many districts have also laid off staff members, tapped into reserves and used up federal stimulus money, which had helped them avoid further cuts in the face of fast-rising pension, health care, utilities and special education costs.
Edmund J. McMahon, a frequent critic of New York's tax structure and a senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy in Albany, conceded that a cap would force districts to cut programs and services, but he said that would then pressure the State Legislature to undertake "sweeping mandate relief."
"School districts are past pros at crying wolf," Mr. McMahon said. "But I think in this case they really would have to make significant cuts because they're locked into these costs, and because their state aid is probably also going to be cut."
Mr. Cuomo has pledged to review all current state mandates and propose a "sunset" bill requiring that "all unnecessary unfunded mandates" be re-evaluated and eliminated unless affirmatively renewed.
A tax cap proposal surfaced as early as 1997 as part of Gov. George E. Pataki's School Tax Relief, or STAR, program, but it was dropped after opposition by legislators. It was later backed by Govs. Eliot Spitzer and David A. Paterson, who supports a 4 percent cap. This year, the Senate, which was narrowly controlled by Democrats, passed legislation for a 4 percent cap, but it has stalled in the Assembly.
Some fiscal experts say property tax caps simply shift the burden of paying for schools to other sources: income tax, sales tax, school fees and private fund-raising.
Critics have also noted that a cap would not lower taxes, only slow the rate of increase. "Look, I'm a Long Islander who pays property taxes, so I understand what everyone is looking for," said Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers. "It's just that they're looking at something that doesn't provide real property tax relief."
The teachers' union and Assembly Democrats have instead advocated a so-called circuit-breaker, a state-financed program that would give tax breaks to people based on need. The Assembly even passed a bill in 2008. But, given the state's fiscal condition, some critics say it is unrealistic to expect more state financing for schools.
Frank Gerace, a Long Island financial adviser who pays $10,000 in property taxes on his 1970s-era four-bedroom house on a half-acre, said school districts could not keep asking for more from homeowners. Mr. Gerace was a founder of a citizens group, SchoolWatch, in 2006 that helped defeat a nearly 13 percent tax rate increase in the East Islip district.
"It will wake up districts and let them know they have a limited amount of funds they can work with," Mr. Gerace said. "Right now some of them are run like country clubs."

CHARTS: NORTHEASTERN STATES: tax themselves heavily, mainly for schools. Massachusetts, which passed a tax cap in 1982, tends to be lower than its neighbors. Percentage of income that median homeowner paid in property tax, top five counties by state, 2009; SALARIES AND BENEFITS: In New York, school spending has grown rapidly as contract obligations to teachers and other employees have risen. Change from previous year in school district spending, statewide (not including New York City); PAYING FOR IT: State rebates kept property tax increases low in the early part of the decade. When they stopped rising, homeowners faced big tax increases. Since the recession, federal stimulus dollars and prior-year surpluses kept tax increases low. Change from previous year in school district revenue, statewide (not including New York City); DAY OF RECKONING: Stimulus money is gone, and state aid is expected to decrease next year. But personnel costs continue to balloon, and that means big tax increases or large layoffs. Here's a projection of the dilemma that one district may be facing.

For nearly two years, China's turbocharged economy has raced ahead with the aid of a huge government stimulus program and aggressive lending by state-run banks.
But a growing number of economists now worry that China -- the world's fastest growing economy and a pillar of strength during the global financial crisis -- could be stalled next year by soaring inflation, mounting government debt and asset bubbles.
Two credit ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch Ratings, say China is still poised for growth, yet they have also recently warned about hidden risks in its banking system. Fitch even hinted at the possibility of another wave of nonperforming loans tied to the property market.
In the late 1990s and early this decade, the Chinese government was forced to bail out and recapitalize these same state-run banks because a soaring number of bad loans had left them nearly insolvent.
Those banks are much stronger now, after a series of record public stock offerings in recent years that have raised billions of dollars from global investors.
But last week, an analyst at the Royal Bank of Scotland advised clients to hedge against the risk that a flood of cash into China, coupled with soaring inflation, could result in a "day of reckoning."
A sharp slowdown in China, which is growing at an annual rate of about 10 percent, would be a serious blow to the global economy since China's voracious demand for natural resources is helping to prop up growth in Asia and South America, even as the United States and the European Union struggle.
And because China is a major holder of United States Treasury debt and a major destination for American investment in recent years, any slowdown would also hurt American companies.
Aware of the risks, Beijing has moved recently to tame its domestic growth and rein in soaring food and housing prices by raising interest rates, tightening regulations on property sales and restricting lending.
At the end of the Central Economic Work Conference, a high-level annual economic policy meeting that concluded on Sunday, Beijing promised to combat inflation and stabilize the economy. Those pledges came just days after the central bank ordered banks to set aside larger capital reserves in a bid to slow lending, the sixth time it has done so this year. And the government reported on Saturday that the consumer price index had climbed 5.1 percent in November, the sharpest rise in nearly three years.
Analysts say more tightening measures are expected in the coming months but that the challenges are mounting.
"There are so many moving pieces," said Qu Hongbin, the chief China economist for HSBC in Hong Kong. "It wouldn't be honest to say things aren't complicated."
Optimists say China has been adept at steering the right economic course over the last decade, ramping up growth when needed and tamping it down when things get too hot.
But this time, Beijing is not just struggling with inflation, it is also trying to restructure its economy away from dependence on exports and toward domestic consumption in the hopes of creating more balanced and sustainable growth, analysts say.
China is also facing mounting international pressure to let its currency, the renminbi, rise in value. Some trading partners insist China is keeping its currency artificially low to give Chinese exporters a competitive advantage.
Beijing contends that raising the value of its currency would hurt coastal factories that operate on thin profit margins, forcing them to lay off millions of workers.
The most immediate challenge appears to be inflation, which some analysts say may be even more serious than the new figures suggest. Housing prices have skyrocketed. And prices for milk, vegetables and other foods have soared this year.
"The money supply is too large," said Andy Xie, an economist based in Shanghai who formerly worked at Morgan Stanley. "They increased the money supply to stimulate the economy. Now land prices have jumped 20 times in some places, 100 times in others. Inflation is broad-based. Go into a supermarket. Milk is more expensive in China than it is in the U.S."
In Shanghai, where the average monthly wage is about $350, a gallon of milk now costs about $5.50.
Wages have also risen sharply this year in coastal provinces amid reports of labor shortages and worker demands for higher pay. Many analysts expect more wage increases next year.
That may be good for workers, analysts say, but it will also change the dynamics of the Chinese economy and its export sector while contributing to higher inflation.
Beijing is now under pressure to mop up excess liquidity after state banks went on a lending binge during the stimulus program that got under way in early 2009. Analysts say a large portion of that lending was diverted to speculate in the property market.
In addition to restricting lending at the big state banks, Beijing recently moved to close hundreds of underground banks and attempted to restrain local governments from borrowing to build huge infrastructure projects, some of which may be wasteful, according to analysts.
Some economists say the real solution is for Beijing to privatize more industries and let the market play a bigger role. After the financial crisis hit, the state assumed more control over the economy.
Now, state banks and big state-owned companies are reluctant to surrender control over industries where they have monopoly power, analysts say.
"Inflation is not the most serious problem," says Xu Xiaonian, a professor of economics at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. "The most fundamental problem we have to resolve is structural. We need more opening up and reform policies. Look at the state monopolies in education, health care, telecom and entertainment. We need to break those up. We need to create more jobs and make the economy more innovative."
Zhiwu Chen, a professor of finance at Yale, agrees.
"The state economy and the local governments will be where the future problems occur," Professor Chen said in an e-mail response to questions on Sunday. "They will be the sources of real troubles for the banks and the financial system."
Though no economist is forecasting the end to China's decades-long bull run, many have turned more cautious. And Fitch Ratings recently released a study it conducted with the forecasting consultancy Oxford Economics that examined the effect a slowdown in China would have on the rest of the world.
Fitch expects China's economy to grow at an annual rate of 8.6 percent next year, down from about 9.7 percent this year. But the report, which was released a few weeks ago, said that if growth slowed to 5 percent, the economies of many other Asian nations would suffer seriously. Steel, energy and manufacturing industries around the world would also be hard hit, it said.
Fitch analysts are careful not to forecast a sharp slowdown in China. But if one comes, they say, it is "most likely to stem from a combination of property crash and banking crisis."

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Ascending the narrow streets that wind through this city's hillside slums, the graffiti steadily gets more radical and anti-American, repeatedly proclaiming "Yankees go home!" amid murals denouncing President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But at the same time, the cars get bigger -- as in '70s-style, gas-guzzling, Starsky-and-Hutch, Ford-Gran-Torino big -- and American.
"We like our cars to be like tanks in this country, meaning they should be huge, comfortable and preferably manufactured in the United States," said Miguel Delgado, 52, a mechanic in Los Frailes, a slum on this city's western fringe, where he was working on a 1976 Dodge Coronet and a 1979 Chevrolet Impala.
The survival here of so many retro-chic American gas hogs, from Plymouth Valiants to Dodge Aspens and Chrysler New Yorkers, owes partly to the vagaries of Venezuela's recent history and partly to its oil wealth. Motorists say that they drive these cars simply because they can. They smile when they hear that gasoline prices in the United States average about $3 a gallon, and much higher in parts of Europe.
Venezuela provides what might be the most generous fuel subsidy anywhere. Gasoline, currently less than 10 cents a gallon, is the cheapest in the world, undercutting even Saudi Arabia and Iran, other top oil-exporting nations, according to a study of global fuel prices by the German aid agency GTZ.
While Venezuela is a major oil producer, the subsidy still costs the government more than $9 billion a year. For all his populism, President Hugo Chavez has lamented its drain on public finances, calling gasoline prices "disgusting."
But he has not touched the subsidy, which many Venezuelans consider a birthright. An increase in fuel prices in 1989 helped set off riots in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed.
Today filling the tank of a 1974 Lincoln Continental, a 19-foot-long monster with a V-8 engine and mileage in the low teens, costs about $1, including a small tip for the gas-station attendant. "It's a super-economical car," said Jose Pereira, 41, the proud owner of one such model.
Many of the vintage land yachts tooling around Caracas today were imported during the heyday of "Venezuela Saudita," Saudi Venezuela, in the early 1970s, when oil prices quadrupled and this developing nation became flush with petrodollars.
A sort of proto-Chavez populist president, Carlos Andres Perez, nationalized the oil industry, sent aid to Bolivia and tried to turn Venezuela into a player in the developing world. A Concorde flight linked Caracas to Paris. So many Venezuelan shoppers flocked to Miami that they were called "dame dos," Spanish for "give me two."
"My car reminds me of the era when Venezuela was the envy of Latin America," said Jesus Regalado, 68, a taxi driver who still cruises the city in his 1975 Dodge Dart, which he bought new thanks to a government financing program.
Much has changed since then. Oil prices plunged in the 1980s, and in the ensuing tumult, Mr. Chavez, then an obscure military officer, led an unsuccessful 1992 coup attempt against Mr. Perez. After his release from prison, Mr. Chavez had better luck with electoral politics, winning the presidency in 1998 and turning Venezuela from a country where the United States wielded considerable influence to a thorn in Washington's side.
His new political alliances and another roaring oil boom, which ended abruptly in 2008, lined the roads with newer cars. An Iranian venture now manufactures a four-door sedan here called the Turpial. Officials have begun importing thousands of Russian Ladas.
In the capital's wealthier districts, S.U.V.'s like Jeep Cherokees, Ford Expeditions, even the occasional Hummer, vie for space in clogged thoroughfares with smaller Toyotas, Daewoos, Hondas and Hyundais. Thousands of motorbike couriers weave through the gridlock, adding to the chaos.
Despite the newer cars, the low growl of American guzzlers still cuts through the din of traffic, evoking in some ways the love affair that people in Cuba, Venezuela's top ally, have with pre-1960 American automobiles.
Some motorists say they buy the cars because spare parts are easily available. Others buy them to hedge against Venezuela's high inflation. Used cars hold their value remarkably well here: a 1979 Ford LTD Landau, for instance, sells for about $5,200 here compared with about $1,500 in the United States.
Still, the eight-cylinder workhorses remain cheaper than newer models, explaining their prevalence in some poor districts of Caracas and other cities. But the affection for the aging American giants that saves so many of them from the crushers cannot be explained by economics alone.
"I love my Fairlane precisely because it is American," said Freddy Gomez, 54, a deliveryman in this city's gritty Boleita district who drives a red 1974 Ford Fairlane. Grinning with a hint of mischief, he pointed to a decal on the Fairlane's rear window, which showed a mathematical equation involving the Ford logo plus a bottle of spirits plus a female figure. The sum: a couple in an amorous embrace.
"When people see me driving my Fairlane, they know I'm a man of style," he said. "This car is the F-16 of the highways, friend," he added, referring to the American warplanes, acquired before diplomatic relations soured with Washington and still flown by Venezuela's Air Force.
But many of the aging American fleet seem more like rusting turboprops than sleek fighter jets.
A 1975 Chevrolet Nova parked in the Pedregal slum had its hood tied down with string and Yosemite Sam mats on the floor. Its paint job, in hues of brown, looked like the work of a would-be Mark Rothko, punctured with dings and dents.
"Yeah, my Nova has about 30 of them," said its owner, Marcelino Rojas, 50, a house painter.
The rubber-burning days of some of these cars might be nearing an end. News reaching here from Detroit these days speaks of exotic new electric cars like the Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf. The announcement that General Motors was pulling the plug on Pontiac, the 84-year-old brand whose sales peaked in 1973, drew gasps among some Venezuelans.
"I find it hard to believe that the Americans would let Pontiac expire like that," said Oswaldo Valdes, 21, a university student who owns a 1970 Pontiac Grand Prix. "In this country, this great automobile has decades of life ahead of it."

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has been attacked for failing to foresee the financial crisis, for bailing out Wall Street, and, most recently, for injecting an additional $600 billion into the banking system to give the slow recovery a boost.
But Mr. Bernanke will face even more scrutiny in the months to come. On Thursday, House Republican leaders announced that Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the outspoken Republican libertarian who ran for president in 2008, will become the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the Fed. His position on the central bank is captured in the title of his 2009 book, "End the Fed" (Grand Central Publishing).
Here's some of what he wrote:
The Beginning of the End
"The day the Fed came into being in 1913 may have been the beginning of the end, but the powers it obtained and the mischief it caused took a long time to become a serious issue and a concern for average Americans."
The Gold Standard
"Whenever I talk of a gold standard, there are always people ready to accuse me of having some obsession or fixation. Fetish is a word thrown around. In fact, I'm only observing reality: the idea of sound money in most of human history has been bound up with gold money."
A Full-Time Counterfeiting Operation
On Mr. Bernanke: "There is something fishy about the head of the world's most powerful government bureaucracy, one that is involved in a full-time counterfeiting operation to sustain monopolistic financial cartels, and the world's most powerful central planner, who sets the price of money worldwide, proclaiming the glories of capitalism."
New Money Out of Thin Air
"Only the Federal Reserve can inflate the currency, creating new money and credit out of thin air, in secrecy, without oversight or supervision. Inflation facilitates deficits, needless wars and excessive welfare spending."
Fed Chairmen He Has Known
"Being in Congress in the late 1970s and early 1980s and serving on the House Banking Committee, I met and got to question several Federal Reserve chairmen: Arthur Burns, G. William Miller and Paul Volcker. Of the three, I had the most interaction with Volcker. He was more personable and smarter than the others, including the more recent board chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke."
Low Interest Rates
"Artificially low interest rates are achieved by inflating the money supply, and they penalize the thrifty and cheat those who save. They promote consumption and borrowing over savings and investing. Manipulating interest rates is an immoral act. It's economically destructive."
The Bailouts
"Today, there is no principled opposition to the corporate bailouts and the Fed's trillions of dollars of new credit and the takeover of insurance, mortgages, medical care, banks and the auto industry. The arguments have only been over amounts, financial vehicles, and which political group gets to wield the economic power. If there is no moral argument against the economic takeover of America, there will be no resistance to the dictator who rules over our lives with an iron fist."
The Obama Legacy
"For the same reason a disease cannot be cured by more of the germ that caused it, the inflation and debt accumulation of the Obama years will not inflate our way out of it. This depression will likely last and last."

Correction: December 19, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican who is in line to become head of the subcommittee that oversees the Federal Reserve, transposed two of the digits in one of the decades in which he served on the House Banking Committee. It was during the early 1980s, not the 1908s.

Abstract: The White House commission, headed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, proposes to wring nearly $400 billion from health care spending between 2012 and 2020, of which the biggest single element -- $110 billion -- would come from increased cost-sharing by Medicare beneficiaries. The health care reform law already limits the tax exclusion for the most costly employer plans, and eliminating it entirely sounds like a good idea in principle.

Full text: Here is a basic truth about the deficit: In the long run, it cannot be fixed, without reining in spending on Medicare and Medicaid.
This year, Medicare, Medicaid and a related children's health insurance program will account for more than 20 percent of all federal spending -- higher than Social Security or defense. Unless there are big changes, by 2035 federal health care spending -- driven by rising medical costs and an aging population -- is projected to account for almost 40 percent of the budget.
Two bipartisan commissions have issued recommendations to sharply reduce annual deficits, in part through bold changes -- some sound, others dubious -- in the way health care is paid for. Here are some of the issues that Congress will need to evaluate:
COST-SHIFTING The most disturbing element of both reports is that, in their efforts to show quick savings, they shift much of the burden from the federal budget to individuals or, in some cases, to states. That may make the federal deficit look better, but it is a shell game that produces no real reduction in the cost of health care.
Both commissions would save the government significant money by forcing all but the poorest Medicare beneficiaries to pay higher premiums and co-insurance.
The White House commission, headed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, proposes to wring nearly $400 billion from health care spending between 2012 and 2020, of which the biggest single element -- $110 billion -- would come from increased cost-sharing by Medicare beneficiaries. The second commission, an independent panel headed by Pete Domenici and Alice Rivlin, seeks to save $137 billion from Medicare cost-sharing.
Forcing beneficiaries to pay more is a reasonable way to get them to think twice before undergoing an expensive test that may not be critically necessary. But there is a big risk that people on modest incomes might forgo needed care. Beneficiaries might have to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars more out of pocket.
It would make sense to require wealthier older people to pick up more of the cost of their own health care. But almost half of all Medicare beneficiaries live on low incomes -- below $21,000 a year for an individual and $28,000 for a couple. Cost-shifting must not be allowed to undermine the health or financial security of elderly or disabled Americans of modest means.

END OF A TAX BREAK The Domenici-Rivlin panel, the more aggressive on health care, would also phase out the exclusion that exempts workers from paying taxes for employer-subsidized insurance, a benefit that also encourages excessive use of medical care. The long-term gain in tax revenue could be huge -- more than $3 trillion between 2012 and 2030 and almost $10 trillion by 2040.
The health care reform law already limits the tax exclusion for the most costly employer plans, and eliminating it entirely sounds like a good idea in principle. But it would increase the financial burden on middle- and lower-income employees. That is why they would need to have access to competitive insurance exchanges that will open in 2014 and, depending on their need, federal subsidies. Such subsidies could amount to roughly half of the tax revenues gained by eliminating the exclusion, but the net reduction of the deficit would still be large.
VOUCHERS FOR MEDICARE The Domenici-Rivlin panel has a far-reaching proposal to give Medicare enrollees vouchers to buy coverage from Medicare or a competing private plan offered on a Medicare exchange. The voucher would increase in value at roughly half the likely rate of medical inflation. If the cost of coverage rose faster than that, the beneficiary would have to pay an extra premium to cover the difference or seek a cheaper plan.
The commission believes that competition on the exchanges will cause insurance plans to find ways to lower premiums. It also believes beneficiaries will restrain their own spending. The panel projects savings from premium support and its near-term cuts and cost-shifting could be huge -- more than $2 trillion through 2030 and more than $7 trillion through 2040.
We see considerable merit in having traditional Medicare and private plans compete for business, but only if the competition is fair. There would have to be tight regulation to require plans to accept all comers, to set limits to cost-sharing.
SPENDING CAPS The health care reform law already seeks to cap the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary to roughly half the rate it has been increasing in recent decades. It empowers a new board to find savings should the target be breached, subject to Congressional veto. The Bowles-Simpson commission would expand that approach by placing a cap on total federal spending for health care -- not just Medicare and Medicaid but the subsidies on new exchanges and tax exemptions. But the commission punts on what to do should the growth cap be exceeded, as many experts deem likely.
FIXING THE SYSTEM The best way to lower health care spending is to reform the dysfunctional health care system whose costs seem unrelated to the quality of care delivered. The reform law makes a good start, sponsoring research to determine which treatments are effective and which are not, starting pilot projects to change the way care is delivered and paid for, and setting up new organizations to rush successful approaches into wide use in Medicare and ultimately the private sector.
Neither commission goes much further, probably because reformers had already scooped up most of the plausible approaches. The White House commission wants to speed up the adoption rate for reforms shown to work in pilot projects, an idea we heartily endorse.
Lawmakers from both parties need to take a serious look at the commission's recommendations. So far, we have not heard much more than the usual posturing from either side of the aisle. Meanwhile the Republicans are still vowing to repeal the new health care reform law or block its implementation. That is yet one more reason why their claims to fiscal rectitude are so unbelievable.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- The booming Chinese economy is showing signs of overheating, according to a raft of new data, and that could spell trouble for this nation's growth early next year.
On Saturday, the government said China's consumer price index -- its broadest gauge of inflation -- rose 5.1 percent in November, the biggest jump in 28 months. Food prices soared and retail sales and property construction both rose sharply, as well.
A few days earlier, the government released trade data showing that imports and exports had jumped far more than expected in November. This is happening even as the country's two leading trade partners -- the European Union and the United States -- struggle with concerns over mounting debt and slower growth.
Analysts say the new data is likely to put more pressure on China to appreciate its currency, the renminbi, which has been kept low against the United States dollar, and also to find new weapons to fight inflation and the threat of a property bubble.
Raising the value of the currency would make China's imports of oil, cotton, grain and other commodities less expensive, alleviating some pricing pressures. But China worries that a stronger currency could hurt struggling factories in the coastal provinces because they operate on thin margins and export goods based on contracts denominated in dollars.
A stimulus package from Beijing drove growth last year and much of this year by pressing banks to engage in aggressive lending and encouraging local governments to begin an investment binge and initiate huge infrastructure projects.
Also, the Chinese money supply has continued to balloon at a time when wages are rising and bad weather is affecting food supplies. The government said Friday that food prices jumped in November. Many analysts expect wages to rise sharply next year -- exacerbating inflationary pressure.
"By far the biggest challenge is inflation," said Andy Xie, an economist in Shanghai who formerly worked for Morgan Stanley. "Every social turmoil is related to inflation because it wipes out peoples' earnings."
Beijing says it is now determined to restrain growth and fight inflation. The government moved Friday to raise the reserve ratio requirement for state-run banks for the sixth time in a year in the hopes of controlling what is now seen as overly aggressive bank lending.
Earlier this year, Beijing raised interest rates for the first time in nearly three years. And more recently, the authorities in Beijing said they would tighten monetary policies. Housing prices are soaring as well, which is adding to the tensions.
Government pressure on state-run banks has had some results. Growth has moderated in recent months, but wages continue to climb and food prices seem to be rising even faster.
The reasons for Beijing's concerns are clear: Inflation could overheat the economy but also create troubles as the value of workers' earnings plummets. That could set off social unrest, one of the chief fears of the ruling Communist Party.
Beijing is worried that untamed growth will also create new strains on the nation's banking system, particularly if government policies force state-run companies to pay higher interest rates on their loans.
The banking system is still dominated by a handful of state banks and financial institutions.
In its report Saturday, after the release of new data that showed strong growth in industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investments, Goldman Sachs analysts said some areas might be growing even faster than the government is reporting, because of efforts to hide growth from experts.
"Inflation has become more widespread, highlighting it is more driven by fundamental forces, especially overly rapid aggregate demand growth, instead of random events such as bad weather, which pushed up food prices," Yu Song and Helen Qiao, analysts for Goldman Sachs, said in a report released Saturday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Investors sold Treasuries for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, sending interest rates higher in response to the tentative deal to extend Bush-era tax cuts even as the Federal Reserve was trying aggressively to keep borrowing costs low.
The frenzy on the bond market was set off on Tuesday after President Obama announced his tax-cut agreement with Republican lawmakers. Financial markets interpreted the development as likely to hasten the economic recovery but also increase the budget deficit.
The deal on taxes, which would be paired with new cuts to payroll taxes and business taxes, effectively opened up a new channel to stimulate the economy with fiscal policy. At the same time, it appeared to run headlong into the Federal Reserve's program, begun last month, to buy $600 billion in Treasury bonds in an effort to keep borrowing costs low and encourage spending by consumers and businesses.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond have been steadily rising since Oct. 7, when they were 2.39 percent.
On Tuesday, after President Obama's announcement, yields shot up, and by Wednesday afternoon they were up 19 basis points from the day before, to 3.318 percent.
They retreated to 3.259 percent on Wednesday after the Treasury Department reported positive results from its $21 billion auction of new 10-year notes.
The yield on the 10-year note ended at 3.27 percent, the highest level since mid-June. The price tumbled again Wednesday, falling 1 5/32, to 94 17/32.
That tax deal "is having the opposite effect to what the Fed wants to do on yields," said Jonathan H. Wright, a former Federal Reserve economist who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins University. "But the end objective is being supported. The Fed objective was to provide stimulus to the economy through bonds."
The government's auction attracted almost three times as many buyers than bonds sold, a ratio characterized as fairly typical. The Treasury plans a $13 billion auction of 30-year notes on Thursday.
Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital, said that the tax deal had altered the conditions under which the Fed had devised its bond purchasing program, a move known as quantitative easing.
"Those purchases were meant to push real rates down and inflation expectations up," he said. "Instead the reverse has happened. Real rates are rising and inflation expectations have not risen much since October. I think the Federal Reserve will be a little concerned."
Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, said the economy can still function with Treasuries at 4 percent, but if they rise to 5 percent the recovery could stall.
"What this means is that the Federal Reserve is facing a dilemma," he said in a research note. An increase in quantitative easing, rather than lowering yields and holding down the cost of capital, could have the opposite effect, Mr. Baumohl wrote, as bond investors increasingly worry about the prospect of higher inflation.
In an interview broadcast last weekend, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, left open the possibility of expanding the central bank's bond purchases. He defended the purchases as a way to stimulate a sluggish recovery and said the fear that they would cause inflation was "way overstated."
For consumers, the increase in bond yields could mean higher rates for home mortgages, which have already been rising in recent weeks.
"Watch mortgage rates soar and housing activity and prices dive even more in the aftermath of this bond market action," said David Rosenberg, the chief economist for Gluskin Sheff.
The fiscal expansion announced by Mr. Obama appeared to have caught the Fed by surprise, though supporters of the Fed's purchasing program argued that bond yields would be even higher had the Fed not been buying up debt.
Mr. Wright said that one consequence of the tax cut deal could be a curtailing of the Fed's program that was originally planned to last into next summer.
"Fiscal policy is presumably going to have some stimulative effect on the economy, and it lessens the need for further quantitative easing," he said.
But if quantitative easing is, indeed, cut short, the risk premiums on long-term bonds will probably rise even further, because once the Fed is sidelined as a major purchaser, investors will need stronger inducements to hold the securities.
"The cleanest interpretation here is investors are going to demand a higher return on Treasuries in order to compensate them for the greater supply," Mr. Wright said.
European bond yields also rose on Wednesday as their prices dropped. The sale of bonds by the German government received a weak response. European officials exchanged pointed comments about the need to create euro bonds as a way to pay for more bailouts of struggling countries on the Continent.
While global markets have been unsettled by the financial troubles in the euro zone in recent weeks, some deficit hawks are now turning their attention to the United States.
"This is more worry for the bond market," said Laura LaRosa, the director of fixed income at Glenmede. "The deficit problem needs to be addressed. It makes yields go higher because we are adding to the deficit and fears of inflation, and the creditworthiness of the United States comes into question."
Some analysts said fixed-income investors were taking profits in a Treasury market that had become overpriced in reaction to the Fed's quantitative easing program, which started as they priced in the program before the Nov. 3 announcement, and were possibly rebalancing portfolios.
"The market was overextended," said Robert S. Gay, the managing partner for Fenwick Advisers and a former Fed economist. "It is evidence that the market was overbought."
In the equity markets, stocks wavered within a narrow range. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.32 points, or 0.12 percent, to end regular trading at 11,372.48. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.53 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,228.28, while the Nasdaq composite index increased 10.67 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,609.16.
The FTSE 100 in Britain was down 13.92 points, or 0.24 percent. In Frankfurt, the DAX lost 26.04 points, or 0.37 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 21.48 points, or 0.56 percent.
The dollar firmed against a range of currencies.

Full text: Fortune Brands has found an antidote for its poison pill. The odd combination of liquor, golf clubs and faucets never made sense. The conglomerate structure also dissuaded specialist rivals from making takeover bids. Carving up the company should solve the problem.
Fortune says it has been considering the merits of a breakup for years, but it took the arrival of the activist investor William A. Ackman to spark action. Each of the three pieces of the business will be more attractive on its own. The spirits business, in particular, should now attract a bid from Diageo.
The company says it will take a few more months to execute its plan. But the blueprint looks well drawn. The home and security division is to be spun off. The golf unit, maker of Titleist gear, will be sold or separated. And the arm that owns beverage brands would then stand alone as a listed company.
Not surprisingly, Wall Street supported the idea. Fortune's shares are up 19 percent since Mr. Ackman's stake in the company became known. Golfing and home products may find interested buyers or do well alone. But the alcohol business represents the biggest chunk of Fortune's value. It accounts for about two-thirds of profit and has a logical buyer. Jim Beam and Maker's Mark would fit snugly inside the drinks powerhouse Diageo, which has long had a taste for bourbon.
There would be a residual, though smaller, conglomerate problem. Fortune also owns midshelf liquor brands such as Aftershock cinnamon schnapps and Old Overholt rye, which Diageo presumably could live without. Yet this is an easier problem to work around than dismantling the entire company.
Consider the valuation dynamics. Spirits are expected to generate $686 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization this year for Fortune, according to Merrill Lynch research. Putting that on a multiple of 15 would equate to a little more than $10 billion, which is roughly the company's entire current market capitalization. Still, for a buyer, that is a better deal than paying a control premium for all of Fortune and then having to unload unwanted divisions. It is certainly enough to invite a round of toasts for Mr. Ackman and for Fortune.
Global Inflation
The global oil price is again above $90 a barrel. United States Treasury yields are rising. A gauge of manufacturing exports in Britain is at a 15-year high. The link between these seemingly disparate stories is that the world is reaping what it has sown. Deflation is over and inflation is coming back -- perhaps strongly.
The oil price spike reflects a broader trend in commodities. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index of commodity prices has risen by 20 percent since the end of August. Copper, gold and silver are all muscling to records or at long-term highs.
There is more to this than simply loose monetary policy and speculation in commodities markets. In 2008 and 2009, speculators shorted the dollar and went long commodities -- physical goods seemed safer than the paper central banks were printing so liberally. The difference now is that the dollar and commodities are rising together. Meanwhile, yields on 10-year United States Treasuries are also climbing, above 3 percent.
The growing belief in the markets is that the risk of a "double dip" recession has been averted and that growth and inflation are rising. Barclays Capital raised its 2011 United States growth forecast after the tentative deal between the Obama administration and Republicans on the extension of Bush-era tax cuts. Markets are factoring in recovery. That looks bearish for very expensive bonds, but positive for commodity prices.
This, after all, is what policy makers wanted. Fiscal and monetary policies have been ultra-loose in most major economies for two years. In the United States, the twin faucets remain full on. Global growth is picking up and trade and exports are soaring -- and there is an inflationary element, too.
The implications of rising commodity prices are many and complex. Inflation is hurting poor consumers in emerging economies, notably in Asia. That must soon spread westward. Price pressures are already arriving in Britain, keeping inflation above 3 percent.
As prices rise, loose money-printing by central banks must be reined in. Economic growth may gather steam in 2011, but the price of money, too, seems certain to rise.

Full text: The bond market on Tuesday had one of its worst days this year as it sold off over concerns that President Obama's tax deal would add to the nation's budget deficit.
Mr. Obama said on Monday night that he had an agreement with Congressional Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax cuts at all income levels for two years, raising concerns that such a move would increase the deficit even as it inspired confidence in the economy.
When the markets opened Tuesday, stock indexes rose and held gains most of the day as emboldened investors assumed more risk and drained life from the Treasury market.
The tax deal could mean an increase in growth rates in the United States, with rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates.
Bond prices fell, while yields shot up. Pressure built on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note. Its yield has risen since hitting 2.39 percent on Oct. 7.
On Tuesday, it rapidly crossed a psychological threshold of 3.08 percent. The yield on the 10-year note was 3.13 percent, up significantly from 2.93 percent late Monday. Its price dropped 1 23/32, to 95 22/32.
Higher yields, if sustained, will mean costlier home mortgage rates. The jump in rates has taken place even as the Federal Reserve has acted to contain borrowing costs to aid the recovery.
Anthony G. Valeri, a market strategist for LPL Financial, said the bond market performance also demonstrated anticipation that the Fed might raise interest rates sooner. "We had a pretty violent reaction to the passage of the tax cut extension," he said.
In addition, the bond sell-off made investors timid before auctions this week of 10-year and 30-year notes. "As if today's selling wasn't enough, we have got fresh supply coming in tomorrow," Mr. Valeri said.
The effect could also signal that the government will have to sell more bonds to finance the deficit, said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.
But the tax deal could have positive implications for the economy, which spurred investors to reconsider the allocation of their assets. Consumer spending, business investment and corporate profits could increase, Wells Fargo economists said in a research note.
Stocks rallied on the news, but lost some steam at the end of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.03 points, or 0.03 percent, to 11,359.16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a two-year high during the day but closed up just 0.63 points, or 0.05 percent, at 1,223.75 while the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.57 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,598.49.
Analysts said investors were primed to leave havens and return to riskier equities because of upbeat trends in economic data -- Friday's jobs report notwithstanding -- and signs of some calm in the European markets.
The CRB commodities index ended down but copper rose more than 1 percent on prospects of a recovery. Financials, which are affected more by interest rates, were weaker. But Citigroup was up more than 3.8 percent at $4.62 after the United States Treasury said late Monday that it had sold its remaining stake in the bank.A report from the Federal Reserve said total consumer credit outstanding rose at an annual rate of 1.7 percent to reach $2.39 trillion in October as nonrevolving accounts climbed.

Abstract: The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday evening that rising inequality was eroding social cohesion and that Congress could help economic growth by making the tax code more efficient. On fiscal policy, a topic he has largely avoided, Mr. Bernanke repeated his point that the government should avoid an immediate contraction that could jeopardize the fragile recovery, while at the same time starting to address "the long-term structural budget deficit."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday evening that rising inequality was eroding social cohesion and that Congress could help economic growth by making the tax code more efficient.
The statements, in an interview with "60 Minutes" on CBS, were a rare foray outside the strict boundaries of the Fed's mandate, to which Mr. Bernanke has typically confined his remarks.
In the interview, which was taped last week during a visit to the Ohio State University, Mr. Bernanke was unusually blunt in defending the Fed's decision last month to inject $600 billion into the banking system to jolt the flagging recovery.
"This fear of inflation, I think, is way overstated," Mr. Bernanke said. "We've looked at it very, very carefully. We've analyzed it every which way."
On fiscal policy, a topic he has largely avoided, Mr. Bernanke repeated his point that the government should avoid an immediate contraction that could jeopardize the fragile recovery, while at the same time starting to address "the long-term structural budget deficit."
But he went slightly further when asked how Congress might help the economy grow.
"The tax code is very inefficient -- both the personal tax code and the corporate tax code," Mr. Bernanke said. "By closing loopholes and lowering rates, you could increase the efficiency of the tax code and create more incentives for people to invest."
That statement seemed to be an endorsement of one proposal from the fiscal commission appointed by President Obama. Among the ideas it put forward last week was reducing personal income tax rates but eliminating a number of popular deductions.
When asked about rising inequality in the United States, Mr. Bernanke offered a response that was likely to be embraced by liberals.
"It's a very bad development," he said. "It's creating two societies. And it's based very much, I think, on educational differences. The unemployment rate we've been talking about. If you're a college graduate, unemployment is 5 percent. If you're a high school graduate, it's 10 percent or more. It's a very big difference."
Mr. Bernanke added: "It leads to an unequal society, and a society which doesn't have the cohesion that we'd like to see."
During the interview, Mr. Bernanke reiterated his view that a double-dip recession was unlikely, but added, "We're not very far from the level where the economy is not self-sustaining."
The chairman also left open the option of going beyond the $600 billion of Treasury securities the Fed plans to buy through June 2011.
"It's certainly possible," Mr. Bernanke said, adding: "It depends on the efficacy of the program. It depends on inflation. And finally, it depends on how the economy looks."
Mr. Bernanke offered a retort to critics, saying, "We're not printing money. The amount of currency in circulation is not changing. The money supply is not changing in any significant way."
Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed was highly unlikely to change course when it meets on Dec. 14 for the final time this year.
The Fed has made it clear that its implicit long-run target for inflation is around 2 percent or slightly less, and Mr. Bernanke said that "we've been very, very clear that we will not allow inflation to rise above" that level.

Abstract: Tightening the money supply might mean China's central bank would buy fewer dollars and might strengthen the renminbi against the dollar and other major currencies -- the effect critics of China's monetary policy have been seeking.

Full text: BEIJING -- China will tighten its monetary policy next year, the country's leaders said Friday, a sign that they are increasingly concerned about inflation and an overheated economy.
The move, announced in an article by Xinhua, China's official news agency, comes as other nations, including the United States, continue to grapple with a global recession.
Xinhua reported that the Politburo, the elite team led by nine members at the top of the Communist Party hierarchy, had decided that China's monetary policy should shift "from relatively loose to prudent next year." The article also said China "will continue its proactive fiscal policy," meaning that investment spending would not be severely curbed.
China's economy has continued to grow rapidly, bolstered in part by an enormous government stimulus package and liberal lending by state banks after the global financial crisis began in late 2008. The move to rein in liquidity and bank lending, presumably through interest rate increases and other means, indicates that Chinese leaders feel confident enough in prospects for future growth that they can afford to cool down the economy.
The Xinhua article did not discuss the implications of a tighter monetary policy for the value of the renminbi. But one reason China has kept its monetary policy loose for the last several years has been to issue more renminbi and buy United States dollars.
That currency market intervention has kept the renminbi weak and has made Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets while making foreign goods more expensive in China. The United States, Europe and some developing countries have become increasingly concerned; they say the relative weakness of the renminbi has caused the transfer of jobs and economic growth to China. And the Obama administration in particular has been putting pressure on China to let the renminbi appreciate.
Tightening the money supply might mean China's central bank would buy fewer dollars and might strengthen the renminbi against the dollar and other major currencies -- the effect critics of China's monetary policy have been seeking. But analysts do not expect the shift in policy to lead to significant currency appreciation.
The government reported that the consumer price index, an indicator of inflation, rose 4.4 percent in October from the same month in 2009. The increase was the largest in 25 months and higher than the rate policy makers in Beijing are comfortable with. The government wants the average throughout all of 2010 to be no higher than 3 percent; in May, the index nudged up to 3.1 percent over May 2009 and has been gradually rising since.
Some analysts say the government will raise interest rates throughout 2011 to curb spending.
In October, the government slightly raised a benchmark lending rate, apparently to slow real estate speculation. The property market in China has been booming. Rising property prices, along with the government stimulus money and loose bank lending, have spurred new developments across the country, from the windswept plains of Inner Mongolia to the tropical southern island of Hainan. Some analysts say this has resulted in a dangerous bubble in the real estate market, while others argue that the capacity will be put to good use.
A record $560 billion of residential property was sold in 2009, an increase of 80 percent over 2008, according to government statistics.
Some officials in the central government have indicated they recognize there is a risk to loose bank lending and presumably want to slow it. Victor C. Shih, an associate professor at Northwestern University, has estimated that state banks have lent $1.6 trillion to companies owned by local governments, and that a significant portion of that is likely to pile up as bad loans, posing a risk to state banks.
Low wages have helped to hold down inflation. But those wages, coupled with the hot property market, mean that migrant workers from the interior of China are less tolerant of poor work conditions on the coasts, where many of China's export manufacturing factories are located. Many workers are now choosing to stay closer to home in the interior provinces.
China Daily, an official English-language newspaper, reported on Monday that two large manufacturing hubs, the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta, are experiencing severe worker shortages. The Pearl River Delta could be short by as many as 900,000 workers, the newspaper reported, citing a recent survey by the human resources department of Guangdong Province.

Abstract: Grappling with sharply divergent economic performance by euro area members, the central bank disappointed investors who had looked for more than just a continuation of existing programs and had awaited a signal of a bold expansion of monetary support. Investors have criticized European governments for a lack of decisiveness during the crisis and had hoped the central bank might step in to fill the void, specifically by broadening its purchase of government bonds through quantitative easing, as the Federal Reserve has done to put cash into the United States economy.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank on Thursday continued its emergency support to weak countries within Europe but stopped short of more aggressive action to contain the debt crisis that has already engulfed Greece and Ireland.
Just months after the central bank indicated that it would wind down its extraordinary loan program to banks, its officials conceded that the program was still needed. Traders said the central bank was also buying Irish and Portuguese debt on open markets on Thursday, continuing a program begun this year and pushing up bond prices and lowering the cost of borrowing for these countries.
Grappling with sharply divergent economic performance by euro area members, the central bank disappointed investors who had looked for more than just a continuation of existing programs and had awaited a signal of a bold expansion of monetary support.
Investors have criticized European governments for a lack of decisiveness during the crisis and had hoped the central bank might step in to fill the void, specifically by broadening its purchase of government bonds through quantitative easing, as the Federal Reserve has done to put cash into the United States economy.
The president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, said an "overwhelming majority" of the bank's governing council had agreed to continue the debt purchases begun in May -- an admission that the decision was not unanimous. Instead of promising stronger measures, he emphasized that the central bank's action was "not quantitative easing."
Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote, "We are disappointed."
He added, "We see no reason to think any risks -- perceived or imagined -- arising from the twin crises of Euroland's sovereign debt and banking sector are reduced by today's E.C.B. council meeting."
Mr. Trichet must balance a number of opposing forces. Growth in Germany has been better than expected but contrasts ever more sharply with the results in weaker countries. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, expanded 0.7 percent in the third quarter, the European statistics agency Eurostat said Thursday. That compared with 0.4 percent growth for the entire euro zone, and a 1.1 percent decline in Greece.
Inflation remains subdued, but the central bank could face a quandary if prices start to rise in faster-growing parts of the euro area. Sworn to keep prices in check, the central bank might have to raise interest rates even while weaker countries still struggle to grow.
The bank's governing council left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 percent on Thursday, as expected. The bank has stood pat on interest rates since May 2009. Most analysts do not expect an increase until well into 2011.
Asked Thursday at a news conference if diverging growth rates made it more difficult for the bank to develop a monetary policy that is right for all 16 euro area members, Mr. Trichet argued that growth in the strong countries would help the weak members.
"Those parts of the euro area economy that have real gains in competitiveness through hard work can now be a source of growth for the benefit of the euro area as a whole," he said. The central bank on Thursday revised its forecast for the entire area slightly higher.
Mr. Trichet also faces a divide among bank policy makers much like the one among European governments.
Axel A. Weber, the president of the Bundesbank and a member of the governing council, has criticized the central bank's bond purchases, and he said that investors should share the burden of future debt and bank crises -- a position shared by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany but not Mr. Trichet.
On Thursday, Mr. Trichet seemed to reject the role that others often want to thrust on him as the euro's last line of defense.
Speaking in New Delhi, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, suggested that central banks could do more to support growth.
"Growth is the most important thing," he said, according to Reuters. "But because of a very high level of public debt, the burden falls on monetary policy."
Mr. Trichet, however, put the onus on governments rather than the central bank to respond more firmly.
"We need an improvement in the 'E' letter of E.M.U.," he said, referring to European Monetary Union. He added, though, that "observers should never underestimate" European leaders. "When times are very demanding, the Europeans are making decisions," Mr. Trichet said.
In Brussels, suggestions that the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was pushing for an emergency weekend summit meeting were played down. Diplomats said a meeting would be useful only if far-reaching plans were under way.
Financial markets reacted positively on Thursday, apparently cheered by the extended support for banks and reports that the central bank was buying bonds of weak countries.
"As Trichet was speaking, the E.C.B. moved in aggressively, buying Portuguese and Irish bonds," said Charles Diebel, chief strategist at Lloyds TSB Bank in London. "The E.C.B. is saying, 'We're doing as much as we can within our remit. Now it's over to the governments.' " But Mr. Diebel added: "This doesn't sort out the real, underlying problems in the euro zone."
Prices on Italian, Portuguese, Belgian, Irish and Spanish 10-year bonds rose sharply, while the safer German 10-year benchmark issue slipped a touch. Earlier, an auction of Spanish government debt met with firm demand, which also helped improve sentiment.
The euro rose to $1.3210 in New York from $1.3139 on Wednesday.
European stocks rose after the central bank meeting, having slipped earlier in the day. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, rose 2.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London was up by the same amount.
In Madrid, the Spanish government sold 2.5 billion euros, or $3.3 billion, of three-year bonds at an average yield, or effective interest rate, of 3.7 percent. Though the yield was well above the 2.5 percent the state paid at a similar auction in October, the offering was oversubscribed, showing solid demand. A higher yield suggests that investors were demanding a premium to compensate for a higher perceived risk.
"Trichet tried to calm markets without giving them everything they wanted," said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING in Brussels. "After today's E.C.B. meeting, turbulence on bond markets is not likely to calm down quickly."
As of Monday, the European Central Bank had spent 69 billion euros buying government bonds on open markets, a fraction of the Fed's bond purchases. Unlike the Fed, the central bank "sterilizes" the purchases by taking in the same amount in bank deposits, avoiding perceptions it is printing money and fueling inflation. Mr. Trichet said Thursday that the central bank would continue doing so.
The bank has been trying to reduce the extraordinary support it began extending to the banking system at the height of the financial crisis. But it is clear that institutions in Ireland and some other countries would not be able to function without the unlimited loans that the central bank has been providing.
The bank said Thursday that it decided to continue providing unlimited three-month loans to banks at least through mid-April. Previously, it had committed to providing the low-cost liquidity only until mid-January, making loans to banks at 1 percent interest, provided the institutions could offer collateral.
The bank began buying bonds in May to halt a run on Greek debt. Purchases dwindled after July, but they have increased recently. The bank bought debt worth 1.35 billion euros last week, a level that was still much lower than in May and June, when it spent 59 billion euros buying debt on secondary markets.
The central bank does not disclose what European government bonds it has bought. It reports only once a week, on Monday, on the size of the purchases.

Abstract: Scott Marcouiller, the chief technical market strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, said that investors were probably learning to live with the uncertainty over Europe's financial troubles. The data was the latest in a series of encouraging economic reports, including better retail sales and an upward revision to the pace of the nation's economic output in the third quarter, to an annualized 2.5 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, Mr. Marcouiller said.

Full text: Stocks surged on Wednesday as investors temporarily put aside worries over Europe's debt crisis and focused on signs of global economic growth, particularly in the United States and Asia.
Hope that the United States job market may be coming back to life gave a powerful push to prices on Wall Street. The monthly report from ADP Employer Services, the payroll processing firm, said that private employers added 93,000 jobs in November, more than expected.
"It would be jobs data that was the primary stimulus, and also some comfort coming out of the European situation," said Dan McMahon, director of equity trading at Raymond James & Associates.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 249.76 points, or 2.3 percent, higher at 11,255.78. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 25.52 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,206.07, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite added 51.20 points, or 2 percent, to close at 2,549.43.
The 2.2 percent rise in the S.& .P 500 was the biggest gain in the index since Sept. 1.
Weeks of worry that debt troubles in Europe could spread beyond Ireland appeared to settle somewhat. The Portuguese government successfully sold debt, albeit at higher interest rates, and there was speculation that the European Central Bank would step up to confront the turmoil in the euro zone.
Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, hinted on Tuesday that the bank could adopt more aggressive bond-buying measures if needed, saying that investors might not fully appreciate the European Union's resolve. "Pundits are tending to underestimate the determination of governments," Reuters quoted Mr. Trichet as saying.
The Portuguese debt management agency sold 500 million euros, or $654 million, of 12-month Treasury bills on Wednesday at an average yield of 5.281 percent -- up from 4.81 percent for a similar auction in November. Although investors were asking for a higher return to take on a greater perceived risk, demand for the securities was a healthy 2.5 times the amount offered.
Scott Marcouiller, the chief technical market strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, said that investors were probably learning to live with the uncertainty over Europe's financial troubles.
"People are buying the dips," he said. "People are looking past the negative news and willing to buy short term."
The International Monetary Fund and the European Union agreed on Sunday to rescue Ireland with a $111 billion program, after a similar bailout of Greece last spring, though neither action has done much to alleviate fears that the contagion will spread.
The global stock rally on Wednesday got its start in Asia as an upbeat manufacturing report in China eased concerns that the Chinese economy could slow as it wrestled with inflation and soaring housing prices.
In Beijing, the state-affiliated China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported that its purchasing managers index rose to 55.2 last month, from 54.7 in October. A similar manufacturing survey by HSBC rose to an eight-month high.
"When days like this come along it becomes a buying opportunity for commodities," said Paul Christopher, senior international investment strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors.
As a result, the energy, industrials and materials sectors were the biggest gainers on the broader market.
Indeed, recent data have suggested that manufacturing and economic activity is increasing. That, in turn, has set off a broad-based rise in the price of commodities, Mr. Christopher said.
In the United States, the Labor Department revised higher the annual rate of worker productivity in the third quarter to 2.3 percent on Wednesday.
The data was the latest in a series of encouraging economic reports, including better retail sales and an upward revision to the pace of the nation's economic output in the third quarter, to an annualized 2.5 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, Mr. Marcouiller said.
As a result, he said, stocks in economically sensitive sectors like industrials and materials would probably show improvement, while the dollar was likely to decline as the Federal Reserve pursued its quantitative easing program of purchasing government securities.
All of the Dow components rose on Wednesday, while 483 stocks on the S.& P. 500 finished higher.
Energy stocks were up nearly 3 percent, while materials and industrial stocks rose more than 2 percent. Schlumberger rose 4.54 percent, to $80.85, and Anadarko Petroleum was up 4.86 percent, to $67.28. General Electric was up 2.97 percent, to $16.30. Alcoa was up 3.39 percent, to $13.57.
Bank of America rose 3.20 percent, to $11.29, retracing ground after it had fallen 3.18 percent on Tuesday on worries that it might be the target of a forthcoming WikiLeaks document release.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell more than a full point as its yield rose to 2.96 percent, from 2.80 percent late Tuesday.

Abstract: Congress and the White House now have a chance to take out an insurance policy against the risk that the recovery will fade in coming months, just as it did over the summer. Because the Bush tax cuts will expire unless new legislation is enacted, they offer a chance to get that insurance policy through Congress.

Full text: WASHINGTON
Democrats have left themselves in a tough spot on the Bush tax cuts. After delaying the issue until after the election and then being trounced in that election, they find themselves with little leverage.
If they cannot come up with a plan that can win 60 votes in the Senate, which means at least two Republican votes, Republicans can filibuster any bill. All of the tax cuts would then expire on Dec. 31. When the new Republican House majority arrives in January, it will be able to make its first order of business a retroactive tax cut -- forcing President Obama and Senate Democrats to choose between a purely Republican plan and an across-the-board tax increase.
So the big question is whether Democratic leaders can come up with any compromise that centrist Democrats and a couple of Republican senators -- Scott Brown, who represents liberal Massachusetts? George Voinovich of Ohio, who is retiring? -- are willing to accept.
Much of the recent commentary about the tax cuts has skipped over this political reality. It's instead focused on how tough the Democrats should be and whether they should insist on the expiration of all the Bush tax cuts on income above $250,000 a year. But that's no longer one of their options. Unless they believe they will benefit more than Republicans from a standoff in which taxes go up, which is hard to believe with a Democrat in the White House, their only choice now is among various versions of retreat.
A small group of Obama administration officials and lawmakers from each party will be negotiating over the next few days, and two possibilities are getting the most attention.
The first is a millionaire's tax, in which the Bush tax cuts would be extended only on income below $1 million. This would raise only half as much as Mr. Obama's proposal -- allowing the cuts to expire on all income above $250,000 -- but it would still eliminate roughly 8 percent of the medium-term budget deficit. A millionaire's tax would also mean that the tax code would again begin to distinguish between the merely affluent and the truly wealthy, as was the case decades ago.
The second, more likely option is to extend all the tax cuts -- and to package them with other tax cuts and spending likely to do more to help the economy than the Bush tax cuts. (Remember, after President George W. Bush signed the cuts in 2001, the economy lost jobs for the next two years, and economic growth during his presidency was mediocre.) These other measures could include a tax cut for businesses that added workers, an across-the-board payroll tax cut and an extension of unemployment benefits.
Combining the two ideas -- using the revenue from the millionaire's tax to pay for job creation programs -- may also be possible. Senator Mark Warner, a moderate Virginia Democrat, has been pushing a similar idea.
The safer strategy is focusing on job creation, without involving the millionaire's tax. Republicans would then be forced to accept additional tax cuts, some of which were originally Republican ideas, or to stand in the way of extending the Bush cuts. Democrats, for their part, could avoid repeating their mistake of early this year, when they assumed a recovery was under way and failed to do enough to help the economy.
Today, the economy looks striking similar to the way it did at the start of the year, with the latest numbers again pointing to a recovery. Retail sales over Thanksgiving weekend were strong. The last jobs report showed more hiring than expected. Yet the outlook remains highly uncertain, partly because of the debt troubles in Europe.
The great historical lesson of financial crises is they tend to have bigger, longer-lasting effects than policy makers think. Congress and the White House now have a chance to take out an insurance policy against the risk that the recovery will fade in coming months, just as it did over the summer. Because the Bush tax cuts will expire unless new legislation is enacted, they offer a chance to get that insurance policy through Congress.
The political argument for taking a risk and trying to pass the millionaire's tax is that it will allow the Democrats to cast themselves as friends of the middle class. The economic argument is that such a tax would probably do more long-term good than any of the other remaining options.
The country, as you've no doubt heard, is facing a huge budget deficit. To reduce the deficit to a level economists consider sustainable, Washington needs to find about $400 billion in annual tax revenue and spending cuts by 2015. A millionaire's tax would be a good start, producing about $30 billion a year. By comparison, Mr. Obama's plan to freeze federal workers' pay would save about $5 billion a year.
A millionaire's tax would also fall on an income group that, by almost any definition, can best handle a tax increase. Since 1980, pretax income for households making at least $1 million has more than tripled, after adjusting for inflation. Pretax income for households in the dead middle of the income distribution, making roughly $50,000, has risen just 13 percent.
At the same time, the wealthy have received a much bigger tax cut over the last three decades than any other group. The total federal tax rate on households making more than $1 million -- including the income tax, the payroll tax and others -- was above 50 percent in 1980. In recent years, it has been about 33 percent.
Finally, a millionaire's tax would make a distinction between the 400,000th dollar of income and the 40 millionth dollar. Today, the government taxes those dollars at the same rate, which is hard to justify in a country with a progressive tax system and high inequality. Until the 1970s, the highest tax bracket began at more than $1 million a year in today's dollars.
So which route should Democrats take? It depends on whether they think they have any chance of persuading a couple of Republicans to vote for a millionaire's tax. If the Democrats fail and don't leave themselves enough time to pass a bill with job creation measures, they will be facing total capitulation -- an extension of the high-end Bush tax cuts with nothing in return.
And what should the Republicans do? Perhaps, when faced with the final choice, a few of them will be willing to vote for either reducing the deficit or helping the economy.

Full text: The best thing about the Irish right now is that there are so few of them. By itself, Ireland can't do all that much damage to Europe's prospects. The same can be said of Greece and of Portugal, which is widely regarded as the next potential domino.
But then there's Spain. The others are tapas; Spain is the main course.
What's striking about Spain, from an American perspective, is how much its economic story resembles our own. Like America, Spain experienced a huge property bubble, accompanied by a huge rise in private-sector debt. Like America, Spain fell into recession when that bubble burst, and has experienced a surge in unemployment. And like America, Spain has seen its budget deficit balloon thanks to plunging revenues and recession-related costs.
But unlike America, Spain is on the edge of a debt crisis. The U.S. government is having no trouble financing its deficit, with interest rates on long-term federal debt under 3 percent. Spain, by contrast, has seen its borrowing cost shoot up in recent weeks, reflecting growing fears of a possible future default.
Why is Spain in so much trouble? In a word, it's the euro.
Spain was among the most enthusiastic adopters of the euro back in 1999, when the currency was introduced. And for a while things seemed to go swimmingly: European funds poured into Spain, powering private-sector spending, and the Spanish economy experienced rapid growth.
Through the good years, by the way, the Spanish government appeared to be a model of both fiscal and financial responsibility: unlike Greece, it ran budget surpluses, and unlike Ireland, it tried hard (though with only partial success) to regulate its banks. At the end of 2007 Spain's public debt, as a share of the economy, was only about half as high as Germany's, and even now its banks are in nowhere near as bad shape as Ireland's.
But problems were developing under the surface. During the boom, prices and wages rose more rapidly in Spain than in the rest of Europe, helping to feed a large trade deficit. And when the bubble burst, Spanish industry was left with costs that made it uncompetitive with other nations.
Now what? If Spain still had its own currency, like the United States -- or like Britain, which shares some of the same characteristics -- it could have let that currency fall, making its industry competitive again. But with Spain on the euro, that option isn't available. Instead, Spain must achieve "internal devaluation": it must cut wages and prices until its costs are back in line with its neighbors.
And internal devaluation is an ugly affair. For one thing, it's slow: it normally take years of high unemployment to push wages down. Beyond that, falling wages mean falling incomes, while debt stays the same. So internal devaluation worsens the private sector's debt problems.
What all this means for Spain is very poor economic prospects over the next few years. America's recovery has been disappointing, especially in terms of jobs -- but at least we've seen some growth, with real G.D.P. more or less back to its pre-crisis peak, and we can reasonably expect future growth to help bring our deficit under control. Spain, on the other hand, hasn't recovered at all. And the lack of recovery translates into fears about Spain's fiscal future.
Should Spain try to break out of this trap by leaving the euro, and re-establishing its own currency? Will it? The answer to both questions is, probably not. Spain would be better off now if it had never adopted the euro -- but trying to leave would create a huge banking crisis, as depositors raced to move their money elsewhere. Unless there's a catastrophic bank crisis anyway -- which seems plausible for Greece and increasingly possible in Ireland, but unlikely though not impossible for Spain -- it's hard to see any Spanish government taking the risk of "de-euroizing."
So Spain is in effect a prisoner of the euro, leaving it with no good options.
The good news about America is that we aren't in that kind of trap: we still have our own currency, with all the flexibility that implies. By the way, so does Britain, whose deficits and debt are comparable to Spain's, but which investors don't see as a default risk.
The bad news about America is that a powerful political faction is trying to shackle the Federal Reserve, in effect removing the one big advantage we have over the suffering Spaniards. Republican attacks on the Fed -- demands that it stop trying to promote economic recovery and focus instead on keeping the dollar strong and fighting the imaginary risks of inflation -- amount to a demand that we voluntarily put ourselves in the Spanish prison.
Let's hope that the Fed doesn't listen. Things in America are bad, but they could be much worse. And if the hard-money faction gets its way, they will be.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
We are not going to shop our way out of this mess.
It's a cheerless truth about the post-Thanksgiving start of the Christmas season, traditionally the bell lap in America's year-long steeplechase of buying. There has been a rebound in consumption since the grimmest days of the Great Recession, but that has not been joined by an uptick in hiring or a robust expansion.
So the question of our anxious age: What will return our economy to full-throttled life? We're not talking about tactical measures that will ease fears of a double-dip recession, or maintain some upward momentum in the stock market, or even add another 151,000 new jobs, as the economy did in October.
What's needed is a path to sustained growth. That means a strategy for the millions who have lost their jobs in recent years and some hope for the more than 125,000 new entrants to the United States labor market each month.
Got any ideas?
Many academics do, though fair warning: some of their concepts are a little out there, a reflection, perhaps, of the severity of our problems. Also, canvassing these people is depressing. If you are planning a holiday party and would like a bit of merriment with your tinsel and egg nog, a few of these big thinkers should be left off your list. Several preface their thoughts with brace-yourself sighs and even the ideas that excite them have a pretty grim cast.
"Age and disease will be our next engine of growth," says Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School. "That's the really good news."
As millions of baby boomers retire, she says, they will segue from their accumulation years into their spend-down years.
"They're going to be spending a lot on health care," Professor Ghilarducci said, "to forestall disease, to make themselves look younger. Low-end services, high-end services. CT scans, face lifts, bionic knees. We all think that health care is a high percent of gross domestic product now, but we ain't seen nothing yet."
But is it a good idea to nip, tuck and CT scan our way to prosperity?
"If I were predicting a huge new demand for straw brooms," she said, "that would not be a reason for optimism, because there isn't room for technological breakthroughs when it comes to straw brooms, or a lot of high-paying jobs. But spending on health care yields all sorts of breakthroughs and jobs at every skill level, from very low to very high."
The aging of America presents a different sort of opportunity to James K. Galbraith, a professor at the University of Texas, who opened an interview with this very succinct expression of pessimism:
"We're likely to see a situation that makes people angry and miserable for years."
But Professor Galbraith said he saw a way to alleviate the misery of one large group of Americans: the jobless elderly. Instead of sending them unemployment checks, the government should temporarily allow workers who are, say, 62 years old, to retire with full Social Security benefits. In essence, he said, the government would continue providing these people with assistance, but through retirement benefits instead of unemployment insurance.
Not only would they no longer be forced to compete for jobs they are unlikely to get, they would have 22.5 percent more purchasing power than they would have if forced to wait until the age when full Social Security benefits currently kick in. Collectively, that added purchasing power would drive demand for a variety of health and home care services -- also known as jobs.
To economists from the conservative, free-market wing of the discipline this will sound like more of the medicine that put us in the hospital. Their main worry is that the government will intervene and make matters worse.
"Growth doesn't come from big federal programs," says John H. Cochrane of the University of Chicago. "The government didn't tell us" to create the vast variety of profitable businesses on the Internet, but "it did tell us to buy houses and look what that got us."
Professor Cochrane said he was not a forecaster. He is, however, an optimist.
"The fundamentals are there. We have had a financial panic, but in the long run, growth is determined by businesses with great ideas, and we still have plenty of those. Now, it's perfectly possible we're in for a miserable decade but only if the government screws it all up, with high tax rates, chaotic tax rates, or if we suffer as a result of the overhang of government debt."
Professor Cochrane and others counseled against a search for quick fixes. Mark A. Calabria of the Cato Institute went further, emphasizing that time was a key ingredient to a recovery.
It could take years for the millions of people once employed by the housing industry -- from construction workers to real estate agents -- to find new careers or return to their former careers when and if a strong housing market returns.
"I think we also have a bubble in the labor market for state and local government employees," he said, "and over the next two years we might see as many as one million of these employees lose their jobs."
So don't expect a speedy return to 7 percent unemployment, he said. For silver linings, he pointed to exports, which he thinks will be a source of growth, given the weaker dollar. And he sees an upside in an unlikely place: inflation, which he says might go from 2 percent today to 3 or 4 percent in the coming years.
"If you have a house worth $200,000 and a mortgage of $250,000, inflation is going to raise the nominal value of your home," he said. "But your mortgage will stay the same. For borrowers who are underwater, inflation will get their heads closer to above water."
Before we start rooting for higher inflation, or re-jiggering Social Security, or scaling back government, let's ask a more basic question: Is there no technological marvel on the horizon that could create an unexpected bounty in jobs? The way the railroads did in the 19th century or the way the Internet and computer industries did starting in the early '80s?
Green-energy initiatives like solar power, wind power and fuel cells are often described as jobs machines just waiting for ignition. True?
"I think the potential is there but the question is when and the question is how," said Christian Menegatti of Roubini Global Economics. "Investments like that are risky and they won't pay off for a number of years, and probably even longer. Those kind of projects will need public incentives."
Public incentives, he noted, aren't likely to emerge from a Republican-dominated House.
How about a cheap technology that our mortal minds can't currently fathom? A decade ago, who could have imagined that more than a million people would pay $1 for a portable phone video game in which you slash watermelons with a Japanese sword? Who, in other words, could have envisioned the Fruit Ninja app?
"That's a pretty wispy hope," said Gar Alperovitz, a professor at the University of Maryland.
For hope that is a little more tangible, Professor Alperovitz pointed to local co-operatives that are sprouting up around the country. They tend to be employee owned, and get off the ground with private and foundation funding. Many of his favorite examples are found in Cleveland, of all places -- like the Evergreen Cooperative Laundry, an employee-owned firm that provides laundry services to hospitals, which started in 2009.
Professor Alperovitz tracks and catalogues enterprises like the cooperative laundry on a Web site, community-wealth.org. He says he sees in these companies the stirrings of a movement animated by the cold reality that neither the government nor private enterprise is on the verge of large-scale hiring.
"If the economy and the government don't have an answer to a problem," he says, "people are forced to try social enterprise."
Perhaps we are entering the era of the self-starter. Prof. Andrew Caplin of New York University thinks so. He begins with the premise that in the coming global economy some people will succeed and others will not, and income inequality will grow. While it's noble to focus on how to spread wealth around, he says that it might be wiser to think of ways the poor and middle class could cater to the economy's biggest winners.
"Unfortunately, there will be income inequality," he says, "but enough people will make money that those who don't would do well, in as much as they understand the needs of that group."
He says he expects a rise in what he calls "artisanal services," like cooks, nutritionists, small-scale farmers. He sees services emerging that aid the wealthy at the intersection of health and genetic science. He imagines a rise in technology services, too -- experts who keep clients current about technology which can advance their interests in business, in the media, on search engines and so on.
Professor Caplin worries that this concept might be caricatured as "cater to the rich." But he suggested that this country could use a lot more non-judgmental thinking about the future of the United States economy. Any argument on that subject that starts with the word "should," he said, is not nearly as useful as one that starts with "could" and has a firm grasp on "is."
"If you start with 'should' you get arguments where nobody makes any sense and where you can claim that some people are good and other people are bad," he said, referring to recent skirmishes over Fed policy, deficits and other contentious topics. "With that sleight of hand you've ensured that you will not discuss anything of substance. You've just lined up two camps to fire at one another." In the spirit of the coming holidays, it seems downright unseasonal to end with an image that sounds lifted from the Battle of the Somme. So, a little solace.
Many interviewees made the point that America's higher education system is still drawing the greatest minds from around the world. That insures a regular influx of the innovative, motivated thinkers, a resource of enormous value, though one that is impossible to quantify.
And that's not all. When asked for something uplifting, Mr. Menegatti deadpanned:
"Things could be much worse."

Correction: December 5, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about various ideas by economists to return the economy to life misstated the retirement age for full Social Security benefits. Full benefits are provided on a sliding scale based on the year of birth; they are not available to everyone when he or she turns 65. (The age recently rose to 66 for people born after 1942 and will rise to 67 for people born after 1959.)

Abstract: Since Aug. 31, the MSCI EAFE index of foreign stocks in developed markets has gained 5.9 percent. Because many emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are big producers of natural resources, increased consumption in the United States -- and rising prices of commodities -- should provide a nice lift to many stocks in those regions, market strategists say.

Full text: HOW will you know whether the Federal Reserve's plan to reinvigorate the economy by buying Treasury debt is working?
Simple: Look at how foreign stocks are behaving. Based on their performance last week, the Fed could be running into a problem.
Although one goal of the Fed's $600 billion monetary stimulus is to restore confidence in domestic stocks -- in the hope of bolstering consumer confidence and spending here at home -- the real canary in the coal mine for the central bank's plan is the performance of overseas equities.
Why? Market strategists say they believe that the Fed's effort, its second foray into quantitative easing, known as QE2, will have several consequences, some of them apparently unintended. For starters, by keeping market interest rates low through buying intermediate-term Treasuries, the Fed hopes to prompt risk-taking among investors.
But risk-taking doesn't stop at America's shores, and since anticipation of QE2 began building, investors have bid up risky emerging-market stocks more than domestic equities. Since Aug. 31, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets Index has surged more than 13 percent. That strong rally is a sign that the Fed's efforts packed initial punch, because it encouraged investors to take on risk.
Low interest rates also reduce demand for the dollar, though it has been rising quite recently. Over the longer haul, a falling dollar would lower the cost of American goods sold abroad, increasing exports and, ultimately, job creation.
But a declining dollar would also "encourage U.S.-based investors to favor overseas investments," said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. That's because when the dollar sinks against other currencies, investors who put money to work abroad can profit on the currency exchange.
Since Aug. 31, the MSCI EAFE index of foreign stocks in developed markets has gained 5.9 percent. But despite the dollar's strength in November, the weakening of the currency in September and October nearly doubled those gains: 10.1 percent for Americans investing abroad.
Ultimately, the Fed's goal is to reflate the economy. That means producing inflation, perhaps by accelerating economic activity and setting off greater demand for goods and services. Because many emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are big producers of natural resources, increased consumption in the United States -- and rising prices of commodities -- should provide a nice lift to many stocks in those regions, market strategists say.
"QE2 should help stocks in general, but it will probably help foreign stocks more," said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.
Until recently, that was clearly the way it looked. Since the markets started pricing in QE2, the trends have generally worked in favor of foreign stocks.
But now comes the first real test. The Fed's stimulus plan has begun to run up against another strong force: tightening monetary policies emerging in China.
Last week, speculation grew that China would raise interest rates further as government figures indicated that overall inflation for Chinese households rose 4.4 percent over the last year while food costs spiked more than 10 percent.
So far, officials in China have discussed imposing price controls, and its central bank has increased reserve requirements for financial institutions, in an effort to curb lending.
The fear is that if China must raise rates, "people will start to worry about a hard landing in China," said Alec Young, international equity strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services. And because China is such a huge consumer of commodities, that in turn could hurt growth in other emerging markets.
Indeed, since Nov. 9, when the worries about China began to crop up, commodity prices have sunk around 6 percent and emerging-market stocks have been off around 5 percent.
Contributing to fears of another economic speed bump is the fresh round of concern out of Europe, with the talk of a financial bailout of Ireland. And, last week, geopolitical news came back into the financial mix, with North Korea's military strike on a South Korean island.
"It's hard to be pounding the table in positivity with these things in the news," Mr. Young said. He added that the rekindling of fear in the global economy recently caused the dollar to strengthen and commodities to fall.
For now, many market strategists are still betting that the Fed's spending can trump the potentially troubling headlines emerging from China and much of the rest of the world.
"You never see the positive news in headlines, like that Sweden is recovering nicely or how healthy Germany's economy is," said David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors.
What's more, Mr. Kotok says Chinese officials are well aware that they must balance their policies' effects on their domestic economy and on Western markets, a huge source of demand for Chinese goods and services.
Furthermore, Mr. Kleintop at LPL says he believes China's efforts to combat inflation won't lead to a hard economic landing. Rather, he predicts a "very modest and targeted" slowdown that won't negatively affect emerging-market growth or the success of the Fed's plan. Of course, if it does, investors in those foreign equities will be first to notice.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Ireland's reluctant acceptance of a bailout supported by the International Monetary Fund is the latest in a string of developments since 2007 that have thrust the monetary fund into a new position of authority and prominence.
The fund, which earlier in the decade seemed dormant and even irrelevant, is back in a big way. This year alone, it has inaugurated loan packages or credit lines to Colombia, El Salvador, Greece, Jamaica, Mexico, Poland and Ukraine, among others. As Ireland joins the list, many investors are raising questions about Portugal and Spain.
The biggest economies have turned to the monetary fund to monitor the trade imbalances and currency tensions that threaten global cooperation. The fund is lecturing Europe -- the Continent whose devastation led to its creation in 1944 -- on the need for economic changes. Its bungling of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, widely regarded as a low point that soured emerging markets on the monetary fund, has been seemingly forgiven, if not forgotten.
Even as the I.M.F. expands its presence, the institution is being transformed in ways that reflect the emerging economic order, with Asia leading the recovery; Latin America, the Middle East and Africa growing steadily; and the richest economies of Western Europe, North America and Japan lagging behind.
"Almost overnight the I.M.F. seems to have regained some of its legitimacy and some of its customers -- or at least it's found new customers," said David Andrew Singer, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "The I.M.F. is back in business, and its legitimacy is on the rise, but it's also being tested in new ways."
Under pressure from the United States, Europe has ceded two seats on the fund's board as part of a broader effort to better represent China and other fast-growing developing countries in decision-making.
The I.M.F. has reassessed some of its long-held orthodoxies, like its aversion to capital controls and its insistence that central banks maintain a very low target for inflation.
The public face of the I.M.F. is being revisited as well. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French economist and politician who has led the fund since 2007, might be the last managing director chosen under the World War II-era custom of having a Western European lead the fund while an American heads its sister institution, the World Bank.
"I find it inconceivable that they'll have a Western European or North American as the next managing director," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the I.M.F.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a charismatic figure who is credited with shepherding the I.M.F. back into the spotlight and whose popularity at home has risen, might run for the French presidency in 2012.
Whatever he decides, his successor is likely to be someone from the developing world. Frequently mentioned names include Mohamed A. El-Erian, the American-born son of an Egyptian diplomat and an economist who leads the giant bond investor Pimco; Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a senior Indian planning official; and Arminio Fraga and Guillermo Ortiz, former heads of the central banks of Brazil and Mexico respectively.
For now, Mr. Strauss-Kahn has declined to discuss his political future, focusing on the economic woes of Europe.
At a European Central Bank conference in Frankfurt on Nov. 19, he said that the Continent's stellar growth in the postwar decades -- fueled by technological adoption, growing integration and a strong banking system -- stalled in the early 1980s.
He cited hurdles to growth: chronically high unemployment (and its high social costs), stagnant productivity in southern Europe and a financial sector focused more on arcane innovation than on support for the small start-up businesses that drive job creation.
"As the postcrisis world takes shape, Europe risks being left even further behind, especially as the dynamic regions of the world are bolting out of the stables," he said. "Europe must break the shackles of low growth and stop settling for second best. This is the only way to save the social model and fulfill the common European destiny."
Mr. Strauss-Kahn urged changes to bring about a "single labor market" like the European Union's common market for goods, and raised the delicate issue of rebalancing growth within Europe, gently prodding Germany -- the export powerhouse at the center of the union -- to stimulate domestic demand.
And he urged national governments to grant more authority in matters like research and development and budgetary policy to the European Union, saying that "peer pressure has not served Europe very well" and "countries must be willing to cede more authority to the center."
In giving tough advice to Europe, "in a sense the I.M.F. is returning to its roots," said James Raymond Vreeland, a political scientist at Georgetown University. After all the I.M.F.'s first loan was made to France, in 1947; its first conditional loan arrangement with a developing country was with Peru, in 1954.
The fund's advice is in some ways even more significant than its financing, which is based on contributions from member countries and has increased as a result of the crisis. The European Union is financing most of the bailout for Greece, for example, but is relying on the I.M.F. to monitor the fiscal and tax changes there, and the repair of the banking system in Ireland.
"It's not so much that they need the I.M.F.'s money, but that they need the I.M.F.'s mechanism for being able to monitor policy reforms," Mr. Vreeland said of the Europeans.
While the realignment of economic power has been painful for rich countries, it has provided an unanticipated boon for the I.M.F.'s mandate.
"In many ways, the I.M.F. has been blessed with the power shift under way in the global economy," said Robert R. Bench, an authority on international financial regulation at the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University.
The Group of 20 economic powers has given the I.M.F. the task of helping to untangle the thorniest problem threatening global economic coordination: the persistent balance-of-payments imbalances that bind Asia and America in an uneasy embrace.
The instability that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis has been attributed in part to the persistent tendency of surplus countries, like China and Germany, to save and export too much and of deficit countries, like the United States and Britain, to borrow and spend too much.
A summit meeting of the G-20 leaders, including President Obama, in Seoul, South Korea, ended on Nov. 12 with vague and convoluted promises to redress global imbalances, but little detail on how to go about doing it.
But the nations did agree to rely on an I.M.F.-led mechanism, known as the mutual assessment process, for monitoring the imbalances and suggesting ways to repair them.
Only "limited progress" has been made toward fixing the imbalances, the I.M.F. concluded in a report released in Seoul.
Whether the fund can persuade Beijing and Washington, and not merely Dublin and Athens, is likely to be one its greatest challenges in the coming months.

Abstract: [...] the problem seems to be perpetual weakness in rich economies that have been hobbled by debt foolishly taken on by people from bankers to subprime home buyers who had one thing in common: a belief that the risk of something going very wrong was all but nonexistent. The problems of 1980 and 2010 manifested themselves differently, but they led to the same conclusion: that the modern monetary system -- called "fiat money" by critics to emphasize that nothing real stands behind the value of currencies -- does not work.

Full text: It is part religion, part politics. It is a way to voice a lack of confidence in the central banks of the world and a yearning for the world as it used to be.
It is an investment that historically made sense when inflation was rampant, and yet it is soaring while the Federal Reserve frets about the threat of deflation.
It is gold.
It is tempting to view the soaring price of gold, which went above $1,400 an ounce earlier this month and remains close to that level, as a warning of imminent inflation. Such interpretations have fueled critiques of the Fed's latest round of monetary stimulus as being the forerunner of a collapse of the dollar.
But I think it reflects first and foremost a dismay at the current state of the world economy, and a conclusion that the elites who are running it do not know what they are doing.
Or, as a friend of mine put it, "You are buying gold because it is the alternative to this collection of stupid politicians around the world."
It is not easy to have a calm discussion about gold. There are people who all but worship it and there are people who view it as a barbaric relic of an earlier era.
If you are in the latter group, you probably look at it as just another commodity, whose price should reflect the demand for it in various industrial uses and for jewelry.
That analysis basically prevailed in the 1990s. That was an era of growth around the world, and it was the time when central bankers convinced governments that they deserved independence in the pursuit of wise monetary policy.
But the last decade was another matter, as was the late 1970s, when we had the last explosive move for gold bullion. Then the problem appeared to be runaway inflation. Now the problem seems to be perpetual weakness in rich economies that have been hobbled by debt foolishly taken on by people from bankers to subprime home buyers who had one thing in common: a belief that the risk of something going very wrong was all but nonexistent.
The problems of 1980 and 2010 manifested themselves differently, but they led to the same conclusion: that the modern monetary system -- called "fiat money" by critics to emphasize that nothing real stands behind the value of currencies -- does not work. Gold is the alternative.
You could argue that having gold behind a currency is also a form of fiat, that gold should be worth its value as a commodity rather than seen as a great and perpetual store of value. After all, gold was a very bad investment for 20 years, from 1980 to 2000. And why should the world decide that something found in South Africa is more valuable than a resource found elsewhere?
One advantage of gold, of course, is that it does not deteriorate with age. Gold mined 1,000 years ago may be in that ring on your finger. Other things do not last. A banana standard might seem like a wonderful idea in Central America, but it would not work.
A disadvantage of gold as an investment is that it costs money to store and produces no income. But who cares these days? The yield on short-term Treasuries is almost nothing. To get any kind of interest rate, you have to take some real risks of the type that blew up so spectacularly in 2008 and 2009.
People my age can recall when the dollar was worth precisely one thirty-fifth of an ounce of gold. But that was near the end of the era when currencies were tied to gold in any way. The United States government had made it illegal for us to own gold, for fear we would buy it and drive up the price. There was a lot of inflation between the time Franklin Roosevelt set that ratio and the time that Richard Nixon severed the link, but the stated gold price remained the same.
During the last gold boom, there were other ways to bet on the continuing failure of American political leadership. One could buy German marks, or Swiss francs or Japanese yen. All those economies appeared to be much better managed than those of the United States or Britain.
Now there are fewer alternatives. Those who think the big inflation is coming in the United States do not think we will suffer alone. If the Chinese renminbi were a freely traded currency, people would flood into it and drive the price up. But of course China is determined not to allow that, and the rest of the world appears powerless to do anything but mutter about how unfair it all is.
The international furor over the Fed's quantitative easing shows how sensitive countries are to the prospect of other currencies losing value against their currency. It is not easy to conjure up a situation in which the dollar plunges for a prolonged period against the euro or the yen. In fact, the opposite has happened since the Fed spelled out its plans.
There is a real threat of inflation in China and some other developing countries, but the rest of us can only wish we were so lucky.
I say lucky because there is a case to be made for the current desirability of rising prices. Imagine for a moment that asset prices in the United States, and Ireland and Spain, for example, rose sharply over the next few years, as measured by euros and dollars. Imagine that incomes rose much more slowly, so that real inflation-adjusted incomes fell even though nominal incomes rose.
In other words, imagine the late 1970s came back. We used to call that period "stagflation," and no one has fond memories of it. Those of us with money would be poorer, because the money would buy less. It would be even worse if we had lent the money for a number of years at the current low interest rates.
But the borrowers would be much better off, and just now they are the ones in the worst trouble. People with homes that now seem to be hopelessly underwater would find they could sell and pay off the mortgage. Banks would discover they had fewer bad loans than they thought they did. Unemployed people could afford to move in search of work.
Nominal gross domestic product would rise sharply in all of those countries, even if real G.D.P. rose more slowly. The debt-to-G.D.P. ratios that are now causing so much hand-wringing would be reduced, not by budget surpluses but by devalued debt.
Saying that a lot of people would benefit from something happening is not the same as explaining how it would happen. Just now, deflation looks more ominous in many Western countries. Ireland is planning to cut the pay of public workers, again, and fiscal tightening -- something needed to fight inflation, not deflation -- is the order of the day in many countries. We may think central banks blew it in the last decade, but we apparently will not do anything to help them in their current struggle. The plea by Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, for the government to find a way to invest more now, while cutting spending later, received little attention because the idea appeared to be a political impossibility.
It is distrust of elites that feeds some of the current gold fever, and that helps explain why it may make sense for one company that is promoting gold as an investment to hire G. Gordon Liddy as a spokesman. This is a man whose fame comes from committing the Watergate burglary on behalf of the very president who severed the last ties binding the dollar to gold, and is therefore vilified by gold bugs. But Mr. Liddy has an anti-establishment tint, and the intended audience is not committed gold bugs but instead worried and suspicious people. They may not be believers in gold, but they know all too well what can go wrong with investments in stocks and real estate.
Over the last four decades, the only ones in which gold was freely traded, gold proved to be a good buy precisely when it appeared the system was failing. In the 1970s, gold zoomed upward from artificially low levels, while stocks did not come close to keeping up with inflation. In the 1980s and 1990s, stocks rose at rates greater than 15 percent a year, and gold went down. In the first decade of this century, stocks declined while gold rose at a compound rate of almost 15 percent a year.
So far this year, both gold and stocks are up. That combination is unlikely to last out the current decade.
Betting that $1,400 gold will soon be $1,800 gold or $2,500 gold is basically a bet that the West really is in permanent decline this time, with countries facing the prospect of bankruptcy or sharp reductions in spending on everything from schools to pensions. Or perhaps all of the above.
Let's hope the bet is wrong.
