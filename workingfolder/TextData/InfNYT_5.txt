Full text: Â  CORRECTION APPENDED. Sometimes, something bad happens, and it creates huge financial market swings and long-lasting economic ripples. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were an example, as was the 2011 Japanese nuclear disaster.
But the so-called Brexit is different.
The immediate financial downturn after Britain voted Thursday to leave the European Union resembles the fallout from those disasters. But the other events were largely disconnected from the broader economic currents of their time. They were one-off events, at least in terms of their economic ramifications.
What makes Brexit so concerning is that it accentuates and deepens global forces that have been building for years. So far, governments have been unable to limit any of it. And those forces have self-reinforcing, vicious-cycle dimensions that make it a particularly perilous time for the global economy, even though the type of full-scale panic that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 looks unlikely.
Britain accounts for less than 4 percent of world G.D.P. Most people on Earth don't really have a rooting interest in the exact details of the nation's trade relationship with the rest of Europe. But its decision to leave the European Union is making more powerful six interrelated forces that already weigh on the global economy:
Low inflation There is a glut of global commodities, particularly oil. There is a glut of labor, with elevated unemployment in much of the world. Inflation has been persistently below the 2 percent mark that major central banks aim for, and shows little sign of rising.
And since the Brexit decision, markets are signaling that those forces have become even more energized.
The price of oil fell 7.5 percent from Thursday to Monday's close, despite little reason to think that the British referendum will cause any major changes in, for example, the supply of oil from oil reserves that the nation controls.
And bond markets are priced at levels that imply the years ahead will have lower inflation that was priced in before the Brexit news. While high inflation is often seen as the greater threat, in the last few years economists have viewed too-low inflation -- which can discourage spending and investment and make debts more onerous -- as the more pressing concern. In the United States, bond market prices imply that investors now expect annual inflation of 1.37 percent a year through 2026, down from 1.55 percent on Thursday before the vote's results, a drop of 0.18 of a percentage point; in Germany, the drop was 0.13 of a point and in Japan 0.10 of a point. (The one exception: Britain itself, which will almost certainly see much higher inflation in the coming years because of a drop in its currency.
Strong dollar The United States dollar has been on a tear. The dollar index, measuring its value against six other major currencies, is up more than 20 percent in the last two years.
Some of this reflects good health: The United States economy is reasonably strong, with steady growth since 2009 and a 4.7 percent unemployment rate. That has led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates once and contemplate further moves.
Some of the dollar rally reflects a more negative global outlook. The economies of Europe, Japan and many emerging markets have remained exceptionally weak, making the United States look comparatively fantastic. Factor in the United States' traditional role as the beacon of stability in turbulent times, and American assets look more attractive than their underlying economics would suggest.
Most worrisome is that there are some feedback loops between the strong dollar and economic weakness abroad. Many international companies, especially in China and emerging markets, owe debt in dollars, so a stronger dollar makes their debts more onerous and creates spillover economic weakness. And the stronger dollar is undermining American exporters, slowing growth in the United States.
Brexit is only accentuating this. The dollar index is up 3 percent since Thursday, most significantly because of the collapse in value of the British pound, but it is also up against the euro.
Impotent monetary policy The world's central banks are well aware of these forces, of course, and are trying to combat them. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are in the middle of huge programs to try to pump money into their financial systems by buying assets. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have been delaying interest rate increases in hopes of achieving higher inflation and more solid growth.
So far it hasn't been enough to get inflation persistently up to 2 percent or achieve sustained strong growth. And it is an open question if more of the same will change anything, particularly given that the economic challenges emanating from Britain are more because of existential questions of national identity than because of a garden-variety business slowdown.
Nonetheless, in the aftermath of Brexit, analysts and financial markets are now pricing in even slower interest rate increases for the Fed and the Bank of England, and a real possibility of yet more easing programs by the E.C.B. and the Bank of Japan.
Low interest rates Remember back in December when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates? That day, 10-year Treasury bonds were yielding 2.3 percent. Those bonds had fallen to 1.74 percent by Thursday (the Fed controls short-term interest rates directly, but longer-term rates are set in the open market).
In the two trading days since the Brexit vote, that rate has fallen to 1.44 percent. Other bond markets, including across Europe and in Britain itself, have also experienced falling longer-term rates. Germany, Switzerland and several other European countries even have negative long-term interest rates, meaning a person who buys a bond and holds on to it will lose money.
That's very much related to the decline in investors' expectations for lower inflation and more central bank activism. But it may also reflect a "fear premium" as investors throw money into anything that seems safe -- even if it means they are guaranteed to lose money.
Weak growth This is the underlying story behind all of these other market currents. Europe is only now returning to its 2007 level of economic output; Japan's growth is so low it is constantly bouncing in and out of recession status. In developing markets, Brazil is in recession and China is slowing. Britain and the United States are doing better, but only by the diminished global standards of the 21st century.
You can have endless debates about the underlying causes. Is this the inevitable result of a lull in productivity growth, a result of bad policy or bad luck, or some mix? Either way, the reality is that the global economy seems locked into lower growth than had been the norm in the decades before 2007.
Britain's E.U. vote raises the risk of further dragging down that growth rate, particularly if there is a prolonged period of uncertainty around the country's fate or a permanent breakdown in the trade ties that make an economy richer.
Political instability All of this is creating a toxic political environment in much of the advanced world, driving greater polarization and the flocking of voters to candidates outside the mainstream.
Brexit is the most recent example, supported as it was by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. The rise of right-wing nationalist parties in Continental Europe is another prime example, as are the popularity of Donald J. Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States; Jeremy Corbyn in Britain; and the far-left Podemos party in Spain.
Of course, less conventional politicians could turn out to succeed at generating stronger economic conditions where parties of the center have failed. But if nothing else, the widening of the ideological spectrum creates a wider range of possible outcomes -- including some that would surely be very negative for financial markets and the global economy.
Again, none of these stand in isolation. Each is deeply related -- either as cause, effect or both. And each has been pushed further by Britain's choice. Where the cycle ends, and when, no one knows.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Upshot article on Tuesday about the effect Britain's decision to leave the European Union could have on the global economy referred incorrectly to the dollar's performance against the yen between Thursday and Monday. It dropped against the yen; it did not rise.

Full text: Â  If you happen to trade bonds for a living, it is entirely understandable if you are feeling a little anxious these days.
Prices for United States Treasuries, German bunds and most other securities on the multitrillion dollar global bond market have been exceptionally volatile in the last couple of months. In this environment, someone who buys and sells them for a living could lose a fortune by taking an ill-timed bathroom break.
But what happens in bonds matters for the rest of us, too. Bond prices translate into the price to borrow money for practically every family and business on earth, which, in turn, determines savings and investment patterns. In the latest bout of volatility, long-term interest rates in the United States have climbed by almost 0.4 percentage points. Since the interest rate is in an inverse relationship to a bond's price, the value of bond investors' portfolios has taken a hit.
And that helps explain why there has been so much hand-wringing over the ups and downs of the market in the last few weeks, as my colleague Peter Eavis has reported.
Bankers are warning that tighter regulations may preclude them from playing their traditional role of stepping in to buffer the ups and downs of markets. Regulators worry that asset managers are engaging in herd behavior that will fuel an unnecessary roller coaster in markets. And there is plenty of worry out there that years of central bank interventionism have dulled the proper functioning of markets.
These arguments all have merit, and they aren't mutually exclusive. And when you look closely at what has been happening with bond prices, what it says about the economy is pretty much benign. What it says about how some of the markets at the core of the global financial system are working is far scarier.
So first, what does the shift mean for the economy?
Ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds were yielding 2.26 percent Wednesday, up from 1.87 percent in late March; those higher rates have also rippled through to higher mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs. Some international long-term interest rates, particularly in Germany, have climbed steeply. Some economists are even raising the possibility that a generation-long shift toward ever-lower global interest rates might have finally run its course.
Not so fast. Interest rates are still extraordinarily low by any historical standard and still below where they were in the fall of 2014. Viewed in a longer time horizon, it looks as if the bond boom of late 2014 and the start of 2015 went too far and is now partly reversing, not that some new trend of higher rates is taking hold.
The factors that fueled those low rates to begin with -- very low global inflation, vast pools of global savings looking for a place to be parked, central banks trying to use easy-money policies to restore growth -- have changed after all.
You don't have to believe there is an epochal shift going on, only modest changes in the last couple of months that can justify the move.
It looks as if higher rates are coming. The Federal Reserve appears relatively committed to its plans to raise short-term interest rates sometime this year. Oil prices have risen after falling to recent lows over the winter, so inflation should be a bit higher than it had seemed in February. And the dollar has weakened on currency markets, which also signals higher inflation.
Those all point to higher bond yields, and that's exactly what we've gotten, with no major mystery.
What is more of a mystery is why we've seen such abrupt turns in a market that historically has been slow-moving and not prone to overreactions.
Usually it's the stock market that is always rising and falling for reasons that are hard to explain (or justify). The bond market, dominated by sophisticated, grown-up institutions like pensions and sovereign wealth funds as opposed to individual investors, has traditionally seemed less prone to irrational jitters.
In other words, there are perfectly plausible, fundamental reasons the 10-year Treasury yield should be 2.26 percent right now. But reasons it should have risen by half a percentage point since the start of February, with many jaw-dropping days in between? They are hard to fathom when nothing terribly dramatic about the economy or policy outlook has changed since then.
And that's where we get to those explanations mentioned above involving the technical details of the bond market: things like banks being restricted from trading operations by new regulations, and asset managers crowding in and out of trades.
We're in a world where the supply of bonds is relatively fixed. It has always been true that governments don't quickly adjust their deficit spending plans based on a move in rates. But in a normal state of affairs when prices rise, private bondholders are more willing to sell, helping restrain the size of swings.
But now global central banks, having bought trillions of dollars' worth of bonds in executing their quantitative easing programs, are not inclined to exploit price moves opportunistically. Rather, they are moving glacially, based on economic fundamentals, and with lots of advance communication on their intentions.
Count other institutions that hold bonds as insurance against economic catastrophe -- not because they are hoping for meaningful return -- and the number of players in the market responding to prices in an economically rational way is small.
This is a long way of explaining the common term of art in markets: There is less liquidity than there once was.
One result is big swings based on small pieces of information, as the buffers that would normally sell into price increases and buy into price drops are nowhere to be found.
And there's not much reason to think that the forces driving this -- the expansive role of central banks in the market, the structures of banks and asset managers and so on -- are going to change anytime soon.
In other words, bond traders may just want to get used to postponing those perilous bathroom breaks.

Abstract: Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute, said that in addition to the focus on China, there were outstanding questions about the effect of the Federal Reserve's resumption of buying Treasuries. China, which accounts for most of the United States trade deficit, has managed to resist pressure to allow its currency to appreciate quickly, and Mr. Obama said the Chinese currency issue was an "irritant" to the United States as well as "to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world."

Full text: Stocks fell Friday and commodity prices declined, reflecting concerns about global issues and the possibility of a slower economy in China.
The declines came after world leaders at the G-20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, came up with an agreement that fell short of the Obama administration's goals for trade surpluses and deficits.
Investors were also apparently reacting to signs of financial pressures in Europe and to the possibility that China's higher-than-forecast inflation rate of 4.4 percent in October could lead to measures to slow its economy.
Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute, said that in addition to the focus on China, there were outstanding questions about the effect of the Federal Reserve's resumption of buying Treasuries.
The Fed announced last week that it would buy government securities worth $600 billion as a way to stimulate the economy. It began the new round with a purchase of $7.23 billion in Treasury paper Friday, according to Reuters.
"What is driving everything is really the quantitative easing, and people wondering how successful it is going to be," Mr. Roberts said of the program aimed at jolting the economy into recovery.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 90.52 points, or 0.8 percent, to 11,192.58 on Friday. The Dow was down 2.2 percent for the week, but is up 7.33 percent so far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 14.33 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,199.21. It was down 2.2 percent for the week, but is up 7.54 percent for the year.
The Nasdaq composite index, which includes many technology stocks, slid 37.31 points, or 1.46 percent, to 2,518.21. It was down 2.4 percent for the week, but is up 10.98 percent so far this year.
"Nothing is a one-way bet," said Bart Melek, a global commodity strategist for BMO Capital Markets. "Typically markets look to sell off and make some profit."
He said one of the catalysts on Friday was related to expectations that China would act after its latest inflation report, ultimately affecting its appetite for commodities.
"There is wide speculation that China is going to undertake a program of monetary tightening," he said. "The consensus is building that China will likely slow things down a little bit."
The worries also sent crude oil futures down nearly 3 percent, while gold prices also fell.
"Commodities have moved sharply into reverse as markets fear further tightening from China," following the inflation report and expectations that inflation will keep rising, Edel Tully, head of precious metals strategy at UBS, wrote in a research note.
Stocks of materials companies fell more than 2 percent, while energy and industrial shares fell more than 1 percent.
"China was a big catalyst to that," said Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates. "Obviously China has a big role in global economic growth, so that might force some investors to take risk off the table."
President Obama and other leaders wrapped up the G-20 meeting with an agreement to curb "persistently large imbalances" in saving and spending. But there is still outstanding friction over currency, Mr. Roberts of Channel Capital said.
China, which accounts for most of the United States trade deficit, has managed to resist pressure to allow its currency to appreciate quickly, and Mr. Obama said the Chinese currency issue was an "irritant" to the United States as well as "to a lot of China's trading partners and those who are competing with China to sell goods around the world."
Investors have been watching corporate earnings and economic indicators for trading cues in recent weeks, but developments in Asia and global markets, including concerns over borrowing costs in Europe, have captured the market's focus this week.
Mr. Melek said concern that some European countries, particularly Ireland, could be restructuring their sovereign debt was another reason for a lower market Friday.
The technology sector declined for a second day, because of disappointing earnings forecasts from Cisco.
Shares of Cisco fell 37 cents, or 1.80 percent, to $20.15.
Intel said it was raising its quarterly dividend to 18 cents a share, starting in the first quarter of next year. Shares of Intel rose 32 cents, or 1.51 percent, to $21.53.
Shares of Nvidia rose 65 cents, or 5.15 percent, to $13.26, after the company said that its third-quarter profit was stronger than expected.
Citigroup and Bank of America declined. Citigroup lost 7 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $4.29, while Bank of America dropped 25 cents, or 2.02 percent, to $12.12.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary November reading on consumer sentiment failed to lift market spirits, even though it came in at 69.3, up from 67.7 in October and slightly higher than the median Reuters forecast of 69.0.
The price on the 10-year Treasury note fell 1 7/32, to 98 19/32. The yield rose to 2.79 percent from 2.63 percent late Wednesday. The bond market was closed Thursday for Veterans Day.
The dollar edged down on its weighted index against a range of currencies. The euro was up to $1.3693.
The American market followed declines in Europe and Asia.
The FTSE 100 in Britain was down 18.36 points, or 0.32 percent, to 5,796.87, while the DAX index in Germany declined 11.2 points, or 0.17 percent, to 6,734.61.
The CAC 40 in France was lower by 36.23 points, or 0.94 percent, at 3,831.12.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- As the United States markets edge toward bear territory, losing nearly 20 percent of their value from last fall's peak, investors might wonder where they can turn for relief.
The gloomy answer: nowhere.
Many of the major markets in Europe and around the world have already entered a bear market. Germany and France are among the markets suffering the most, and once high-flying emerging markets in countries like China and India have collapsed even more drastically.
Higher inflation, exploding energy costs, troubled credit markets and worries about an inflationary psychology, it turns out, are global concerns. And fixing these problems -- and bringing optimism back to stock markets worldwide -- is proving to be difficult for central bankers, who are trying to contain inflation without risking even slower growth.
"The recent downturn in equities is essentially about investors worrying that central banks are going to be tougher than anyone had expected," said Erik F. Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs.
The market numbers are uniformly grim.
In Europe's largest economy, Germany, the benchmark DAX index is off slightly more than 20 percent this year, and the CAC-40 in France is down almost 22 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50, a gauge for the 15-nation euro zone, has declined by about 24 percent. The nearly 15 percent decline in the FTSE 100 in Britain looks tame by comparison.
Emerging market indexes have fared even worse. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong has plunged nearly 21 percent, the Shanghai Composite has lost nearly half its value this year. The Bombay 500 in India lost about 38 percent.
The declines at major stock markets worldwide suggest that the same economic concerns are in play: rising inflation, which has been caused for the most part by record oil prices. Oil hit a new high of $140.21 a barrel on Friday.
And central banks around the world, including the United States, are indeed moving to head off resurgent inflation by raising interest rates. While such a move can contain inflation, it can also squelch growth. Indeed, the likelihood of higher interest rates has already been fueling the market sell-offs as investors around the world try to digest all manner of bad economic news.
In Australia, inflation is running near its highest level in 16 years, and in March the central bank raised the benchmark lending rate to a 12-year high. The People's Bank, China's central bank, tightened credit again this month by raising banks' reserve requirements for a second time. China is struggling to control inflation without hurting its fast-growing economy; the same story is playing out in Indonesia and India.
On Sunday, the world's top central bankers began a two-day meeting in Basel, Switzerland, where they were considering approaches to calm nerves about inflation while avoiding a shock to economic growth. The United States is near or in recession, while growth is fading in Europe.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank may take matters into its own hands. In all likelihood it will raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, to 4.25 percent, hoping to curb inflation of both food and energy prices. Prices in the 15-nation euro area rose by 3.7 percent in the year through May, nearly double the bank's informal goal of just below 2 percent.
The Federal Reserve appears poised to follow suit. Last week the central bank voted to hold the short-term federal funds rate steady at 2 percent, ending a series of rate cuts. But it also hinted strongly that worries about inflation might compel it to raise the rate later this year. The rate affects what consumers pay for mortgages, car loans and other credit.
"Europe tends to paint this in black and white," said Ethan S. Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "In the U.S., the balancing act is going on."
The absence of a unified global strategy for calming inflation has not been lost on investors who are searching for an anchor of stability, and coming up short.
"When you have central banks around the world doing different things -- following a different road map -- that can be problematic," said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford, a financial services firm.
Then there is the politics.
The European Central Bank's decision to get out in front is being debated in Europe, where growth is cooling under the pressure of oil prices, the strong euro, and fading demand in the United States. The bank's primary mandate is to keep inflation low, but that does not stop European politicians from worrying about growth.
Oil prices, while an enormous factor in the decision-making that will go on this week in Europe, are only part of the calculation. A more generalized inflation, feeding through to consumer prices and influencing demands for higher paychecks, also deprives businesses of the confidence that they had until recently about how to make decisions on building factories, hiring employees or developing products.
"The longer inflation remains high, the more damaging it will be for longer-term economic growth prospects," Morgan Stanley wrote in a report about inflation creeping upwards worldwide. "High inflation rates usually go hand-in-hand with a higher variability of inflation, which raises uncertainty and can thus reduce investment spending."
Stock market volatility caused by inflation worries has also complicated the pressing task of recapitalizing banking systems, above all in the United States but also in Europe.
As equity markets crumble, much-needed recapitalizations "become more and more difficult" because investor appetite for new sales of shares declines, Mario Draghi, the Italian central bank chief, who heads global efforts to reform financial regulation, said last week. Efforts to overcome the credit squeeze, in other words, have become hostage to the economic slowdown that the squeeze helped create.

Abstract: ''China has been the world's factory and the anchor of the global disconnect between rising material prices and lower consumer prices,'' said Dong Tao, an economist for Credit Suisse. ''But its heyday is over. We're going to see higher prices.'' ''This is what I call the perfect storm,'' said Alan G. Hassenfeld, the chairman of Hasbro, one of the world's largest toy makers, during a recent visit to China. ''We've got higher labor costs and labor shortages, plastic prices have gone way up and we're doing more safety testing.'' ''There's a shift in sourcing driven by higher prices in China,'' says Bruce Rockowitz, president at Li & Fung. ''We've already seen a big move in furniture to Indonesia.''

Full text: China's latest export is inflation. After falling for years, prices of Chinese goods sold in the United States have risen for the last eight months.
Soaring energy and raw material costs, a falling dollar and new business rules here are forcing Chinese factories to increase the prices of their exports, according to analysts and Western companies doing business here.


The rise was a modest 2.4 percent over the last year. But even that small amount, combined with higher energy and food costs that also reflect China's growing demands on global resources, contributed to a rise in inflation in the United States. Inflation in the United States was 4.1 percent in 2007, up from 2.5 percent in 2006.
Because of new cost pressures here, American consumers could see prices increase by as much as 10 percent this year on specific products -- including toys, clothing, footwear and other consumer goods -- just as the United States faces a possible recession.
In the longer term, higher costs in China could spell the end of an era of ultra-cheap goods, as well as the beginning of China's rise from the lowest rungs of global manufacturing.
Economists have been warning for months that this country's decade-long role of keeping a lid on global inflation was on the wane.
''China has been the world's factory and the anchor of the global disconnect between rising material prices and lower consumer prices,'' said Dong Tao, an economist for Credit Suisse. ''But its heyday is over. We're going to see higher prices.''
Chinese imports constitute 7.5 percent of spending by Americans on consumer goods, but they make up much bigger shares of several popular categories, including about 80 percent of toys, 85 percent of footwear, and 40 percent of clothing.
Even when the market share held by Chinese goods is relatively small, their low prices put pressure on other producers to keep costs down.
Whether Chinese factories will succeed in making wholesalers pay more for their goods and whether retailers will be able to pass much of their higher costs on to American consumers is unclear, analysts say.
But companies that operate in China or buy from here are already reeling from mounting cost pressures that they say will weaken their profits and could disrupt their supply chains.
Those supply lines were already called into question by large-scale recalls of Chinese exports last year, involving everything from toys to pet food to tires.
''This is what I call the perfect storm,'' said Alan G. Hassenfeld, the chairman of Hasbro, one of the world's largest toy makers, during a recent visit to China. ''We've got higher labor costs and labor shortages, plastic prices have gone way up and we're doing more safety testing.''
While no reliable figures exist on average Chinese wages, experts say that factory wages have risen 80 percent or more in many coastal areas in recent years, with the lowest wage about $125 a month.
Some of the current cost pressures are actually by design -- Beijing's design.
After years of complaints from the United States and Europe about China's growing trade surplus, authorities here have removed incentives that once favored exporters of cheap goods.
Starting last June, for instance, China removed or reduced tax rebates on hundreds of items for export, including toys, apparel, leather, wood and other goods, effectively taxing those industries.
But the actions are also part of Beijing's desire to move China higher up the global manufacturing chain -- away from the least- finished products, like plastic children's toys, toward more advanced exports that require skilled labor, like small electronics and even automobiles.
Whatever the government's motivation, many Chinese exporters say the timing of the rebate cut was disastrous. Their factories had been struggling to cope with problems that included power shortages, higher raw material costs, rising wages and inflation in other areas.
For instance, the cost of some types of plastic has risen more than 30 percent in the last few years because of higher oil or petroleum costs. Plastic is a major component in toys and other consumer goods.
Many Chinese factory owners say a tough new labor law, which went into effect on Jan. 1, complicates the hiring and firing process and threatens to raise labor costs even more, at a time when parts of the country are already plagued with labor shortages. Some factory owners say there have already been strikes and other turmoil over the interpretation of the new law and how it should be applied.
''We have seen lots of brawls between employees and employers,'' said Hong Jiasheng, vice president of the Taiwan Merchant Association, which represents investors in China. ''We think the enactment of the new labor law is too hasty.''
Analysts say Beijing is also stepping up its enforcement of environmental laws, putting added pressure on factories that had long skirted regulations. Adhering to those often ignored rules increases cost, too.
These changes take place against the backdrop of a dollar falling modestly against the Chinese currency. The dollar is down about 7.6 percent in the last year against the yuan and is expected to fall further this year.
The weaker the dollar, the more expensive Chinese and other goods become when their prices are converted to dollars.
All in all, toy producers are among the hardest hit by the changes in law and prices. They rely on large quantities of plastic. They face heightened regulatory scrutiny after the product safety scandals last year. Indeed, some toy factories went bankrupt, squeezed between rising local costs and pressures from foreign customers to deliver a better product at an even lower price.
''I've been in the toy industry for almost 20 years, but these past two years have been the hardest time,'' said Guo Jinshen, manager of the Fenggang Fengyuan Plastic Toys Company. ''Costs are rising, there are recalls, stricter regulation, more complicated inspection -- all these things make it difficult.''
To reduce costs, some factory owners are considering moving to inland China, where wages are lower, or to other parts of Asia, like Vietnam and Indonesia.
Li & Fung, one of the biggest companies for supplying products worldwide, says its customers are already responding to Chinese inflation.
''There's a shift in sourcing driven by higher prices in China,'' says Bruce Rockowitz, president at Li & Fung. ''We've already seen a big move in furniture to Indonesia.''
But while relocating production to cheaper countries could keep prices low for Western consumer goods, moving factories and complex supply chains is difficult. Such changes can take years and cost millions of dollars.
In the meantime, makers of toys, apparel and footwear -- highly labor-intensive industries -- are being forced to consider raising prices even as growth in the United States slows, a rare confluence of events not seen in decades.
Companies that began outsourcing production to China in the 1990s mostly benefited from lower costs, which translated into both higher corporate profits and lower consumer prices. Now, many Western companies have to rethink pricing.
''Companies are now ordering for the spring of 2009,'' says Nate Herman, director of international trade at the American Apparel and Footwear Association, based in Arlington, Va., that represents some big clothing and footwear makers. ''Factories are coming back and asking for 20, 30, 40, 50 percent price increases.''
Will importers pass those costs on to consumers? ''It's going to be hard to avoid some increase,'' he said.

Productivity Up in Quarter; Pace Slowed In All of 2006

Abstract: The Federal Reserve is keeping watch for any signs that slowing productivity and rising wage pressures are having an adverse impact on inflation. The hope is that businesses will meet worker wage demands by trimming their profits rather than increasing the cost of their goods. Currently, inflation has been tame, with underlying inflation pressures starting to recede after last year's surge in energy prices. Many economists say they believe that as long as the spike in energy prices does not spread to wage demands, the Fed will be content to remain on the sidelines, as it did last week when it left rates unchanged.

Full text: Productivity grew at a healthy 3 percent annual rate in the final quarter, although for all of 2006, this crucial measure of economic vitality expanded at the slowest pace in nine years.
Productivity, the amount of output for an hour of work, rose by 2.1 percent for all of 2006, down slightly from a 2.3 percent increase in 2005.
It was the slowest pace since a 1.6 percent gain in 1997, according to figures released Wednesday by the Labor Department. But the 3 percent annual growth rate in the last three months of 2006 was nearly double what economists were expecting.
Labor costs for each unit of output rose 3.2 percent for all of 2006, up from a 2 percent increase in 2005 and the fastest rise in worker wages and benefits since a 4.2 percent increase in 2000.
For the fourth quarter, wage pressures eased a bit, rising by just 1.7 percent, a better outcome than analysts had been expecting after a 3.2 percent rate of increase in the third quarter.
While rising wages are good for workers, the concern is that if those increases outstrip gains in productivity, businesses will start raising the price of their products, setting off a classic wage-price spiral.
The Federal Reserve is keeping watch for any signs that slowing productivity and rising wage pressures are having an adverse impact on inflation. The hope is that businesses will meet worker wage demands by trimming their profits rather than increasing the cost of their goods.
Currently, inflation has been tame, with underlying inflation pressures starting to recede after last year's surge in energy prices. Many economists say they believe that as long as the spike in energy prices does not spread to wage demands, the Fed will be content to remain on the sidelines, as it did last week when it left rates unchanged.
Productivity growth lagged for more than two decades as the country struggled to cope with a series of oil price shocks in the 1970s. However, beginning in the mid-1990s, productivity started to improve drastically as the cumulative impact of high-tech tools like computers began to enhance worker efficiency.
But after hitting a gain of 4.1 percent in 2002, the rate of productivity gains has been slowly declining. Still, the 2.1 percent rise last year was nearly a full percentage point above the average annual gains from 1973 through 1993.
Separately Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that consumers increased their borrowing at a more modest pace in December. Consumer credit rose at a 3 percent annual rate that month, the smallest gain since October and far below the 6.9 percent surge in borrowing in November.
The increased borrowing pushed total consumer debt up by $6 billion in December, to a record $2.4 trillion.

In the Exporting Horse Race, It's China by a Nose Over the U.S.

Abstract: FIVE years ago, total United States exports were worth about three times as much as exports from China. China's figure was growing -- the ratio had been about 5-to-1 five years before that -- but there was little doubt that it would be decades before Chinese exports equaled those of the United States. As can be easily seen, exports to all three countries have soared over the years. But the final chart shows the market share of the three trading partners for Chinese exports over time, and there have been changes. Japan was China's largest customer in the mid-1990's, buying a sixth of what China sold at the peak. China's exports to the United States rose at an annual rate of 22.3 percent, faster than its overall rate but slower than the 23.3 percent growth rate of exports to Europe. Exports to Japan rose at a slower rate, 11.4 percent.

Full text: FIVE years ago, total United States exports were worth about three times as much as exports from China. China's figure was growing -- the ratio had been about 5-to-1 five years before that -- but there was little doubt that it would be decades before Chinese exports equaled those of the United States.
But now it has happened.
This week, the United States reported it had exports of goods -- a figure that excludes exports of services -- of $80.313 billion in July. China had already reported its July figure, $80.337 billion.
It was the first month ever that China reported higher exports than the United States.
To be sure, the figures are not seasonally adjusted, something that China does not do for its statistics. If they were, it is probable that the United States would still be ahead, perhaps for a few more months.
Nonetheless, ''there is no doubt about the trend,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. He noted that China had already released its August figure, showing an increase to $90.77 billion.
The large chart shown here gives monthly figures back to 1995, for both the United States and China. The other charts show the share of China's exports going to its three largest trading partners: the United States, Europe and Japan. Those data use 12-month moving averages to smooth the figures.
As can be easily seen, exports to all three countries have soared over the years. But the final chart shows the market share of the three trading partners for Chinese exports over time, and there have been changes. Japan was China's largest customer in the mid-1990's, buying a sixth of what China sold at the peak.
But the United States moved into the No. 1 position in 1997 and held it until last year, when Europe -- measured as a continent -- began to take a larger share of Chinese exports than the United States.
One way to look at exports over a long period of time is to measure the compound annual rate of increase. For the 10 years through July, Chinese exports rose at an annual rate of 19.5 percent, quadruple the 4.8 percent rate of growth for the United States. (The figures are not adjusted for inflation, and are measured in dollars.)
By contrast, Germany's exports rose at an annual rate of 7.0 percent, and it remains the largest exporter, with July sales of $92.7 billion. Growth rates were 5.0 percent for France, 7.5 percent for Spain and 5.6 percent for Britain. Japan, notwithstanding the fact it still runs substantial trade surpluses, showed export growth at a rate of just 4.0 percent.
China's exports to the United States rose at an annual rate of 22.3 percent, faster than its overall rate but slower than the 23.3 percent growth rate of exports to Europe. Exports to Japan rose at a slower rate, 11.4 percent.
For the United States, exports to China have risen at an annual rate of 15.5 percent, the fastest growth in sales to any large country but not nearly enough to keep the trade deficit with China from becoming a political issue. But over the decade, exports to Japan have actually declined, at an annual rate of 1.6 percent.

Abstract: ''If the inflation rate continues to be persistent like this, the Federal Reserve will simply have to pursue persistently policies that will keep that inflation from increasing further,'' the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole, told reporters during a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Bank of Korea. Recent comments from Fed officials, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have spurred speculation that the central bank will raise the benchmark federal funds rate a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, at its next meeting on June 28-29. On Friday, Mr. Poole and two other Fed officials made comments concerning inflation. ''Core inflation is modestly above what many of us have expressed as our comfort zone,'' Mr. Poole said, although he also said that the current inflation situation ''is absolutely not dangerous.''

Full text: Inflation in the United States may be worse than government data has indicated, and the Federal Reserve may have to keep raising interest rates if it persists, a Fed official said Friday.
''If the inflation rate continues to be persistent like this, the Federal Reserve will simply have to pursue persistently policies that will keep that inflation from increasing further,'' the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, William Poole, told reporters during a conference on monetary policy sponsored by the Bank of Korea.
Mr. Poole, a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, also described the United States economy as ''fundamentally very robust.''
Recent comments from Fed officials, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have spurred speculation that the central bank will raise the benchmark federal funds rate a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, at its next meeting on June 28-29. On Friday, Mr. Poole and two other Fed officials made comments concerning inflation.
''Core inflation is modestly above what many of us have expressed as our comfort zone,'' Mr. Poole said, although he also said that the current inflation situation ''is absolutely not dangerous.''
The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month, in line with expectations, while core inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up a worse-than-expected 0.3 percent. Core prices are advancing at a 3.1 percent pace so far this year. That compares with a 2.2 percent increase in 2005.
Earlier, Mr. Poole said more attention should be paid to informal sources of information in addition to official data to determine the extent of inflationary pressure.
''Statistical studies to detect pass-through from recent energy price increases have failed to show significant effects in U.S. price data,'' he said. ''But stories about widespread pass-through are becoming increasingly common.''
''We may face more inflation pressure than currently shows up in formal data,'' Mr. Poole said. There was still some time, he said, to gather and analyze information before the Fed's next policy meeting.
Reuters reported on Friday that a Fed governor, Randall S. Kroszner, said that while inflation was under close scrutiny, it remained manageable.
''We analyze these numbers very systematically. They are all within manageable ranges,'' Reuters quoted Mr. Kroszner as saying after a speech to the Institute of International Bankers in New York. ''We want to try to look at where inflation is going. We don't want to look in the rearview mirror at what has happened to inflation."
And Bloomberg News reported that in remarks for a conference in Massachusetts, another Fed governor, Donald L. Kohn, said the central bank cannot allow the economy to expand above its potential ''for some time'' without igniting a sustained increase in inflation.
The news service quoted Mr. Kohn as saying that globalization had helped restrain price increases through lower import prices and some ''dampening'' of unit labor prices as the supply of low-skilled labor becomes more abundant.
''The fact that China and some other emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressure on their exchange rates and are running trade surpluses has undoubtedly contributed to their disinflationary effects on the world,'' Mr. Kohn said, according to Bloomberg News. ''These imbalances are not likely to be sustained indefinitely.''
Inflation concerns in the United States have contributed to declines in global markets amid perceived uncertainty about the Fed's intentions with interest rates.

Abstract: In 1985, President Ronald Reagan managed to avert a storm. When he started his second term, a large budget deficit and high interest rates were fueling a relentless climb in the dollar, opening a huge gap in the trade balance. Yet by 1989 the dollar had fallen 50 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 40 percent against the West German mark, without prompting runaway inflation. And the current account deficit -- the broad gap between exports and imports of goods and services -- had finally begun to close. While the nation's economic tribulations today are not identical to those faced by Mr. Reagan, some economists suggest that the process of policy coordination formalized at the Plaza provides a map that Mr. [Bush] may want to follow. ''The second Bush administration should take a page from the second Reagan administration and do a midcourse correction,'' said C.Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International Economics in Washington. Richard H. Clarida, a professor of economics at Columbia University who was chief economist at the Treasury during Mr. Bush's first term, wrote in an e-mail message: ''I view Plaza as a public statement that conveyed to markets that the new [James A. Baker III] Treasury acknowledged that the dollar had to fall (and indeed it had been falling gradually since February 1985) and implicitly that monetary policy would be consistent with that goal, and that budget deficits would be coming down,''

Full text: THE White and Gold Room at the Plaza Hotel in New York seems an appropriate spot for big financial decisions. Chandeliers drip crystal from high ceilings. White walls are bedecked in gold trim. It was in this opulent place on Sept. 22, 1985, that officials of the world's leading industrial powers convened to hammer out a plan to save the world from economic turmoil.
Almost 20 years later, the Plaza's sumptuous settings could be put to similar use again.
President Bush starts his second term facing a financial bugbear that shares many of the same qualities of the crisis two decades ago: The United States' budget deficit is bloated. Its trade deficit is hitting records every month. The mushrooming growth of its foreign debt is scaring financial markets. And foreign exchange rates seem out of kilter.
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan managed to avert a storm. When he started his second term, a large budget deficit and high interest rates were fueling a relentless climb in the dollar, opening a huge gap in the trade balance. Yet by 1989 the dollar had fallen 50 percent against the Japanese yen and more than 40 percent against the West German mark, without prompting runaway inflation. And the current account deficit -- the broad gap between exports and imports of goods and services -- had finally begun to close.
A major component of Mr. Reagan's strategy was built at the Plaza, where finance ministers and heads of central banks of the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France agreed to intervene in currency markets -- furiously buying yen and marks -- to reduce the value of the dollar. The meeting also inaugurated a period of monetary policy coordination and introduced an international dimension to what had been strictly domestic discussions of fiscal policy.
While the nation's economic tribulations today are not identical to those faced by Mr. Reagan, some economists suggest that the process of policy coordination formalized at the Plaza provides a map that Mr. Bush may want to follow. ''The second Bush administration should take a page from the second Reagan administration and do a midcourse correction,'' said C.Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute of International Economics in Washington.
But other than exerting pressure on China to let its currency, the yuan, fluctuate in value against the dollar, the Bush administration appears uninterested in coordinating economic policy with other countries. It has mostly just exhorted them to spend more to help close the United States' trade deficit. And Congress, now controlled by Republicans, has shown no more interest in taking action.
The world's finances today are balanced rather precariously between a big spender -- the United States -- and several countries around the world that are big savers.
In broad schematic terms, the United States imports and the rest of the world exports; the United States borrows and the rest of the world lends. Financial flows are so lopsided that last year America soaked up nearly three-fourths of the surplus savings in the entire world.
Not surprisingly, this state of affairs is adding to the country's foreign debt. At the end of last year, the nation's financial deficit -- what the United States owes the rest of the world, minus what the rest of the world owes the United States -- amounted to more than $3 trillion, about 30 percent of the country's annual economic output. And it is growing. In the 12 months through October, foreigners acquired nearly $885 billion of new United States government and corporate debt.
THAT wouldn't be a problem if the world were comfortable lending ever-larger sums to the United States to pay for American investment and consumption. But this is unlikely.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who hasn't been one to worry idly about deficits, warned in a speech to German bankers last month that foreigners would probably demand higher interest rates and bond yields to hold American debt.
''The question now confronting us,'' he said, ''is how large a current account deficit in the United States can be financed before resistance to acquiring new claims against U.S. residents leads to adjustment.''
That is, when does the debt become so big that foreigners begin to worry about getting their money back with a reasonable return?
Some foreign investors are already jittery. In the last two years, the dollar has fallen substantially against several currencies, including the Canadian dollar and the euro, and has slipped somewhat less against the yen. Investment from abroad has been falling since March.
Some economists are worrying that investor fears over the country's solvency could set off an uncontrolled run on the dollar, or worse. ''I think we are going to have a sharp increase in interest rates and a collapse in bonds,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, a professor of economics at Harvard who was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration.
Addressing this conundrum requires multiple changes on a global scale. Mr. Bergsten and other economists said they believed that today, as in 1985, international cooperation could come in handy.
First, the dollar must decline further against the Chinese yuan and other Asian currencies. The dollar's steep but narrow fall to date has placed a heavy burden on the exports of a small set of countries, while doing nothing to the exchange rates of China and some other major Asian exporters. And with the yuan's value virtually pegged to the dollar's, other Asian countries, like Japan and South Korea, have been reluctant to let their currencies rise much.
American pressure on China to let its currency float has been unsuccessful so far. But a multilateral approach -- one that could guarantee that other Asian currencies rose in tandem so as not to reduce China's export competitiveness in the region -- might work, some economists say.
''I could see the Europeans, the Japanese and the Canadians being very enthusiastic about this,'' Robert D. Hormats, a vice chairman at Goldman Sachs International, said of such a multilateral agreement. ''They argue that they are taking the brunt of the dollar's adjustment.''
Many economists say a change in the dollar's value, however, is not enough. If the adjustment is to work, Asians and Europeans need to spend more and save less, reducing their pressure to export and increasing their appetite for imports. Most important, demand in the United States must fall. That means the budget deficit must be trimmed from its current level of 4 percent of the nation's output. Otherwise, interest rates will rise substantially to bring private consumption down.
''It is not enough for finance ministers to announce that they are unhappy with the current configuration of exchange rates,'' said Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.
But how much can economic diplomacy achieve today? In the 1980's, the Group of 5 leading industrial democracies, which was later expanded into the Group of 7, or G-7, with the addition of Canada and Italy, had a very compelling reason to stick together: the cold war. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's has made other countries less willing to follow the United States.
''G-7 plus China would impress the world that under the pressure of the developed nations, China gave in -- that's not really multilateral,'' said Xu Xiaonian, a Chinese economist who recently became a professor at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. ''It's better than the U.S. versus China, but only marginally better.''
Even traditional allies don't see eye-to-eye these days. Mr. Bergsten may want the yen to rise against the dollar, but the Japanese may not.
MOREOVER, some things are just tough to coordinate. To begin with, fiscal policy is freighted with local politics and is virtually impossible to coordinate internationally. Persuading the indebted Japanese government to spend more or the European Central Bank to lower interest rates is not likely to be achieved by a global meeting at a five-star hotel.
''The sizable fiscal deficit of Japan and the convergence criteria of Europe are obstacles to easy fiscal policy,'' said Tomomitsu Oba, a primary architect of the 1985 agreement as Japan's vice minister of finance for international affairs.
Then there is the issue of getting the United States interested. Mr. Bush, in particular, has not shown a great enthusiasm for multilateral solutions to the world's problems. And his economic wish list -- led by the privatization of Social Security and a reform of the tax code -- leaves little space for policies that would reduce the bloated budget deficit.
''There is a strong argument for a Plaza-like agreement at the moment. But the chances of having it are zero,'' said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''The Chinese are going to say, 'If you want cooperation from us, we want to know what your contribution will be,' and I don't think they will accept Social Security reform as a quid pro quo.''
The Plaza agreement itself provides an interesting insight into the possibilities and limits of international economic collaboration.
In the view of the United States' allies through early 1985, Mr. Reagan's economic policy had no place for international cooperation, either. That policy, executed by Donald T. Regan, the Treasury secretary at the time, was driven by an overriding belief in tax cuts. The administration contended there was no reason to worry about the trade deficit, and that a strong dollar was simply a measure of America's economic potency.
Advisers who didn't toe the line were dispensed with. In February 1984, for example, the Council of Economic Advisers, then headed by Martin Feldstein, blamed the budget deficit for the current account deficit and noted that the market considered the dollar to be overvalued by more than 30 percent. Mr. Regan dismissed the warning -- ''as far as I'm concerned, you can throw it away,'' he said -- and Mr. Feldstein resigned in July. He is now the president and chief executive of the National Bureau for Economic Research.
But the politics would change. The rising dollar through the first Reagan term had been hurting some of the administration's most important allies in the business lobby. In early 1985, the National Association of Manufacturers said the $112 billion merchandise trade deficit of 1984 -- then a record, and double the amount of the previous year -- was a ''disaster'' that was crimping growth and ''radically changing the way American firms are doing business'' by ''driving more and more of them abroad.''
Moreover, Congress, then controlled by the Democrats, started bubbling up with protectionist bills and resolutions. One proposal, by Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen of Texas and Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, would have imposed import surcharges on countries with large trade surpluses with the United States. Another, by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, would have mandated intervention in currency markets to weaken the dollar if the trade deficit hit certain triggers.
So as he started his second term, Mr. Reagan changed course. Mr. Regan left the Treasury to become the president's chief of staff, while James A. Baker III, the chief of staff, moved to the Treasury.
One of Mr. Baker's first statements was that the Treasury's policy of nonintervention was ''obviously something to be looked at.'' By February 1985, the United States had started intervening in the currency markets to weaken the dollar.
AT the Plaza seven months later, Mr. Baker and the Federal Reserve chairman at the time, Paul A. Volcker, agreed with their counterparts from Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to not only collectively spend billions to weaken the dollar, but also to usher in an era of economic policy coordination.
In 1986, West Germany, Japan and the United States engaged in coordinated interest rate cuts. While there was no sustained coordination on fiscal policy, the multilateral process provided a forum to talk about its contributions to the global imbalances in the world economy. The United States even persuaded the Japanese government to increase public spending.
''The Plaza was very successful, measured economically or politically,'' said someone who participated in the talks, a high-ranking American official at the time who spoke last week only on the condition that he not be identified. ''We didn't get protectionist legislation, and the dollar's decline did not create problems in the United States.''
Some people dispute the notion that the Plaza meeting was a success. For one, the collaboration was messy. The dollar fell further than expected, leading the United States and its partners to quickly seek a new accord, signed at the Louvre palace in Paris in 1987, to try to stabilize the currency. And the wrangling among the allies over monetary policy and exchange-rate coordination helped to prompt the collapse of the United States stock market in October 1987.
What's more, the current account deficit kept growing for two years after the Plaza accord. It started shrinking significantly only as the budget deficit narrowed and the economy slowed later in that decade.
Some economists argue that intervening in the foreign exchange markets was an unnecessary expense and that the attempt at coordination was pointless because countries followed their own interests anyway. America's budget deficit started shrinking after Congress passed legislation limiting public spending. The Fed cut interest rates to support growth. Japan, West Germany and the other European allies were also following their own interests in cutting rates. The markets just responded to the economic fundamentals, these critics say.
Richard H. Clarida, a professor of economics at Columbia University who was chief economist at the Treasury during Mr. Bush's first term, wrote in an e-mail message: ''I view Plaza as a public statement that conveyed to markets that the new Baker Treasury acknowledged that the dollar had to fall (and indeed it had been falling gradually since February 1985) and implicitly that monetary policy would be consistent with that goal, and that budget deficits would be coming down,''
Yet for all the skepticism, Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs said he still saw a benefit from the efforts at multilateral coordination. He was at the Plaza on Sept. 22, 1985, waiting to hear news of the negotiations. ''The Plaza was the one thing that created the notion that we were willing at least to work with other countries on the exchange rate,'' he said. ''It changed a neglectful approach to one of international cooperation.''

The Dollar Is Down: Is It a Cause for Concern?

Abstract: ''There is a school of thought that the U.S. can keep borrowing forever,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University and a former chief economist at the I.M.F. ''But if you add up all the excess saving being thrown out by the surplus countries, from China to Germany, the United States is soaking up three-quarters of it right now.'' Where Mr. Rogoff predicts that the dollar will slide sharply over the next two years, Ms. [Catherine Mann] predicts that Asian countries will continue to subsidize American imbalances to keep their economies growing. A decline in the dollar may be likely, but not a panicky flight by foreign investors. ''It's striking how many parallels there are between today and the early 1970's,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''The loss of the anchor of the dollar and fixed exchange rates contributed to the inflation we saw in the 70's. It was the worst period in growth we have had since World War II.''

Full text: It sounds eerily like the worst economic nightmare for President Bush's second term.
Bogged down in a costly war that shows no sign of ending, the United States faces a gaping budget deficit and ballooning foreign indebtedness. The dollar plunges against other major currencies, while turmoil in the Middle East sends oil prices soaring. The rest of the decade is plagued by rising inflation, increased joblessness and sky-high interest rates.
But the president under fire was Richard M. Nixon -- not George W. Bush. The war was in Vietnam, not Iraq. And the dollar crash was in 1973 rather than 2005.
Could it happen again? With the dollar down more than 40 percent against the euro since 2002, and hitting new lows since Mr. Bush's re-election, economists are debating whether America's foreign indebtedness could lead to a collapse in the dollar and a global financial crisis.
The United States is spending nearly $600 billion more a year than it produces, almost 6 percent of its annual gross domestic product. Much of that spending has been financed by Asian governments, which bought more than $1 trillion in Treasury securities and other dollar assets in the last two years to help keep the dollar strong against Asian currencies.
Many analysts expect the financing gap to widen and the dollar to decline further. But there are at least three schools of thought on whether a dollar collapse is likely and, if it happens, what it would mean.
One group, which includes the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, contends that global financial markets are awash in so much money that the United States can borrow much more than seemed possible 20 years ago.
The dollar may well decline in value, according to this view, but the decline would be gradual and would help reduce American trade imbalances by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
The Bush administration goes one step further, arguing that America's huge foreign debt simply reflects the eagerness of others to invest here.
''Productivity has been remarkably high in the last few years,'' John Taylor, deputy secretary of the Treasury, said at a recent conference. ''Foreigners want to invest in the United States. That's what that gap illustrates.''
A second school of thought holds that foreign governments like China and Japan will continue to finance American borrowing and keep the dollar strong because they are determined to sustain their exports and create jobs.
But a third school, which includes officials at the International Monetary Fund, worries about a collapse in the dollar that would send shock waves through the global economy.
That group argues that the dollar needs to depreciate another 20 percent against the other major currencies but warns about a run on the dollar that could reduce its value by 40 percent.
A collapse of that size would severely affect Europe and Asia, which have relied heavily on exports to the United States for their growth.
A steep drop in the dollar could lead to higher interest rates for the federal government and American private borrowers, as foreign investors demanded higher returns to compensate for higher risk. And it could expose hidden weaknesses among financial institutions and hedge funds caught unprepared.
''There is a school of thought that the U.S. can keep borrowing forever,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, professor of economics at Harvard University and a former chief economist at the I.M.F. ''But if you add up all the excess saving being thrown out by the surplus countries, from China to Germany, the United States is soaking up three-quarters of it right now.''
For Mr. Rogoff and several other economists, the question is not whether the dollar declines -- but how fast and how far the fall turns out to be.
The United States current account deficit, which encompasses annual trade as well as the balance of financial flows, has gone from zero in 1990 to nearly $600 billion this year. The United States' accumulated debt to foreign investors is $2.6 trillion, or 23 percent of the annual output of the economy.
But where foreign investors in the 1990's poured trillions of dollars into American stocks and corporate acquisitions, investment from abroad now comes mostly from foreign central banks and goes heavily to buying Treasury securities that finance the federal deficit.
Catherine Mann, a senior economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said today's financing gap could be expected to widen. Part of the problem lies with Europe and Japan, which grow more slowly than the United States and import less than they export.
Higher costs of imported oil will aggravate the trade deficit even more, Ms. Mann said, and the federal government will be paying foreigners higher interest rates on its rapidly growing debt.
''You have a dynamic that links government deficits to current accounts deficits more than has been the case before,'' Ms. Mann said. ''We are going to have a lot of government securities out there, and a very high share of those Treasuries are owned by foreign investors.''
But where Mr. Rogoff predicts that the dollar will slide sharply over the next two years, Ms. Mann predicts that Asian countries will continue to subsidize American imbalances to keep their economies growing. A decline in the dollar may be likely, but not a panicky flight by foreign investors.
The American dollar has been through several ups and downs in recent decades. In 1973, it fell sharply against Japanese and European currencies -- the major industrialized countries had already abandoned the system of fixed exchange rates adopted at Bretton Woods after World War II.
The dollar rebounded strongly in the early and mid-1980's in response to higher American interest rates, but then plunged 40 percent after leaders from the United States, Japan and Europe reached the so-called Plaza Accord in 1986 to nudge the dollar back down. The plunge after the Plaza Accord caused few disruptions for Americans, and foreign investors did not demand higher interest rates on securities.
''One theory is that investors were simply irrational,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''Others said it was the result of what Charles DeGaulle called the 'exorbitant privilege' of being able to repay your debts in your own currency.''
Some economists contend that the United States can postpone its day of reckoning for years. Richard N. Cooper, a professor of economics at Harvard, said the global pool of savings was about 10 times the United States' appetite for foreign capital last year and growing fast enough to easily finance $500 billion a year.
The wild card is that most of the money is coming not from private investors but from foreign governments, led by Japan and China. Rather than profits, their goal has been to stabilize exchange rates and keep their exports from becoming more expensive.
Many economists contend that the Asian central banks have created an informal version of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates that lasted from shortly after World War II until the early 1970's.
The system collapsed after the imbalances between Europe and the United States became impossible to reconcile. Rapid growth is putting similar pressure on China, which has kept its currency, the yuan, pegged at a fixed rate to the dollar.
The growing imbalances, in both China and the United States, is one reason Mr. Rogoff is bracing for a jolt to the dollar and the American economy similar to the one that occurred in the early 1970's.
Then, as now, the United States was running large budget and trade deficits. Then, as now, the United States was bogged down in a war costing billions of dollars a year. And in 1974, a few months after the dollar plunged against the German mark and Japanese yen, oil prices soared.
''It's striking how many parallels there are between today and the early 1970's,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''The loss of the anchor of the dollar and fixed exchange rates contributed to the inflation we saw in the 70's. It was the worst period in growth we have had since World War II.''

Abstract: So it came as a surprise to some economists and portfolio managers that Fed policy makers thumbed their nose at inflation worries in the statement accompanying the rate increase. ''Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors,'' the policy makers said. Mr. [Paul Kasriel] points to the past for evidence of what can happen when the Fed begins to raise rates well after inflation has taken hold. He identified two other periods during which the Fed began to increase rates when the Fed funds rate was in negative territory, adjusted for inflation, as it is now. Each time -- in March 1971 and July 1980 -- inflation soon took off with a vengeance. ''Everyone recognizes that holding the Fed funds rate below the inflation rate is a recipe for accelerating inflation because it creates an incentive for people to go out and buy things and finance them at relatively low rates,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''That act tends to drive the prices of those goods and services even faster. That was the predicament the Fed got itself into in the 1970's and spent a long time remedying. Now the Fed is in the early stages of squandering some of the gains that chairman Volcker made in eliminating inflation during the 80's.''

Full text: Inflation and market interest rates are far ahead of Alan Greenspan's federal funds rate, which he raised yesterday to 1.25 percent. Now the nation will see how well Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, plays the game of catch-up.
Fears that Mr. Greenspan has opened wide the door to inflation in the United States by keeping interest rates too low for too long prompted a sell-off in the bond market recently. That has pushed short- and long-term rates far above the federal funds rate and produced the worst quarter for bond investors in almost 25 years.
Since falling to 3.68 percent in March, yields on 10-year Treasury securities have risen nearly a point, to 4.58 percent yesterday. Yields on two-year Treasuries have risen to 2.69 percent from 1.46 in March.
When inflation outruns a central banker, price increases on goods and services not only take hold, they tend to feed on themselves, rising ever higher. Inflation is exceedingly difficult to bring under control once it has gained a foothold.
So it came as a surprise to some economists and portfolio managers that Fed policy makers thumbed their nose at inflation worries in the statement accompanying the rate increase. ''Although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated, a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors,'' the policy makers said.
That is not the opinion of Alan W. Kral, portfolio manager at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen in New York. ''We believe that inflation has returned,'' Mr. Kral said. ''And the cause of it has been an overexpansive monetary policy for almost 10 years.''
As a result, many say that Mr. Greenspan has two battles to fight: one against inflation and one against the view that he has been far too accommodating in keeping interest rates low.
''I believe the Fed is behind the curve because the economy continues to be strong and the inflation rate is creeping up and will continue to creep up,'' said Henry Kaufman, an economist in New York. Its plan to raise interest rates gradually may be good for the economy, he said, ''but is not designed to put the system back into balance in terms of constraining inflation itself.''
For weeks, the Fed has broadcast its intention to raise interest rates glacially, so yesterday's move surprised no one. Some economists said the Fed's approach was appropriate given the economic indicators. ''There are good reasons for this gradual approach in 2004,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Company in Minneapolis. ''With the declining price of oil, economic fundamentals, including productivity and global competition, will keep inflation in check.''
In the statement accompanying the interest rate increase, the central bank acknowledged that the economy showed strength, and it ended by saying that it would ''respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.''
But many view the Fed's extremely measured approach to curbing inflation, which is running at a rate of 2.9 percent so far this year, as a mistake. Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said such a tack allowed for too much inflationary pressure to build before meaningful brakes were finally applied.
Mr. Kasriel points to the past for evidence of what can happen when the Fed begins to raise rates well after inflation has taken hold. He identified two other periods during which the Fed began to increase rates when the Fed funds rate was in negative territory, adjusted for inflation, as it is now. Each time -- in March 1971 and July 1980 -- inflation soon took off with a vengeance.
''Everyone recognizes that holding the Fed funds rate below the inflation rate is a recipe for accelerating inflation because it creates an incentive for people to go out and buy things and finance them at relatively low rates,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''That act tends to drive the prices of those goods and services even faster. That was the predicament the Fed got itself into in the 1970's and spent a long time remedying. Now the Fed is in the early stages of squandering some of the gains that chairman Volcker made in eliminating inflation during the 80's.''
Mr. Kasriel said he thought the Fed would be forced to abandon its measured approach to interest rate increases early next year when inflation pressures become undeniable.
The stock market barely reacted to the rate increase; the Dow Jones industrial average closed the day up 22.05 points. Bonds rallied, pushing yields on the 10-year Treasury down to 4.58 from 4.69 on Tuesday.
Richard Bernstein, chief United States strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he was surprised that investors seemed so optimistic about the Fed's move because corporate profits were no longer rising. A study of history, Mr. Bernstein added, indicates that financial disruptions have followed periods when the Fed raised rates while corporate profits slowed.
There have been only three times during Mr. Greenspan's tenure when rates rose while profits weakened, Mr. Bernstein said, and each ended badly. The first was followed by the recession of 1990-91; another such period preceded the financial crises of the summer of 1998; and finally, a period of rising rates and falling profits culminated in the collapse of the stock market bubble in 2000.
''Every time that profits growth has peaked out, people say it doesn't matter, and every time the Fed has started raising rates people say it doesn't matter,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''But every time it has mattered. The combination played a major role in terms of getting investors to be more risk averse. So to me it is a little remarkable that people are so sanguine about this.''

Newest Export Out of China: Inflation Fears

Abstract: Whether the trend will be sustained depends on many variables. Chinese leaders have taken steps to slow the economy and brake inflation, raising reserve requirements for banks twice in less than three weeks. By next year, the many steel mills now under construction could start easing the acute shortages that are driving up steel prices. New power plants over the next five years should curb blackouts if coal mines can increase output fast enough to supply them. Yet the increase in the export price, they said, is an accurate reflection of rising costs. Yellow phosphorus, the insecticide's main ingredient, is, like many raw materials, in short supply because mines have failed to keep pace with demand. And while chemical factories commonly operated seven days a week until a few months ago, many are now idle for two or three days a week because of blackouts stemming from soaring use of air conditioners, refrigerators and other appliances. Coiled steel products were ready for use at the Hangzhou Iron and Steel Company in February. China uses a quarter of the world's steel products, and the rising price of the manufacturing material is fueling inflation. (Photo by Reuters)(pg. C4)

Full text: As managers of businesses across China opened booths here on Thursday at the nation's biggest trade fair, the common refrain was that prices of everything from rice to steel were rising sharply, and that prices of exports to the United States, Europe and elsewhere would have to follow.
The prices for orders placed now will not show up in most American indexes for months, when goods are actually shipped. But as prices begin to rise in the United States, concerns are growing that China will become an exporter of inflation. Even though its goods account for a small percentage of total American purchases, China has played an oversize role in worldwide prices, with low labor costs that allow it to set prices in many industries.
A socket wrench manufacturer said his high-quality models had risen in price by 10 percent in the last six months and his lesser-quality models by as much as 50 percent. An exporter of automobile exhaust manifolds, brake drums and other parts had raised prices by 10 percent in several increments since December.
The prices of steel and other materials are major culprits. Another is energy costs. A motorcycle manufacturer in east-central China said he has had to close a factory for three days each week because of electricity blackouts, forcing a 4 percent increase in prices, with more planned.
Food and other necessities are putting pressure on wages. A maker of key-cutting machines in an inland province of central China said it was paying workers 10 to 20 percent more to help cover sharp increases in rice prices and had raised export prices for the machines by 25 to 30 percent.
Price increases in raw materials and other business costs in China, a government spokesman said, will probably spill over soon to consumer prices in China and abroad.
''There is a time lag, but it can't be too long, and there is pressure for price rises,'' said Zheng Jingping, the spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. ''If this goes on for a long time, it will cause problems.''
Exports from China to the United States last year represented just 1.2 percent of the value of all goods and services produced within the United States. But China has been the lowest-cost provider in many areas. As its prices rise, many other low-income and middle-income countries exporting to the United States, from Eastern Europe to Mexico and Central and South America, will find it easier to raise prices as well.
China's efforts to keep the economy from overheating and igniting inflation have been unfruitful so far. Using a term that Mr. Zheng and other Chinese officials have conspicuously avoided, the state-run New China News Agency on Thursday quoted Morgan Stanley's China economist, Andy Xie, describing the Chinese economy as ''a bubble.''
That comment came as Beijing announced that the economy had grown 9.7 percent in the first quarter, faster than expected. The statistics bureau also reported that consumer prices were exactly 3 percent higher in March than a year earlier.
Mr. Xie of Morgan Stanley said in a telephone interview that the true increase in consumer prices could be 7 or 8 percent. ''The State Council has said they want to keep inflation below 3 percent, so they have to report an increase of 3 percent,'' he said, referring to China's cabinet.
In the United States, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday that prices climbed 0.5 percent in March, with gasoline and clothing leading the way, for an annualized rate of more than 6 percent if sustained. Though prices of housing and health care have been heading higher for some time, increases in other areas stoked concerns in the financial markets that inflation was back.
Within China, ferocious competition has kept prices from rising for relatively costly items like cars, household appliances and mobile phones. Giant companies like Wal-Mart, moreover, have some ability to force suppliers to hold down price increases. The main buyers at the Guangzhou Trade Fair are wholesalers who supply small and medium-size retailers.
China also has more unemployed people in rural areas than the entire American work force, and many are migrating to cities in search of work, providing a check on wages.
But managers from two companies in Wuhan in central China said in separate interviews that factories there had lifted wages by at least 10 percent in response to what one manager described as pressure from the provincial government to help workers cope with rising food prices. Managers of a company in northeastern China that makes machinery for embroidering clothing and an auto parts factory in central China described smaller wage increases.
''The cost of living -- transport, food, everything -- is going up,'' said Su Han Xiang, the director general of Jinshan Ceramic Industries in southern China, explaining that he had just given his workers a raise of several percent.
Michael Woo, the general manager of a door lock company here in Guangdong Province, said that he had not raised the wages his company pays: $110 a month plus heavily subsidized room and board. But he noted that workers' pay was already higher in this province than elsewhere, so Guangdong workers were less vulnerable to rising food prices.
Buyers at the trade fair talked about marking up prices in coming months. Paul Bartels, the general manager of Bright-Life Catalogue Inc. in Cedarhurst, N.Y., buys products in bulk as a broker for American mail-order companies.
Speaking from the hardware hall at the fair, Mr. Bartels said that he had taken price increases of a few percent from his profit margins, but had passed on larger increases. ''With every customer I have, I've gone back and revised prices, and none have gone down,'' he said.
Whether the trend will be sustained depends on many variables. Chinese leaders have taken steps to slow the economy and brake inflation, raising reserve requirements for banks twice in less than three weeks. By next year, the many steel mills now under construction could start easing the acute shortages that are driving up steel prices. New power plants over the next five years should curb blackouts if coal mines can increase output fast enough to supply them.
Growing evidence suggests that Beijing has been using informal price controls on businesses, especially state-owned enterprises, to help keep inflation under control.
Two representatives of one of China's largest state-owned chemical companies said that while the company had just raised by 50 percent the export price of a popular insecticide for rice and cotton, the government had prevented the company from charging more to Chinese farmers.
Yet the increase in the export price, they said, is an accurate reflection of rising costs. Yellow phosphorus, the insecticide's main ingredient, is, like many raw materials, in short supply because mines have failed to keep pace with demand. And while chemical factories commonly operated seven days a week until a few months ago, many are now idle for two or three days a week because of blackouts stemming from soaring use of air conditioners, refrigerators and other appliances.
As a result, the steep investment cost for each chemical production line must be spread over a smaller output of pesticides and fertilizers.
The United States and Western European nations found in the 1970's that price controls can limit inflation for a while, but they also cause markets to become less efficient and slow economic growth. Prices then jump when the controls are lifted.
Just as rising oil prices created a problem in the United States three decades ago, rising prices for energy and other raw materials have rippled through the Chinese economy. Because wages are still so low, raw materials account for a much larger share of costs here than in many other countries.
At the trade fair, the exhibition area with the widest variety of goods belonged to a marketing company from Hubei Province in central China. The company's export director, Ke Sheng Feng, rattled off price increases for work boots, up 10 percent; machetes, up 20 percent; and folding steel ladders, up 50 percent.
''Frankly speaking, all products will be increasing'' in price, Mr. Ke said. ''If the conditions continue like this, business will be difficult.''

Abstract: President Bush will offer a plan to help accelerate the United States economic recovery, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said today. ''Early next year President Bush will propose new action for economic growth and job creation,'' Mr. O'Neill said in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry. He did not specify what actions Mr. Bush might suggest. Mr. O'Neill said he was also continuing to draft proposals to reduce the length of the tax law and free billions of dollars for investment. If the tax system were simplified, he said, the United States could recover an estimated $400 billion a year that is now lost to tax avoidance and the cost of complying with the tax laws. Mr. O'Neill, who again called the United States tax system ''an abomination,'' said Mr. Bush shared his view that the tax code was too complicated. He stopped short of saying the president would endorse a complete overhaul, however.

Full text: President Bush will offer a plan to help accelerate the United States economic recovery, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said today.
Forecasts are for growth to slow in the fourth quarter to about half the 3.1 percent annual rate of expansion from July to September. That is slower than the 3 to 3.5 percent range Mr. O'Neill once predicted.
''Early next year President Bush will propose new action for economic growth and job creation,'' Mr. O'Neill said in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry. He did not specify what actions Mr. Bush might suggest.
With a Republican-controlled Congress taking office in January, Mr. Bush has said he will seek to make last year's $1.35 trillion tax cut permanent.
The administration has been getting advice on other possible steps. Businesses are seeking a 75 percent write-off for equipment purchases and changes in rules that will require them to pay billions of dollars to shore up their pension plans. Investors want to end the so-called double taxation of dividends.
On Capitol Hill, Republicans may try to speed up parts of last year's tax cut for individuals that are being phased in and to make permanent provisions that are set to expire. Democrats want to increase the minimum wage, extend jobless benefits and temporarily suspend Social Security taxes to put cash into workers' pockets.
Mr. O'Neill has suggested that he prefers narrowly aimed tax cuts to broad-based reductions because only parts of the economy are weak.
''The tougher part has been building broad-based momentum throughout the economy,'' he told the British business leaders. ''Some sectors have been doing well, such as housing and auto manufacturing, while others, such as commercial airplane manufacturing and airline services, have lagged.''
Mr. O'Neill said he was also continuing to draft proposals to reduce the length of the tax law and free billions of dollars for investment. If the tax system were simplified, he said, the United States could recover an estimated $400 billion a year that is now lost to tax avoidance and the cost of complying with the tax laws. Mr. O'Neill, who again called the United States tax system ''an abomination,'' said Mr. Bush shared his view that the tax code was too complicated. He stopped short of saying the president would endorse a complete overhaul, however.
Mr. O'Neill cited low inflation, lean inventories, rising incomes, a 5.7 percent unemployment rate and the largest annual gain in productivity since 1983 as evidence of economic strength.
Creation of a homeland security department, terrorism risk insurance and the lowest Federal Reserve interest rates for 41 years have helped underpin the economy, he said.

Dollar Falls As Top Official Casts Doubts On Intervention

Abstract: The Treasury Department controls whether and when the United States, through the Federal Reserve, buys and sells dollars and other currencies to raise or lower the value of the dollar. Mr. [Paul H. O'Neill]'s immediate predecessors, Lawrence H. Summers and Robert E. Rubin, both adhered almost slavishly to the same language in describing currency policy, saying a strong dollar was ''in the interests of the United States.''

Full text: After saying his goal was to avoid upsetting the financial markets, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill did just that today by sparring with members of a Congressional committee about the nation's financial condition and leaving some investors with doubts about his willingness to defend the weakening dollar.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. O'Neill stressed that nothing he said should be interpreted as any change in the longstanding position of the United States that a strong dollar is good for the economy. He expressed considerable annoyance that traders routinely read more into his statements about the dollar and the economy than he intends, simply to generate volatility in the markets.
But he said nothing to suggest that he would intervene to stem a continuing slide in the dollar's value, noting that government action to support the currency cannot be effective in the long run if it runs counter to the collective judgment of the financial markets.
''I'm saying I think there's a real doubt about the effectiveness of interventions or words about interventions,'' Mr. O'Neill said in response to a question about whether he might support an action like the coordinated effort by the seven big industrial democracies in 1985 to bring down the dollar's value.
On a day when the dollar was already losing ground against the euro and the Japanese yen, Mr. O'Neill's comments were taken as a green light by currency traders to keep pushing the dollar down.
By the end of the day, the dollar was trading at 127.45 yen, down from 128.57 on Tuesday and 134 yen in early February. The euro rose to 90.55 cents, up from 90.03 cents a day earlier and 85 cents in late January.
''I think there's concern on the part of traders that this represents a stealth move away from the strong dollar policy toward a more laissez-faire dollar policy,'' said Lara Rhame, senior currency economist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. ''Markets now need to be sold on the dollar, and O'Neill has never been interested in doing that.''
While Mr. O'Neill's comments were taken by currency markets to undermine the dollar, his testimony emphasized the fundamental strengths of the economy and signaled again his unwillingness to drive the dollar down deliberately to make American exports more competitive on international markets.
The Treasury Department controls whether and when the United States, through the Federal Reserve, buys and sells dollars and other currencies to raise or lower the value of the dollar. Mr. O'Neill's immediate predecessors, Lawrence H. Summers and Robert E. Rubin, both adhered almost slavishly to the same language in describing currency policy, saying a strong dollar was ''in the interests of the United States.''
Since taking office 15 months ago, Mr. O'Neill has more or less stuck to that formulation, but often with an added emphasis that the dollar's value is the byproduct of a fundamentally strong economy and the perception that the United States offers the world's best opportunities for investment.
But to currency traders, his slight variance from the established formulation has been enough to justify testing Mr. O'Neill's commitment to the dollar's value almost every time he speaks about the subject.
The dollar has been weakening for several months in part because of a perception among international investors that the recovery from last year's recession might be tepid and that corporate profits and stock prices in the United States might therefore remain depressed.
But several members of the banking committee pointed to evidence that some countries, including Japan and China, were deliberately keeping their currencies undervalued to give their exporters an advantage in world markets.
After Mr. O'Neill's appearance, economists and representatives of business groups and organized labor told the committee that the dollar remains so overvalued that the United States is having trouble competing internationally, costing jobs and profits at home.
''The dollar is way out of whack and everybody knows it,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
But there is also growing concern that the United States is vulnerable because of its large current account deficit. The current account measures the balance between the inflow of goods, services and capital into the United States and the outflow. It has been running at a deficit of more than 4 percent of the economy's total output in recent years, and after falling slightly last year is expected to rise again this year, putting it at a level that in other nations has often presaged an economic crisis.
Some economists say that if the flow of capital into the United States dries up, the dollar could fall sharply in value, reigniting the threat of inflation and putting pressure on the Fed to raise interest rates.
But other economists say the deficit merely reflects the relative attractiveness of investing in the United States and does not present any particular threat to the dollar. That was the position taken by Mr. O'Neill today -- and it led him into several sharp exchanges with the banking committee's chairman, Senator Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland.
''I am really taken aback that we have a secretary of the Treasury who doesn't perceive any problems associated with this large current account deficit,'' Mr. Sarbanes said.
Mr. O'Neill replied that most of the steps to reduce the deficit -- like limiting the inflow of foreign capital or of imports -- would be like cutting off an arm because it might someday become diseased.
''I just don't understand the thinking that creates what I consider to be an artificial, intellectually useful construct, and then take it to a policy conclusion that does damage,'' Mr. O'Neill said.

Full text: Sixty-five million Turks awakened this morning to find their national currency in a free fall that stripped away more than 25 percent of its value by the end of the day and sent a wave of concern -- but so far no panic -- through many foreign markets.
While investors and political leaders worried about whether Turkey's financial problems would be contagious, Turks waited for prices to skyrocket and wondered whether the crisis might bring down the government.
''Those who are responsible should pay the price,'' a statement from the Civil Initiative, a coalition of labor unions and business groups, said.
The leaders of the two main opposition parties demanded that Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit resign and call early elections, though few officials or diplomats in Ankara, the capital, expected either.
The new turmoil resulted from the decision by Turkey -- in hopes of averting a financial meltdown -- to let the value of its currency, the lira, be decided by market forces. The lira had been pegged to a mixture of the dollar and the euro. The decision was announced at 3 a.m. today after a 12-hour meeting of Mr. Ecevit and his senior cabinet members.
In Washington, officials at the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund, with bitter memories of the collapse of Thailand's currency in 1997, issued a series of statements intended to calm the markets by expressing support for Turkey's decision to let the currency float.
But in private, these officials were much more critical. American officials noted that in the autumn, before the I.M.F. worked out a $7.5 billion emergency loan deal to support economic change in Turkey, many at the Treasury thought the effort to maintain a fixed exchange rate was doomed. And a senior I.M.F. official said: ''There was a lot of doubt that they could make the reforms stick, and that they were playing with global markets they didn't entirely understand. They didn't have the political cohesion to make it work.''
The officials noted that there was no evidence of Turkey's problems spreading to other emerging markets.
Here in Istanbul, the financial markets responded quickly and harshly, sending the lira lower even as stock prices rebounded somewhat from Wednesday's decline. The lira had been trading at 685,000 to $1, but by the end of the business day here it dropped to a rate around 925,000 to the dollar. A few hours later in New York, the Turkish currency weakened further, settling at 962,499.
Analysts here said that there were few large currency transactions even at that price and that the volatility made it difficult to determine a fair price for the Turkish lira.
The financial crisis erupted on Monday after a public dispute between Mr. Ecevit and Turkey's president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer. The prime minister left a meeting of senior government officials in a huff after President Sezer accused him and his ministers of not being tough enough on corruption in the banking industry.
With the risk of political instability, interest rates soared and the stock market plummeted, leading to the decision to allow the lira's exchange rate to float to market value.
The decision was a blow to the economic package that the Turkish government instituted a year ago with backing from the International Monetary Fund. Trimming inflation was a key goal, but freeing up the lira is expected to cause a sharp jump in inflation and the cost of imports.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill were briefed on the crisis early today, and Mr. O'Neill issued a brief statement saying he supported the Turkish government's decision to float the lira. ''Turkey is an important ally and good friend of the United States,'' he said. ''The United States continues to back the I.M.F.'s ongoing support for Turkey's economic reform program.''
The briefing of General Powell was notable because it indicated that the State Department, mindful of the Mexican and Asian currency crises, was now significantly more sensitive to the possibility that a financial crisis could breed new political and security problems.
The managing director of the I.M.F., Horst Kohler, called on private investors and commercial banks to back Turkey in the financial markets. Mr. Kohler indicated that the lending agency might speed up delivery of the next installments of its $7.5 billion emergency loan.
The biggest fear among many foreign leaders is that Turkey's new round of problems could set off a crisis of confidence in emerging markets elsewhere, leading to investor flight and a repetition of the panic that started with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 and spread widely.
The decision to free up the lira was part of an effort to stem the outflow of foreign investment capital from Turkey. The nation's central bank spent $7.5 billion of its cash reserves early in the week as investors fled and commercial banks faced difficulty making payments.
On Tuesday, Turkey sold $2.7 billion worth of lira-denominated bonds, which dropped sharply overnight with the devaluation. Some analysts said the lira is likely to bounce back in the coming weeks, but the timing and the level are uncertain.
The three parties that form the coalition government had staked their political future on curbing Turkey's chronic double-digit inflation and reducing spending. Economists and analysts said there would be pressure to come up with strong new measures to restore investor confidence, but they questioned whether the government had sufficient public trust to demand more sacrifices.
Kamil Yilmaz, an economics professor at Koc University in Istanbul, said: ''Working people and fixed-income people have really suffered under the inflation-fighting program, and now they are going to suffer more. They have lost confidence in the government.''
Concerns were evident across this city as the lira plummeted. Crowds gathered outside currency exchanges in the busiest neighborhoods and seemed dazed as the currency's value dropped. Many money exchanges refused to sell dollars at any price, encouraging fears that inflation was going to soar again.
''All the prices will jump in a couple of days,'' said Cevat Demirci, as he surveyed the shelves in his small grocery store near the Bosporus. ''The rich will be more rich and the poor will be more poor.''
A more immediate concern for the government will be the effect of the floating lira on the country's banks, which are suffering from falling profits and face a wide corruption investigation. Turkey's 80 banks have an estimated $18 billion in open foreign-currency positions.
Indeed today, Deutsche Bank warned, ''The currency adjustment and the losses accrued over the past few weeks on the securities portfolio could cause even some large banks to face very serious problems.''

U.S. Rate Cuts Reverberate in Asian Stock Markets

Abstract: ''At the very least, the U.S. economy is weakening far more quickly than anyone expected,'' said Dong Tao, a regional economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. ''That means Asia's exports to the United States will perform even worse than they have in the last few months.'' Elsewhere in Asia, investors seemed relieved that the Federal Reserve was moving aggressively to cushion a slowdown in the United States. That is crucial for countries like South Korea and Taiwan, where recovery from the Asian crisis was fueled largely by exports to the booming American market. The slowdown in the United States has already reverberated through Asia. In South Korea, exports grew 20.4 percent in the first 11 months of last year. But in December, the growth rate fell to 1 percent. Mr. Tao predicted that exports from South Korea and other Asian countries would contract in the first half of 2001.

Full text: Stock markets across Asia exulted almost unanimously today in the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates in the United States. But to some economists here, the celebrations rang a bit hollow.
Asian countries remain dangerously dependent on the United States economy, these experts said. While the rate cut lifted spirits in Asia's sluggish markets, the Fed's abrupt move signals weaknesses in the United States that could spell long-term trouble for this region.
''At the very least, the U.S. economy is weakening far more quickly than anyone expected,'' said Dong Tao, a regional economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong. ''That means Asia's exports to the United States will perform even worse than they have in the last few months.''
Such fears were not apparent today in markets from Seoul to Singapore. The rally was most dramatic in South Korea, where the Composite Stock Price Index soared more than 7 percent to close at 558.2 points. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index jumped 4.4 percent, closing at 15,235.03 points.
Shares in Taiwan and Singapore rose 4.9 percent and 3.2 percent respectively. Even in the Philippines, which has been been rattled by a scandal involving the president, Joseph Estrada, stocks rose nearly 2 percent.
Only Japan seemed to share the ambivalence of the experts. After rising more than 1 percent in the first minutes of trading, the Nikkei index closed down 0.7 percent in a shortened holiday session. Analysts said Japan's own economic worries outweighed the impact of the rate cut.
Elsewhere in Asia, investors seemed relieved that the Federal Reserve was moving aggressively to cushion a slowdown in the United States. That is crucial for countries like South Korea and Taiwan, where recovery from the Asian crisis was fueled largely by exports to the booming American market.
''I don't think this guarantees we're out of the woods,'' said Dan Fineman, a regional strategist at J. P. Morgan Chase in Singapore. ''But even with an uncertain outlook for the U.S., we have to be cheering.''
The slowdown in the United States has already reverberated through Asia. In South Korea, exports grew 20.4 percent in the first 11 months of last year. But in December, the growth rate fell to 1 percent. Mr. Tao predicted that exports from South Korea and other Asian countries would contract in the first half of 2001.
Among Asian economies, Hong Kong is the clearest beneficiary of the Fed's action. The former British colony links its currency to the United States dollar and rates here move in tandem with those in the United States.
Shares of banks and property development companies, which are the linchpin of the Hong Kong market, soared today. Officials here praised Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and left little doubt that he effectively functions as Hong Kong's central banker as well.
''I hope Mr. Greenspan, together with the Treasury Secretary in the U.S., will help to prevent a hard landing in the U.S. economy,'' said Sir Donald Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong. ''This is a very useful first step.''
Economists are divided on how a deteriorating United States economy will affect Asia's efforts to overhaul its own economies. Some experts believe that that effort, which was fitful even during last year's relatively good times, will stall if financial markets collapse and foreign reserves dwindle.
''Korea missed a window of opportunity last year when growth was strong, inflation was low, and there was tremendous interest in bidding for Korean assets,'' Mr. Tao said. ''Now, they'll have to do it in a much tougher environment.''
But Simon Ogus, an independent economist, contends that Asia's swift recovery from the crisis of 1997 and 1998 allowed officials here to ignore the need to confront bankrupt companies and insolvent banks.
In South Korea, he said, falling exports will cause the country's balance of payments to dry up. And that might finally force the country's heavily indebted conglomerates to sell assets to foreign buyers.
''If the U.S. has a sharp slowdown, Asia will have a nasty dip,'' Mr. Ogus said. ''But the tough circumstances may finally catalyze changes.''

Out on a Limb, Another Effort To Lift the Euro

Abstract: Six weeks ago, the European Central Bank stirred world markets when it announced a coordinated intervention on behalf of the euro, supported by the United States Treasury. But after rising a few cents on the day of the intervention, the currency soon began floating down again and hit a new intraday low of 82.30 cents on Oct. 26. ''I think the E.C.B. selected a very good moment,'' said Martin Hufner, the chief economist at Hypovereinsbank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank. ''Today's intervention decision was the signal to international financial markets that the European Central Bank is now showing its decisiveness.'' The euro's weakness has already pushed inflation above the central bank's declared upper limit of 2 percent a year. Inflation is running at 2.8 percent, with the most inflationary pressure coming from oil prices, which have tripled in two years. Moreover, the euro's weakness has added a huge surcharge for Europe because oil is priced in dollars.

Full text: Looking more and more like an institution that has been backed into a corner, the European Central Bank intervened in global currency markets again today to prop up the woebegone euro.
But the move was different and riskier than the intervention six weeks ago, because the European bank acted today without support from the United States or other major central banks.
In a two-sentence statement today, the European Central Bank emphasized its fear that the weak euro was aggravating inflation by increasing the cost of imports from outside the zone of 11 nations where the euro is the common currency.
The bank said it was ''concerned about the national and worldwide effects of the euro's exchange rate, including its consequences for price stability.''
The initial effect was modest. Although the euro jumped briefly against the United States dollar to its highest level in six weeks -- 87.89 cents, up from 86.28 -- it later receded and closed at 86.68 cents. That was up from 86.01 on Thursday.
''It is a desperation move by the E.C.B.,'' said Tony Norfield, chief foreign exchange analyst in London at the Dutch bank ABN Amro. ''They are acting completely on their own behalf. The problem is that the underlying capital flows have not changed.''
The intervention was the latest in a long series of attempts to reverse the euro's relentless plunge in value against the dollar. Since the euro was adopted at the start of January 1999, it has lost more than 30 percent of its value against the dollar and even more against the Japanese yen.
Six weeks ago, the European Central Bank stirred world markets when it announced a coordinated intervention on behalf of the euro, supported by the United States Treasury. But after rising a few cents on the day of the intervention, the currency soon began floating down again and hit a new intraday low of 82.30 cents on Oct. 26.
At least part of the reason for the euro's hapless position has been the increasingly clear refusal of the United States to take part in a more sustained rescue effort.
Hours after the intervention, the United States treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, said the government stood by its policy of favoring a strong dollar but said he shared Europe's concern ''about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy.''
The question now is: Will the central bank be more effective on its own if it has more freedom to act? In short, is it better to have the United States as a reluctant partner or to act alone as a decisive player?
Though not entirely unexpected, the intervention today caught investors off guard. Most experts had concluded that there would be no more intervention until after the United States presidential election next Tuesday, on the assumption that the Clinton administration did not want to be seen as weakening the dollar just before Americans went to the polls.
But it was clear by the euro's drift back downward that currency traders and money managers were far from convinced that the euro's revival was at hand.
Analysts estimated that the European Central Bank had intervened fairly modestly, buying up about one billion euros, or $860 million at today's depressed exchange rates.
If that estimate is accurate, the intervention would be more limited than the one orchestrated on Sept. 22 by the European Central Bank, the United States Treasury and the central banks of England, Canada and Japan. Then, the banks were said to have bought $2 billion to $7 billion worth of euros.
But the timing of today's move was fairly shrewd. By catching traders by surprise, the central bank was able, at least briefly, to jolt them out of their complacency. The central bank also moved just as the euro had begun to stage a tiny rally of its own. After sinking to the record last week, it had gained a few pennies in value this week. That allowed the central bank to reinforce a trend, which most analysts believe is more effective than trying to fight one.
''I think the E.C.B. selected a very good moment,'' said Martin Hufner, the chief economist at Hypovereinsbank A.G., Germany's third-largest bank. ''Today's intervention decision was the signal to international financial markets that the European Central Bank is now showing its decisiveness.''
The euro's weakness has already pushed inflation above the central bank's declared upper limit of 2 percent a year. Inflation is running at 2.8 percent, with the most inflationary pressure coming from oil prices, which have tripled in two years. Moreover, the euro's weakness has added a huge surcharge for Europe because oil is priced in dollars.
Wim Duisenberg, the president of the European Central Bank, said at a news conference on Thursday that inflation would remain above the designated targets for longer than the bank had originally expected. In Germany, Europe's biggest economy, import prices have surged 13 percent in the last year and producer prices have climbed steeply.
Yet despite efforts on almost every front, the euro has yet to revive. Originally conceived in part as a strong rival to the dollar, the new currency has instead become an ever-present suggestion that Europe's economy simply is not as robust or attractive as the economy in the United States.
Most analysts continue to say that the euro's weakness has little to do with short-term speculators but that, rather, it stems from the huge flow of direct investment into the United States from Europe and the rest of the world.
In Germany, a growing number of prominent economists are begging the European Central Bank to intervene in a big way and more than once. Although many British and American experts are skeptical that orchestrated interventions can have a lasting impact, some argue that now, the time is right.
But the risks are substantial and growing higher. Each time the European Central Bank intervenes unsuccessfully, it loses more credibility. That, in turn, makes each subsequent attempt even more likely to fail.
''The E.C.B. needs to make it clear that the euro devaluation is over,'' said Mr. Hufner of Hypovereinsbank.
In a market where trillions of dollar cross borders daily, however, that is much easier said than done.

Abstract: With a technological revolution, low inflation and global integration in full swing, the current United States economic expansion, already the longest in American history, shows few signs of old age, President Clinton said in his administration's last annual survey of the economy. In a 500-page report released today that mixed politics with an analysis of the country's record-breaking prosperity, the president's top economic advisers said a combination of deft fiscal management and a surge of entrepreneurial activity had made the current economic expansion not only the longest in history, but also by many measures the most unusual. By the late stages of previous economic booms, in the 1960's and 1980's, inflation had surged, productivity had ebbed and income inequality had risen, the report said. But this expansion, which began in March 1991, has defied gravity, with inflation tame, productivity rising and the income gap narrowing after nearly a decade of growth.

Full text: With a technological revolution, low inflation and global integration in full swing, the current United States economic expansion, already the longest in American history, shows few signs of old age, President Clinton said in his administration's last annual survey of the economy.
In a 500-page report released today that mixed politics with an analysis of the country's record-breaking prosperity, the president's top economic advisers said a combination of deft fiscal management and a surge of entrepreneurial activity had made the current economic expansion not only the longest in history, but also by many measures the most unusual.
By the late stages of previous economic booms, in the 1960's and 1980's, inflation had surged, productivity had ebbed and income inequality had risen, the report said. But this expansion, which began in March 1991, has defied gravity, with inflation tame, productivity rising and the income gap narrowing after nearly a decade of growth.
''I don't know how long it can last, but the economic fundamentals look very good,'' said Martin N. Baily, chairman of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. ''As long as we stick to the fiscal policy we have there is no reason this shouldn't continue indefinitely.''
The report updates projections on how fast the economy will grow this year and next. It predicts the economy will expand at a slightly slower rate of 2.9 percent this year, down from 4.2 percent in 1999, with growth of 2.6 percent in 2001, and no recession in sight.
The administration also adjusted its estimate of the rise in productivity, a measure of worker efficiency and a crucial determinant of the longevity of an expansion. The more each worker can produce in the same number of hours, the more the economy can expand without straining resources and igniting inflation, the thinking goes.
The report predicts that productivity growth will average 2.1 percent a year for each of the next four years, far higher than the 1.4 percent average for the period between 1973 and 1995, but slower than the average gains over the last couple of years.
Indeed, that estimate could be conservative, Mr. Baily said. Productivity actually grew at a 5 percent rate in the final half of last year. If that were to keep up, then the overall economy could probably grow much faster -- perhaps at almost 4 percent a year -- without serious risk of inflation, he said.
Economists are sharply divided on whether Mr. Clinton, or any president, for that matter, does much to influence the overall direction of the economy. To the extent that the widespread use of computers, the growth of the Internet and the stock market surge have powered the economy, for example, the administration's fingerprints are barely visible.
But the report contends that Mr. Clinton deserves credit for what it calls two of the most important ingredients of today's strong economy: a sharp improvement in the financial condition of the federal government and the sizable increase in the role of trade.
''The expansion has been the result of a complementary set of developments in policy and in the private sector,'' the report said. ''Rapid technological change has occurred in an economy that is more globalized than ever.''
When Mr. Clinton took office, the federal government was deeply in debt and adding to the red ink in huge annual chunks. Today, the government is running a hefty surplus and paying down the national debt for the first time in decades. That reversal has freed hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in more productive sectors, the report says.
The sound economy and the resulting rise in tax revenues have a good deal to do with that, of course. But some economists outside of government agree that Mr. Clinton deserves a tip of the hat.
''Government spending declined as a share of the economy during his term,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ''There was a surge in tax revenue, it's true. But in another era, it could have been frittered away.''
Another engine of the economy has been globalization. Trade -- the sum of exports and imports -- accounts for a greater share of economic activity today than at any time since the turn of the last century, the report says. Moreover, the flow of capital among nations has exploded in the 1990's.
Credit Mr. Clinton's push for market-opening initiatives around the world, the White House argued. Mr. Clinton persuaded Congress to ratify free trade agreements with Mexico and Canada and helped usher in the creation of the World Trade Organization during his tenure. The seeds for both those achievements were laid in the Reagan and Bush administrations, the report acknowledges, but final credit for making them a reality goes to Mr. Clinton, it says.
The report notes two less rosy indicators, either of which could eventually contribute to the next recession. Private households are spending lots of money now based on expectations of future earnings and a continuing run-up in stock prices, the report says. That could foreshadow a sharp reduction in consumption if the stock market slumps.
The United States is also running a record trade deficit with the rest of the world. Long term, the deficit threatens the strength of the dollar and the reliance on cheap imports and capital from abroad to help fuel the domestic economy.

Abstract: BARELY a year after a worldwide deflation scare -- when markets and currencies were crashing, banks and businesses in Asia, Russia and Latin America were failing, and prices of oil and raw materials were plunging -- inflation is back on peoples' minds. But what concerns Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Wall Street investors is the nagging suspicion that the stellar inflation record of the last two years was mostly the product of a few lucky, highly transitory breaks -- and therefore won't last. That suspicion is likely to propel the Fed's policy-making committee toward another interest-rate increase when it meets on Tuesday. Actually, there are solid reasons for thinking that a return to the bad old days, when upwardly spiraling prices seemed as inevitable as the sunrise, is highly unlikely. For one thing, some of those ''transitory'' factors are likely to persist for quite a while longer.

Full text: BARELY a year after a worldwide deflation scare -- when markets and currencies were crashing, banks and businesses in Asia, Russia and Latin America were failing, and prices of oil and raw materials were plunging -- inflation is back on peoples' minds.
On the face of it, fretting about inflation when every major price gauge in the United States is rising just 2 percent or so a year seems a little like Uma Thurman obsessing over her weight.
But what concerns Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Wall Street investors is the nagging suspicion that the stellar inflation record of the last two years was mostly the product of a few lucky, highly transitory breaks -- and therefore won't last. That suspicion is likely to propel the Fed's policy-making committee toward another interest-rate increase when it meets on Tuesday.
Admittedly, the budding recovery in Asia and Europe has already blunted some of the forces that have helped push United States inflation down from 4 percent to 2 percent a year since 1997.
Energy prices -- indeed, most commodity prices other than farm products -- are already rebounding sharply after collapsing last year.
And the high-flying dollar, which helped to make imports cheaper, has recently weakened against the euro and the yen as global investors have begun to shift some of their mutual fund money away from the United States to foreign markets.
Sounds dire, right?
Actually, there are solid reasons for thinking that a return to the bad old days, when upwardly spiraling prices seemed as inevitable as the sunrise, is highly unlikely. For one thing, some of those ''transitory'' factors are likely to persist for quite a while longer. For another, popular expectations about inflation -- low inflation, this time -- readily become self-fulfilling prophecies. And a host of structural and policy changes over the last couple of decades have made the United States economy less inherently prone to inflation.
Even skeptics now say that the low inflation of the 1990's is not just a fluke, but rather a return to a norm that prevailed for a quarter-century, beginning in the late 1940's -- years when 4 percent inflation seemed scandalously high. As Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently, ''To a substantial extent, we're back to the 50's.''
Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University, until recently a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said of mainstream economists: ''A lot of us were real stick-in-the-muds. We said: 'No, no, no. Here are the equations.' But other people who knew less about equations had the sense to realize that things are a bit different.''
For starters, not all the good luck is evaporating. True, energy prices have jumped 24 percent since the beginning of the year. But energy wasn't a big factor in inflation's decline -- the economy uses a lot less energy than it did in, say, 1973 -- and this year's price increase isn't anything like the surges in 1973 or 1990. Most of the impact has already filtered through to consumer prices for gasoline, electricity, heating oil and air fares, adding at most a few tenths of a percentage point to the inflation rate.
The dollar's recent dip and the ballooning trade deficit have some economists, notably Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warning of the possibility of a currency crisis. If the dollar were to take a big dive, that would indeed threaten to push inflation up sharply. But it would also provoke a sharp reaction from the Fed. And the dollar is still slightly stronger on a trade-weighted basis (that is, against a basket of currencies of America's trading partners) than it was at the start of the year.
More to the point, import prices, by far the biggest recent drag on inflation, are apt to remain under downward pressure. Their decline, it turns out, was due less to the strong dollar than to vast excess productive capacity in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere -- an excess that will not be mopped up soon, given the gradual pace of world recovery.
''It's not just the dollar, but economic incentives to increase production abroad,'' said Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.
Domestically, health care costs have stopped skyrocketing and show few signs of resuming that course, despite increases over the last year in the fees that health maintenance organizations charge employers. Though the latest readings show consumer prices for medical care rising a bit faster than a year ago, few experts expect the pace to accelerate to twice the overall inflation rate, as it did in the early 1990's.
In any case, even temporary lulls in inflation can have long-term effects, by changing expectations. Americans who believed two decades ago that inflation would always rise are now expecting it to remain low.
According to the monthly University of Michigan survey of consumer expectations, ordinary Americans expect the inflation rate a year from now to be under 3 percent. (The Federal Reserve forecasts 2.5 percent or less.) ''You get this extra impact,'' Professor Gordon said. ''The biggest factor holding down inflation in the next couple of years is the lower inflation of the past couple.''
But perhaps the strongest reasons for optimism are sweeping changes in the economy that have been in the works for years.
Back in the bad old 1970's, temporary supply shocks tended to produce higher inflation automatically. Since then, some long-term trends -- globalization, deregulation, the computer revolution -- have made the economy less susceptible to bottlenecks and wage-price spirals.
''One story is that we are permanently able to run the economy hotter and labor markets tighter,'' Professor Krugman said, ''because we have a more flexible labor market, and monopoly and union power have been curbed by international competition.''
Consider deregulation, which began during the Carter Administration and has since radically transformed broad swaths of the sprawling service sector, including airlines, energy, banking, railroads, telecommunications and, most recently, electricity. More competition helps rein in inflation directly, and a new wealth of alternatives keeps strikes or other disruptions from creating bottlenecks. (Remember what life was like before faxes, cell phones and E-mail?) ''They all kind of connect the economy together,'' Professor Frankel said.
Then there's the computer revolution. Information technology helps companies do everything they do -- notably, managing inventory -- more flexibly and efficiently. But innovation is also driving down computer prices, and rapidly enough to take half a percentage point off the overall inflation rate, according to Professor Gordon.
More prosaic changes in the way the American labor market works may be as important as globalization. Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard recently published a study suggesting that a host of small, incremental changes -- including the decline of unions, the growing role of temporary-help firms, even welfare reform -- have made the labor market more efficient. That may be why an unemployment rate below the prevailing average of the 1950's and 1960's has yet to set off bidding wars among employers.
And though the labor market may be tight, American business is still operating with a lot of spare capacity, the product of an investment boom spurred by lower interest rates and a rush to embrace technology. Utilization rates remain relatively low even after eight years of economic expansion -- one reason that companies find it hard to raise prices. ''That could explain why inflation is lower than you'd think just looking at unemployment,'' Professor Frankel said.
That investment boom has had another powerful anti-inflation effect. Productivity has been growing at around 2 percent a year, double the rate that prevailed in the 1970's and 1980's. Greater efficiency, in turn, has made it possible for employers to increase compensation at a higher pace than the inflation rate without adding much to their costs.
''We've had an acceleration of productivity growth, and it takes a while before people build that expectation into wages,'' Professor Krugman said.
Of course, even the most open, flexible, productive economy can suffer inflation. Inflation, as Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, has said, is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, and is therefore determined by policy makers in Washington, most notably the Fed.
Recall how the low-inflation post-war era ended: tax cuts and guns-and-butter spending under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and an accommodating central bank let the inflation genie out of the bottle even before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quadrupled oil prices in 1973.
Putting the genie back in the bottle cost the nation a couple of nasty recessions and years of high unemployment and lost output. Today, the memory of the high human and political costs of wringing inflation out of the system help keep inflation at bay, much as memories of the Great Depression have kept deflation at bay.
Three times in 10 years, Alan Greenspan has struck pre-emptively with interest-rate increases to ward off any acceleration before it could even begin, in 1989, 1994 and now -- strikes that so far, at least, seem to have served the economy well.
Chart ''The Exception, or the Rule?''
Inflation hasn't been this low this long for decades. Has this run been a fluke, or are Eisenhower-era inflation rates here to stay? Some of the forces that have helped bring down inflation into the 2 percent range are starting to reverse direction, but excess capacity at home and abroad, a more flexible labor market and faster productivity growth should keep inflation from rebounding.

Abstract: INFLATION is back: Not rising prices, except for an uncharacteristic spurt in April, but the perennial debate about the sacrifices that must be made when inflation does turn into a problem. The debate is premature. The 0.7 percent jump in the Consumer Price Index last month appears to have been an anomaly, reflecting a set of circumstances not likely to be repeated in May. But the April jump was the largest for a single month in nine years. And the Federal Reserve compounded the alarm by announcing last Tuesday that, while it was not yet raising interest rates to slow the economy and head off inflation, it was leaning that way, ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances.'' Suddenly, then, a debate has revived that had lain dormant during more than two years of very modest inflation. But the terms of the debate have changed; the issues are different, and the public's perception of inflation is drastically altered.

Full text: INFLATION is back: Not rising prices, except for an uncharacteristic spurt in April, but the perennial debate about the sacrifices that must be made when inflation does turn into a problem.
The debate is premature. The 0.7 percent jump in the Consumer Price Index last month appears to have been an anomaly, reflecting a set of circumstances not likely to be repeated in May. But the April jump was the largest for a single month in nine years. And the Federal Reserve compounded the alarm by announcing last Tuesday that, while it was not yet raising interest rates to slow the economy and head off inflation, it was leaning that way, ''concerned about the potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances.''
Suddenly, then, a debate has revived that had lain dormant during more than two years of very modest inflation. But the terms of the debate have changed; the issues are different, and the public's perception of inflation is drastically altered.
The old alarm is missing, for one thing. The C.P.I. may have jumped in April, but Americans took no notice, according to the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. ''They don't think any price increases will stick,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the surveys. He added that people are more relaxed about inflation than at any time since the early 1960's.
That is a considerable change. Three years ago, there was talk among policy makers of reducing the annual inflation rate to zero, even if that meant suffering higher unemployment. And people listened respectfully.
Now that talk is gone. An inflation rate of 1.5 to 2 percent (the C.P.I.'s range for most of the past year) makes no one nervous today, and a rise to 3 percent seems tolerable to the public, if not to Wall Street. After all, no homeowner -- and most of the nation's families are homeowners -- is complaining about housing prices, which have been rising briskly in most regions. Or, as Mr. Curtin put it, ''An important element of the strong consumer confidence today is this rise in the value of physical assets.''
The revived inflation debate is also taking place in an altered context. Inflation in America is no longer viewed as a national phenomenon, but seen as a global one. The American economy can indeed operate full-blast without the shortages that push up prices, as long as enough other countries can supplement American production by diverting their unsold merchandise and their idle labor to America's needs.
The Asian crisis and its aftermath have forced that perception into everyone's consciousness. Faced with recession and weak consumer demand at home, companies in Asia, Europe and Latin America have been sending their wares to the United States at discount prices. And, gradually, officials and economists are coming to the view that without this flood of imports, the inflation rate in the United States could not have remained so low through three years of expansion and the labor shortages it produced.
Excess global capacity is the new buzz phrase, representing a concept that three years ago most economists and policy makers thought impossible. Supply used to be considered something that rapidly fell in line with demand. Now oversupply -- caused by excess capacity, if not in the United States, then somewhere else -- is recognized as a persistent problem. And deflation, a word shunned in the old inflation debate, is a common concern in the new one.
''The global economy has become the new wild card in making policy to control inflation,'' said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
This new emphasis showed itself last Tuesday in the reaction of the National Association of Manufacturers to the Fed's inflation concerns. The manufacturers, who often complain that they cannot raise prices because of global competition, urged the Fed to hold interest rates steady because of ''the general weakness of global growth.''
Two days later, when the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit had widened in March, because of a big jump in imports, some Wall Street economists welcomed the news instead of wringing their hands as they once would have. The former thinking was that trade deficits pull the United States deeper into debt to foreign lenders who finance the nation's excess spending on imports. Eventually this borrowing can depress the dollar, and a weaker dollar then makes imports more expensive for Americans, pushing up the inflation rate.
That may yet happen. But it was not uppermost last week in the minds of the economists at Bankers Trust. They applauded. ''A burgeoning trade deficit continues to act as a safety valve for the U.S. economy,'' they told clients, ''siphoning production away from potentially overheating domestic industries and thus helping keep inflation tame.''
The new inflation debate is fundamentally altered in another way. Nothing used to be of greater concern than the trade-off between domestic unemployment and domestic inflation, a concept embodied in the acronym Nairu, short for nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. When the unemployment rate fell too low, the theory said, labor shortages would put upward pressure on wages, forcing employers to increase prices. Nairu refers to the level of unemployment below which this effect kicked in.
But where is Nairu, exactly? The common wisdom as recently as 1996 put it at 6 percent, or perhaps a bit lower. But the jobless rate dropped below 5 percent nearly two years ago, and inflation kept falling.
Many explanations are offered for this uncoupling: job insecurity, weak labor unions, temporary workers, a more productive labor force, the global economy. Whatever the cause, Nairu has lost its clout in the new inflation debate -- ''sublimated by the marvelous combination of low unemployment and low inflation,'' as Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist, put it.
The Federal Reserve, in these new circumstances, is much more constrained. Labor shortages are no longer a persuasive reason for raising interest rates to head off inflation. And when the Fed does finally act, the communique will have to take a world view -- explaining convincingly how the global economy is now fomenting inflation in America instead of stifling it.

Abstract: But despite the oil price increase, economists are not predicting a new surge in inflation across the board. Rather, they are merely saying that the decline in inflation, which limited last year's increase in the Consumer Price Index to 1.6 percent, will be over if the oil price rises stick. This means, economists said yesterday, that the rate of inflation over all, which includes energy and food prices, is likely to move up toward the rate for what economists call core inflation. That rate, which excludes energy and food, is considered by some to be a better measure of the long-term rate of price increases. Last year, the C.P.I.'s core rate rose 2.3 percent. But, the economists agree, there is no upward spiral on the horizon. Oil ministers meeting at The Hague also announced that they had the outline of an agreement to cut oil production by two million barrels a day. That report pushed up the price of oil for delivery in April to $14.49 a barrel, its highest since October. The anticipation of some kind of new cut in output has been pushing up the price of oil steadily since mid-February, when it was $11.37 a barrel, just above a 13-year low.

Full text: The oil price surge this year, which got another boost yesterday with a new agreement on cutting production, is beginning to sting consumers.
Gasoline pump prices began to creep up this month. Colder weather in the Northeast could add to the heating oil pinch. Higher prices for airplane fuel may make tickets more expensive quickly. The indirect ripple effects, in products, like plastics, that use oil, will take longer to bite, but will come.
But despite the oil price increase, economists are not predicting a new surge in inflation across the board. Rather, they are merely saying that the decline in inflation, which limited last year's increase in the Consumer Price Index to 1.6 percent, will be over if the oil price rises stick.
This means, economists said yesterday, that the rate of inflation over all, which includes energy and food prices, is likely to move up toward the rate for what economists call core inflation. That rate, which excludes energy and food, is considered by some to be a better measure of the long-term rate of price increases. Last year, the C.P.I.'s core rate rose 2.3 percent. But, the economists agree, there is no upward spiral on the horizon.
''I think we should notice but not worry,'' said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board. ''There is really nothing in the global environment or the United States environment that suggests that this is going to spread.''
Still, it remains to be seen whether consumers will get unnerved when they see reports that prices are moving up rather than holding steady or declining. Investors might also get disturbed and push the price of bonds down and interest rates higher. But there was no sign of this kind of concern in the bond market yesterday, as interest rates on Treasury securities fell and the Government's inflation-indexed bonds were virtually unchanged.
The changing outlook for inflation was reflected pointedly in two separate news events yesterday. First, the Labor Department reported that prices paid to producers fell four-tenths of 1 percent in February. Without energy and food, producer prices were unchanged. Throughout the report there were signs that the prices of many goods were still falling.
Oil ministers meeting at The Hague also announced that they had the outline of an agreement to cut oil production by two million barrels a day. That report pushed up the price of oil for delivery in April to $14.49 a barrel, its highest since October. The anticipation of some kind of new cut in output has been pushing up the price of oil steadily since mid-February, when it was $11.37 a barrel, just above a 13-year low.
There are several reasons that economists are not predicting another general price spiral. One is that the global economic growth is still sluggish at best. Even if Asia, which touched off a worldwide financial crisis in 1997 with a series of currency devaluations, is recovering, Latin America is in decline and Europe seems to be standing still or slipping.
Chase Manhattan Bank forecasts about 1.5 percent growth globally this year. Even if stronger-than-expected United States growth pulls that up to 2 percent, that will be significantly below recent years' pace, said James E. Glassman, Chase's senior United States economist.
''The main driver for all this good inflation news is that we are not growing at our potential globally,'' he said. The way to change his mind about the outlook for inflation, he said, is to have oil prices rising because global demand was picking up.
Another factor is that other commodity prices, from cotton to copper, are at or near their recent lows. The Commodity Research Bureau/ Bridge index of 17 commodities, which fell yesterday, is just 5 points above its 24-year low hit at the end of February.
''Until there is significant upward pressure on all commodities, we are not going to have any worrisome price impact,'' said Ms. Fosler of the Conference Board.
In addition, while oil prices have shot up 20 percent this year, they have risen from very low levels and are just back to where they were last summer or fall, when they were already low. The same is true for gasoline prices, which were at their lowest level, after adjustment for inflation, since at least the 1950's.
And there is the question of whether the production cuts will hold or have a significant impact. Oil producers are notorious for cheating, even after agreeing to pump less oil. After the last major effort to cut production began in March 1998, the price of oil dropped 36 percent to its low of $10.72 a barrel in December.
But while there is not a new inflation spiral in sight, the overall inflation rate will rise if the oil price increase holds.
Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimates that the price of oil could move up to $17 a barrel soon. And he said it could possibly move near $20 a barrel by the end of the year if there was a sustained reduction in production that made a meaningful dent in the current overload of oil inventories.
Cynthia Latta, principal United States economist at Standard & Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass., ran an end-of-the-year oil price of $18 a barrel through her computer model and found the following: The DRI forecast of a 1.8 percent rise in the C.P.I., year-over-year, in 1999 inches up to 2.1 percent. And if the oil price held there, the C.P.I. would increase 2.8 percent in 2000 and 2.6 percent in 2001, before slipping back to 2.4 percent in 2002.
This is above the 1.6 percent increase for 1998. But the number is less startling when compared with the 2.3 percent increase in the C.P.I. in 1997 and the 3 percent rise in 1996. In addition, the forecasts are close to the increase in the core C.P.I., without the volatile elements of food and energy, which rose 2.3 percent in 1998, 2.4 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1996.
All this leads Ms. Latta to agree with the other economists on the recent rise in oil prices: ''It is not going to have much of an impact on inflation.''

January Inventories Up
WASHINGTON, March 12 (Reuters) -- United States businesses added to their stocks of goods on hand in January, with retailers in particular building inventories in anticipation of strong shopping, the Government said today.
Total business inventories increased one-tenth of a percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.088 trillion in January, reversing a one-tenth of a percent decrease in December. But overall sales were down for the first time in five months.
The report reflected booming consumer demand as retailers recorded strong sales and inventory building. The reverse was true for both wholesalers and manufacturers, whose January sales and inventories were lower than in December.
Retailers, enjoying robust sales, increased their goods on hand in January by eight-tenths of a percent, to $336.3 billion, after a seven-tenths of a percent rise in December. Retail sales increased 1 percent, to $234.35 billion, after a 1.1 percent surge in December.
Total sales by all levels of businesses -- retail, wholesale and manufacturing -- were down in January by three-tenths of 1 percent, to $791.09 billion, after a 1 percent jump in December.
It was the first decline in total monthly business sales since a two-tenths of 1 percent fall in August last year and was the biggest monthly drop since a half a percent dip in August 1997.
Manufacturers' inventories fell in January by three-tenths of 1 percent, to $465.57 billion, after a nine-tenths of 1 percent December fall. Sales by manufacturing companies declined eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $341.46 billion, after an eight-tenths of 1 percent gain in December.

Abstract: But the more powerful impact is working through a slower-moving and less visible force: the markets for basic commodities like oil, metals and timber. And that helps explain why the ripples from the Asian financial collapse are continuing to hit hard at countries as far-flung as Canada, Chile, New Zealand and Mexico, yet the effect has remained unexpectedly benign in the United States and Europe. Drops in the prices for copper have hit Zambia and Chile, while New Zealand has felt the impact of lower timber prices. Australia is suffering from a decline in wool prices; Canada bears the pain of lower coal and timber prices. But the United States and Europe are in significantly different positions than most other countries. Even though exports from Europe and America to Asia have dropped sharply and the United States also sells a lot of its own commodities abroad, their economies are far less dependent on them. In addition, generally affluent consumers in the world's two biggest economic entities have received a big boost -- similar to the effects of a substantial tax cut -- because of the decline in commodity prices. This has largely cushioned the Asian fallout so far here and in much of Europe.

Full text: Brace yourself. It's time for the Asian aftershocks.
When East Asia was hit by its economic earthquake a year ago, the shock waves quickly reverberated around the globe through the world's hair-trigger stock and currency markets.
But the more powerful impact is working through a slower-moving and less visible force: the markets for basic commodities like oil, metals and timber. And that helps explain why the ripples from the Asian financial collapse are continuing to hit hard at countries as far-flung as Canada, Chile, New Zealand and Mexico, yet the effect has remained unexpectedly benign in the United States and Europe.
For nations that depend heavily on selling raw materials and basic goods globally to generate growth and to support their government budgets, the pain has been sharp, contributing to job cutbacks, lower currency values, shortfalls in government revenues and ballooning trade deficits.
Over all, commodity prices are down almost 10 percent since February.
''There is no question that the weakness in certain commodities is reverberating in markets around the world,'' said Desmond Lachman, managing director of emerging markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
Drops in the prices for copper have hit Zambia and Chile, while New Zealand has felt the impact of lower timber prices. Australia is suffering from a decline in wool prices; Canada bears the pain of lower coal and timber prices.
But the United States and Europe are in significantly different positions than most other countries. Even though exports from Europe and America to Asia have dropped sharply and the United States also sells a lot of its own commodities abroad, their economies are far less dependent on them. In addition, generally affluent consumers in the world's two biggest economic entities have received a big boost -- similar to the effects of a substantial tax cut -- because of the decline in commodity prices. This has largely cushioned the Asian fallout so far here and in much of Europe.
Consider the impact of lower oil prices, which have fallen from a high of $22 a barrel in the last year to a low of $11.56 a barrel last month. While not all of this is a result of the crisis in Asia, a major portion is because the Asian economic engine has stopped racing ahead and has gone into reverse.
That has translated into about $14 billion in lost income this year to major oil producers like Russia, Mexico, Venezuela and the Middle East and a nearly equivalent bonus for energy consumers. For the United States, which produced 6.4 million barrels a day in April but also imported 10.4 million barrels daily, the positive gain for consumers has far outweighed the negative impact on oil drillers.
Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics, is forecasting that lost growth from American exports and the substitution of cheaper Asian imports for products made here could cut as much a one full percentage point off the increase in the gross domestic product this year.
But, at the same time, he estimates that the overall decline in oil prices, by putting more money into the pockets of American consumers, will add back much, though probably not all, of the growth lost through worsening foreign trade.
And this is not the only stimulus from Asia. The flight of foreign investors from Asia's problems and into the haven of Treasury bonds has bolstered the dollar and pushed American long-term interest rates to 30-year lows. The near absence of inflation has been helped by lower commodity prices and cheaper import prices. All that has allowed growth to perk along without the inflationary pressures that would have normally forced the Federal Reserve to put on the brakes.
Both low rates and low inflation have helped keep the stock market rally alive, adding to the ''wealth effect'' from the market rally that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, among others, believes has kept the economy strong by stimulating spending.
For the United States, Mr. Sinai said, ''It is possible that the positive byproducts could be more than enough to offset the negatives.''
But for major commodity producing nations, the cushion has been less comforting.
In Canada, where commodities make up about 40 percent of exports, the Canadian dollar has been bouncing off record lows, largely because of the weakness of commodity prices. While the economy is still forecast to grow around 3 percent this year, Ottawa has abandoned its policy of raising interest rates to support the Canadian dollar. That has helped offset some of the Asian impact, according to Ram Bhagavatula, the chief financial economist at Citibank.
Analysts are forecasting that New Zealand's commodity-sensitive economy could tip into a short recession because of the falloff in the sales of lumber, fish, fruits, vegetables and the like. And if Japan -- one of the principal buyers of New Zealand products -- remains mired in recession, prospects could worsen.
In Australia, the Aussie dollar plunged to a 12-year low in June as new forecasts showed that total commodity exports should fall by 1 percent over the next year, after rising more than 7 percent the previous year. Like Canada, Australia may have enough domestic demand to keep it out of a recession. But some economists are scaling back their growth forecasts.
The continued low level of commodity prices means that many countries -- along with their financial markets -- will probably remain vulnerable to further shocks for some time. Even in Canada and Australia, where no recession is in sight, the weakened currencies will mean growing trade deficits and inflationary pressure as import costs rise.
Money in stock markets around the world can move quickly, often in anticipation of fundamental economic changes expected in the future. But a meaningful rebound in commodity prices will probably wait until the economies of Asia actually turn around and begin to consume more oil, copper, coal, fish and vegetables.
In a recent study, two World Bank economists, Guillermo Perry and Daniel Lederman, discussed the fallout from declining commodity prices, which they called real effects, and the fallout from declines in equity and currency markets, which they called financial effects.
Looking at the impact of Asia's downturn on Latin America, they found that the weakness caused by the real effects from lower commodity prices ''may produce an increase in the financial vulnerability of countries.''
Sure, there are other factors that explain some of the drop in commodity prices: El Nino and a warm winter contributed to the softness in oil demand, for instance.
But the key factor remains Asia. The International Monetary Fund, in its recent World Economic Outlook, concluded that the drop in primary commodity prices as a group was ''to a large degree'' a result of the Asian downturn.
Asia has had this impact, the report said, because the region had stopped increasing its consumption of oil, copper, rubber, zinc, nickel, wool and timber. For example, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, where the Asian crisis has hit hard, accounted for about a quarter of the growth of demand for copper between 1992 and 1996. With that demand now shrinking, copper prices have dropped almost 35 percent in the last year.
The copper fallout has been felt in Zambia, where the metal accounts for more than 80 percent of export earnings, and in Chile, where copper accounts for 42 percent of export earnings. A major share of Chile's exports go to Asia and the Government estimates that it has lost as much as $500 million in forgone Asian sales.
Last month Chile's Government announced $200 million in new budget cuts that bring the total for the year to $685 million. Interest rates have risen and the peso has fallen to record lows, forcing the central bank to drop policies that limited foreign investment and to use its dollar reserves to defend the peso.
In New Zealand, timber exports, which are about 10 percent of the country's total, collapsed with the weakness in the housing market in Japan, said Mark Benseman, an economist for Merrill Lynch in Auckland. He estimates that about 34 percent of the country's exports -- those going to Australia and Asia -- have been affected by the slump.
In Canada, the Japanese recession has had a stark impact. According to the most recent trade statistics, exports to Japan, measured in Canadian dollars, have fallen 43 percent since April 1997. The decline has been spread over most commodity groups, led by softwood lumber. In the first quarter, exports of coal and related products to Japan fell 84 percent. There also have been significant declines in commodity exports to South Korea and Taiwan.
Over all, the value of agricultural and fishing exports are down 8.5 percent since April 1997 while energy exports are off 17.5 percent and forestry products are down 2.7 percent.
But the biggest impact of all has occurred in the oil markets. Mike Rothman, Merrill Lynch's senior energy analyst, estimates that consumption of oil this year has been cut by as much 300,000 barrels a day in developing Asia and even more by the recession in Japan.
There are 25 countries that count on petroleum revenue for 20 percent or more of their foreign exchange earnings, according to the International Monetary Fund. There are also five oil exporters that count on oil revenues for 40 percent or more of their government budgets.
In Mexico, oil represents only 12 percent of total exports, but it supports 40 percent of Government spending, according to Merrill Lynch. In Venezuela, oil is a double whammy, accounting for 77 percent of exports and 57 percent of Government spending.
The value of the Mexican peso has fallen 10 percent this year. And even though the economy is growing briskly, the Government has just approved a third package of spending cuts, slicing $3.7 billion in all.
In Russia, which is a major exporter of commodities from oil to precious metals, the oil price drop hit in two ways. First, oil accounts for more than 20 percent of export earnings, but Russia has had to cut production by 350,000 barrels a day because the cost to extract and transport the oil is now more than the market price.
In addition, oil prices have foiled, so far, the sale of Rosneft, the last large state-owned oil company, undermining the Government's effort to raise needed cash.
Oil prices have shot up recently on the hope for significant cuts in production. But the two leading commodity indexes, the Commodity Research Bureau/Bridge index of 17 commodities and the Goldman Sachs index of 22 commodities, are only slightly above their recent lows.
And Japan, the key to the revival of the rest of Asia, has yet to prove it can get its economy or its currency back on track. So a commodity upturn is still more of a hope than a reality for the countries that sell them. ''The problem we face,'' said David Bassanese, senior economist at Bankers Trust in Sydney, Australia, ''is that the export recovery still hasn't arrived.''

Abstract: Australian bonds rose in the first trading session of 1998, amid optimism that cooling Asian economies will take the heat off domestic growth, and keep any risk of accelerating inflation at bay. Asia, and the effect it is seen having on demand for Australian exports, ''is going to be the dampening spot for our economy,'' he said. The benchmark October 2007 Government bonds added $6.04 Australian ($4 United States) today for each $1,000 Australian ($650 United States) face value. The yield fell 7basis points, to 5.98 percent.

Full text: Australian bonds rose in the first trading session of 1998, amid optimism that cooling Asian economies will take the heat off domestic growth, and keep any risk of accelerating inflation at bay.
''The bond market will do well'' from Asia's financial turmoil, said Anthony Robson, chief fixed-interest trader at Westpac Bank in Sydney.
Asia, and the effect it is seen having on demand for Australian exports, ''is going to be the dampening spot for our economy,'' he said.
The benchmark October 2007 Government bonds added $6.04 Australian ($4 United States) today for each $1,000 Australian ($650 United States) face value. The yield fell 7basis points, to 5.98 percent.
The gains in Australian bonds were underpinned by a report in the United States this week that suggested that the American economy was growing with little inflation.
Even as Australian growth picks up -- aided by a jump in retail spending during summer vacations and more people finding full-time employment -- price increases by Australian producers and retailers are seen as restrained.
Helping to bolster optimism that inflation will be subdued were comments this week by the investor George Soros, who said the world was on the brink of international deflation as a result of the economic turmoil in Asia.
''What started out as a minor imbalance has become a much bigger one that threatens to engulf not only international credit but international trade,'' said Mr. Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management and the primary investment adviser to Quantum Fund, in an article in The Financial Times on Wednesday.
Investors viewed Mr. Soros's comments as bullish for bonds.

Abstract: The Clinton Administration said today that it would make as much as $5 billion available for the international bailout of South Korea, hoping to stabilize a country where the United States has considerable economic and security interests. The direct financing would back up $35 billion being provided through three international institutions to which the United States is the largest contributor: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The $5 billion commitment -- at the low end of what reports from South Korea had suggested Washington would contribute -- compares with $10 billion being offered for the South Korean package by Japan, and with the $3 billion in backup funds offered by the United States last month to Indonesia, whose economy is far smaller than South Korea's.

Full text: The Clinton Administration said today that it would make as much as $5 billion available for the international bailout of South Korea, hoping to stabilize a country where the United States has considerable economic and security interests.
The direct financing would back up $35 billion being provided through three international institutions to which the United States is the largest contributor: the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
The $5 billion commitment -- at the low end of what reports from South Korea had suggested Washington would contribute -- compares with $10 billion being offered for the South Korean package by Japan, and with the $3 billion in backup funds offered by the United States last month to Indonesia, whose economy is far smaller than South Korea's.
The offer reflected a strategy adopted two weeks ago by the United States and many big Asian nations of calling on the I.M.F. and other international organizations to take the lead in dealing with financially troubled nations, but encouraging other governments with a stake in the region to offer supplemental aid when needed.
''We have a vital national economic and security interest in helping Korea restore market stability as soon as possible,'' Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said.
The American aid will be made available through a special fund under the Treasury Department's control, and does not require any Congressional authorization. Administration officials said they kept Congressional leaders informed about the situation, and said there were no signs the plan would run into serious opposition from Republican leaders.
But some Democrats and Republicans expressed misgivings, and said that when Congress reconvened next month they would raise questions about the Administration's request for even more funds for the I.M.F.
''It's very bad policy,'' said Representative Ron Paul, a Texas Republican, who has long argued that international bailouts put taxpayer money at risk and threaten the American economy by weakening the dollar and stimulating inflation, all to insulate banks and other investors from losses. ''With the exception of some bankers from Houston, I never hear from anyone who wants to sacrifice taxpayer dollars to go over there to bail someone out,'' Mr. Paul said today.
Democratic critics want to tie international bailouts and other financial aid to human rights issues and improved conditions for workers.
Administration officials defended both the I.M.F. package with South Korea and the American backup fund as effective ways to impose sweeping changes on the South Korean financial and economic systems. And they said that the last such American financing package -- a key element in the bailout of Mexico three years ago -- was fully repaid, with interest, helping close off the crisis there.
Officials said the United States agreed to provide additional financing only after determining that the I.M.F. package was tough enough on the Koreans to restore market confidence in their economy while reassuring American taxpayers that the Treasury Department was not throwing good money after bad.
A senior Treasury official said today that American aid would be released to South Korea only to fill any gaps in that country's financing needs between the release of I.M.F. installments. The American money would be provided for 60-day periods, with the possibility of extensions if needed. And it would be released only if Seoul continues to meet all the requirements of the I.M.F. program and if the Treasury Department thinks it will be repaid.
The money would come from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, a $40 billion pool administered by the Treasury Department and used at the discretion of the President. It was set up in the 1930'ss to give the Government ammunition to defend the dollar's value. It has been used increasingly, though, in maintaining the stability of global markets by helping beleaguered nations restore confidence in their currencies.
There have been periodic attempts by Congress to restrict the stabilization fund. Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, is currently pushing for legislation that would require that any disbursement of more than $250 million receive Congressional approval.
Mr. Faircloth said he would demand that the Administration accept such a restriction in return for Congressional approval of Mr. Clinton's request for $3.5 billion to bolster the I.M.F.'s finances. The Administration's request for that money was blocked last month by anti-abortion Republicans, who demanded restrictions on American support for international family planning programs in return for new I.M.F. support.
''I believe Robert Rubin needs to stop using the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a personal piggy bank for international bailouts,'' Mr. Faircloth said.
But Administration officials said that the problems in South Korea could impress on members of Congress the need to strengthen the I.M.F. The Administration won support on that today from four senior Republicans on the House Banking Committee, including the chairman, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa.
They sent a letter to Republican leaders urging them to support the additional funds for the I.M.F. and also for the United Nations, saying that the ability to halt global financial crises was in America's interest.
''With the financial future of Asia uncertain and the possibility of a full bailout of South Korea looming, a depleted I.M.F. may not be able to respond to a currency crisis that could have grave consequences in the United States,'' said Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, the author of the letter.

Abstract: The United States economy looks well balanced in its seventh year of growth, with surprisingly low inflation despite tight labor markets, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report today. ''The United States has enjoyed a year of exceptionally good economic performance,'' the Paris-based group of 29 industrial countries said in its annual review. ''This is all the more remarkable in this, the seventh year of economic expansion.''

Full text: The United States economy looks well balanced in its seventh year of growth, with surprisingly low inflation despite tight labor markets, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report today.
''The United States has enjoyed a year of exceptionally good economic performance,'' the Paris-based group of 29 industrial countries said in its annual review. ''This is all the more remarkable in this, the seventh year of economic expansion.''
The O.E.C.D. forecast that gross domestic product in the United States in 1997 would grow by 3.8 percent, the fastest rate among the group's seven largest members and the highest since 1988.
The annual review, whose content was approved on Oct. 8, predicted that above-trend growth would continue through spring and said the inflation rate could increase to around 3 percent from its current level of just above 2 percent.
The O.E.C.D. said that keeping prices in check would probably require the Federal Reserve to raise short-term borrowing costs by as much as three-quarters of a percentage point ''to curb some interest-sensitive demand.''
The Fed last changed monetary policy on March 25, when it lifted the Federal funds overnight lending rate by a quarter-percentage point, to 5.5 percent. Despite the tightening, long-term interest rates and other market rates are lower since the spring. ''As a result, all of the restrictive effect of the March tightening has since been undone in the interim,'' the O.E.C.D. said. The group saw the biggest inflation risk coming from the labor market.

Full text: To the Editor:
Your timely April 17 article on wealth inequality in the United States ("Gap in Wealth in U.S. Called Widest in West," front page), closely following publication of Robert McNamara's book "In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam," prompts me to offer my opinion on the origin of the undesirable trend of extreme wealth inequality in the United States.
In all the publicity that has accompanied Mr. McNamara's book, practically the only mention I've noted of the economic consequences of the Vietnam War was in your April 13 book review: "And McNamara faults President Johnson for failing to be more forthright with the American public about the growing expense of the war."
This understates the facts substantially! Lyndon Johnson deliberately lied to Congress and the American people and escalated the war by stealth, ignoring the warning of his advisers that the result of a failure to raise taxes to finance the war would be a dangerous increase in inflation. Prior to the escalation of the war the United States economy of the early 1960's was a practically utopian equilibrium combination of solid growth without inflation.
Johnson's policy set the stage for and began the inflation of the 1970's, which was made worse by the irrational economic policies of President Nixon and the unsound ones of Jimmy Carter. The dollar lost nearly half its purchasing power in the 1970's. This resulted in massive shifts of wealth toward upper-income groups, who are the owners of businesses and property. The real income of the lowest 20 percent income class declined substantially, while before 1967, income distribution among classes had been very stable.
I am of the strong belief that the trend to extreme wealth inequality in the United States has its origin in President Johnson's failure to finance the Vietnam War with a tax increase and that this result is one of the most serious enduring consequences of the ill-conceived Vietnam War.

Greenspan Reassures the G.O.P. on Planned Budget Cuts

Abstract: Mr. [Alan Greenspan] also followed up on his suggestion last month that the Government's Consumer Price Index overstates inflation by recommending today that Congress appoint a special commission to pinpoint the upward bias in the inflation gauge. That way, he said, rather than altering the index itself, the Government could hold down the increase in the future cost of Social Security benefits, Federal pensions and other costs pegged to inflation in line with the commission's estimates. It is "unquestionable," Mr. Greenspan said, that in the long run, deep budget cuts would result in lower interest rates and better economic growth. But he added that if the cuts were so severe that they slowed the economy in the short term, "we obviously will respond to that."

Full text: Special to The New York Times
Continuing his campaign for deep cuts in the Federal budget, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, reassured Republicans in Congress today that he would try to protect the economy from any damage that might be caused by their proposed spending reductions.
Mr. Greenspan also followed up on his suggestion last month that the Government's Consumer Price Index overstates inflation by recommending today that Congress appoint a special commission to pinpoint the upward bias in the inflation gauge. That way, he said, rather than altering the index itself, the Government could hold down the increase in the future cost of Social Security benefits, Federal pensions and other costs pegged to inflation in line with the commission's estimates.
In his second day of Congressional testimony, Mr. Greenspan echoed his statement on Wednesday that the economy shows signs of cooling off, hinting that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady or even ease credit if there were signs of a sharp downturn.
Supporting that viewpoint were two economic indicators released today.
The Commerce Department said business investment in factories and equipment, a major source of economic strength for the last two years, should slow in 1995 to a much more moderate pace. American business plans to increase capital spending by 6.6 percent this year, to $592.9 billion, less than half the 13.7 percent jump recorded in 1994.
In the other report pointing to a slowing economy, the Labor Department said that first-time claims for unemployment benefits by newly laid-off Americans rose 2,000 last week, to 349,000. It was the highest since the week ended Jan. 7, which was skewed by holiday fluctuations. Excluding that week, it was the highest since last July.
These were the latest among several recent signs that the expansion is finally being braked by interest rate increases.
Mr. Greenspan, in his testimony today before the House Banking Committee, sought to reassure Congress that spending cuts would not make the slowdown any worse.
It is "unquestionable," Mr. Greenspan said, that in the long run, deep budget cuts would result in lower interest rates and better economic growth. But he added that if the cuts were so severe that they slowed the economy in the short term, "we obviously will respond to that."
Mr. Greenspan was clearly trying to head off an excuse for limiting budget cuts. If the absence of Government spending threatens to deflate the economy, he suggested, the Fed could offset the effect with lower interest rates. But he stopped short of supporting the Republican plan to pass a balanced budget amendment, and expressed doubts that tinkering with the Constitution was a wise way to set the nation's fiscal policy.

Treasury prices were slightly higher yesterday after two economic reports met the market's expectations.
Trading was slowed by a computer glitch at the Chicago Board of Trade, where trading in bonds futures contracts was halted for nearly four hours.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 1/16 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 7.67 percent, from 7.68 percent on Tuesday.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales surged eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $186.56 billion for August. Despite the strong showing, analysts still see little reason for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before its November policy meeting.
A report by the Fed, its so-called beige book survey of economic conditions, said that competition among companies was keeping retail price increases subdued as the economy slowly expanded.
"There's reason for optimism that inflation is not going to accelerate dramatically," said Steven Nothern, who manages $3.5 billion at Massachusetts Financial Services. Even so, "the inflation process is starting to move in fits and starts through the pipeline," he said.
Fed policy makers will consider the beige book report in deciding whether to push interest rates higher at their Sept. 27 meeting. The report suggests the Fed will not raise rates again until November, said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America).
"We have seen a cyclical change in inflation," Mr. Strauss said. "Is it dramatic? No."
The Government reported on Tuesday that consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in August, matching increases in June and July. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was at a 2.9 percent annual rate through August, up from 2.8 percent for the first eight months of last year and 2.7 percent for all of last year.
In its survey, the Fed said wage inflation was possible amid "more reports of tightening labor markets than before, though wage pressures are still described as modest."
Today, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is scheduled to report on prices paid by 150 manufacturers in Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey. Bonds tumbled after last month's Philadelphia Fed report, which said the bank's prices-paid index surged to a five-year high.
In the corporate bond market, seven businesses sold a total of $1.78 billion in bonds yesterday.
The Nissan Motor Company sold $642 million in bonds. First National Bank of Boston, a unit of the New England bank holding company the Bank of Boston Corporation, sold $200 million of 10-year notes. Bear Stearns Companies sold $200 million of five-year notes.
Other sales included a $175 million offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Government-owned utility, and an $80 million sale by the Michigan Gas Corporation. TCI Communications Inc., a unit of Tele-Communications Inc., sold $300 million of 10-year debt. Chevy Chase Savings Bank sold $181.9 million of floating-rate securities backed by home equity loans, according to MCM Corporate Watch.
Bonds backed by mortgages of the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, led mortgage-backed securities higher, following news of programs that will make the securities easier to trade.
Ginnie Mae 8 percent pass- throughs for October delivery rose as much as 1/4, to 985/32 , to yield 8.41 percent, three basis points less than yesterday. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
Ginnie Mae and the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said yesterday that they would begin bundling mortgage-backed bonds for investors.
Correction: September 16, 1994, Friday
A chart in Business Day yesterday, with an article about the credit markets, included incorrect figures supplied by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, for the average weekly yields on participation certificates. The yield for the 15-year certificate is 7.83 percent, not 8.18 percent, and the yield for the 30-year certificate is 8.31 percent, not 8.66 percent.

For the Nations of the Western Hemisphere, Renewed Growth: Canada; Strong Growth But Weak on Jobs

Abstract: Steel, lumber, automotive parts, lead and zinc and other industrial products are in demand to support the economic expansion in the United States, which takes 80 percent of Canada's exports. In turn, exports are a quarter of Canada's gross domestic product. So, while the economy strengthens, the mood here is still morose. "Company downsizing spooks consumer spending," said Ranga Chand, senior economist at Burns Fry Ltd., Canada's leading investment house. Room for maneuver is relatively tight. The Federal deficit is 6 percent of the gross domestic product, double the 3 percent level in the United States. About 40 percent of Canada's debt is held abroad, meaning that unless a deficit-cutting program has credibility, foreigners are likely to dump Canadian securities and the Canadian dollar, which at around 75 cents to the United States dollar is already near its lowest levels in six years.

Full text: Canada is struggling to get back on its feet economically after heavy-duty structural changes the last half-dozen years, including the painful redirection of resources in response to freer trade, disinflation, new technology and changes in the nation's tax laws.
The convalescence demonstrates how closely linked the patient is to its huge southern neighbor. The economy is growing again but not because of any quickening in the pace of domestic consumption. The engine is exports, chiefly to the United States, which are setting new monthly records.
Steel, lumber, automotive parts, lead and zinc and other industrial products are in demand to support the economic expansion in the United States, which takes 80 percent of Canada's exports. In turn, exports are a quarter of Canada's gross domestic product.
Cuts in inflation, now below 2 percent, and gains in productivity in most industries have sharpened competitiveness and led most forecasters to see steady improvement in growth over the next couple of years.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Paris-based agency that periodically rates industrialized countries' economic performance, predicts Canada will outpace every member but Turkey over the next two years, with a 3.7 percent expansion in 1994 and a 4.1 percent gain in 1995 -- up from 2.5 percent in 1993.
Yet because of continued corporate downsizing and increasing use of labor-saving technology, no significant drops are foreseen in unemployment, which has hovered around 11 percent over the past three years.
Many economists believe that growth must climb nearer 5 percent before unemployment starts falling; yet forecasts by the O.E.C.D. and others suggest there is not much chance of this any time soon.
So, while the economy strengthens, the mood here is still morose. "Company downsizing spooks consumer spending," said Ranga Chand, senior economist at Burns Fry Ltd., Canada's leading investment house.
Another problem is the huge Government deficit, forcing interest payments and debt ever higher. The new Liberal Government vows to do something about it, but people will not know what it has up its sleeve until the February budget.
Room for maneuver is relatively tight. The Federal deficit is 6 percent of the gross domestic product, double the 3 percent level in the United States. About 40 percent of Canada's debt is held abroad, meaning that unless a deficit-cutting program has credibility, foreigners are likely to dump Canadian securities and the Canadian dollar, which at around 75 cents to the United States dollar is already near its lowest levels in six years.
The question is whether the Government will cut spending or raise taxes. Either way will be a drag on economic growth, further postponing the end of double-digit joblessness.
On bright spot has been the stock market, which enjoyed a record 1993. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-share index surged 29 percent to 4321.40, and many analysts foresee further advances of 10 percent to 20 percent this year, given the strength in both the economy and corporate earnings.

Full text: The Clinton Treasury is betting that the Clinton Presidency will succeed in creating a low-inflation environment over the next several years and that the President's successor will follow suit.
That is the gamble that the Treasury took this week when it announced that it would shift 45 percent of its longer-term borrowing to shorter- term maturities of from three years to three months. If the bet proves wrong and inflation does not stay low, taxpayers will be paying higher interest costs.
"Whether this turns out to be a good thing or a bad thing is whether they follow good economic policy or bad economic policy for the next several years," William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said yesterday. "That is another way of saying that inflation stays low." Debt Mix Shift Applauded
The economist Henry Kaufman, who applauded the Treasury debt mix shift, added, "It is betting on your own economic policy."
But Mr. Kaufman also said that the shift, by helping to lower intermediate and long-term interest rates slightly, would assist the private sector, which he said should be a more important goal of the policy change.
"The Treasury should follow a policy that will be supportive of the economic recovery even if it is only in a marginal sense," Mr. Kaufman said. And, he said, borrowing more with short-term securities is a positive incentive for the Treasury.
"As the Treasury finances short term, its financing costs are more variable," he said. "As inflation goes up, interest costs will go up, so Treasury has an additional incentive in the fight against inflation."
Bringing the deficit under control, which has looked less likely in recent weeks because of the problems of President Clinton in getting his programs through Congress, is the kind of long-term repair the economy needs, analysts say. That would help foster confidence and help keep long-term interest rates coming down, making more investors believe that inflation will remain low.
Such a trend could lead to lower long-term interest rates and, at the same time, only small increases in short-term interest rates as the economy begins to pick up pace. In that case, it would be advisable to cut some long-term borrowing because long rates would be falling. And it would not be so risky to add to short-term borrowing because short-term interest rates would not likely rise enough to erase the savings gained by shifting from higher-interest-rate long-term borrowing to lower-interest-rate shorter-term borrowing.
But this blend of economic policies may also require that the economy grow at just a moderate pace, which would mean that the President's goal of creating millions of new jobs would be harder to attain.
There is another way to make the debt shift work, but that would be an even less desired condition for the Administration: a new recession that would bring both short- and long-term rates and inflation lower. Move Seen Well Considered
Analysts who do not support what the Treasury did on Wednesday -- which included a 40 percent reduction in the annual issuance of 30-year bonds; a shift to two, instead of four, 30-year auctions a year, and the elimination of the seven-year note -- do agree that the move was well considered. They say it was not just an all-out effort to cut borrowing costs and push interest rates lower by eliminating long-term borrowing. If this were the case, the Treasury could have eliminated the 30-year bond auction scheduled for next week and reduced the level of 10-year note borrowing.
"Given that they had made the bad decision to shorten the maturity of the debt, they went about it in a quite reasonable way." said Louis Crandall, the chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates. Treasury Market
Treasury prices were mixed yesterday as traders and investors awaited the Labor Department report on April employment, which is to be released this morning.
In the last 16 months, the price of the 30-year bond has rallied and the yield has fallen eight times in the week ahead of the employment report. This week became the ninth time as the yield on the long bond fell to 6.80 percent, from 6.92 percent last Friday.
Forecasters are expecting a moderate increase in nonfarm payroll jobs in the range of 157,000, according to Bloomberg Business News. But what is more important is the impression about the strength of the economy that the report leaves with traders and investors. A feeling that the economy has bounced back from the weather-related slowdown in March would make it harder for yields to break out of their current trading range and move to new lows.
In secondary trading, the price of the 30-year bond was down 6/32 as the yield rose to 6.80 percent, from 6.78 percent Wednesday, which leaves the bond little changed since the debt announcement. The price of the seven- year note fell 5/32 , to yield 5.51 percent. But despite the shift to shorter-term borrowing, prices of two-and three-year notes were up marginally and the discount rates on Treasury bills fell.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has held absolute power in this impoverished Central African country for 26 years while amassing a personal fortune, today agreed to let an opposition leader form a new coalition government that could mark the end of his autocratic reign.
President Mobutu's agreement to share power was first announced Saturday night and confirmed when a deadlock in negotiations over the choice of a new prime minister was broken today.
The accord followed a week of looting and violence touched off by mutinous soldiers angered because they had not been paid. Discontent had been rising for months, however, as the country reeled from a severe economic crisis and as opposition leaders pressed to have Zaire join the democratic trend sweeping much of Africa. Mobutu to Keep Title
After 10 hours of talks today with opposition leaders, President Mobutu agreed to allow Etienne Tshisekedi, his fiercest adversary since 1980, to become Prime Minister and form what is being called a crisis government. Under this arrangement, General Mobutu would remain head of state with as-yet undefined but apparently diminished powers.
Five Mobutu loyalists would have posts in an 11-member coalition government under the accord, with the remaining posts going to the opposition.
The two sides are to meet again Monday for the third successive day to try to agree on Cabinet posts. Despite hope stirred by the developments, there appeared to be a strong prospect of further political chaos . Delegates to a democracy conference gathered outside the talks at Kinshasa's marble palace and vowed to kill any opposition leaders who allowed President Mobutu to remain in Government even as a figurehead.
The protesters blocked the entrance to the center where the talks were held and then swarmed around President Mobutu as he arrived. They shouted "dictator" and "thief" when he ventured into the crowd, wearing his trademark leopard-skin hat, and tried to explain the reasons for forming the coalition. Inside, the delegates did their best to ignore the turbulence, dining on smoked salmon and drinking Champagne for lunch.
The delegates were angered at being left out of the talks. They said the national conference, whose 3,000 delegates are scheduled to reconvene Tuesday in a continuing effort to chart a path to democracy, should instead manage the transition. Talks Began Seven Weeks Ago
The current political negotiating process started seven weeks ago, but because of a dispute over the selection of delegates, it bogged down. Opponents charged that President Mobutu filled the lists with his own supporters.
Only the major opposition parties are involved in talks on forming a new government. Many of the leaders of those parties have served under President Mobutu at one time but have since broken with him.
In an apparent effort to re-establish control over the military, President Mobutu announced the dismissal of his army Chief of Staff, Gen. Manzembe Mayibanga, and ordered a complete restructuring of the armed forces. The general was replaced by the current head of military intelligence, Gen. Mahele Liyeko, officials said.
Last Monday, about 3,000 Zairian paratroopers touched off widespread rioting and looting as they went on a rampage after the Government had failed to pay them for months. They closed Kinshasa's airport and Congo River port, looting stores and private housesmostly owned or rented by Zaire's wealthy expatriates.
As the pillaging and unrest spread, France and Belgium flew in hundreds of special troops to evacuate their citizens from the former Belgian colony.
The national radio station said today that 117 people had been killed and nearly 160 others injured in the wave of rioting that swept through this dilapidated city and elsewhere in the country. The streets were deserted at nightfall, with soldiers scattered along the roads enforcing a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Most stores and offices in the capital were shuttered, and the airport remained closed to commercial traffic. Figurehead Status Possible
Opposition figures and Western diplomats interviewed this weekend were reluctant to give a timetable for what many consider the inevitable downfall of President Mobutu. But several diplomats suggested that his fortunes had sunk so low that he might now be persuaded to remain in power as essentially a figurehead, presiding over a transitional government until elections are held.
"This is incredible -- Mobutu has committed political suicide," said Olivier Kasongo, an opposition leader who was among the hundreds who gathered this morning at the conference center where President Mobutu and opposition leaders held their talks.
A senior Western diplomat with extensive experience in Africa said: "It is not in our interest that Mobutu suddenly disappear. What may replace him is unclear, and meanwhile, the situation could prove chaotic."
Even if the differences between the President and the opposition can be bridged, it is not clear how the people of Zaire will react as they face an economic crisis of unprecedented proportions.
One sign of the continuing deterioration of the security situation here was the sudden and unexpected departure of the entire European staff of the Inter-Continental Hotel. Soon after the rioting began last week, troops from the presidential guard surrounded the hotel. Not long afterward, several hundred French, Belgian and other expatriates sought refuge there.
On Friday night, however, marauding soldiers from the presidential guard reportedly moved to the tree-lined streets near the hotel, using rifles or pistols to shoot out padlocks and smash down doors. Apparently fearing that the attacks might spread to the hotel, the foreign staff fled this afternoon.
In all of sub-Saharan Africa, Zaire has one of the worst reputations for official corruption and economic mismanagement. According to African and Western diplomats, as well as numerous scholars on Zaire, President Mobutu has used his position to make himself one of the world's richest men. Critics estimate his personal fortune at $4 billion.
Even his harshest critics, however, give him high marks for having woven together a nation out of nearly 250 often-feuding ethnic groups. He has achieved this through a mix of political acumen, personal appeal and strong-arm tactics. Economic Policy Faulted
But his economic leadership is held in far lower regard. In early 1990, the Government abandoned an economomic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund. At the same time, Government spending ballooned. The resulting budget deficit helped push annual inflation in Zaire to an estimated 900 percent to 1,000 percent, its highest level since 1960, the year of independence from Belgium.
Meanwhile, because of deficit spending and a sharp decrease in the availability of foreign exchange, the national currency, the zaire, has depreciated rapidly against the American dollar. In January 1990, the zairecq traded at about 300 to the dollar; the official exchange rate is now about 19,000 to the dollar.
Workers typically earn in a month the money needed to survive just one week, and many have second jobs. Many Zairians complain that they have no money to buy anything, and if they did, there is little in stores to buy.
When confronted with accusations of corruption and mismanagement, the 60-year-old leader has insisted that he is a victim of disinformation. He has also blamed external factors like weak commodity prices for the growing civil strife and the country's sharply deteriorating standard of living. Hundreds of Millions From U.S.
President Mobutu's Government has received hundreds of millions of dollars from the United States since he seized power in a 1965 military coup. The Central Intelligence Agency is said to haveworked closely with President Mobutu for years. Historians have written that American officials knew about, and some say even helped, his successful coup. The takeover followed five years of bitter factional fighting in the country among Marxists with Soviet ties, pro-Western moderate reformers, and a neo-colonial leadership in what was then Katanga province, in the nation's south.
In particular, Zaire's role as a conduit for arms for United States-backed rebels in Angola led by Jonas Savimbi virtually assured continuing support for the Mobutu leadership. At the same time, President Mobutu has maintained strong ties with Belgium while developing relations with France and South Africa.
But amid allegations of a massacre of 12 university students by security forces in May 1990, and possibly several times that number, the United States Congress voted in December to cut all military and economic aid to Zaire.
If President Mobutu should leave the political scene, the leading candidates to fill the vacuum are thought to be Mr. Tshisekedi, the head of the largest opposition group, the Union for Democracy and Social Process, and a former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Nguza Karl-i-Bond. Both have been accused at various times of having been co-opted by President Mobutu; however, Mr. Nguza has also felt the President's wrath, serving years in prison when he fell from official grace.
In 1967, Mr. Tshisekedi was instrumental in writing a document that helped set up President Mobutu's one-party state, but in 1981, he was one of 13 members of Parliament who broke with the leader. They signed a letter accusing the Goverment of corruption, human rights abuses and the stifling of democracy.
Mr. Nguza has also had a checkered career. In the late 1970's after serving as prime minister, he became one of President Mobutu's severest critics and in 1980 was sentenced to death for treason. The sentence was later reduced to a long prison term. Mr. Nguza later testified before a United States Congressional committee investigating reports that President Mobutu had embezzled aid funds from the United States.
Nonetheless, in 1986 President Mobutu sent Mr. Nguza to Washington as Zaire's Ambassador to the United States.

Abstract: "We are back to the fastest-growing economy in the region," said Andres Sosa Pietri, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., the national oil company. "We lagged in the '80s, but now we are back on our feet." Michael Skol, the United States Ambassador here, predicted, "Venezuela is likely to have a sustained economic boom in the 1990's, with growth rates higher than Chile's." Venezuela ships two-thirds of its daily exports of 1.9 million barrels to the United States. With oil production plummeting in the Soviet Union and political uncertainty gripping the Middle East, Venezuela likes to portray itself as a "safe source." To meet growing demand from the United States, the oil company plans to increase production capacity by 20 percent, to 3.5 million barrels a day, by 1996.

Full text: Special to The New York Times
After a hiccup caused by low oil prices and a shift to free-market policies, Venezuela has reclaimed its position as the nation in the Americas with the highest economic growth rates.
The gross national product, which grew 5 percent in 1990, expanded by an annualized rate of 10 percent during the first half of this year, according to figures released here in late August.
Memories are now fading of 1989, the rough first year of President Carlos Andres Perez. That year, the economy shrank by 8 percent and a reduction of food and gas subsidies set off riots that killed 300 people.
"We are back to the fastest-growing economy in the region," said Andres Sosa Pietri, president of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., the national oil company. "We lagged in the '80s, but now we are back on our feet."
Michael Skol, the United States Ambassador here, predicted, "Venezuela is likely to have a sustained economic boom in the 1990's, with growth rates higher than Chile's."
Although annual inflation continues to hover around 37 percent, optimism is growing. American, European and Venezuelan companies are embarking on multibillion-dollar "megaprojects" involving Venezuela's highly profitable oil and minerals.
And President Perez's determined commitment to free-market policies appears to be bearing fruit, as trade tariffs drop, investment rules ease and the Government starts to sell money-losing state companies to investors.
In early August, the Government accepted a $145 million bid by a consortium led by Iberia, the Spanish airline, to buy a 60 percent stake in the state-owned international airline, Viasa. In October, private companies are to bid for the state telephone company, whose inefficiency has long hampered the economy.
During a visit to New York and Washington scheduled for late September, Mr. Perez plans to discuss with United States officials a timetable for establishing a free-trade agreement. Since taking office in February 1989, Mr. Perez has reduced import tariffs to 10 percent, on average, from 34 percent. In April, Venezuela signed a framework agreement with the United States for trade and investment liberalization.
Leading a Congressional delegation to Caracas in late August, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, said Mr. Perez had shown "great leadership in opening markets and in helping to develop trade between our two great countries." A 'Safe Source' of Oil
Accounting for about half the growth forecast through 1996 is a five-year, $48 billion expansion program by the national oil company.
Venezuela ships two-thirds of its daily exports of 1.9 million barrels to the United States. With oil production plummeting in the Soviet Union and political uncertainty gripping the Middle East, Venezuela likes to portray itself as a "safe source." To meet growing demand from the United States, the oil company plans to increase production capacity by 20 percent, to 3.5 million barrels a day, by 1996.
Foreign companies are entering new areas of the petroelum industry. In November, about 20 American and foreign companies are expected to submit bids to reactivate marginal fields that have been abandoned in eastern Venezuela. Total predicted production of these fields is expected to be 150,000 barrels a day. Natural Gas Project
In another project, Government approval is expected later this year for a $3 billion natural gas processing plant to be built with multinational control. Called Cristobal Colon, the project involves Mitsubishi, Shell Oil and Exxon.
"It will be the first time since the nationalization of the oil industry in 1975 that foreigners will have majority equities," said Mr. Skol, the American Ambassador.
The national oil company is also negotiating with American and European companies on multibillion-dollar joint ventures to exploit Venezuela's vast coal and bitumen reserves.
After the privatization of only three banks in two and a half years, efforts to sell state companies appear to have accelerated with the sale of Viasa in August. Fondo de Inversiones de Venezuela, a state agency charged with privatization, is accepting bids for a number of state companies -- a shipyard, a cement company, four hotels and several sugar mills.
But the most keenly awaited sale is that of the telephone company.
With half of Venezuela's demand for three million lines going unmet, it takes eight years to get a telephone installed. Some offices employ secretaries simply to dial and redial numbers. One United States company, Procter & Gamble, gave up and installed a $150,000 private microwave system after moving here in 1987, and other companies have shied away from Venezuela because of weak telecommunications.
"There are a lot of projects in tourism, trade and industry asking for services we can't offer," said Fernando Martinez Mottola, president of the phone company, Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela. Winning a $98 Million Bid
In a first step to privatize telephone service, a consortium led by BellSouth Enterprises and Racal Telecom submitted a winning $98 million bid in May to provide 20 years of cellular telephone service.
In October, eight international consortiums are to bid on buying the phone company, which has 20,000 employees, a $600 million debt and enormous growth prospects.
According to the tender, the buyer will have to install an average of 300,000 lines a year over the next five years, and by the end of the 1990's, the wait for a new phone must be no more than a week.

Held in check by the sharpest drop in grocery costs in nearly four decades, consumer prices rose just two-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported today.
The slight rise helped to hold the 1991 inflation rate so far to 2.7 percent, less than half last year's pace of 6.1 percent.
The small, seasonally adjusted rise in the Consumer Price Index was viewed as both a symptom of the recession and a necessary ingredient of a sustained recovery. It followed an identical rise in June.
The financial markets, which expected good news on inflation, were encouraged, and bond prices soared to levels not seen since early February. [ Page D17. ] The Dow Jones industrial average rose sharply early in the day when the data came out, although it fell back later to close 3.35 points down. [ Page D10. ] 1.2% Drop in Grocery Prices
The July data largely reflected a 1.2 percent drop in grocery prices, the largest one-month decline since 1953. The grocery numbers included a 12.7 percent drop in prices for fresh vegetables as crops rebounded from earlier weather problems.
In addition, energy prices fell for the seventh time in eight months.
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy items -- considered a good measure of core inflation -- rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the same rate as in June.
A senior Bush Administration official said subdued inflation would revive consumer spending and lower interest rates, but some private forecasters warn that the economy could suffer a relapse.
"Inflation prospects are terrific," said Robert Brusca, an economist at Nikko Securities Company International Inc. But he added, "We do not have a recovery in the bag."
Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher said: "Very low inflation is a welcome development for consumer purchasing power. This news creates the right environment for possible additional reductions in market interest rates." Fed Would Have Leeway
Dampened inflation gives policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who are scheduled to meet privately Tuesday, leeway to stimulate economic growth with lower interest rates if necessary, economists said. The last move by the Fed to push short-term interest rates down came Aug. 6, with a quarter of a percentage point cut in the Federal Funds rate.
Despite subdued price rises, the Labor Department also said today that Americans' purchasing power -- as measured by inflation-adjusted average weekly earnings -- slipped 1.4 percent in July after rising nine-tenths of 1 percent in June. The drop came from a large decrease in average hours worked and a slight dip in average hourly earnings.
In another report, the Commerce Department said business sales in June rose a weak two-tenths of 1 percent. Businesses still managed to shrink their inventories by three-tenths of 1 percent. That should pave the way for new orders, increased production and job gains when consumer demand strengthens.
Two private surveys showed business executives were not becoming more optimistic about the economy.
The United States Chamber of Commerce said only 40 percent of 7,057 businesses surveyed in August believed the economy is headed up, compared with 46 percent in June. Optimism Index Slips
The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents smaller businesses, said its optimism index slipped to 100 in July from 101 three months earlier.
The July inflation report reflected improving fruit and vegetable crops following severe weather earlier in the year. The price of both lettuce and tomatoes fell more than 20 percent for the month.
The various changes left the Consumer Price Index, before adjusting for seasonal variations, at 136.2 in July, compared with 130.4 a year earlier. That means a market basket of goods and services costing $136.20 last month would have cost $130.40 in July 1990.

Abstract: California's drought and recent freeze notwithstanding, food prices are also moderating. Prices had been climbing at close to a 6 percent rate for the last two years, faster than inflation. Now the Department of Agriculture's official forecast calls for advances of 2 to 5 percent, with the department's chief forecaster, Ralph Parlett, saying that "awful things would have to happen to hit the upper forecast range." Though the Fed has been loosening gradually since the spring of 1989 and more aggressively this winter, money growth on average has been far lower in the last four years than in the first half of the 80's. In particular, the Federal Reserve did not react to last summer's oil price shock by flooding the economy with money. "That was a very important decision," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp. "Very few companies were able to pass on the rise in energy costs."

Full text: From the Revolution to Vietnam, virtually every American war has sparked a round of inflation. But the Persian Gulf war looks as if it will be an exception. A barrage of signals -- including cheaper oil and raw materials, softer prices at factories, swelling cattle herds and shrinking bonuses for sales workers -- suggests that inflation may retreat.
The drop could be striking, and price increases could well stay low for years. The most compelling reason for thinking so is the Federal Reserve's four-year spell of stinginess in pumping cash and credit into the economy. Since 1987, the money supply has grown, on average, at just half the rate of the early 80's.
"We've built the foundation for lower inflation," said W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, noting that the Federal Reserve Board and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, have been committed to nudging inflation down by gradually reducing money growth. Economy Would Gain
If inflation stays low, the economy would benefit. The United States would fall closer in line with such rich and powerful nations as Germany and Japan, whose inflation rates have averaged half of the United States rate, or less, in the last decade. And long-term interest rates could edge down as investors' fears of future inflation eased.
What is more, future recessions would probably be milder than the harsh downturns that ruptured the high-inflation years. One reason that most economists expect the current recession to be shorter and shallower is that inflation has not raced out of control.
Many forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, expect consumer price inflation to average 3 to 4 percent this year, compared with an annual rate of almost 7 percent in the second half of 1990. For the next few months, the rate could hover around 2 percent, forecasters at DRI/McGraw-Hill said, as the lower cost of a barrel of crude oil works its way into a broad spectrum of consumer prices. Last fall, spot oil prices shot toward $40 a barrel; now, oil is trading at about $18 a barrel.
That would give consumer buying power a welcome boost and help stabilize spending. "It's like a $16 billion personal tax cut and is worth $170 per household," said Roger E. Brinner, the chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
Among the reasons the Persian Gulf War seems not to have been inflationary are that it lasted only 42 days, quickly contained the threat to oil supplies, was financed in part by American allies and was fought with armstaken from inventory. Ordinarily, military spending overheats the economy as production surges to supply the war effort, leaving fewer goods available for civilian consumption. As a result prices rise. More Room for the Fed
The lower oil prices now give the Federal Reserve more room to fight the recession. "Because a lessening of cost pressures has improved the outlook for prices, the easing of policy has been possible without raising new concerns in the financial markets about inflation prospects." Mr. Greenspan testified before Congress on Wednesday. And on Friday, the Federal Reserve once again pushed down interest rates.
This low-inflation scenario could stumble if, for example, oil prices took off again, the dollar suddenly plunged, or state and local governments jacked up taxes sky high in an attempt to solve their budget problems. But the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report, issued on Feb. 20, alludes to the "downward tilt of the underlying inflation trend." That view is shared by Administration and Congressional economists, as well as many private forecasters.
There has already been a basic improvement in price trends -- as any driver who has recently pulled up to a gasoline pump can attest -- but it has been largely obscured in official inflation measures because of a rash of one-time events and statistical flukes. One-Time Hits
To take just one example: Higher Federal excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes will probably exaggerate this winter's inflation rate by more than one-third, John F. Peterson, an economist at the Congressional Budget Office, estimated. Other special factors were the 17 percent postal rate increase that went into effect last month and the second installment of the minimum wage increase. These onetime hits should be absorbed in a month or two.
Four forces are helping to beat down inflation, most economists agree: weaker commodity prices, especially for energy and food, which together account for about one-fifth of consumer spending; the recession, preceded by a year and a half of extremely sluggish economic growth; slackening wage gains, and, finally, signs that productivity outside manufacturing is holding up better than expected during the downturn. A major factor in each, most analysts say, is the Federal Reserve's monetary restraint in recent years.
The immediate source of relief is, of course, cheaper crude oil. At around $18, oil prices are back where they were in the first half of 1990. They should bobble around $20 in this year's second half, down from $24.40 in the comparable period last year, said Adam E. Sieminski, an economist at the Washington Analysis Group.
Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, commented, "Indirectly, that's slowing prices charged by metals and paper manufacturers, on the one hand, and airlines and hotels on the other."
And David D. Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, said, "The prices of key industrial commodities are falling because the world economy is much weaker now."
California's drought and recent freeze notwithstanding, food prices are also moderating. Prices had been climbing at close to a 6 percent rate for the last two years, faster than inflation. Now the Department of Agriculture's official forecast calls for advances of 2 to 5 percent, with the department's chief forecaster, Ralph Parlett, saying that "awful things would have to happen to hit the upper forecast range."
Though the Fed has been loosening gradually since the spring of 1989 and more aggressively this winter, money growth on average has been far lower in the last four years than in the first half of the 80's. In particular, the Federal Reserve did not react to last summer's oil price shock by flooding the economy with money. "That was a very important decision," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp. "Very few companies were able to pass on the rise in energy costs." Sluggish Growth
The consequence of monetary restraint was sluggish growth even before Saddam Hussein toppled the economy into recession. "Spare capacity in factories and looser labor markets make it harder for business and workers to push for price and wage gains," Mr. Rippe of Dean Witter Reynolds said.
As a consequence, compensation costs are moderating. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' employment cost index rose 4.6 percent in December from a year earlier, down from an increase of 5.2 percent in June. Slow growth and recession pushed unemployment up to 6.5 percent in February from its low of 5.3 percent last June. As long as unemployment stays above what is considered full employment -- which most economists put at 5.5 to 6 percent -- employment costs should keep moderating.
The trend is especially evident among service companies that are squeezing some of their highest-paid help, salespeople, real estate agents and stockbrokers. "The upscale labor market is flabbier than it's ever been," said Stephen Strongin of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Basic Change Seen
Smaller raises may reflect a fundamental change in the job market, suggested Daniel J. B. Mitchell, a professor of management at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Workers are less cushioned from market forces by union contracts or paternalistic employers; union membership is down to 12 percent of private, non-government workers. While small-business payrolls swelled by 15 million during the 80's, Fortune 500 companies shed 2 million jobs. In deciding how much to raise pay last year, Mr. Mitchell said, "employers looked to conditions in the labor market, not to some notion of protecting workers' purchasing power."
But permanent progress on the inflation front ultimately depends on faster productivity growth, almost everyone agrees. "The only way to have strong growth without inflation is to increase productivity faster," said Mr. Hale of Kemper Financial Services. Otherwise, he said, low inflation comes at the cost of stagnating living standards.
There has been an early sign that the productivity trend might be improving. Productivity rose slightly in the recession's first quarter, instead of declining along with output as it usually does at the start of a downturn. At the beginning of the 1981-82 slump, by contrast, productivity plunged at a 5.5 percent annual rate. Since companies laid off workers a lot sooner in the current slump, some economists say, once output picks up in a recovery, productivity gains could be sizable.

FEDERAL RESERVE SAID TO RULE OUT A RATE SHIFT NOW

Abstract: ''It is fairly well accepted that monetary policy, reacting to supply shocks, is not appropriate,'' a Federal Reserve official said. The rise in bond rates reflected in part a concern on Wall Street that the Middle East crisis might cause the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in an effort to avoid a recession. In the Wall Street view, rather than warding off a recession, such action by the Federal Reserve might fuel inflation. ''People perceive that the Fed might be ready to cave in on interest rates, so the Fed has to maintain them longer than it might otherwise have wanted to do,'' said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in San Francisco. Some said that if the price of crude oil was to stabilize at about $26 a barrel - it fell in trading today to about $31 a barrel - that would be a $25 billion to $50 billion ''tax'' on consumption. Economic growth would slow a bit, in this view, but not to the point of a national recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the gross national product.

Full text: LEAD: The Federal Reserve apparently decided at a policy meeting this week to make no changes in interest rates until the Middle East crisis quieted down and a clearer picture emerged of its effect on the economy.
The Federal Reserve apparently decided at a policy meeting this week to make no changes in interest rates until the Middle East crisis quieted down and a clearer picture emerged of its effect on the economy.
Such a decision suggests that the Federal Reserve, for the time being, remains more concerned about controlling inflation than quickly trying to offset any potential recessionary effect of the Middle East crisis.
Perhaps more important, some officials said that if oil prices, after the crisis, were to settle at, say, $8 a barrel above their pre-crisis levels, or at about $26 a barrel, then the long-term effect on the economy would be minimal - perhaps shaving one-quarter or one-half a percentage point off economic growth.
Growth Rate Is Weak

The Commerce Department reported today that growth in the second quarter was at an anemic annual rate of 1.2 percent, after an also-weak 1.7 percent in the first quarter. That means the gross national product has grown at an annual rate of 1.5 percent so far this year. [Page 31.] The minutes of the closed-door meeting in Washington on Tuesday will not be released for six weeks. But some Federal Reserve officials, here for a conference, indicated in off-the-record conversations that a change in policy when no one knows what might happen in the Middle East could inject new uncertainty into the jittery bond and stock markets.
Annual Two-Day Event

The gathering here in Grand Teton National Park, at a lodge deep in the mountains and woods, is an annual two-day event that brings together Federal Reserve officials and economists from universities and from Wall Street.
The aim is to socialize, to exchange views and to attend five hours of conference sessions each morning, leaving the afternoons free for white-water rafting and hiking. The conference sessions today and Saturday center on controlling inflation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe; a half-dozen central bank presidents and finance ministers from these countries traveled here to participate.
But the Middle East was clearly a distraction for the Federal Reserve delegation, led by Alan Greenspan, the chairman. There was much coffee-break talk about the latest reports from Wall Street and the Persian Gulf. And some Fed officials suggested that as long as the crisis continued and future oil supplies were uncertain, there was nothing that the Federal Reserve could or should do.
''It is fairly well accepted that monetary policy, reacting to supply shocks, is not appropriate,'' a Federal Reserve official said.
Largely as a result of war fears and oil-supply disruptions, the Dow Jones industrial average has lost nearly 13 percent of its value since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and long-term bond yields have climbed more than half a percentage point.
Regularly Scheduled Meeting

The Tuesday policy meeting in Washington was one that is held every six weeks. The presidents of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks gathered in the capital with Mr. Greenspan and the five Federal Reserve governors to review the state of the economy and decide whether to use their power to lower interest rates, thus stimulating buying and investing, or push up rates and thus reduce the odds of a higher inflation rate.
The Federal Reserve has been slowly pushing down interest rates for nearly a year, out of concern that the economy was weakening. The last drop came on July 13. Although Mr. Greenspan has not commented on the economy since Iraq invaded Kuwait, he maintained until then that while the economy was weak, the odds of a recession were low.
A day after the Washington meeting this week, Mr. Greenspan and two Federal Reserve governors, Wayne D. Angell and Edward W. Kelley Jr., traveled to Jackson Hole and were joined by 6 of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve regional banks.
Two Unwelcome Developments

In informal interviews, several Federal Reserve officials said the Iraq crisis had brought on two developments that the central bank had hoped to avoid. One was a fall in the value of the dollar, a potentially inflationary development because it makes imports more expensive. The other was the sharp rise in interest rates for long-term Government bonds to offset any erosion in the value of bonds from future inflation.
The rise in bond rates reflected in part a concern on Wall Street that the Middle East crisis might cause the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in an effort to avoid a recession. In the Wall Street view, rather than warding off a recession, such action by the Federal Reserve might fuel inflation. ''People perceive that the Fed might be ready to cave in on interest rates, so the Fed has to maintain them longer than it might otherwise have wanted to do,'' said Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in San Francisco.
Decisions Not Disclosed

None of the five or six officials who discussed informally the Middle East crisis and the American economy would disclose specific decisions made at the Tuesday meeting. But they said the nation would not know for a month or more what might happen in the Middle East: whether war would break out; whether oil shipments would be further disrupted, or how high oil prices might rise. In such an uncertain situation, the officials said, adjusting interest rate policy would be inappropriate.
But some said that if the price of crude oil was to stabilize at about $26 a barrel - it fell in trading today to about $31 a barrel - that would be a $25 billion to $50 billion ''tax'' on consumption. Economic growth would slow a bit, in this view, but not to the point of a national recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the gross national product.

Abstract: Members agreed that ''current information on business conditions pointed on balance to relatively moderate but sustained economic expansion.'' At the same time, the members ''generally agreed that the prospects for significant reductions in inflation pressures during the quarters immediately ahead were not promising.'' W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a prominent advocate of a tough anti-inflation policy, voted against the directive. He argued for a tighter credit policy ''to help assure that progress would be made toward a reduced rate of inflation.'' Mr. Hoskins said tighter credit would ''enhance the credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy in countering the persisting strength of inflationary pressures,'' according to the minutes.

Full text: LEAD: Federal Reserve policy makers concluded at their May meeting that inflation posed too great a danger to allow interest rates to decline, minutes of the meeting released today show.
Federal Reserve policy makers concluded at their May meeting that inflation posed too great a danger to allow interest rates to decline, minutes of the meeting released today show.
The eight-week-old records were made available amid signs that the policy makers had decided at their most recent gathering on Monday and Tuesday to stand ready to shift their policy and nudge interest rates lower if the economy weakened further.
Unidentified Government officials outside the Fed were quoted in published reports today as saying they believed the directive adopted earlier this week allowed a relaxation of the tight credit policy if additional signs of economic sluggishness emerged.
Analysts were split over whether the June employment report released today by the Labor Department provided such evidence. The unemployment rate slipped to 5.2 percent, from 5.3 percent, but non-farm job growth was a weaker-than-expected 40,000.
In May, members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted by 10 to 1 to maintain the existing credit policy and directed central bank officials to be equally ready to raise or lower rates, depending on developments on inflation and economic growth.
Members agreed that ''current information on business conditions pointed on balance to relatively moderate but sustained economic expansion.'' At the same time, the members ''generally agreed that the prospects for significant reductions in inflation pressures during the quarters immediately ahead were not promising.''
W. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a prominent advocate of a tough anti-inflation policy, voted against the directive. He argued for a tighter credit policy ''to help assure that progress would be made toward a reduced rate of inflation.''
Mr. Hoskins said tighter credit would ''enhance the credibility and effectiveness of monetary policy in countering the persisting strength of inflationary pressures,'' according to the minutes.
Other members, who were not identified, went along with the directive but said that ''the need to contain and ultimately to reduce inflation might well require a firming of policy at some point.''
The Federal Reserve has been fighting inflation with higher interest rates since early 1988. In mid-1989 it began nudging rates down amid concern that the economy might topple into a recession. However, since late December, the Fed has held steady. The Federal funds rate, the interest charged among banks for overnight loans, has hovered around 8.25 percent since then.
The open market committee, which is made up of the seven Fed governors and five of the system's 12 regional bank presidents, meets in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy. Minutes are released about six to eight weeks later, a few days after the next meeting. There was one vacancy among the governors at the time of the May meeting.

Abstract: In ''Rostenkowski Plan: A G.O.P.

To the Editor:
In ''Rostenkowski Plan: A G.O.P. Triumph'' (Op-Ed, March 15), Paul Craig Roberts again rejects sound economic science with his denial that budget deficits affect interest rates -specifically, in denying that balancing the United States budget would reduce interest rates.
In rebuttal to this virtually self-evident thesis, he asks: ''Why do West Germany, with its trade surplus, and Britain, with its budget surplus,'' have higher interest rates than the United States?
The simple answer is that interest-rate determinants are complex. Real inflation in Britain and feared inflation in inflation-phobic West Germany explain their higher interest rates. Since each national economy carries its own economic configurations, the scientific question is this: What happens, other factors assumed equal, to Britain's, or Germany's or America's, interest rates when budget deficits rise?
Economic logic decrees that, in strict accordance with the law of supply and demand, interest rates rise when budget deficits rise. This virtually axiomatic truth can be demonstrated by linear regression analyses of United States interest rates. Such analyses show definite correlations between mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, Treasury bond rates and Federal budget deficits.
Mr. Roberts tacitly recognizes the critical role of the law of supply and demand when he warns that ''raising taxes could put the economy in the tank.'' Why? Because the consequently reduced income could reduce demand for goods and services.
The same law operates in the money markets. When borrowers compete for a budget-reduced pool of lendable dollars, the price of money - i.e., the interest rate - tends to rise. Significantly, this basic economic truth is rejected only by the Reagan Administration's supply-side ideologues.

Abstract: The battle between Harold C. Simmons and Lockheed could be one that both sides lose. The Lockheed Corporation claimed victory on Tuesday in a proxy fight with Mr. Simmons for control of the company and its board. But Mr. Simmons won several shareholder rights measures, one calling for the abolition of a ''poison pill'' defense against a takeover and another for voluntary exemption from Delaware's anti-takeover laws. Mr. Simmons, who owns nearly 10 percent of Lockheed's shares, says he will continue pressing the company to improve shareholder value. But some analysts believe that Lockheed's value is more likely to go down. ''They're looking at a defense budget that's going to decline precipitously over the next three or four years,'' said Michael Rosen, an aeronautics analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Major programs in the aeronautical systems division are winding down.'' Whatever the company's fate, Mr. Simmons has had enough success in budging an obstinate board to encourage others to wage proxy fights for control of major companies. Men in a shadowy, smoke-filled room are plotting to woo new smokers to replace those who quit or die. They cackle with laughter as one of them says, ''Gentlemen, we're not in this for our health.'' The scene is from a paid television commercial in a new anti-smoking campaign that California launched on Tuesday. The state will spend $26.8 million over the next 18 months, much of it to show tart, pointed advertisements during prime time. Gone are the sober public-service announcements that aired at odd hours to an audience of insomniacs and night watchmen. ''The objective is to change the image that the tobacco industry has created for smokers,'' said Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the California Department of Health Services.

COMPANIES

Soda for Ships

Now this is a floating exchange rate. American Pepsi for Soviet ships. In a $3 billion deal - the largest ever between an American company and the Soviet Union - Pepsico will vastly expand its sales there in return for a flood of Stolichnaya vodka and a fleet of freighters and tankers.

COMPANIES

Soda for Ships

Now this is a floating exchange rate. American Pepsi for Soviet ships. In a $3 billion deal - the largest ever between an American company and the Soviet Union - Pepsico will vastly expand its sales there in return for a flood of Stolichnaya vodka and a fleet of freighters and tankers. Since the ruble cannot be converted into Western currencies, companies operating in the Soviet Union have to look for other ways to take out their profits. Pepsico has been a leader in penetrating Soviet markets. Donald M. Kendall, the chairman of the company's executive committee, is ''Mr. U.S.-Soviet trade,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Now other Western companies will be watching to see how much Pepsi can profit from perestroika.

From Low-Tech to High-Tech

In Japan, even low-technology companies are going high-tech. The Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Company has closed its last coal mine, while the Mitsubishi Metal Corporation has closed its last Japanese mine of any sort. The two announced on Wednesday that they would merge to concentrate on developing sophisticated new materials for industries like computers and electronics. The new company will have annual sales of $5.7 billion. Impressive, but not enough to make the new company more than a supporting actor within the powerful Mitsubishi Group of allied companies. Annual sales for Mitsubishi Electric Corporation alone are more than $19 billion.

Buying Safer Tankers

The American Petroleum Institute questions whether two hulls make an oil tanker less prone to oil spills than one. The issue needs more study, the trade group says. But Conoco Inc. has already reached its own conclusion. On Tuesday, the company, a subsidiary of Du Pont, broke with the industry by announcing an order for two new tankers with the extra hulls. ''We realize that double-hulled tankers are not the total solution, but they do offer an increased margin of protection against oil spills,'' said Constantine S. Nicandros, Conoco's president. ARCO appears to favor the double hulls as well. The extra protection raises the cost of a ship by 5 to 15 percent. A Coast Guard study cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council said that if the Exxon Valdez tanker had a double hull, it would have spilled 15 to 60 percent less oil onto Alaska's shores and seas last year. Congress is considering legislation to make double hulls mandatory.

Lockheed Wins - And Loses

The battle between Harold C. Simmons and Lockheed could be one that both sides lose. The Lockheed Corporation claimed victory on Tuesday in a proxy fight with Mr. Simmons for control of the company and its board. But Mr. Simmons won several shareholder rights measures, one calling for the abolition of a ''poison pill'' defense against a takeover and another for voluntary exemption from Delaware's anti-takeover laws. Mr. Simmons, who owns nearly 10 percent of Lockheed's shares, says he will continue pressing the company to improve shareholder value. But some analysts believe that Lockheed's value is more likely to go down. ''They're looking at a defense budget that's going to decline precipitously over the next three or four years,'' said Michael Rosen, an aeronautics analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''Major programs in the aeronautical systems division are winding down.'' Whatever the company's fate, Mr. Simmons has had enough success in budging an obstinate board to encourage others to wage proxy fights for control of major companies.

M.C.I.'s Growth Spurt

The MCI Communications Corporation plans to pick up another 1.4 percent of the long-distance telephone market - through an expensive acquisition rather than discounted service. MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance telephone company, announced an agreement on Monday to buy Telecom USA Inc., the fourth largest, for $1.25 billion. Analysts lauded the deal, saying it would combine MCI's residential and big-business customers with Telecom's medium-size accounts in medium-size cities. But the new company, with more than 13 percent of the long-distance market, would still be dwarfed by A.T.& T., with 71 percent. The deal is subject to review by the Justice Department.

Clearing the Air

Men in a shadowy, smoke-filled room are plotting to woo new smokers to replace those who quit or die. They cackle with laughter as one of them says, ''Gentlemen, we're not in this for our health.'' The scene is from a paid television commercial in a new anti-smoking campaign that California launched on Tuesday. The state will spend $26.8 million over the next 18 months, much of it to show tart, pointed advertisements during prime time. Gone are the sober public-service announcements that aired at odd hours to an audience of insomniacs and night watchmen. ''The objective is to change the image that the tobacco industry has created for smokers,'' said Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the California Department of Health Services.

Boeing's Japan Connection

The Boeing Company plans to rely on three Japanese corporations for major components needed to develop a new commercial jet, the 300-seat 767-X. Boeing abandoned earlier plans for giving the companies equity in the project, which raised fears about whether the Japanese would gain enough expertise in aerospace to challenge American manufacturers.

CBS Bets on Sports

CBS Inc. found that betting on sports can pay off. First-quarter earnings, reported on Wednesday, rose 52 percent from the year before to $85.3 million. CBS profited by adding the Super Bowl and two games from the NCAA basketball semifinals to its first-quarter schedule. But its prime-time ratings continue to disappoint. And it paid so much for sporting events later this year that analysts predict weak earnings - unless the World Series involves a couple big-city teams that battle to six or seven games.

ECONOMY

Incompetence or Greed?

Last week's savings and loan horror story: William S. Sessions, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said on Wednesday that the institutions seized by the Government are shot through with fraud. His said his agency will have to spend years hiring and training investigators familiar with accounting, banking, real estate, energy and white-collar shenanigans; sorting through truckloads of documents, and then proving to juries that savings and loan executives lost billions not through incompetence alone, but also through thievery. The incompetence argument is strong, judging from the billions these units sank into ''junk bonds'' and even junkier real estate. The horror story from the week before, remember, was the General Accounting Office's estimate that the bailout would cost $325 billion to $500 billion..

More Bond Defaults

The darkest forecasts of corporate bond defaults soon come to seem far too optimistic. The Bond Investors Association predicted in January that defaults would rise to a record $15 billion this year from $11.9 billion in 1989. But bond issues totaling $5.7 billion defaulted in the first quarter alone, the association reported. Leave out the $3.5 billion Campeau default, and the total would still be 64 percent ahead of last year. Richard Lehmann, the association's president, lists Western Union, Southland and Ames Department Stores among the companies most likely to default.

Explaining the Drop in Prices

Cheaper clothing, vegetables and gasoline helped drive wholesale prices down two-tenths of 1 percent in March. Economists -surprised by Friday's report of the first drop in seven months - were all but consulting the Old Farmer's Almanac for explanations. A warm winter, said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Georgia State University Economic Forecasting Center, meant ''tomatoes came on line more quickly than expected.'' The core rate of producer price inflation, excluding food and energy, rose three-tenths of 1 percent.

INTERNATIONAL

Investing in Japan Inc.

The Japanese keep spending on their corporations, if not on themselves. Last year, they invested $750 billion, about 24 percent of gross national product, in plants, equipment, and research and development. The United States spent $500 billion, or 10 percent of gross national product. Analysts say Japanese companies have enough cash to sustain investment despite higher interest rates and a falling stock market. American negotiators urge the Japanese to consume more. The response, from a recent book co-written by Akio Morita, the Sony chairman: ''We are focusing on business 10 years in advance, while you seem to be concerned only with profits 10 minutes from now. At that rate, you may well never be able to compete with us.''

Soviets Short on Cash

Can the Soviet Union pay for its grain? Shippers are complaining of late Soviet payments, which might amount to almost a half-billion dollars. Some grain dealers have stopped selling there on credit. Soviet payment problems extend to other areas; the Soviet Union reportedly defaulted on late charges for tankers waiting in the Black Sea to load Soviet oil. But Soviet oil exports appear to be holding up even if production and domestic consumption are off. Some economists say the trouble is less a lack of hard currency than bureaucratic confusion. But Thane Gustafson, a Soviet specialist for Cambridge Energy Research Associates, wonders whether the country is dealing with ''a succession of micro-crises, or the beginning of a macro-crisis.''

Americans in Brazil

American companies face losses from Brazil's economic turmoil. Johnson & Johnson announced a $125 million write-off on Wednesday; one reason is Brazil's radical new program to fight inflation, which its Congress approved on Wednesday. Measures imposed by President Fernando Collor de Mello have already pitched Brazil into a recession.

Abstract: ''Interest rates in one ocean bay are affected by rates in another bay,'' said Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science. ''But they don't mingle perfectly. There is considerable room for differences.'' There is such a worldwide pool of savings and it does move across borders, but not as easily as theory suggests and not in such single-minded response to the highest bidder, economists say. The problem is that the demand for loans is rarely as great as the worldwide supply of savings, so rates do not have to rise to compete for funds. ''Using the concept of funds flowing across borders to explain interest rate movements is a trap,'' said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. ''Rates can change in one country or another without any great demand for money.'' The second reason why interest rates go in different directions is the most important, involving a distinctly national phenomenon that money brokers everywhere refer to as their ''expectations'' about inflation. ''Right now, they expect the inflation rate to rise more in Japan and Germany than in the United States,'' said Nicholas Sargen, chief of bond research at Salomon Brothers.

Full text: LEAD: When interest rates go up in one major industrial country, must they also do so in others? The recent rise of West German, Japanese and American rates, in tandem, has given that impression. But plenty of room still exists for the United States to control its own interest rates, even going against the trend in other countries.
When interest rates go up in one major industrial country, must they also do so in others? The recent rise of West German, Japanese and American rates, in tandem, has given that impression. But plenty of room still exists for the United States to control its own interest rates, even going against the trend in other countries.
The United States, in fact, has been quietly going against the global grain for over a week. While people buying German and Japanese bonds have insisted upon somewhat higher interest rates in return for their money, those buying American securities have settled for rates that have remained essentially unchanged since late February.
''Interest rates in one ocean bay are affected by rates in another bay,'' said Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science. ''But they don't mingle perfectly. There is considerable room for differences.''
The differences stem from such distinctly national phenomena as whether investors consider a particular country a safe place to put their money and whether a nation's inflation rate is rising or falling.
These differences, however, did not show themselves in January, when German and Japanese interest rates suddenly rose and American rates went up with them. The phenomenon seemed to confirm the often-cited ''pool of money'' thesis, which holds that a worldwide pool of savings exists, one that moves easily across borders, seeking the highest rate of return, as measured by interest rates. The rates are offered to attract money for such things as financing the American budget deficit or the rebuilding of East Germany.
There is such a worldwide pool of savings and it does move across borders, but not as easily as theory suggests and not in such single-minded response to the highest bidder, economists say. The problem is that the demand for loans is rarely as great as the worldwide supply of savings, so rates do not have to rise to compete for funds. ''Using the concept of funds flowing across borders to explain interest rate movements is a trap,'' said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. ''Rates can change in one country or another without any great demand for money.''
Behind the Divergence

As if to demonstrate the point, American, German and Japanese rates have begun to decouple, marching once again largely to their own tunes. Economists cite two major reasons for the divergence.
One is safety or, more specifically, whether investors feel sure that money invested in one country's securities will not suddenly disappear or suffer an accident. Right now, concern is growing about the safety of money in Japan and Germany. Japanese stock prices have plunged in recent weeks, suggesting that the Tokyo stock exchange might be flirting with a crash. And investors are nervous about the economies in Eastern Europe.
In these uncertain situations, American securities are often thought of as a safe place to park money, even though Japanese and German interest rates keep rising, as they have in recent days to lure the money to Tokyo and Europe.
Inflation Concerns

The second reason why interest rates go in different directions is the most important, involving a distinctly national phenomenon that money brokers everywhere refer to as their ''expectations'' about inflation. ''Right now, they expect the inflation rate to rise more in Japan and Germany than in the United States,'' said Nicholas Sargen, chief of bond research at Salomon Brothers.
The mechanics are plain enough. When inflation seems to threaten in Germany, for example, an investor thinking of buying German bonds reasons this way: Why purchase a bond that yields 9 percent when inflation in that country might rise to an annual rate of, say, 6 percent or 7 percent, diluting most of the income's purchasing power, not only in Germany but probably elsewhere as well. Better to buy an American bond that pays 8.5 percent interest and count on the American inflation rate of 4.5 percent to remain unchanged.
If the expectation about the American inflation rate turns out to be correct, then only about half the purchasing power of the income from the Treasury note would be eaten up. The ''real'' return would be 4 percent (the 8.5 percent yield minus the 4.5 percent loss to inflation) while the real return on the German bond would be only 2 or 3 percent.
Seeking the 'Real' Return

Just this sort of thinking is now in evidence. Interest rates on German and Japanese 10-year bonds have risen by one-quarter to one-half a percentage point since Feb. 22, reaching 7.12 percent yesterday in Japan and 8.97 percent in Germany. But the rate on 10-year United States Treasury notes has held steady at just above or just below 8.5 percent, closing yesterday at 8.63 percent. Americans, and also foreign investors, have gone for the higher ''real'' return on American securities, and as they bought the dollars needed to purchase them, the dollar rose in value.
Never mind that actual inflation is less of a problem in West Germany and Japan today than it is in the United States. The annual inflation rate in the United States is now 4.5 percent, compared with rates in Germany and Japan of less than 3 percent. But the expectation is that inflation will get worse in Japan because of its booming economy and in West Germany because of the financial strain in rebuilding East Germany.
A third factor that makes interest rate movements a national rather than global phenomenon is the power of the major central banks to manipulate interest rates on short-term securities. Changes in these rates usually influence long-term rates, independently of international forces.
'Large Exaggeration'

Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, weighed in on this point in Congressional testimony last week. He said that while there is influence from rising rates in Germany and Japan, ''the presumption that it ties our hands and makes our monetary policy ineffective is a very large exaggeration.''
If all this is true, why then did American, German and Japanese rates rise in unison from early January through mid-February? Some economists, among them A. John Steigmann, research director at the Ford Motor Company, call what happened ''largely a coincidence.'' Three factors came together in December to create the global rise in rates.
One was the view that the American economy had finally gotten as weak as it was going to get and would rebound in the new year, pulling up the American inflation rate as the demand for goods intensified. Suddenly, a 7.7 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury note did not seem so appetizing, and it rose to offset the expected erosion from a higher inflation rate, reaching 8.66 percent last month before expectations changed again. Fresh data about the American economy have convinced the bond market, for the moment, that last year's 4.5 percent inflation rate might continue unchanged, after all, into 1990.
Simultaneously in December, rates rose in Japan because a new chief of the Bank of Japan called attention to the potential for a higher inflation rate in that country, and tried to head it off by pushing up Japanese interest rates. That was a classic tactic of central banks. Higher rates discourage spending financed with loans, thus reducing the demand for goods.
Also in December, expectations changed in West Germany. The Berlin wall was breached and suddenly there was talk of extending the West German currency to East Germany, giving 15 million East Germans, in one fell swoop, the wherewithal to buy West German goods. That is potentially inflationary.
What's more, the expectation arose that West Germany would need higher interest rates to attract billions of dollars from the world's pool of savings to finance the rebuilding of East Germany. ''Markets run in anticipation of real events that might never materialize,'' said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economic consultant.

Abstract: Yet the increase in the underlying rate also reflected special factors, involving automobile and tobacco prices, and analysts said they doubted that any worrisome surge in inflation is under way. ''We are starting to see it beginning to nose up a little bit, but it's not anything too disturbing,'' said John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. He said it was clear that the outlook for the core rate is not anything like the January level. At the White House, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called today's report ''disappointing news,'' but in accord with the views of most private-sector economists, he said inflation would probably not continue at such a rate. ''We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in nature,'' he said. ''But inflation requires eternal vigilance.''

Full text: LEAD: Heavily affected by harsh early-winter weather, consumer prices soared 1.1 percent in January, the biggest monthly advance in more than seven years, the Labor Department reported today.
Heavily affected by harsh early-winter weather, consumer prices soared 1.1 percent in January, the biggest monthly advance in more than seven years, the Labor Department reported today.
The increase in the Consumer Price Index was at the upper edge of the range of expectations, and analysts said it appeared to extinguish any remaining chance that the Federal Reserve Board would seek further cuts in interest rates anytime soon.
Until recently the widespread assumption among analysts was that the Federal Reserve was inclined to nudge rates down to counter weakness in the economy. But the latest economic reports suggest that the risk of recession has abated. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, told Congress on Tuesday that 1990 is likely to be a year of moderate expansion.
Banks Feeling Rate Pressure

Pressure is even building in the banking system to reverse the half-point cut in the prime lending rate, to 10 percent, made in early January. Since then some rates that banks pay to attract short-term funds, like those on certificates of deposits, have climbed significantly. At the same time, however, the overnight loan rate, which is closely controlled by the Federal Reserve, has remained steady at about 8.25 percent.
Japan and West Germany are raising their interest rates to combat the threat of inflation, and these increases in turn tend to pull up rates here. Further easing of credit by the Federal Reserve, analysts agree, could cause an unwanted drop in the dollar if interest rates in the United States become relatively unattractive to investors.
Core Inflation Also Jumps

Without the categories of energy and food, which were influenced the most by supply shortages resulting from the record cold in late December, the January increase was six-tenths of 1 percent. This is the largest increase in this important gauge, which economists call the underlying, or core, inflation rate, since January 1984.
Yet the increase in the underlying rate also reflected special factors, involving automobile and tobacco prices, and analysts said they doubted that any worrisome surge in inflation is under way. ''We are starting to see it beginning to nose up a little bit, but it's not anything too disturbing,'' said John D. Paulus, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. He said it was clear that the outlook for the core rate is not anything like the January level.
Traders said the price jump contributed to a decline in both stock and bond prices as the two markets opened. But the Dow Jones industrial average managed to regain some of its losses and finish the session off 13.29 points, to 2,583.56. And the Treasury's benchmark long bond, which had plummeted in price on Tuesday, managed a gain on the day.
At the White House, the Presidential spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, called today's report ''disappointing news,'' but in accord with the views of most private-sector economists, he said inflation would probably not continue at such a rate.
''We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in nature,'' he said. ''But inflation requires eternal vigilance.''
In his Congressional testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan said that he expected inflation to remain steady in 1990 at 4 to 4.5 percent but that an inflation rate in that neighborhood was too high and the Fed was determined to bring it down.
Prices for heating oil and other products that surged in January have already receded, analysts said.
Prices in the New York metropolitan area, one of five city tabulations made on a monthly basis, jumped 1.4 percent in January, with an increase in transit fares accounting for a bit more than 10 percent of the advance.
Prices in Urban Areas

Prices climbed 1.3 percent in Chicago, 1.1 percent in Los Angeles, 1 percent in Philadelphia and nine-tenths of 1 percent in San Francisco.
The rise of 1.1 percent in the overall Consumer Price Index - which covers all urban consumers, or about 80 percent of the population - was the biggest since June 1982 and followed a 1.8 percent jump reported earlier this month in January's Producer Price Index for Finished Goods.
The Labor Department said energy and food accounted for more than 60 percent of the increase as fuel oil soared 26.3 percent and fruits and vegetables jumped 10.2 percent, both records. Gasoline climbed 7.7 percent after falling in November and December. The price of tomatoes rocketed 75.6 percent, bringing the retail price to more than $1 each in some stores.
Many consumers no doubt refused to pay such a price and bought something else instead, but this is not captured by the price index because it measures a fixed market basket of goods and services. The Consumer Price Index makes no allowance for consumers shifting buying habits, such as switching from steak to hamburger.
Transportation Costs

Among the main statistical categories, transportation showed the biggest increase, 2.1 percent, with motor fuels accounting for nearly 75 percent of it. Public transportation rose 1.9 percent because of increases in airline fares and intracity charges, like the rise in New York City transit prices, which included increases in taxi and commuter railroad fares and a subway and bus fare jump from $1 to $1.15. The transportation category rose three-tenths of a percent in December.
Somewhat surprising to some analysts was another rise, six-tenths of 1 percent, in prices of new cars. Analysts had expected a drop, largely because auto makers had resumed incentive programs, but a Labor Department official explained that the 1990 models were introduced more slowly than usual and thus their higher prices are still being incorporated into the figures.
Food and beverage prices climbed 1.8 percent, with grocery-store foods up 2.9 percent, the biggest increase since a 7.1 percent surge in August 1973. About two-thirds of the advance was in fruits and vegetables, but dairy products were up 2.4 percent and the category that includes meats, poultry, fish and eggs were up 1.9 percent. Egg prices themselves leapt another 9.1 percent. In December, the food and beverage category rose four-tenths of a percent.
Housing, which accounts for 42 percent of the consumer price index, rose seven-tenths of 1 percent after three straight months with advances of four-tenths of 1 percent. Nearly half the rise reflected fuel and other utilities. Prices of hotel and motel rooms rose 2.9 percent.
Other Categories

Apparel prices were unchanged last month, compared with a decline of three-tenths of a percent in December, and medical care and other goods and services rose by the same amounts as in December, six-tenths and eight-tenths of 1 percent, respectively.
Other goods include tobacco, which posted a 1.3 percent increase that analysts had not expected in light of a big jump in December. An official said a tobacco price increase at the end of the year was partially reflected in the January figures because of the way data are collected and that state and local tax increases would take effect at the beginning of a year.
The entertainment category rose six-tenths of 1 percent in January with increases for reading materials, club memberships and tickets to cultural, sporting and entertainment events accounting for the bulk of the advance. This category rose four-tenths of a percent in December.
Before rounding, the consumer price index for all urban consumers rose 1.1084719 last month, to 127.4 percent of its 1982-1984 base. This means that a group of goods and services that then cost $10 now costs $12.74. Without seasonal adjustment, the index rose 1 percent last month.
A second index, which covers urban wage earners and clerical workers, or 32 percent of the population, also rose 1.1 percent when seasonally adjusted and 1 percent without such adjustment.

Why the Fed Is Largely Uncriticized

Abstract: ''I enjoy the absence of Fed-bashing,'' one governor said a few days before the President spoke. But he added, perhaps prophetically, ''I don't think it's a long-term phenomenon.'' In 1980, a repeated theme of President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign was his attacks on the Federal Reserve for its ''ill-advised'' policy of raising interest rates to retard inflation. Mr. Carter's Treasury Secretary, G. William Miller, himself a former Fed chairman, complained that the central bank was ''not communicating'' sufficiently with the Administration. ''I admire [Alan Greenspan],'' he continued. ''That doesn't mean we don't have our differences; we do. The Fed has a special view about the containment of inflation, and at the same time it is not unmindful of the necessity for growth. We have a special feeling about growth, but we have a very strong eye on inflation. I would say the differences are between the 40-yard lines.''

Full text: LEAD: President Bush and his spokesman last week broke his Administration's policy of keeping quiet about the policies of the Federal Reserve.
President Bush and his spokesman last week broke his Administration's policy of keeping quiet about the policies of the Federal Reserve.
But the statements of the President and his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, about the need for lower interest rates were mild compared to the sharp attacks on the Fed by officials in previous administrations when the economy was flagging in an election year.
At the week's end, senior Administration officials said the Bush and Fitzwater remarks were not meant as a direct challenge to the central bank but as a reminder that the Bush Administration wants interest rates as low as is possible, consistent with restraining inflation.
Rates Remain High

Although the Fed has allowed interest rates to fall somewhat in the last seven months, they remain abnormally high in relation to the rate of inflation.
Until last week, the central bank had received unusually little criticism from the White House and Congress as an election year begins, given the weakness of the economy and the fact that interest rates are unusually high by historical standards. Three-month Treasury bills are paying about 7.75 percent and 30-year Treasury bonds are around 8.25 percent, while the inflation rate has held steady for years at about 4.5 percent.
The reluctance of politicians to take on the Fed is in large part a result of the high regard they have for Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and of their hope that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues can perform the extraordinarily delicate feat of slowing the economy enough to avert high inflation without causing a recession.
No Political Pressure

The relative absence of criticism also reflects the acknowledgement in the White House and Congress that elected officials have let the budget deficit get out of hand and, for better or worse, have surrendered economic policy to the central bank.
Even legislators from states and districts that for all intents and purposes are in a recession say they are under no pressure from constituents or interest groups to take on the Fed.
The view of the Federal Reserve governors and top staff members is that a lack of political arm-twisting gives them freedom to fine-tune the economy that they would not otherwise enjoy.
But, gun-shy from past experience, they fear the statements by Mr. Bush and Mr. Fitzwater are the first signs that the truce flags are coming down.
''I enjoy the absence of Fed-bashing,'' one governor said a few days before the President spoke. But he added, perhaps prophetically, ''I don't think it's a long-term phenomenon.''
In his first public statement on the matter in almost a year, Mr. Bush told the National Association of Homebuilders in Atlanta on Friday that ''low and stable interest rates'' were essential to a growing economy. He did not specifically mention the Federal Reserve.
Fitzwater's Remarks

The day before, Mr. Fitzwater said the Administration hoped that new statistics showing a steady inflation rate and a faltering housing industry would persuade the Fed to loosen credit.
Some politicians suggested that Mr. Fitzwater's remarks laid the groundwork for the Administration to shift blame to the Fed if the economy slides into a recession. But top Administration officials disputed that view. One observed that Mr. Greenspan resented political pressure and would be less likely to loosen the reins on credit if the Administration kept speaking out.
In any case, the mood now is quite different from that in 1980 and 1982, the last times the economy was weak in an election year.
In 1980, a repeated theme of President Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign was his attacks on the Federal Reserve for its ''ill-advised'' policy of raising interest rates to retard inflation. Mr. Carter's Treasury Secretary, G. William Miller, himself a former Fed chairman, complained that the central bank was ''not communicating'' sufficiently with the Administration.
Reagan's Complaint

Similarly, in early 1982, President Ronald Reagan blamed the Fed for a monetary policy that caused capital investment to decline. Speaking of interest rates as the midterm election drew near, he told an audience, ''If that string hadn't been pulled for so long and so hard, we might not have had the depth of the recession that we've had.''
Reagan Administration officials like Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, were even harsher in their criticism, and many lawmakers campaigned on platforms of seeking lower interest rates.
By contrast, President Bush and his top economic policy makers agreed early in the Administration not to attack the Fed in public, a senior official said. They have generally stuck to that agreement, even though most economists believe the economy is growing little, if at all.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady explained the reasoning behind not challenging the Fed. ''People in the United States and around the world generate a higher level of confidence, which leads to economic growth, if they don't feel that there's a big war going on between the economic authorities inside the United States,'' he said.
'Inflation Genie'

Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said, ''The Administration realizes that while the goal is to maximize growth, letting the inflation genie out of the bottle is very costly later on.''
Once or twice before last week, the Administration's vow was broken. In his first week in office, President Bush told an interviewer, ''I don't want to see us move so strongly against fear of inflation that we impede growth.''
Even that mild comment raised eyebrows in the markets. ''There was a suspicion that this Administration, dominated by Texans and with all the Texas real estate and energy problems, would be less anti-inflation than Reagan,'' said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. ''People were waiting for signs that they would turn on the printing press.''
Then in August, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, pointedly criticized the Fed for keeping credit too tight. ''If we do have a recession,'' he said, ''I think it will be because they erred on the side of caution.''
Darman Pulls Back

That caused a stir for a few days. Mr. Darman said later he had not intended to use such strong words. He has not spoken out publicly on the subject since.
Asked in an interview today on the ABC News program, ''This Week,'' what policies the Fed should be following, Mr. Darman replied, ''I would like to stay out of that debate in the theory that they will do something wiser if I stay out of the swirl.''
This does not mean the Bush Administration and the Fed have not at times been at odds. Early last year, they disagreed over how to deal with the third world debt and the problems of the savings industry. Over the summer, one official said, Administration economists tried hard to convince Mr. Greenspan that signs of inflation were largely the result of one-time increases in oil and food prices and not a general overheating of the economy.
Then, in October, the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the central bank, decided not to lower interest rates immediately after the meeting of finance ministers of the seven leading industrial countries because Fed officials did not want to be perceived as succumbing to Administration pressure to drive down the value of the dollar.
Value of Socializing

Those differences were smoothed over in private. Mr. Greenspan knew many officials in the Administration from when they worked together for President Gerald R. Ford, and they continue to socialize together.
Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Brady meet nearly every week for breakfast, often joined by other officials. Mr. Boskin said staff relations between Administration economists and those at the Fed were smooth and cooperative.
''I do express my views to the chairman,'' Mr. Brady said. ''I do it forcefully and privately, and I intend to keep it that way.''
''I admire Alan Greenspan,'' he continued. ''That doesn't mean we don't have our differences; we do. The Fed has a special view about the containment of inflation, and at the same time it is not unmindful of the necessity for growth. We have a special feeling about growth, but we have a very strong eye on inflation. I would say the differences are between the 40-yard lines.''
Greenspan Is Careful

For his part, Mr. Greenspan has been careful not to criticize President Bush's policies in public, although, according to colleagues, he believes strong measures including tax increases are needed to lower the budget deficit.
In Congress, where lawmakers with strong interests in farming, small business and construction railed in years past against high interest rates, Mr. Greenspan is treated with respect bordering on reverence.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the Indiana Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee, has led the drive to make Federal Reserve procedures more accountable. But he precedes every discussion with strong praise of Mr. Greenspan and the current Fed policy.
And the Democrats who control Congress say they prefer to blame President Bush for the economic slowdown. They fear that too much talk about the Fed's role would give the President an escape hatch.
A Positive Influence

Many lawmakers also concede that Mr. Greenspan may be the only official in Washington with a positive influence on the economy, and they are grateful that times are not worse.
''Can you imagine, if it was the President or Congress who had control of monetary policy?'' asked Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who sits on the Banking and Budget Committees. ''Look at how Congress and the President have handled the budget deficit.''

O.E.C.D. Opposes Unilateral Trade Steps

Abstract: In the polite language of diplomacy, the ministers' final communique said, without mentioning the United States specifically, that the governments ''reject the tendency toward unilateralism'' and ''will avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions which undermine'' the ''integrity of the multilateral trading system.'' Japan devoted most of its energy at the two-day meeting to rallying other nations to join it in criticizing the American action. ''I have no doubt that they have the message,'' said John Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister, referring to the United States. ''But they also have the Congress.'' The O.E.C.D. is a Paris-based organization that industrial democracies formed in 1960 to foster economic growth and cooperation. United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said he thought the efforts were succeeding. ''In my opinion, the process is working,'' he said. ''We will always have moments in time when the process is creaky.''

A week after the United States named Japan, India and Brazil as unfair traders, the world's industrial nations said today that they rejected unilateral measures that undermine the world trade system.
The United States joined in the statement, issued by finance and foreign ministry officials from 24 industrial nations at the end of the annual meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
In the polite language of diplomacy, the ministers' final communique said, without mentioning the United States specifically, that the governments ''reject the tendency toward unilateralism'' and ''will avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions which undermine'' the ''integrity of the multilateral trading system.''
Last week Washington, exercising Section 301 of the trade act, cited Japan, Brazil and India as unfair traders, which subjects them to special negotiations and possible penalties unless they lower several import barriers.
At the two-day meeting, Washington had lobbied for watered-down language on unilateral actions, while Japan wanted to make sure the issue was hit hard. Both said they were satisfied with the final wording.
At a news conference today, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said that Washington's use of Section 301 was consistent with the spirit of the O.E.C.D. ministers' statement. She argued that Washington was using the legislation as a tool to open up the multilateral trade system, not undermine it.
''If we were a smaller nation we could sit by perhaps and watch,'' she said. ''But we are the largest nation and we have historically taken a leadership role'' to knock down trade barriers.
Many officials at the annual ministerial meeting of the O.E.C.D. said they hoped their condemnation of unilateral trade actions might persuade Washington not to retaliate single-handedly against the countries it has branded as unfair traders.
Japan devoted most of its energy at the two-day meeting to rallying other nations to join it in criticizing the American action. ''I have no doubt that they have the message,'' said John Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister, referring to the United States. ''But they also have the Congress.'' The O.E.C.D. is a Paris-based organization that industrial democracies formed in 1960 to foster economic growth and cooperation.
In their communique today, the countries also pledged to resist inflationary pressures and to strengthen efforts to reduce trade imbalances.
But the meeting was marked by disagreements over steps to fight inflation, whether interest rates should be raised or lowered and how aggressive the United States should be in cutting its budget deficit. With the dollar soaring to levels that most finance officials here said was too high, some in attendance suggested that international cooperation to spur noninflationary growth and stabilize exchange rates was proving unsuccessful.
But United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said he thought the efforts were succeeding. ''In my opinion, the process is working,'' he said. ''We will always have moments in time when the process is creaky.''
The ministers called for stepped-up efforts to cut the American trade deficit and the trade surpluses of Japan and West Germany.
The ministers said the United States needed ''continued moderation of domestic demand and further decrease of public deficits'' to contain inflationary pressures and cut the trade deficit.
The communique urged Japan to adopt measures aimed at increasing consumption and imports. The steps would include reforming its stringent land policies, opening up its distribution system and further liberalization of its financial sector.
As for the third world debt crisis, the communique suggested that commercial banks and multilateral organizations act to reduce the debt burden of many African and Latin American nations.
''The ministers stressed that lower interest rates and sustained economic growth might mean more help to developing countries than any debt strategies we have seen,'' said John Sigurdsson, Iceland's Minister of Industry and chairman of the ministers' meeting.
For the first time, the O.E.C.D. ministers devoted much of their communique to an appeal for more cooperation to protect the environment.

Abstract: ''Every time there is a round of sharp price increases, we get a wave of new visa requests,'' a Latin American diplomat said. ''Most people say they're going on vacation because they know it's hard to get immigrant visas, but they all want to leave here for good.'' #500,000 in 3 U.S. States With an estimated half million Peruvians already living in Florida, New York and California, the United States is the preferred destination. And since even tourist visas to the United States are increasingly hard to come by, some travel agencies are now charging $2,500 to smuggle in migrants through Mexico. There is also a steady flow of Peruvians moving to Chile, Paraguay and Venezuela. ''I don't want to go to the United States because Latinos are treated as second-class citizens there,'' said an engineering student who gave his name only as Carlos. ''I won't feel so foreign in a Latin country.'' ''You'd better leave me your address,'' a left-leaning academic told a foreign visitor. ''You never know when I'll come knocking on your door. I know that if there's a coup, there's going to be a flood of political exiles. There'll be massive repression of the left.''

Full text: LEAD: In a crowded airport lounge in full view of tearful emigrants bidding farewell to friends and relatives, the message written in black letters on a white marble wall looked singularly out of place.
In a crowded airport lounge in full view of tearful emigrants bidding farewell to friends and relatives, the message written in black letters on a white marble wall looked singularly out of place.
''I am proud to be Peruvian,'' it said. But with well over 100,000 Peruvians expected to flee this country's acute economic crisis this year and many more dreaming of doing so, pride in Peru seems to be in desperately short supply here today.
''You can put me on the list of those leaving,'' said Esteban Garcia, a 24-year-old book salesman who now drives a taxi. ''What has my country given me? What can it give me? If I stay, all I'm doing is making the rich richer.''
With Peruvians battered into pessimism by falling living standards, food shortages, blackouts, transportation strikes and growing terrorism, the idea of seeking a better life abroad has therefore become almost a fad here in recent months. 'I'm Going to Miami'
''I handed in my passport this morning,'' said a young man who declined to give his name. ''My father is a general, and the army is going to ask for a United States visa for me. In any event, I'm going to Miami. I have relatives who run a restaurant there.''
Government statistics show that 38,000 people emigrated in 1986, 66,000 in 1987 and about 120,000 last year. ''If this trend continues, one million of Peru's 20 million inhabitants will have left by 1992,'' Enrique Bernales, a leftist Senator, said.
Still more alarming for a backward country, many of the migrants are professionals, technicians or skilled workers. ''Can we criticize them?'' Senator Bernales asked. ''In a way, the country is pushing them out because they can't find jobs, salaries are low and they see no future for themselves here.''
For Latin America as a whole, this kind of exodus is also new. Excluding Cuban exiles, the vast majority of Latin migrants have traditionally been poor. But the region's economic crisis in the 1980's has brought a new wave of white-collar migrants from Mexico, Brazil and Argentina as well as Peru.
Peru's crisis, though, is the most dramatic. While its economy has been struggling since 1983, it went into a tailspin last year when the gross domestic product shrank by 9 percent, inflation exceeded 1,700 percent and average real wages fell by more than half. The prospects for 1989 are even bleaker.
''Every time there is a round of sharp price increases, we get a wave of new visa requests,'' a Latin American diplomat said. ''Most people say they're going on vacation because they know it's hard to get immigrant visas, but they all want to leave here for good.'' #500,000 in 3 U.S. States With an estimated half million Peruvians already living in Florida, New York and California, the United States is the preferred destination. And since even tourist visas to the United States are increasingly hard to come by, some travel agencies are now charging $2,500 to smuggle in migrants through Mexico.
But there is also a steady flow of Peruvians moving to Chile, Paraguay and Venezuela. ''I don't want to go to the United States because Latinos are treated as second-class citizens there,'' said an engineering student who gave his name only as Carlos. ''I won't feel so foreign in a Latin country.''
At the Migration Department, prospective migrants start lining up well before midnight to beat the crowds scrambling to pay $55 to obtain a passport every morning. ''Once I have my passport, I'll visit the American, Australian and Canadian Embassies,'' a 34-year-old agronomist said. ''I'm still young enough to start a new life.''
Significantly, while there is anxiety about an escalating war between the armed forces and Maoist guerrillas of the Shining Path, this conflict is still centered in the Andean highlands, and almost without exception migrants-to-be give economic reasons for their decision to leave.
Tens of thousands of peasants have fled to Lima's shantytowns to escape political violence over the past eight years but, in contrast to poor Mexicans and Central Americans who can travel overland to the United States, the cost of leaving here has limited the option of emigrating to Peru's middle classes. 'It Costs a Lot'
''Even for them, it is not easy,'' a foreign diplomat said. ''It costs a lot to settle a family in another country, and many people have to sell their homes and cars and even borrow to raise the money necessary. But they go anyway. It's dramatic. You'll have respectable senoras willing to cross the desert to get into the United States.''
Many of Peru's wealthy minority, on the other hand, already have savings and own property in the United States and Western Europe. ''People have so much money abroad that they could pack up and leave in a couple of days if the situation got out of hand,'' a prominent industrialist said.
For the wealthy and, for different reasons, for many leftists, political uncertainty rather than economic hardship is in fact the main reason for planning an escape route abroad. While the wealthy fear the steady advance of Shining Path revolutionaries, leftists are alarmed by growing speculation about a rightist coup.
''You'd better leave me your address,'' a left-leaning academic told a foreign visitor. ''You never know when I'll come knocking on your door. I know that if there's a coup, there's going to be a flood of political exiles. There'll be massive repression of the left.''
But while economic problems have prompted many Peruvians to lose faith in their country, the phenomenon is now feeding on itself. ''People pass on rumors as fact and cause panic,'' said Reynaldo Gubbins, president of the Peruvian Confederation of Industries. ''They hear of friends and relatives leaving the country and they wonder why they're staying. At times, I think we have a strong self-destructive streak in us.''

Abstract: ''They're pleased with the level of growth,'' said Elliott Platt, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, ''and their concern has shifted to inflation.'' ''We have no objection to what they're trying to do,'' Beryl W. Sprinkel, the President's chief economic adviser, said today. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, an informal adviser to the Presidential campaign of Vice President Bush, expressed similar views Tuesday. Mr. Sprinkel, for one, says the Federal Reserve is right to raise rates to bring the money supply into line, but he says the market's assumptions about inflation and low unemployment will be soon be disproved. ''I don't believe for a moment that at these levels of employment, inflation has to take off,'' he said.

Full text: LEAD: Many of the nation's major banks raised their important prime lending rate today, a decision prompted by growing fears at the Federal Reserve Board and on Wall Street that inflation is now a greater threat than recession.
Many of the nation's major banks raised their important prime lending rate today, a decision prompted by growing fears at the Federal Reserve Board and on Wall Street that inflation is now a greater threat than recession.
The banks, including Citibank, Chase Manhattan and Chemical in New York, lifted the prime rate half a percentage point, to 9 percent. That was its level in mid-October, just before the stock market collapse, when the economy looked as robust as it does now.
Banks use the prime rate as a base for all their loans to small and medium-size businesses and to consumers, so the increase in the prime means an immediate rise in many interest rates. A Domino Effect Looms
For consumers the higher prime rate, which generally lags behind the movements of other interest rates, signals increasing costs for mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans and other loans. Last Friday the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said rates on fixed-rate mortgages moved up slightly in April, ending the decline that began after the October crash.
The increase in the prime rate sent tremors through the already jittery stock market, contributing to a substantial drop of 37.80 points, or 1.9 percent, in the Dow Jones industrial average. It closed at 1,965.85. [ Page D1. ] In the credit markets, prices dipped slightly, but the rate increase was largely ignored. The move came as no surprise because of the recent rise in short-term rates. [ Page D16. ] The dollar's value was bolstered in currency trading by the higher interest rates. But there was conjecture that other nations might raise their interest rates, which could weaken the dollar.
Many economists said the increase in the prime rate confirmed a tentative but important shift in the policy of the Federal Reserve Board, from trying to help the economy avoid a recession to trying to prevent a surge in inflation.
They pointed out that in February the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the risks of inflation and a recession were about even. But recent statements by Mr. Greenspan and his fellow governors, they said, indicate that the risk of inflation now dwarfs the likelihood of a slowdown.
On Monday, for example, one of the governors, Martha R. Seger, said she was readjusting her forecast for the economy in view of the signs of faster growth. At another point, she said the Federal Reserve would not let inflation become a problem.
''They're pleased with the level of growth,'' said Elliott Platt, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, ''and their concern has shifted to inflation.''
The prime rate increase is likely to spread throughout the banking industry. It was foreordained by a recent rise in the Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, from a little below 7 percent to about 7 1/8 percent today. Increases in this rate, which the Federal Reserve controls, often force other rates to climb.
Economists see the Federal Reserve's moves more as preventative steps against a surge of inflation than as attempts to arrest the relatively low current inflation. And they say the rate increases could be reversed in a month if Government reports show consumer prices and other gauges of inflation to be stabilizing.
Most of these economists also doubt that the Federal Reserve will take a second step in an aggressive assault on inflation by raising the discount interest rate, , although that is a major concern in the financial markets. The discount rate, which is what the central bank charges on loans it makes to financial institutions, has been 6 percent since last September. Discouraging Borrowing
Higher interest rates invariably slow the economy by discouraging people from borrowing. This slowing helps relieve the pressure from workers and businesses seeking the wage and price increases that speed up the rate of inflation. The interest increases resulting from Federal Reserve policy have been so small, however, that they have aroused little concern in the Reagan Administration.
Some Administration officials seem to think that thwarting a little inflation now, even at the risk of slowing economic growth slightly, is better than hitting the economy with big rate increases to try to brake even faster inflation shortly before the Presidential election in November.
''We have no objection to what they're trying to do,'' Beryl W. Sprinkel, the President's chief economic adviser, said today. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, an informal adviser to the Presidential campaign of Vice President Bush, expressed similar views Tuesday.
Some other experts, however, contend that the Federal Reserve's intervention is so cautious and so tentative that it reflects more confusion than conviction about the course of the economy.
The one-quarter point rise in the Federal funds rate does not seem a very forthright assault on inflation, said Scott E. Pardee, a former senior Federal Reserve official who is now vice chairman of Yamaichi International on Wall Street. ''What it looks like is a big fudge,'' he said. Confusing Signals
But the behavior of the economy invites some confusion, analysts say. The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.4 percent, its lowest level in 14 years. At such a level, some economists assume, industry has to bid up wages to recruit workers and then charge higher prices to pay the higher wages.
Hourly wages rose last month at an annual rate of 6 percent, or two percentage points more than the current inflation rate of about 4 percent. Prices of the commodities that industries buy to make their products have also picked up a bit in recent days, putting additional pressure on prices.
Meanwhile, the economy strikes some economists as out of balance. While the economy might be growing at a sound enough annual rate of 3 percent, consumer spending is accounting for too much of the growth, they complain. With the long decline of the dollar's value, lowering the prices of American exports, exports had been expected to provide most of the economy's strength.
Some sectors of American industry are showing strains in meeting the demands of both the domestic consumers and the foreign markets, and as industry approaches the limits of its productive capacity it tends to raise prices. And the money supply, whose growth the Federal Reserve tries to control, has been growing faster than the central bank desires, possibly signaling higher inflation. The Oil Factor
On the other hand, wage increases, though strong in April, have not been nearly as strong as they were when the economy was showing similar strength in the past. Oil prices are softening, too, which helps keep all prices down. With all these developments, the financial markets have concluded that inflation is heading up and have pushed up long-term rates.
Mr. Sprinkel, for one, says the Federal Reserve is right to raise rates to bring the money supply into line, but he says the market's assumptions about inflation and low unemployment will be soon be disproved. ''I don't believe for a moment that at these levels of employment, inflation has to take off,'' he said.
One Federal Reserve economist, who declined to be named, said: ''What the Fed has to do is make a judgment about whether the old assumptions about inflation and unemployment persist or whether we're in a new era of labor docility.
''We've reached a point where historical relationships would suggest some increase in wage growth. We haven't seen it yet. Are historical relationships going to prevail, or have they broken apart?''
Given the uncertainty, he implied, the Fed is prudent to let interest rates rise a bit.

Moderately Higher Inflation Forecast

Abstract: ''We are going to get more inflation,'' said William C. Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's School of Business and Management. He cited increasing tightness in the labor market - at 5.5 percent the national unemployment rate has not been lower since 1974 - and the fact that the paper, chemical and certain other industries are now running at virtually full capacity. ''You've got to get some price pressure out of that,'' he added. 5 Percent Called Likely A similar view was expressed by Kathryn L. Kobe, a vice president at Joel Popkin & Company, a consulting firm headed by a former top specialist on prices at the Department of Labor. ''We are looking at 5 percent by the end of this year,'' Ms. Kobe said, adding that this was likely even if the economy stumbled into a recession. ''I'd say the dollar's the predominant culprit'' in the inflation outlook, said Robert C. Holland, a former Fed governor and now head of the Committee for Economic Development, an industry group. ''We've been fortunate to have had as little effect as we've had so far.'' Leverage on Auto Prices Weyerhaeuser's Mr. [Lynn O. Michaelis], for one, thinks this is a risky policy. ''They may be doing a little bit too much of this fine-tuning,'' he said. ''We don't yet think we're launched into the kind of inflationary pressures of the 1970's.''

Full text: LEAD: The United States appears to be entering a period of moderately higher inflation in which the general price level could rise 5 percent or more a year into the early 1990's, many economists and business executives maintain.
The United States appears to be entering a period of moderately higher inflation in which the general price level could rise 5 percent or more a year into the early 1990's, many economists and business executives maintain.
This acceleration, which is seen as pushing a bit higher and arriving a bit earlier than was expected as recently as last winter, is a result of the decline in the international value of the dollar, the probable end of falling oil prices and the accumulating pressures of an uninterrupted business expansion that began more than five years ago.
''We are going to get more inflation,'' said William C. Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's School of Business and Management. He cited increasing tightness in the labor market - at 5.5 percent the national unemployment rate has not been lower since 1974 - and the fact that the paper, chemical and certain other industries are now running at virtually full capacity. ''You've got to get some price pressure out of that,'' he added. 5 Percent Called Likely A similar view was expressed by Kathryn L. Kobe, a vice president at Joel Popkin & Company, a consulting firm headed by a former top specialist on prices at the Department of Labor. ''We are looking at 5 percent by the end of this year,'' Ms. Kobe said, adding that this was likely even if the economy stumbled into a recession.
At the same time, however, the various analysts and decision-makers expressed little fear of a return to the highly worrisome and disruptive inflation levels that averaged in double digits from 1979 through 1981. ''There's no sign of that type of wage-price spiral now,'' said Lynn O. Michaelis, chief economist for the Weyerhaeuser Company, the forest-products company.
Although recently reported jumps in both the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods in March prompted waves of selling in the securities markets, these statistics by themselves did not make a persuasive case for a higher inflation level.
Analysts pointed out, for example, that half the difference between February's increase of two-tenths of 1 percent in the consumer index and March's five-tenths rise reflected a temporary bulge in apparel prices related to the semiannual introduction of new lines. They also noted that the Producer Price Index for Crude Goods posted its fourth decline in the last five months. Nothing Unusual Seen
''I don't see anything in them that's all that unusual,'' said Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a voting member this year of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee. He added that the 4.2 percent consumer index inflation rate over the latest three months was not meaningfully higher than the 3.9 percent rate over the latest 12 months.
Nonetheless, the March increases did tend to focus attention on the prospect that various forces do seem now to be converging to raise the country's inflation rate a notch or two - to probably 4.5 to 5 percent or perhaps somewhat more for the second half of this year.
One important factor is the dollar's three-year decline against the currencies of Japan and most European trading partners. Assuming foreign producers have about exhausted their ability to protect hard-won markets here by accepting progressively slimmer profit margins, they will be seeking to add to what in some areas have already become substantial price increases. While some analysts believe that much of this impact has already been absorbed, others insist that the sizable effects still lie ahead.
''I'd say the dollar's the predominant culprit'' in the inflation outlook, said Robert C. Holland, a former Fed governor and now head of the Committee for Economic Development, an industry group. ''We've been fortunate to have had as little effect as we've had so far.'' Leverage on Auto Prices
With the economy running short of capacity in some areas, various restrictions on the importing of steel, textiles and other goods are having more price ''bite,'' economists note. Even in cars, where there is little production constraint, the limit on Japanese imports has given Detroit more leverage to raise its prices.
Oil is another likely force for higher inflation. After four years in which the consumer index's rise was held to just under 4 percent, the collapse of world oil prices in 1986 shriveled inflation that year to 1.1 percent. With a relatively steady oil price last year, inflation rebounded to 4.4 percent and many analysts now assume that the stepped-up fighting in the Persian Gulf insures that oil prices will be driven up this year.
Although upward pressure on wages has been modest so far, some suspect that the United States may be losing this as an inflation suppressant. In a draft of a special report on inflation to be published shortly, the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University notes that the percentage of the working-age population who already have jobs ''has been moving along a path similar to previous inflation upswings.'' This is unsettling in an economy in which employee compensation accounts for about 73 percent of national income and is thus the biggest factor in business costs and pricing. Fewer Younger Workers
Demographic changes that have resulted in smaller pools of younger workers seem likely to aggravate wage pressures, other analysts said.
But these pressures seem to be concentrated outside the normal domain of organized labor. Rudy Oswald, an economist for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said he saw little sign of any basic new inflation surge. ''There's no indication'' of this, he said, noting, for example, that an alternate Labor Department consumer index in March rose only three-tenths of 1 percent compared to the five-tenths rise in the more popular version.
Ms. Kobe, on the other hand, said she expected the Government to report this week a sizable increase for the first quarter in its key employment cost index, one of the best gauges of wage pressures.
Another skeptic about inflation is Elizabeth A. Bossong, a Pittsburgh steel consultant. Calling current inflation fears ''more in the eye of the financial community'' than justified by the ''real'' world, she said it was premature to worry about serious inflation even in steel where many kinds of products are already in tight supply.
''I still don't see the old-type cost pressures that would suggest inflation on the industrial side,'' Ms. Bossong insisted. Evidence of Many Increases
Nonetheless, there is evidence that many prices are, in fact, being raised. A survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found last month that 27 percent of its respondents planned to raise prices in the next six months, the highest since early 1984, and that 30 percent had raised prices in the last six months, the highest since late 1981.
Many of those who believe that the nation's underlying inflation rate is indeed heading for, say, 5 percent from 4 percent, maintain that this should not be cause for alarm.
''It doesn't mean we have a serious inflation problem and, in fact, it's not necessarily a bad thing at all,'' Temple's Mr. Dunkelberg said. Higher prices and higher profits are the ''signals'' needed for the economy to shift resources from consumer goods into its increasingly export-oriented industrial sector so that the country can cut its huge deficit in international trade, he added.
Higher inflation will also tend, other economists said, to keep the dollar at low enough levels to sustain the current export boom. Fears on Action by Fed
Many analysts said that one of their main fears was that the Federal Reserve, which they see as having little analytical cohesiveness these days, will misinterpret the threat and over-react to slow the economy, possibly tipping it into a recession.
Indeed, the Fed may have already begun to ''fight the wrong war,'' some maintain. One piece of evidence cited is a recent address by H. Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
''Because the Federal Reserve has been credible in fighting inflation in the 1980's,'' Mr. Hoskins told Seattle business economists, ''it should be possible to contain inflation by using very small policy changes as long as these changes are initiated in advance of rising inflation.''
Weyerhaeuser's Mr. Michaelis, for one, thinks this is a risky policy. ''They may be doing a little bit too much of this fine-tuning,'' he said. ''We don't yet think we're launched into the kind of inflationary pressures of the 1970's.''

Abstract: The Phillips curve didn't take into account commodity or food shortages, which were behind a lot of the inflation of the 1970's. You have to remember that through much of the 1970's and 80's, there was recession, inflation and declining employment in the manufacturing sector. These economic conditions made people cautious about pushing for higher wages. The unions, in particular, have been cautious in their wage demands and are more interested in job security. Only if there is no recession this year, and the expansion continues, will there be any real push for higher wages. For the rest of the year, unemployment will continue at its 5.6 percent level, or dip slightly, and inflation will continue at 4 1/2 percent. MARVIN KOSTERS Director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

Unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent, the lowest rate in 8 1/2 years. Will increased tightness in the labor market push up inflation? The Phillips curve - an economic relationship which shows that inflation grows as unemployment shrinks, and vice versa - would suggest the answer is yes. But most economists say the curve is not an accurate guide. BARRY BLUESTONE Professor of political economy, University of Massachussets at Boston.
Inflation has various roots and labor is certainly one. But so are energy prices and the weather. The question today is whether the labor market has become so tight that it is bidding up wages. In the major unionized sectors of the economy, the wage settlements have been very modest. Wage increases relative to productivity have been small. And unit labor costs rose no more than 2 percent in 1987, compared with more than 6 percent a year during the 1970's. This means there doesn't seem to be any indication of a rise in labor costs and none of increased inflation. We'll have sluggish economic growth this year - about 2 percent - with unemployment at about 5.5 percent. Inflation will stay between 3 1/2 and 4 percent. JANET L. NORWOOD Commissioner, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Many economists have difficulty with the Phillips curve. The overall rate of inflation is moved not just by labor, but by things like oil prices, which are affected by external causes, and food, which is affected by the weather. These two factors have played a large role in the inflation picture over the last two decades. So far food and energy prices have been behaving well. What we don't know is the effect on inflation of the lower dollar and the probable increase in import prices. FRANK LEVY Economist, University of Maryland School of Public Affairs.

MARVIN KOSTERS Director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.
During most of the 1980's, wages grew by progressively smaller amounts each year. Last year was the first year wages grew at a greater rate than the year before - and this doesn't include bonuses to hourly workers, which are increasingly common.
But what happens to inflation this year will depend on public policy - such as the legislated increase in the minimum wage or new laws requiring employers to increase employee health care benefits. Without these policy changes, we will see a slight uptick in the inflation rate. But with these changes, there very well might be a large increase in inflation in 1988 and 1989. Don't forget that labor costs account for two-thirds of the total gross national product and without productivity gains, increases in wages translate into higher prices.

When the World's Growth Slows

Abstract: Many economists are clearly chagrined that leaders of the industrial world do not seem terribly alarmed about the slowdown. ''The most dangerous thing is the gradual acceptance that if all we have is 2 percent growth, that's O.K., without thinking that for many people real earnings will remain basically unchanged throughout their lifetimes,'' said Jean Baneth, director of the World Bank's international economics department. ''That will be very different from the societies we built in the 1950's and 1960's, where there were expectations of improvement.'' ''In the 1960's, governments were willing to push against capacity more than they are today, and there was a kind of optimism about the inflationary consequences, a feeling that inflation could be limited or that it could be lived with,'' said Georges de Menil, an economics professor at Paris's Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. ''That feeling has changed profoundly throughout the industrial world. That is one reason why growth is not faster than it is today.'' The end of American hegemony means Washington can no longer singlehandly correct the world's economic ills. ''After World War II, the U.S. had 50 percent of the world G.N.P. and could play locomotive for the world whenever growth slowed,'' said M.I.T.'s Dean Thurow. ''Now the U.S. is down to 23 percent of world G.N.P. and can't play locomotive.''

Full text: LEAD: WORLD economic growth has been shrinking and shrinking, but so gradually - and so inexorably - that economists have grown accustomed to the numbers. Yet a stark tale emerges when those numbers are added together year after year and their impact is examined.
WORLD economic growth has been shrinking and shrinking, but so gradually - and so inexorably - that economists have grown accustomed to the numbers. Yet a stark tale emerges when those numbers are added together year after year and their impact is examined.
There is an academic ring to the words ''slower international economic growth.'' But translated into human terms, these words lose their textbook abstraction. They mean longer unemployment lines from the north of England to northern Ohio and fewer opportunities for 16-year-olds from Pasadena to Paris. In the developing world, they mean something even more painful: malnourished children, ramshackle housing, high rates of infant mortality. Together, they weave a quilt of many interconnecting colors, and that is the only way they can be looked at: Economists have long recognized that slower world growth hurts everyone, from the richest nations to the poorest and that all are bound together.
The numbers are telling: In the 1950's and 1960's, the global economy grew by about 5 percent a year, sending living standards galloping forward in much of the world. In the 1970's, growth fell to slightly above 3 percent, and in the 80's it has slipped to about 2.3 percent. The outlook for the next few years is for a continued slide.
The slowdown is having serious effects on expectations and living standards in much of the world. For the average American worker, the slowdown in growth has meant that real income has not risen since 1973. In Europe, growth has been so slow that the jobless rate has soared to over 11 percent. For the debt-plagued nations of Africa and South America, this slowing trend has pushed per capita income 15 percent below the levels of 1980.
Yet, as 1988 dawns, many economists believe the world faces a rare opportunity in economic history. For the first time, they say, the leading industrial nations might have the power to reverse the slowdown, mainly because of an unusual confluence of circumstances. Inflation and budget deficits have been tamed in many nations. Corporate profits are healthy and interest rates are lower than they were a few months ago. Several important technological breakthroughs, such as fiber optics and superconductors, are waiting to be spread through the world; big technological advances often push growth by creating new opportunities and jobs.
''The conditions for going back to 3 to 4 percent growth in the world economy are actually better now than they have been at any time since the 1960's,'' said Stephen Marris, senior economist with the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
YET if the leading industrial nations fail to work together to help reduce trade imbalances and push growth upward, some economists warn of serious trouble ahead. The world's fragile financial markets could take another deep plunge, they say, dragging down the world economy. If growth rates continue sliding, the trend could usher in an era of downward mobility, forcing people to work harder just to stay in the same place economically. If economic growth falls below the 1 percent population growth in much of the industrial world, people will have to struggle to keep their living standards from falling.
Such an era of frustrated expectations could heighten tensions in the industrial world and political instability in the third world. In developing countries, it could exacerbate an already grave situation: As per capita income declines, poverty increases from one year to the next.
''This slowdown makes it particularly difficult for the really poor countries to grow,'' said Angus Maddison, author of several books on world growth rates and professor of economics at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. ''Their growth is intertwined with the industrial world. They should be catching up to us and growing faster, but they are having problems because our growth has slowed.''
TECHNICALLY, growth is defined as the increased output in a nation's goods and services, covering everything from housing to hospital care. Many factors - from technology to economic policies - can help growth, or hinder it. Just as it seemed natural that growth would take off after World War II, as consumer demand was unleashed and economies were rebuilt, it also seemed inevitable that growth would fall from those heady levels.
But in recent years, other, more political factors have contributed to the further slowdown. Today, some economists argue that a few nations - particularly West Germany - have been overzealous in their fight against inflation, and that, in the process, they have sacrificed global economic growth.
Many economists are clearly chagrined that leaders of the industrial world do not seem terribly alarmed about the slowdown. ''The most dangerous thing is the gradual acceptance that if all we have is 2 percent growth, that's O.K., without thinking that for many people real earnings will remain basically unchanged throughout their lifetimes,'' said Jean Baneth, director of the World Bank's international economics department. ''That will be very different from the societies we built in the 1950's and 1960's, where there were expectations of improvement.''
Although some economists say the 25-year period after World War II was extraordinary because growth levels far exceeded historic norms, they say there is no reason why growth rates in the 1990's cannot move closer to levels of the 1960's.
Getting there from here will not be easy, however. In the last five years, a stubborn third world debt crisis has slowed growth in both developing and industrial nations. The United States, once an all-powerful locomotive that pulled weaker economies along with it, has been plagued by huge trade and budget deficits that it seems unwilling to reduce as fast as the rest of the world would like. And West Germany, Europe's most powerful economy, is so nervous about increasing inflation that it does not want to stimulate its economy nearly as much as other nations want.
In recent years, many governments tried to fight inflation at the expense of growth. Now, economists say, they must shift gears and focus more on promoting growth - using policy vehicles that could range from more government spending to investment incentives - while keeping inflation under control.
The huge trade imbalances, which have roiled stock and foreign exchange markets since mid-October, must be cut before the world can move into a smoother - and faster - growth period.
MANY economists say that unless stronger steps are taken to slash America's $155-billion trade deficit and Japan's and West Germany's huge trade surpluses, markets will remain unstable and interest rates will rise. That could lead to a sharp economic downturn, making it hard for growth in the 1990's to outpace growth in the 1980's.
''What is holding us back from achieving faster growth,'' Mr. Marris said, ''is we have to correct this incredible disequilibrium, and it will be very difficult to do that while avoiding a recession.''
Mr. Marris was one of 33 prominent economists from 13 countries who signed a statement earlier this month calling on Washington, Bonn and Tokyo to take more decisive actions to reduce trade imbalances. The economists said Washington should try to cut domestic demand and imports further, and must go beyond its recent deficit reductions. It must, they say, cut its $150 billion deficit by an additional $40 billion a year for several years.
The economists also urged West Germany to raise imports and accelerate and expand tax cuts scheduled for 1990. And they urged Japan to push domestic demand growth above 4 percent a year.
Although most economists agree on what these three nations must do, they say improved world economic growth could become a hostage to domestic political constraints. Bonn and, to a lesser degree, Tokyo, fret that greater stimulus will mean increased inflation and angry voters. In an election year, Washington worries about how voters will react to higher taxes or more budget cuts.
''Coordination means each would have to do what's good for the world economy, but they don't want to do it,'' said Lester Thurow, an economist and dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The oil shock of 1973 is often called the turning point when world economic growth started to slow. But other forces were already at work.
Consumer demand was explosive after World War II. In North America, Europe and Japan, families rushed to buy homes, cars and televisions, helping to create a golden era of sustained growth. Europe's economy forged ahead as it rebuilt. And Europe and Japan bounded ahead as they adopted many of the advanced technologies that the United States had monopolized. This meant huge investments as well as great strides in productivity and growth.
Simultaneously, major tariff reductions, brought about by successive rounds of multilateral negotiations, produced a trade boom that was a catalyst for growth. By the early 1970's, however, the factors that fostered strong growth were largely played out.
Then came 1973. OPEC nations quadrupled the price of oil, and the oil shock cut into purchasing power, hit corporate profits and created a wave of uncertainty that slowed investment. It also produced a recession in the United States and the first post-war recession in Europe.
''That created a globalization of economic problems,'' said Rudiger Pohl, professor of economics at Hagen University in Germany.
About the same time, the world was rocked by another economic shock: the decision to abandon fixed exchange rates in favor of floating ones. Many economists said companies began hesitating before they invested, even when demand and profits were strong, because they feared future exchange rate fluctuations.
Many conservative economists - and even some liberal ones - say the development of the so-called welfare state in many industrialized nations also placed a brake on growth. Productivity growth and investment were discouraged, they say, by the increase in regulations on industry as well as higher taxes that supported more generous social programs.
Higher taxes, higher inflation, greater uncertainty from oil shocks and exchange rate volatility all contributed to a declining rate of investment. Business investment had long served as a powerful flywheel that kept growth humming even when consumer spending slowed. Sluggish investment reduced the flywheel effect, cutting growth and raising the volatility of the world economy. That provided another disincentive to investment, which hurt productivity growth. Rising productivity is vital because it allows for faster economic growth without inflation.
DURING the 1970's, governments began an about-face, trying to slow growth in order to stamp out inflation.
Then came the 1979 oil shock. Creeping inflation began galloping; fighting it became a priority worldwide. Governments slammed the brakes on growth - in ways that ranged from curbing spending to raising interest rates.
''In the 1960's, governments were willing to push against capacity more than they are today, and there was a kind of optimism about the inflationary consequences, a feeling that inflation could be limited or that it could be lived with,'' said Georges de Menil, an economics professor at Paris's Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. ''That feeling has changed profoundly throughout the industrial world. That is one reason why growth is not faster than it is today.''
But according to Professor de Menil, today's slower growth - provided growth continues - might be smarter that the go-go growth of yesteryear because it is less inflationary and therefore more sustainable.
Nevertheless, many economists see several underlying problems with the slow-growth, anti-inflation approach. In particular, they say, the fight against inflation is causing economic growth to fall short of its potential. ''There have been restrictive fiscal policies in many countries, especially Germany,'' said Professor Pohl. ''That has made global demand weak, and that has been one of the causes of the growth slowdown over the past five years.''
In the 1960's, the United States, Japan, France and many nations embraced policies to keep demand strong. In the United States, the Vietnam War contributed to big spending at the same time that the nation was spending heavily on social programs.
Now many countries - especially West Germany - seem to be trying to keep demand modest to help hold down inflation. For many governments, the emphasis has been on the supply side - reducing regulations, taming unions, lowering taxes - in order to encourage investment. Some economists say that even with supply side stimulus, companies still may not feel enough incentive to invest because they do not expect much growth in demand.
''There is a vicious cycle,'' said Mr. Baneth of the World Bank. ''Business does not have confidence in long-term growth, and because of their lack of confidence, they're not creating the capacity which would allow long-term growth in a stable, non-inflationary environment.''
Professor Maddison, who used to be one of the top economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said conditions were right for pushing the world economy to perform closer to what he says is its growth potential of 4 percent a year.
''One thing is clear: The world economic situation is much less inflationary now that it had been,'' he said. ''The time is ripe to experiment with more active demand management.''
Another problem that many economists see with the anti-inflation fight is that Europe and Japan have taken one approach and the United States took another. After the 1979 oil shock, Europe and Japan adopted policies of fiscal consolidation, slashing budget deficits and cutting the ratio of their budgets to their gross national product. Meanwhile, in Washington, the Federal Reserve Board jacked up interest rates to help whip inflation and the Reagan Administration pushed through huge tax cuts that produced gargantuan budget deficits.
Taken together, these disparate approaches sent the dollar soaring and generated a huge American trade deficit and enormous German and Japanese trade surpluses.
''These policy mess-ups create much more skepticism about the power of government to do anything good about the economy and about long-term growth in demand,'' said Andrea Baltho, an Oxford University economist who has written extensively on world growth.
Many economists say that reconciling the disparate approaches to fighting inflation, thereby reducing trade imbalances, would help lead to faster growth. Resolving the third world debt crisis would also be a boon to growth, they say.
''Brazil, Argentina, a lot of these countries used to be very dynamic economies,'' said Richard Portes, director of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London. ''But because everyone is worried about having to bail out a few banks, we have not yet taken the bold steps needed to bring the less developed countries back to being dynamic contributors to world growth.''
EFFORTS to correct all these problems - to pave the way for faster growth - have been made harder by another pronounced change in the world economy: the decline of the United States as the world's premier economic power. This has been caused by many factors: the economic rise of Japan and the Pacific Rim, America's huge borrowings, the once-strong dollar's damage to America's manufacturing base, and the increasing ease of transfering manufacturing technology from industrial countries to developing ones.
The end of American hegemony means Washington can no longer singlehandly correct the world's economic ills. ''After World War II, the U.S. had 50 percent of the world G.N.P. and could play locomotive for the world whenever growth slowed,'' said M.I.T.'s Dean Thurow. ''Now the U.S. is down to 23 percent of world G.N.P. and can't play locomotive.''
As a result, there is a greater need for the three leading industrial powers - United States, Japan and Germany - to work together to furnish the leadership that Washington once provided. But how likely is that?
''Coordination,'' Dean Thurow said, ''is very easy to say, very easy to praise, but very difficult to do.''

Abstract: ''Some people in the Bundesbank say we have to be careful because the domestic-made rate of inflation is about 1.5 percent and may be rising,'' said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist for Commerzbank. ''In my view, 1.5 percent is no inflation at all.'' A Call to Stimulate Consumption ''We are not neurotic about inflation,'' Mr. [Karl Otto Pohl] said Monday in a speech defending German policies. ''Experience has taught us not to wait until prices go up, because then it is mostly too late.'' ''The rise of the mark against the dollar shouldn't hurt us that much because only one-tenth of Germany's exports go to the United States,'' Mr. Ramm said. ''Besides, about 50 percent of Germany's imports are dollar-denominated.''

Wherever the Germans turn, someone is telling them what to do.
If it is not Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d agitating for lower interest rates, it is Edouard Balladur, France's Finance Minister, calling on Bonn to spur economic growth.
The Germans do not quite understand why so much attention is focused on their economy, which has had steady if unspectacular growth and minuscule inflation. They are perplexed by the anger directed at them over the dollar's recent plunge to only 1.70 German marks, a development the Germans say has been caused not by Bonn, but by Washington's failure to rein in its budget and trade deficits.
''We did not cause all the imbalances - they're mainly the fault of the Americans - and we are not very eager to change what we think is a solid economic course,'' said one German economic policy maker. Germans Seen as Disingenuous
Many West Germans may feel that their country is being unfairly singled out, but the country's trading partners, particularly the United States, view this response as disingenuous.
America and others say that Germany - Europe's largest economy and the world's leading exporting nation - is such an important player on the international scene that it needs to take a more active role to reduce the world's trade imbalances. Last year, Germany's merchandise trade surplus totaled $57 billion while the United States trade deficit was $147 billion. Germany's economy is a quarter the size of the United States'.
Washington, like numerous international organizations, says that Germany could contribute in two ways. One, it could cut interest rates. This would permit the United States to keep its own rates down and would help to stimulate a world economy that some worry may face a recession because of the recent stock market collapse. Two, the Germans could take strides to consume more - buying more from abroad, for example -to help to reduce the gargantuan American trade deficit.
All this would mean stimulating the economy, which could increase inflation, the Germans' traditional nemesis. But signs of positive action by Germany might help to calm the financial markets, which have been roiled, at least in part, by the split between Bonn and Washington.
More and more Germans, albeit still a minority, are urging their leaders to worry less about inflation and more about economic growth. On Monday, Germany's five leading economic institutes called on the Government to speed up tax cuts to help increase growth beyond its lackluster annual rate of 1.5 percent, a rate likely to be hurt by the rise of the German mark. Ending the Market Turmoil
Whether Germany helped to cause the trade imbalances is not the issue, many economists say. In their view, the issue is how best to end the turmoil in the stock and foreign exchange markets, and to most economists, the answer is more international cooperation, including a lot of cooperation from Germany.
Indeed, Treasury Secretary Baker thought German action was so essential that in mid-October he threatened to let the dollar drop if the Germans did not lower their interest rates. It was a threat that many say helped to spur the worldwide stock plunge.
The Germans fret that what may be good medicine for the world economy could be bad medicine for their country. German officials and economists are quick to point out that a decade ago, their nation relucantly bowed to foreign pressure to increase the budget deficit to speed up economic growth. Today, the Germans still grouse about the economic hangover: a budget deficit one year of about $33 billion and an inflation rate of almost 7 percent, a rate the Germans consider suffocatingly high.
Moreover, the Germans often recall the hyperinflation that afflicted their nation in the late 1920's and late 1940's. Memories of people carting wheelbarrows full of money to do their shopping still live vividly in the German mind.
''This is a country where people think 2 percent inflation is already too high,'' said Hermann Rempsberger, chief economist for Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank.
Many economists say that Bonn is silly to worry that pump priming will produce inflation. The nation's inflation rate this year is about 1 percent. The soaring mark will help hold down the price of imports. And with a jobless rate of 8.3 percent, there is plenty of slack in the economy.
''Some people in the Bundesbank say we have to be careful because the domestic-made rate of inflation is about 1.5 percent and may be rising,'' said Ulrich Ramm, chief economist for Commerzbank. ''In my view, 1.5 percent is no inflation at all.'' A Call to Stimulate Consumption
Officials in Washington and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have long urged Bonn to stimulate consumption. On the fiscal side, they say that Bonn should cut taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers and increase Government spending.
But Bonn officials say they have already moved to satisfy Washington. In the spring, the Germany Parliament increased a tax cut, scheduled for Jan. 1, from $5.3 billion to $8.2 billion. In addition, Bonn has scheduled another $11.8 billion in tax cuts to take effect in 1990.
These would help increase Bonn's budget deficit to $19 billion in 1990, from about $12 billion in 1985. ''If you take our budget deficit as a measure for expansionary policies, we're clearly on the path of expansion in absolute and relative terms,'' said one Finance Ministry official.
German officials note that one of the main reasons that the Social Democratic Party was voted out in 1982 and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition was voted in was displeasure about the Government's lack of fiscal discipline. Rising Budget Deficits
''Budget deficits have been rising in Germany and will be increasing and it's very difficult for our Government to do more,'' said Mr. Rempsberger, the economist.
In addition, German economists estimate that their nation's domestic demand will grow by about 3 percent.
With regard to monetary policy, Bonn's critics say that since Oct. 19, when stock prices collapsed, it has not done enough to lower interest rates. American officials say that since the German mark is arguably the world's second most important currency, Germany's interest rates be significantly below American rates so the United States does not have problems attracting investors to finance its huge budget deficit.
''The Germans have done less to reduce interest rates than anyone else since Oct. 19,'' said Ian Harwood, an economist with Warburg Securities in London.
At the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, officials boast that they have lowered interest rates since Secretary Baker made his demand and since the stock market's plunge. The central bank has lowered an important market rate to 3.80 percent, from 3.85 percent, and some economists predict the Bundesbank will reduce it to 3.65 percent in the next few weeks. Although the decline is small, some participants in the financial markets place more immediate importance on the general direction of interest rates.
Economists in Frankfurt say there is a split within the Bundesbank between the pragmatists, who are willing to pare interest rates, and the hard-liners. The latter group, said to be in the majority, is headed by Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank vice president, and seems to care more about fighting inflation than accommodating the demands of Germany's trading partners. Their main concern seems to be that the German money supply has risen by 7.8 percent so far this year, which in their view could mean an upsurge in inflation next year.
Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank's president, is said to favor reduced interest rates, but is occasionally outvoted by the hard-liners.
''We are not neurotic about inflation,'' Mr. Pohl said Monday in a speech defending German policies. ''Experience has taught us not to wait until prices go up, because then it is mostly too late.''
Many foreign economists cannot understand why Germany is so reluctant to stimulate its economy, especially when the soaring mark is expected to slow Germany's economic growth. But German economists say the dollar's plunge from 3.2 marks in 1985 to only 1.70 German marks will not make much difference to their economy. Germany's Growth Estimates
Two weeks ago, Mr. Ramm of Commerzbank predicted Germany's economy would grow by 2 percent in 1988, but now he has cut that forecast by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.
''The rise of the mark against the dollar shouldn't hurt us that much because only one-tenth of Germany's exports go to the United States,'' Mr. Ramm said. ''Besides, about 50 percent of Germany's imports are dollar-denominated.''
Some economists say that the overall economy could end up better off because a lower dollar means Germany in effect pays less for its oil and raw materials, which are often priced in dollars.
Many economists say that with their widespead affluence, long vacations and declining population, the Germans feel no compulsion to have a go-go growth policy. But the German attitude upsets economists who think Germany should be not a brake for Europe's growth, but an engine.

Abstract: Disagreement among economists revolves not around whether the rate is declining but around the level at which it becomes a flashpoint of inflation and around the importance the Government should give any precise figure in making policy. ''Our basic view is that the point is lower than 6 percent,'' said Beryl W. Sprinkel, the departing chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. ''It's around 5-ish I think.'' Estimates as Low as 4% Whatever the figure, Mr. [Albert T. Sommers] urges that the Government not let the rate decline to the flashpoint, even if it could be accurately determined. Such a policy-driven momentum could inadvertently drive unemployment below that threshold and provoke soaring inflation. Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, warned that with the rise of two-income families and changing attitudes toward work among young people, making forecasts on the basis of such figures is a risky way to guide economic policy. ''There's no doubt the rate is going down,'' he said. ''But how much isn't very clear.'' The labor force's absorption of such bulges of job-seekers does not alone account for the change in the full employment rate. ''In the 70's,'' Mr. [Edward N. Gramlich] of the budget office said, ''the rate rose by more than can be explained by demographics, and it is falling by more than can be explained by demographics.''

Full text: LEAD: A broad spectrum of economists, including advisers to President Reagan, think the nation's unemployment rate can now decline significantly more without precipitating the problem often associated with low unemployment: a burst of inflation.
A broad spectrum of economists, including advisers to President Reagan, think the nation's unemployment rate can now decline significantly more without precipitating the problem often associated with low unemployment: a burst of inflation.
Many say that the jobless rate, currently at an eight-year low of 5.9 percent, can decline to around 5 percent, a level not seen in almost two decades. In the throes of the 1981-82 recession, unemployment exceeded 10 percent, and the economists' new findings do not preclude such levels in future recessions.
But in their view, the Government can now let the economy grow for longer than would have been allowed in recent years for fear of inflation. Inflation worries many officials more than unemployment because rising inflation can force the Government to tighten its hold on money, leading to a recession and even higher unemployment. The Traditional Wisdom
Since the mid-1970's economists have greeted falling unemployment warily because as it fell, industry would compete for workers, offering higher and higher pay, and would then cover the cost of the wages by pushing up the prices of their products, fueling inflation throughout the economy.
Inflation has picked up a bit this year from last year's rock-bottom level of 1.1 percent, and the Federal Reserve Board this month raised interest rates a bit, citing signs of accelerating inflation. But inflation now, at around 4 percent, mostly stems not from wages but from a rise in oil prices and the effects of the cheaper dollar, which makes imports more expensive. And without wages contributing to rising prices, few economists see them undermining the trend toward lower unemployment.
Politically, the trend in employment elates Republicans gearing up for next year's elections. ''They will claim it as a victory,'' said Ted Van Dyk, a political consultant here. He said Democrats would not dispute the prospects of lower unemployment but were likely to draw attention to other economic issues, such as declining standards of living and the nation's trade deficit. Already Below Old Flashpoint
At 5.9 percent for the last two months, the unemployment rate has already pierced the 6 percent threshold that for a decade was judged the flashpoint of rising inflation. At that moment, the Government often tries to cool the economy by such means as raising taxes and cutting public spending or by raising interest rates. Starting in 1979, the Federal Reserve raised rates with a vengeance to exorcise the economy's double-digit inflation rate.
Now, because of huge changes in the economy's dynamics, notably industry's difficult but ultimately successful absorption of postwar baby boomers and women, economists say that unemployment is settling back toward the low levels of two decades ago and allowing the Government more time before making it necessary to put a damper on things.
Disagreement among economists revolves not around whether the rate is declining but around the level at which it becomes a flashpoint of inflation and around the importance the Government should give any precise figure in making policy. ''Our basic view is that the point is lower than 6 percent,'' said Beryl W. Sprinkel, the departing chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. ''It's around 5-ish I think.'' Estimates as Low as 4%
Albert T. Sommers, chief economist at the Conference Board in New York, a business-sponsored research group, says the figure appears to be 5.5 percent now. Jeff Faux, head of a liberal research group here known as the Economic Policy Institute, suggested 4 percent. ''But whatever you felt the rate was a few years ago,'' Mr. Faux said, ''you've got to have a lower estimate today.''
Whatever the figure, Mr. Sommers urges that the Government not let the rate decline to the flashpoint, even if it could be accurately determined. Such a policy-driven momentum could inadvertently drive unemployment below that threshold and provoke soaring inflation. Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, warned that with the rise of two-income families and changing attitudes toward work among young people, making forecasts on the basis of such figures is a risky way to guide economic policy. ''There's no doubt the rate is going down,'' he said. ''But how much isn't very clear.''
Percentage point distinctions may seem insignificant, but few economic issues arouse social and political passions more than jobs, and even minuscule changes in the unemployment rate reverberate through the economy in striking ways. A Point Equals 1.2 Million Jobs
A reduction of a single point means that 1.2 million more people are working. Spending by those workers helps keep the economy growing, and the distribution of incomes tends to even out because more of the poor have jobs. Moreover, even many of the poor who are among the least skilled, usually least employable workers - notably black teen-agers - are being absorbed. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for black teen-agers has already improved dramatically, from 52 percent five years ago to 29 percent in August - the lowest level in at least a decade.
And according to the Congressional Budget Office, a percentage point less of unemployment next year would save the Government $36 billion in aid to the jobless - a boon to the drive to reduce the budget deficit. Such a reduction ''is something that I think is good news from nearly any perspective you can imagine,'' said Edward N. Gramlich, acting director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Such economists note one feature of the change, however, that is not so welcome. Income gains, adjusted for inflation, have by some measures been eroding and by others are no better than static. Among reasons for stagnant wages, economists say, are the impact of foreign competition and workers' rising emphasis on job security over pay hikes. Reviving a Debate of the 1960's
Awareness that a growing economy can tolerate lower unemployment could revive a lively issue of the low-inflation 1960's. Economists of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations became absorbed in debating the level of an unemployment rate that represented the optimum balance of jobs and non-inflationary growth, a figure they called the ''full-employment unemployment rate.''
The goal the Government set then was 4 percent unemployment, which assumed about 4 percent growth. With its taxation, spending and interest rate policies, the Government never quite realized its ideal match of jobs and growth, but it sometimes came close.
In 1961, for example, growth was quite slow, at 2.2 percent; unemployment fairly high, at 6.5 percent, and inflation quiescent, at 1 percent. By 1964, growth had accelerated to 5.3 percent, unemployment had slipped to 5 percent, and inflation was up just a bit, to 1.3 percent. Effect of Unforeseen Factors
Later, inflation arising from the Vietnam War and from surging oil prices, and the rush of both women and World War II baby boomers into the work force, played havoc with the theory. The economy would grow, but often so would inflation and unemployment.
In 1978, Congress wrote the 4 percent unemployment goal into law, but by then it was clearly unattainable and the goal was virtually ignored. To accommodate high systemic inflation, many economists in the late 70's determined that the full employment rate had climbed to 6 percent, and after the recession of 1981 and 1982, members of the Reagan Administration speculated that it had reached 6.5 percent.
Since then, however, circumstances have changed markedly. The postwar babies are adults now and have been absorbed into the labor force. The number of working women continues to rise but at a much slower pace than in the 1970's. Both groups inflated the unemployment rate, because it took the economy a while to absorb them and because unemployment among women and youths usually ran higher than for other groups. Foreign Competition Noted
But the labor force's absorption of such bulges of job-seekers does not alone account for the change in the full employment rate. ''In the 70's,'' Mr. Gramlich of the budget office said, ''the rate rose by more than can be explained by demographics, and it is falling by more than can be explained by demographics.''
''Why?'' he asked, rhetorically. ''I think it's due to the openness of the economy. We are much more susceptible to foreign competition, especially in large unionized sectors such as steel and autos. It has become impossible for them to engineer the kind of wage increases of former times.'' Thus, he said, the economy and employment can grow with less of a threat of inflation.
With inflation again more subdued, some economists expect the debates of the 1960's to resume in earnest. ''People are going to argue over exactly what level of unemployment is the critical level where inflation accelerates,'' said Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution who was President Carter's chief inflation fighter. Some Favor Unfettered Market
Some other economists, mostly conservative, belittle the notion that the Government can manipulate the economy to deliver a predetermined combination of employment and inflation to help encourage growth, and they say unfettered markets do the job better. Just attempting to anticipate a precise level of unemployment is elusive, they say, in part because the labor force is much more fluid than theories of full employment imply.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the source of employment data, defines the labor force - 122 million of an adult population of 184 million - as people who are working or are prepared to work.
The definition excludes the infirm, the retired, society's dropouts, volunteers and those, such as mothers of young children, who elect not to take wage-paying jobs. But in a booming economy, some of these people trickle back into the labor force, making precise calculations about optimum unemployment difficult. They include the least employable hard-core job-seekers, such as unskilled youths without high school diplomas and those who are handicapped but willing to work. The Rock-Bottom Rate
No one, in any event, assumes unemployment can fall to zero. For a while during the 1940's, when the nation strained to support the war effort, the rate fell - to 1.5 percent in 1944 -while the economy boomed and inflation soared.
The 1.5 percent was what economists call ''frictional'' unemployment, the statistical joblessness that accounts mostly for members of the labor force who are in transit between jobs, according to Thomas J. Plewes, an associate commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Many of the economists who espouse such theories say frictional unemployment, and thus the rock-bottom rate, is now around 2 percent. The debate concerns how close to that level unemployment can fall without igniting faster inflation.

Abstract: The first decisive break with the ''quick-fix'' approach, Morgan says, came with the ''bold anti-inflation monetary policy of late 1979,'' when President Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Despite several mid-course corrections, Morgan maintains, monetary policy has displayed a ''consistently resolute, anti-inflation approach.'' An analysis by Data Resources Inc., the economic research subsidiary of McGraw-Hill, finds that the American performance would have been much stronger in the 1980's had it not been for dramatic tax cuts and a defense buildup that were not offset by discipline in the budget. It also says the performance would have been better had monetary policy not been so conservative, ''always erring on the side of greater progress against inflation at the expense of higher unemployment.'' D.R.I. also ran tests to determine the effect if the Fed's monetary policy had been less aggressive, providing more stability for the private sector by holding interest rates to a normal spread above the rate of inflation, and if the Fed had not had to cope with an ''erratic'' fiscal policy. D.R.I. found that the business cycle would have been shallower, without the worst postwar recession; inflation would have come down less; swings in Treasury bill and bond rates would have been half as large; the Federal budget deficit would not have exploded in 1982-83; the dollar would have risen only about one-third as much as its 1985 peak, and the trade deficit would be much smaller now.

Full text: LEAD: DESPITE all the worries on Wall Street, the American economy has been performing remarkably well - if, for the moment, you leave aside the big trade deficit, the budget deficit, the weak dollar and the growing dependence on foreign capital.
DESPITE all the worries on Wall Street, the American economy has been performing remarkably well - if, for the moment, you leave aside the big trade deficit, the budget deficit, the weak dollar and the growing dependence on foreign capital.
In its just-released Economic Quarterly, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company cites three major areas of improvement: the low rate of inflation in the last five years, the second-longest expansion since World War II, and the adding of 14 million jobs since 1979, with the United States unemployment rate now seven percentage points lower than the average of other industrial countries.
What have we done right? Morgan's answer is that, first of all, the United States has had a consistency of policy, especially compared with the 1970's, with its twists and turns in price and wage controls and stop-go fiscal and monetary policies.
The first decisive break with the ''quick-fix'' approach, Morgan says, came with the ''bold anti-inflation monetary policy of late 1979,'' when President Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Despite several mid-course corrections, Morgan maintains, monetary policy has displayed a ''consistently resolute, anti-inflation approach.''
Tax policy, too, has been steadier in the 1980's, Morgan says. Though there was zigzagging on corporate income taxation, the Reagan Administration stressed reduction of marginal tax rates, adding to the economy's dynamism.
The second major factor contributing to the better American performance, Morgan says, has been increased reliance on market forces, giving the economy greater flexibility. It notes that the trend toward less Government interference began under President Carter, with the beginning of deregulation of the airline and trucking industries and the swing away from energy price controls, policies that were carried further by President Reagan.
But has United States fiscal and monetary policy really been all that consistent? And are America's chronic financial and international problems the consequence of Reagan policies?
An analysis by Data Resources Inc., the economic research subsidiary of McGraw-Hill, finds that the American performance would have been much stronger in the 1980's had it not been for dramatic tax cuts and a defense buildup that were not offset by discipline in the budget. It also says the performance would have been better had monetary policy not been so conservative, ''always erring on the side of greater progress against inflation at the expense of higher unemployment.''
Using runs of its large-scale econometric model to compare what actually happened with what the model indicates would have happened if the 1976 tax code had been left intact and Federal expenditures had expanded only at the same long-term pace as the economy, D.R.I. found that interest rates would have been far lower in the last four years and the budget and trade deficits smaller.
D.R.I. also ran tests to determine the effect if the Fed's monetary policy had been less aggressive, providing more stability for the private sector by holding interest rates to a normal spread above the rate of inflation, and if the Fed had not had to cope with an ''erratic'' fiscal policy. D.R.I. found that the business cycle would have been shallower, without the worst postwar recession; inflation would have come down less; swings in Treasury bill and bond rates would have been half as large; the Federal budget deficit would not have exploded in 1982-83; the dollar would have risen only about one-third as much as its 1985 peak, and the trade deficit would be much smaller now.
Roger E. Brinner, chief economist and group vice president of D.R.I., says, ''Future analysts will be less kind to Paul Volcker than contemporary commentators.''
Although D.R.I. emphasizes the erraticism of policy and Morgan its consistency, both analyses tend toward the same conclusion: More consistent and better balanced fiscal and monetary policies would have improved the American economic performance. It was an excessively stimulative fiscal policy that forced monetary policy to be excessively restrictive. That pushed up interest rates and the dollar, aggravating the trade deficit, generating instability in financial markets and raising the ultimate danger of a boom-bust sequence.
Yet expansion marches on. Factory output, after being in the doldrums, is climbing briskly, thanks to the upsurge of exports. But the strong American economy causes imports to rise even faster.
Indeed, some economists fear the United States economy is moving up too fast. Albert M. Wojnilower, chief economist of the First Boston Corporation, warns that ''the near-term economic risk no longer is one of too little demand but too much.''
Alan Greenspan and the Fed reached that conclusion the week before last and raised the discount rate, pushing up other rates. The Fed apparently decided that checking inflationary expectations and defending the dollar now was more urgent than forestalling recession.
However, rising interest rates have caused housing starts to fall to their lowest level in four years. And anxiety in the securities markets is tied to rising rates.
Consistency of policy is all well and good, but the Greenspan Fed, like the Volcker Fed, must be ready to turn around fast if the economic climate - and the greater danger - changes.

Abstract: Despite all this seemingly random fluttering, the markets have not panicked and the dollar has been holding within the probable ''reference'' bands or ''target zones'' set by the Group of Five industrial countries - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France - at the Louvre Museum in Paris last February. There has never been official confirmation that those currency zones exist; indeed, there are reasons to think the agreement was a loose one, giving the countries freedom to intervene or not intervene, depending on their interpretation of national needs and economic developments. The American contribution to the support of the dollar has been relatively modest. According to a Federal Reserve bulletin, it amounted to $4.1 billion from February to April, all financed by drawing down foreign currency balances. The United States might have taken on more of the exchange risk of supporting its own currency by borrowing foreign currencies, especially yen, by issuing ''Reagan bonds'' similar to those issued during the Carter Administration. Denominated in strong foreign currencies and backed by the United States Treasury, Reagan bonds might have eased the pressure on American interest rates. But President Reagan and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d rejected the idea. In an earlier study, ''Deficits and the Dollar,'' published in December 1985, Mr. [Stephen Marris] said the ''trough'' of the hard landing would be reached three and a half years after the dollar started going down. ''This would put it in the third quarter of 1988, just before the November election,'' he said in an update of his study just released by the Institute of International Economics. While noting that ''history is unlikely to repeat itself with such precision,'' he sees ''no obvious reason to change this time scale.''

AFTER last Friday's announcement of a record United States trade deficit of $16.5 billion in July, stocks and bonds rallied and the dollar, after a brief drop, climbed. But yesterday, after the announcement of a record deficit of $41.1 billion in the nation's balance of payments on current account in the second quarter, the securities markets fell and the dollar dropped.
But despite all this seemingly random fluttering, the markets have not panicked and the dollar has been holding within the probable ''reference'' bands or ''target zones'' set by the Group of Five industrial countries - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France - at the Louvre Museum in Paris last February. There has never been official confirmation that those currency zones exist; indeed, there are reasons to think the agreement was a loose one, giving the countries freedom to intervene or not intervene, depending on their interpretation of national needs and economic developments.
Nevertheless, the heavy intervention by central banks and the course of the dollar since the Louvre meeting lend support to the market's view that target zones exist. During the first five months of this year, a dozen governments spent $78 billion buying dollars, with Japan, West Germany and Britain the biggest dollar buyers.
The American contribution to the support of the dollar has been relatively modest. According to a Federal Reserve bulletin, it amounted to $4.1 billion from February to April, all financed by drawing down foreign currency balances. The United States might have taken on more of the exchange risk of supporting its own currency by borrowing foreign currencies, especially yen, by issuing ''Reagan bonds'' similar to those issued during the Carter Administration. Denominated in strong foreign currencies and backed by the United States Treasury, Reagan bonds might have eased the pressure on American interest rates. But President Reagan and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d rejected the idea.
The fundamental reason for doing so, said Stephen Marris of the Institution of International Economics, was that ''a decision by the United States Treasury to borrow in foreign currencies could well be interpreted by the markets as a sign of weakness - that the United States would resort to any gimmick to enable it to go on with its present borrowing spree, rather than face up to the unpleasant decisions needed to put its house in order.''
Most unpleasant of all, from a political standpoint, would be the need for the Reagan Administration to agree to an increase in taxes and a cut in military expenditures to reduce the budget deficit, which most economists regard as crucial to reducing or eliminating the trade deficit. Such action could also be unpleasant economically, increasing the risk of recession.
There has also been resistance on the side of the Europeans and Japanese against taking the fiscal actions needed to correct their trade imbalance with the United States. They could do this by cutting taxes or raising outlays, military or civilian. But, fearing inflation and the loss of foreign markets, the European countries and Japan have dragged their heels against stimulating faster growth or incurring larger military burdens to restore balance to the Western alliance, as the United States has urged them to do. Without such ''convergent'' fiscal actions on both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific, the United States trade deficit and, over time, the decline of the dollar are likely to persist.
Thanks to heavy central-bank intervention, which has cowed the markets, the dollar has been holding up this year. A hopeful view, Mr. Marris says, is that the central banks are giving breathing space to the markets and time to governments, to overcome the political obstacles to taking necessary fiscal action; in the case of the United States, that delay is likely to last until after the 1988 election.
But a much darker view, held by Mr. Marris, is that the present pattern of exchange rates cannot hold much longer and that the necessary changes in policy are unlikely to be made in time to prevent serious troubles: runs on the dollar, escalating interest rates, an inflationary recession for the United States and a ''hard landing'' for the world economy.
In an earlier study, ''Deficits and the Dollar,'' published in December 1985, Mr. Marris said the ''trough'' of the hard landing would be reached three and a half years after the dollar started going down. ''This would put it in the third quarter of 1988, just before the November election,'' he said in an update of his study just released by the Institute of International Economics. While noting that ''history is unlikely to repeat itself with such precision,'' he sees ''no obvious reason to change this time scale.''
Such exactitude among Cassandras is the latest thing, although Mr. Marris is at least a year and a quarter ahead of the predicted ''crash of 1990'' of Prof. Ravi Batra of Southern Methodist University.
All the same, the bulls in the markets are refusing to be stampeded. They are holding to their confidence in the light of the steady growth of the economy (five years in a row now); the pickup in retail sales (a 1.3 percent rise in August, the biggest since February); the moderate rate of inflation (no change in producer prices in July); the decline of the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent, and the remarkable resiliency of the dollar, despite the big trade and budget deficits. The deepest mystery may be, not when will the crash come, but what are we doing right?

Abstract: LEAD: It has been suggested that the incoming Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, should continue the policies of his predecessor, Paul A. Volcker. But more of the same is not the answer to today's problems. Mr. Greenspan's main task is not to fight inflation but to restore a credible policy of growth so that the world can safely deal with the large-scale debt problems that the collapse of inflation left in its wake. The need to grow does not mean that we can throw our caution about inflation to the wind. Our reduced tolerance for inflation is a healthy development that contrasts with conditions during the 1960's, when many economists and politicians argued that a little more inflation would pay for itself in higher employment and economic growth. Nevertheless, our present intolerance for inflation is not without risks. Jittery financial markets can force the Federal Reserve to overreact and to tighten monetary policy even when the economy is weak. Mr. Greenspan's task is to prevent inflation-sensitive financial markets from depriving the economy of the financing it needs in order to grow. Otherwise, the costly victory over inflation could yet become Pyrrhic. To succeed in his task, Mr. Greenspan must re-educate the public about the problems that confront us.

Otherwise, the costly victory over inflation could yet become Pyrrhic. To succeed in his task, Mr. Greenspan must re-educate the public about the problems that confront us.
High on the list is an explanation of the origins of the Federal budget deficit. Widely feared as an excessive fiscal stimulus that must be countered with tight monetary policy, the budget deficits of the 1980's are, in fact, the result of the unexpected collapse in inflation.
As everyone knows, one of the Administration's earliest priorities was to get inflation down. But it did not foresee the sudden, massive fall that occurred. And whenever inflation falls below the forecast, it means the Government has, in effect, overbudgeted for inflation - collecting less revenue than planned and spending more in real, inflation-adjusted dollars than intended. The deficit, in other words, far from being a source of inflation is a result of more disinflation than the Government expected.
The disinflation of the 1980's saddled many sectors of the domestic and world economy with excessive debt burdens. Mexico, for example, went heavily into debt on the basis of economic forecasts that the price of oil would rise to $65 per barrel in 1986 and on to $100 per barrel by the end of the decade. The same expectation caused banks to overexpose their capital in foreign loans.
At the same time, the collapse of inflation pulled down the asset values that are collateral for debts, leaving many debtors and their creditors fatally exposed. Farmers, oil men and real estate developers, who had leveraged their assets as an inflation hedge, found that they could not pay their bills. Hundreds of banks have been destroyed as a result of defaults on their domestic loans. Even our premier financial institutions have been reduced to a shaky status and are being forced by market conditions to set aside huge reserves needed to cushion potential defaults on their foreign loans. Another recession would cause a dangerous unraveling of world debt.
Today many are ignoring these facts and are arguing for an anti-inflation policy consisting of higher taxes to reduce the deficit and higher interest rates to support the dollar. It is hard to imagine a more disastrous policy for a world economy that is still reeling from having lost its bet against the collapse of inflation. For this reason, Mr. Greenspan must break out of Mr. Volcker's mold.

Abstract: There is no ''right'' value for the dollar. What exchange rate is good for autos is not necessarily good for televisions or semiconductors. Each is a different relationship. That's why people take refuge in an overall trade balance number. But the trade deficit is so horrendous that it is clear that whatever exchange rates we have, they have not been effective in equalizing the costs between us and a whole group of countries. Everybody hopes the dollar's fall will correct the trade deficit. But it also means that prices of foreign goods will increase. People will complain on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about the high trade deficit, and then on Thursday, Friday and Saturday complain that the falling dollar is raising prices. But you can't have it both ways. You can't have a falling dollar correct the trade deficit without having inflation. ALBERT T. SOMMERS Senior fellow and economic counselor, the Conference Board. This week, that's just not been feasible. There's been no substantive indication or any public action that there's a willingness to stand firm behind the dollar. Therefore, it's continued to fall. and as long as psychology is in that negative mode, that's going to be the response. BEN BERNANKE Professor of Economics and Public Affairs, Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.

Full text: LEAD: The dollar - whose steep decline in the last few weeks has upset global markets and preoccupied the world's finance ministers - could fall still further, possibly 5 to 10 percent, a number of top United States economists and financial officers said in interviews yesterday.
The dollar - whose steep decline in the last few weeks has upset global markets and preoccupied the world's finance ministers - could fall still further, possibly 5 to 10 percent, a number of top United States economists and financial officers said in interviews yesterday.
For nearly two years, the decline in the dollar has been touted as the remedy for the American trade deficit. Domestic manufacturers contend that the dollar's fall has already helped their competitiveness, and some see even greater benefits ahead. But, after the dollar hit another low against the yen this week, others expressed concern about the economic impact of rising inflation and higher interest rates.
The dollar sank this week after the United States and other industrial democracies, meeting in Washington, renewed their pledge to stabilize currency rates, but offered no new plans. Intervention by central banks in the currency markets yesterday provided some support, but the dollar slipped further against both the Japanese yen and the West German mark.
Some financial experts welcome the possibility of an even weaker dollar, but that prospect worries others who believe a renewed confidence in the currency is most important now. WALTER JOELSON Chief economist, General Electric Company.
I'm concerned that a significant drop in the dollar will raise prices in America so much that the Federal Reserve will say that we have runaway inflation and that they had better raise interest rates and produce a recession. That, of course, would be the worst policy of all. But that is the threat we are facing.
There is no ''right'' value for the dollar. What exchange rate is good for autos is not necessarily good for televisions or semiconductors. Each is a different relationship. That's why people take refuge in an overall trade balance number. But the trade deficit is so horrendous that it is clear that whatever exchange rates we have, they have not been effective in equalizing the costs between us and a whole group of countries.
Everybody hopes the dollar's fall will correct the trade deficit. But it also means that prices of foreign goods will increase. People will complain on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about the high trade deficit, and then on Thursday, Friday and Saturday complain that the falling dollar is raising prices. But you can't have it both ways. You can't have a falling dollar correct the trade deficit without having inflation. ALBERT T. SOMMERS Senior fellow and economic counselor, the Conference Board.
The present value of the dollar is appropriate, and further declines will be counterproductive for all.
Right now, the dollar is inflationary, and the consequence of that is that we are done with a decline in the interest rates and we're beginning to experience a rise. That will prevent the dollar from falling any more. The logic is that the dollar will not fall further because rising interest rates will support it.
Of course, the rise in interest rates has unpleasant features with respect to the domestic economy, but that is unavoidable. JOHN STEIGMANN Economist, Ford Motor Company.
My view - which is not necessarily that of Ford - is that the yen is still out of line and not at a level that will clear the trade deficit. This suggests that further appreciation of the yen is required. My impression, however, is that for other major currencies, they are close to a realistic level.
For the yen itself, I could see it easily go up another 15 percent or so. And I don't have concerns about this. So many of the concerns I've heard seem to be exaggerated and even misplaced. The doomsayers see only the effect that a decline in the dollar can have on capital inflows for investment. But when those capital inflows decline, it means the trade deficit is improving and they are not allowing for the stimulative effect of a better trade performance. ALLEN SINAI Chief economist, Shearson Lehman Brothers.
The right value for the dollar is anywhere from 5 to 20 percent lower than it is right now. But the amount depends on many things: improvement in our trade deficit, interest rate differences between the United States and other countries, relative global inflation rates and whether our budget deficit is reduced.
My concern is that the Fed might end up tightening monetary policy to support the dollar and stem the dollar-induced inflation. Then, higher interest rates could weaken the U.S. economy and that would hurt the economies outside the United States. This would hurt our chances for exports and possibly start a recession. RICHARD W. RAHN Chief economist, the United States Chamber of Commerce.
None of us know what the appropriate level of the dollar is - only the market can determine that. Our mistake is that we try to artificially peg the rate, and policy makers have tended to be wrong.
I do worry about the inflationary pressures caused by the dollar's fall. In my own judgment, it has probably fallen too far. These things tend to swing out - the dollar had gotten too high two years ago, and now it's gone too far in the other direction. But I don't think we should do too much to manipulate the currency up or down.
Policy makers ought to do things to help our competitiveness. We need tax changes to reduce our cost of capital, and we have to get the Japanese to open their markets more. LAWRENCE A. KUDLOW Chief economist, Bear, Stearns & Company.
I don't think the dollar has convincingly bottomed out yet. The ongoing problem is that the Federal Reserve continues to create too many dollars in relation to its global demand. Right now, the international money markets are trying to signal the Fed that they have to start extinguishing dollars.
Most people don't approach it from this standpoint: They talk about stimulating economic growth or budget deficits. My view is, all those play a role, but a small one. The major problem is the Fed has been printing too many dollars. A. NICHOLAS FILIPPELLO Chief economist, Monsanto Company.
We are beginning to see some of the benefits of the weaker dollar on the economy and on corporate profitability. We have seen that the strong downward pressure on pricing flexibility has eased somewhat, which has allowed margins to improve somewhat relative to 1985, and we have seen some improvement in the industry's trade balance.
As an economist more than as a representative of Monsanto, my guess is we will see general improvements in the trade picture, which are probably somewhat better than expected, simply because the markets take time to work, but they do work. NICHOLAS SARGEN Vice president, bond market research, Salomon Brothers Inc.
There are a lot of issues here. One is what exchange-rate level will turn the trade imbalance around. Nobody has a clear answer, but the present level hasn't done the job.
Then there's the issue of foreign investors purchasing securities. Up until recently, interest rates had fallen so much more than overseas, and now we're starting to see that situation change.
The third factor is confidence. If policy makers were to lower their interest rates, then that would have a steadying effect on the market. Right now we're testing the 140-yen-for-dollar level, but we could soon be testing 130 yen for the dollar unless policy makers begin to respond. HANS G. STORR Chief financial officer, Philip Morris Inc.
The dollar could fall another 5 to 10 percent against the yen, the D.M. and Swiss franc, even though the Germans and Swiss say they don't see how that's possible.
The fundamental imbalance in the dollar is caused by the large budget deficit, the large trade deficit and the money supply.
That is the kind of thing that holders of the dollar currencies are seeing, and the Group of Five or Group of Seven have not given sufficient assurance to investors of dollars that a turnaround is about to come. CAROL STONE Senior economist, Nomura Securities Inc.
The main thing in considering the value of the dollar is whether financial market participants have confidence and that public officials are willing to support a particular level.
This week, that's just not been feasible. There's been no substantive indication or any public action that there's a willingness to stand firm behind the dollar. Therefore, it's continued to fall. and as long as psychology is in that negative mode, that's going to be the response. BEN BERNANKE Professor of Economics and Public Affairs, Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.
The balance of trade doesn't seem to be improving enough so as to eliminate the need for future depreciation of the dollar. That in itself suggests that the dollar should keep falling.
You can compare U.S. Treasury bills with interest rates for Germany and Japan. If the spread has widened, that should suggest that there's an expected depreciation of the dollar.
In the past, the difference between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been a good indicator. So that the best guess is continued mild depreciation.

Abstract: The recent meeting in Washington between Secretary Baker and Finance Minister Miyazawa looks more and more like a victory for the United States. Japan appears to have gotten the message that America will let the market carry the dollar down if the Japanese do not take actions to step up the growth of their economy. Mr. Baker, on the other hand, is promising to help stabilize the dollar-yen relationship if Japan follows through on the stimulus that it promised at an earlier Baker-Miyazawa meeting, last Oct. 31. ASIDE benefit of Mr. Baker's hang-tough policy may yet come from the Germans. While still grumbling about not wanting to be a ''locomotive'' for the Americans, the German Bundesbank cut its two key interest rates even before last Sunday's election, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl was re-elected by a lower plurality than he expected. A poor showing by the right-wing nationalists increases the likelihood that the Germans will stop being so heavy-handed and even arrogant in their resistance to the American approach to economic growth. ''These six steps,'' said Secretary Baker, ''are only a start. We need to build on them while keeping our expectations within reasonable bounds.'' The next Group of Five or Group of Seven meeting, expected early this month, is more likely to produce not some magnificent breakthrough, but another three yards and a cloud of dust. Mr. Baker's effort to persuade the others to go along with the American approach has been reinforced by the latent threat of American protectionism. Foreigners know that Mr. [Reagan], politically weakened by the Republican loss of the Senate and by the Iran-contra affair, could have more trouble in staving off protectionist legislation from the 100th Congress. Legislators, however, appear to be looking for ways to avoid naked protectionism, whether through ''market-opening'' approaches and a productivity-based ''competitiveness'' campaign.

IN a turbulent world economy still riven by national forces, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d is striving to find a way to make the major industrial nations work together in their common interest - and, not incidentally, in the American interest as well.
The clash between national interests and world economics will be inescapable when the top financial officials of the Group of Five - the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France - finally get together, possibly as early as next weekend, in an effort to quiet the uproar in the foreign exchange markets.
There is irony to the ingrained pursuit of national interest in an increasingly integrated world economy. The Group of Five meeting itself, the latest in a series of such meetings, represents a forced recognition - forced by the inability of the five to control their own exchange rates and economies - that the unit for economic policy-making must be the world economy, not individual national economies, not even one so powerful as the United States.
Mr. Baker, the chief economic officer of the United States, appears to have accepted this principle, having made the leap early in his tenure to the world economic viewpoint. That he has is abundantly evident in Mr. Baker's efforts to improve the United States economy by insisting that the German and Japanese Governments stimulate theirs so their peoples will buy more American goods and save the United States from its huge trade deficit.
However, his strategy is not narrowly conceived to serve only American trade interests, Mr. Baker argues. ''We feel that we are engaged in a life-or-death struggle here to preserve the world economy,'' he said in defending the pressure that the United States is putting on Japan and West Germany to expand their economies more rapidly. Their concern is that this policy could breed inflation. Yet, slowly and painfully, the other countries appear to be coming around to the Baker view that, despite the risks to their own economies, international cooperation is crucial to their interests.
A key element in the Baker strategy has been the dollar devaluation, which got a big boost at the famous Plaza Hotel meeting in New York on September 22, 1985. At that meeting, the Group of Five agreed to a concerted effort to lower the value of the dollar - largely by coordinating the downward movement of interest rates, a step that has nourished the financial markets. Indeed, the stock market has had one of its biggest booms in history.
Last month, Mr. Baker and his team engineered a new burst of dollar devaluation, because the 40 percent decline up to Jan. 1 had failed to reduce the trade deficit noticeably. Largely against the wishes of America's industrial partners, the dollar this year has been pushed down 7.4 percent against the mark and 4.4 percent against the yen.
In a state of alarm about the climbing yen, which he feared was inflicting damage on the Japanese economy, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa made an emergency trip to Washington two weeks ago, in an effort to persuade Mr. Baker to help stop the yen from rising further. And Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, accused the United States of ''playing with fire'' in talking the dollar down and the mark up. Both the Germans and Japanese bitterly resent being pushed around by the Americans.
This holds as strongly in the area of trade as currencies. Last week, after the United States settled a dispute over grain exports with the European Community, with the Europeans yielding to an American threat of a 200 percent tariff, a European official said, ''We prefer this to a trade war; there would be no winners. But what's bad is that we made concessions. The community always ends up by accepting the will of the Americans.''
Despite such resentment of American pressure - or leadership -there are grounds for hope that the Reagan Administration will succeed in getting the other major industrial countries to go along with its exchange-rate, interest-rate, trade-expansion and global-growth strategy.
The recent meeting in Washington between Secretary Baker and Finance Minister Miyazawa looks more and more like a victory for the United States. Japan appears to have gotten the message that America will let the market carry the dollar down if the Japanese do not take actions to step up the growth of their economy. Mr. Baker, on the other hand, is promising to help stabilize the dollar-yen relationship if Japan follows through on the stimulus that it promised at an earlier Baker-Miyazawa meeting, last Oct. 31. ASIDE benefit of Mr. Baker's hang-tough policy may yet come from the Germans. While still grumbling about not wanting to be a ''locomotive'' for the Americans, the German Bundesbank cut its two key interest rates even before last Sunday's election, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl was re-elected by a lower plurality than he expected. A poor showing by the right-wing nationalists increases the likelihood that the Germans will stop being so heavy-handed and even arrogant in their resistance to the American approach to economic growth.
Secretary Baker is not going for quick, spectacular gains. Rather, he sees himself as pursuing something like Woody Hayes's football strategy at Ohio State - ''three yards and a cloud of dust.'' The Plaza agreement in September 1985 was the first three yards, followed last March by a Group of Five coordinated reduction in central bank rates. A month later, there was a second round of discount-rate cuts by the G-5 minus Germany, and in May at the Tokyo economic summit the G-7 (the G-5 plus Canada and Italy) agreed to closer policy coordination. Last September there was G-7 agreement on multilateral surveillance, and in October came the Baker-Miyazawa agreement.
''These six steps,'' said Secretary Baker, ''are only a start. We need to build on them while keeping our expectations within reasonable bounds.'' The next Group of Five or Group of Seven meeting, expected early this month, is more likely to produce not some magnificent breakthrough, but another three yards and a cloud of dust.
However, if the American push bogs down and a cooperative spirit is lacking among the major industrial nations, a crack-up still could come, with severe political as well as economic consequences for the world. It was the absence of that spirit that produced the Depression half a century ago. While history never repeats itself exactly, there are enough similarities to that earlier economic disaster to suggest that the gods of inflation, depression and nationalism are still haunting the world economy -and could dominate it if international cooperation is missing.
The dangers to the increasingly integrated world economy stem from several sources. One threat is that the United States dollar, the world's key currency will go into a free fall. Fears of a collapsing dollar could cause capital flight from the United States, resulting in a lack of funds to finance the Federal budget deficit, the trade deficit and private investment. That, in turn, would mean climbing interest rates and a plummeting economy and stock market. Or, if the Federal Reserve sought to escape from the problem by, in effect, simply creating more money to replace the departing foreign capital, its action could bring on inflation that would further undermine the national currency.
Another danger is that the wide imbalances in trade - America's $175 billion deficit last year and trade surpluses of $80 and $50 billion, respectively, for Japan and Germany - will set off a wave of protectionism and competitive devaluations. The resulting threats to national industries and to the jobs and incomes of workers and farmers could make nations adopt policies of autarky, or self-sufficiency, walling themselves off from foreign competition and capital flows in the hope of achieving economic survival. The last time this solution was tried, the fall in world trade only aggravated the Depression.
And if world trade should founder, the poor countries of the Third World, whose foreign obligations have climbed above $900 billion, might default on their enormous foreign debts. That would inflict a heavy blow on the biggest Western banks and endanger the world financial system.
Until the early 1980's, the orthodox, Keynesian solution for a nation's problems of insufficient growth, overcapacity and unemployment has been for the Government to increase the demand for the goods and services that a nation has the capacity to produce. The prescription for increasing demand has been to cut taxes, step up Government spending and enlarge the budget deficit.
But the huge buildup of the American budget deficits and the total national debt of more than $2 trillion make traditional solutions obsolete. With the United States so dependent on capital from abroad, it is difficult and even dangerous for the nation to escape its burdens simply by increasing total demand through still greater increases in public and private borrowing. The harvest could be heightened inflationary pressure, a slowing inflow or even an outflow of foreign capital, a decline in investment and further loss of international competitiveness.
What do these new conditions imply for economic policy? The greatest change appears to be that the unit for policy thinking must become the world economy rather than the national economy. The United States has been pushing in that direction, focusing its immediate efforts on a realignment of exchange rates, with the dollar moving down and the mark and the yen rising. THE decline started in late February 1985, but the Plaza agreement fortified the decline - and strengthened the bull market in stocks and bonds around the world. The dollar's fall continued into 1986, but after the middle of the year Japan and West Germany resisted further depreciation, fearing loss of export markets. The United States urged both countries, if they wished to avoid further dollar depreciation, to use fiscal and monetary policy, especially tax reform and lower interest rates, to spur the growth of their own economies.
Japan and the Europeans insisted, however, that the problems of global imbalance and stagnation were the Americans' fault, a consequence of the Reagan Administration's huge and continuous budget deficits. They contended that the United States had failed to deliver on its part of the Plaza agreement - bringing down the budget deficit as the Europeans and Japanese accepted depreciation of the dollar.
President Reagan has, at least rhetorically, accepted the gravity of the budget deficit; in his State of the Union message he called the deficit ''outrageous,'' drawing an uproarious, if somewhat mocking and comic response from the Democrats, who seek to hold him responsible.
In briefing reporters on the new Economic Report of the President last Thursday, Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, accepted the European and Japanese view; he said the Federal budget deficit and the trade deficit were ''two very important problems'' that were linked.
Mr. Baker's effort to persuade the others to go along with the American approach has been reinforced by the latent threat of American protectionism. Foreigners know that Mr. Reagan, politically weakened by the Republican loss of the Senate and by the Iran-contra affair, could have more trouble in staving off protectionist legislation from the 100th Congress. Legislators, however, appear to be looking for ways to avoid naked protectionism, whether through ''market-opening'' approaches and a productivity-based ''competitiveness'' campaign.
These are extemely difficult tasks but the United States, even with its weakened economic position in the world, seems determined to work at their solutions.
The most important aim of economic cooperation in the year ahead will be to keep the world economy moving forward. For within a pattern of growth the serious problems of world debt, trade and currency imbalances can be contained, and progress can be made toward their solution.
Despite the resistance of traditional national politics and interest-group pressures, the development of internationally integrated fiscal and monetary policies has become vital to the economic well-being of every country. THE DECLINE: A CHRONOLOGY
Jan. 17, 1985 - With the dollar rising, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan says the United States will intervene in currency markets, acting jointly with other nations to force the dollar down.
Jan. 21 - Western nations begin selling dollars from their reserves to halt its sharp rise.
Late February - The dollar hits its peak of 263 yen and 3.44 West German marks.
March 1 - With imports rising sharply, President Reagan officially backs intervention in the currency markets as a means of reining in the dollar. Soon after the announcement, the dollar begins the decline that has continued to this day.
Sept. 22 - At the Plaza Hotel in New York, the United States, Britain, France, Japan and West Germany agree to work in concert to drive down the dollar. Although the group takes no specific actions and announces no numerical targets, the threat of intervention spurs widespread dollar selling.
Feb. 20, 1986 - With the dollar down about 30 percent since the Plaza meeting, Paul A. Volcker, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, states in Congressional testimony that the dollar has dropped enough and expresses concern that a protracted decline may undermine confidence in the currency.
March 25 - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone attempts to talk down the value of the yen and threatens intervention, but traders continue to drive down the dollar.
Oct. 31 - At a Washington meeting, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reportedly agree that the dollar should not sink lower than approximately 155 yen. Japan says it will stimulate its economy and cuts its discount rate to a post-war low of 3 percent. The dollar rises sharply on news of the agreement.
November - The United States' monthly trade deficit rises to a recordf of $19.2 billion. Though later revised downward, the data are taken as a sign that the declining dollar has not yet achieved the long-awaited improvement in the nation's balance of trade.
Jan. 11, 1987 - Turbulence in European currency markets, caused in part by a weak dollar, prompts the seven nations of the European Monetary System to realign their currencies.
Jan. 14 - Facing intense political pressure to curb the trade deficit, the Administration leaks word that it wants the dollar to decline further.
Jan. 16 - The dollar has lost 3.7 percent of its value against the mark and 2.6 percent against the yen in one week, despite heavy intervention by the Bundesbank and the Central Bank of Japan.
Jan. 20 - Japan's Mr. Miyazawa flies to Washington to talk with Treasury Secretary Baker, hoping to get his help in arresting the dollar's slide. Mr. Baker refuses to make any firm pledges, and the dollar continues its decline.
Jan. 21 - The dollar falls further, despite a discount-rate cut by West Germany, and ends the week at 153.75 yen and 1.8325 marks.
Jan. 30 - The United States reports that its trade deficit narrowed to $10.6 billion in December, its lowest level since March 1985. - AUDREY D. GRUMHAUS

Abstract: Some of Mr. [Paul A. Volcker]'s strongest admirers, while hoping he remains on the job, believe that he might be wise ''to declare victory,'' as one put it, ''and leave town.'' For one thing, they say, the current economic situation is about as good as it's going to get for a while. Down the line, a crisis could erupt from the heavy trade deficit or the budget deficit or from the build-up of third world debt. Why not, then, use this relatively calm moment, they say, to turn over the reins to somebody else, perhaps Secretary of State George P. Shultz or Wall Street consultant Alan Greenspan, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the mid-70's. IT seems odd, at least on the face of it, that the Reagan Administration would even think of saying farewell to the man most responsible for the pre-eminent economic achievement of the past six years, one that Republicans are sure to boast about in the election of 1988. Some say they already detect a certain disengagement by Mr. Volcker. ''Paul seems somewhat more distant from the job today than I've ever seen him before,'' a senior New York bank economist commented. ''You can build a case that he assumes - or knows - he's going and he's already started his preparations for leaving.'' ''Volcker's less interested now in putting up a fight for it than he was in 1983,'' summed up Jude Wanniski, an economic consultant who knows the chairman. ''If they ask him to stay on he would, but I don't think he's going to campaign.'' [Reagan]'S 'GANG OF FOUR'

Full text: UNTIL about six weeks ago, those who profess to know who's who in this town said that Paul A. Volcker had become a lame duck - a man whose chances of being reappointed head of the Federal Reserve had fallen well below 50-50 and who had begun to weigh seriously some of the juicy seven-figure-a-year offers dangling before him.
Some observers even said they detected a certain detachment in Mr. Volcker's performance in the world's mightiest financial job. He had, they said, not engaged in the subtle lobbying that would have signaled his eagerness to remain in power.
Mr. Volcker's departure, in many eyes, would be a sharp blow to confidence in American economic policy making and could lead, among other things, to a run on the dollar. Like two of his modern predecessors, William McChesney Martin Jr. and Arthur F. Burns, Mr. Volcker has come to be seen as an almost impossibly tough act to follow.
But in the wake of the Administration's problems over selling arms to Iran, the odds seem to have shifted abruptly. Mr. Volcker now appears at least as likely to stay as to go, prompting many on Wall Street and in central banks and ministries around the world to heave some tentative sighs of relief.
''Given what's happening in Washington, his chances of being reappointed are probably pretty good,'' asserts Sam Nakagama, head of the economic advisory firm of Nakagama & Wallace Inc. ''You could even have a situation in which the White House needs Volcker more than he wants to stay.''
William F. Ford, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and now a savings and loan executive in Cleveland, agreed. ''The odds are good he'll be around,'' he declared.
''I think it's at least 60-40 he stays,'' estimated James F. Smith, a former Fed staff member now at the University of Texas.
The will-he-or-won't-he speculation about the Fed leader heated up last week with the resignation of Henry C. Wallich, the longest-serving of the Federal Reserve Board's seven members, who has been ill since the fall of 1985. Mr. Wallich and Emmett J. Rice, who is also retiring from the board this month, have been Mr. Volcker's stoutest anti-inflation allies.
Some of Mr. Volcker's strongest admirers, while hoping he remains on the job, believe that he might be wise ''to declare victory,'' as one put it, ''and leave town.'' For one thing, they say, the current economic situation is about as good as it's going to get for a while. Down the line, a crisis could erupt from the heavy trade deficit or the budget deficit or from the build-up of third world debt. Why not, then, use this relatively calm moment, they say, to turn over the reins to somebody else, perhaps Secretary of State George P. Shultz or Wall Street consultant Alan Greenspan, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the mid-70's. IT seems odd, at least on the face of it, that the Reagan Administration would even think of saying farewell to the man most responsible for the pre-eminent economic achievement of the past six years, one that Republicans are sure to boast about in the election of 1988.
Although the nation paid the price of a major recession, Mr. Volcker's Fed has managed to chop double-digit inflation by two-thirds and preside over a business expansion now entering its fifth year.
''They delivered him the wild horse of raging inflation and he turned it into a household pet,'' said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
There are various reasons, however, why the Administration is not eager to reappoint Mr. Volcker chairman and why it sought to ease him out in late 1984 by offering him the presidency of the World Bank. One is that he is a nominal Democrat, first named to the board by President Jimmy Carter, and a vigorous anti-inflationist who might be less likely than a replacement to provide enough money to finance a pre-election boom.
''Volcker is just not part of their team,'' observed one politically attuned banker. While Fed chairmen are not formal members of any ''team,'' the central bank has never been entirely immune from political pressures of the day.
A second argument against reappointment is that Mr. Volcker is not the committed deregulator of financial markets that many conservatives would like. He constantly worries, for example, that a fragmentation of the financial system would make it more vulnerable to shocks.
A third argument against reappointment is that Donald T. Regan, the President's chief of staff is known not to like him.
But the latter problem may have become irrelevant in recent weeks. Mr. Regan appears to be badly wounded by the Iran arms disclosures, and could be departing himself. If he stays, Mr. Regan is less likely to be the deciding voice either in filling the two immediate vacancies on the Fed board or in the chairmanship itself.
The result, many believe, could be a desire by an embattled President to keep Mr. Volcker on, with Mr. Regan unable to prevent it.
''Volcker stands as a symbol of real integrity,'' asserted Robert V. Roosa, a former Fed and Kennedy Administration official. The world financial system is ''just brittle enough'' to require a Fed chief of unquestioned rectitude and of proven international stature, Mr. Roosa observed, and few candidates seem to fill the bill.
Yet the Administration may have a tough job convincing Washington's most powerful economist to stay on at a post that he has obviously relished since 1979. One close friend reports that Mr. Volcker, who will turn 60 in September, is now ''struggling'' with the decision.
Throughout a career spent almost entirely in the Government, Mr. Volcker has seemed almost oblivious to the financial blandishments of the private sector. At the pinnacle of world finance he earns a relatively paltry $75,100 a year. In the private sector he could easily command 20 times that, or more. He is clearly aware of the monetary sacrifice he has made - one source says he even refuses presents of fine cigars for fear he'll become hooked on higher-quality smokes than his 30-cent Antonio y Cleopatra Grenadiers. He may be tiring of his spartan rumpled-suit-and-spaghetti life style and the drain of maintaining households in Washington for himself and in New York for his ailing wife.
One intimate says he has personally relayed to Mr. Volcker two propositions offering what he called ''unbelievable'' compensation. One would pay $2 million for a year of lecturing; the other would combine an investment firm partnership with a university professorship.
The friend reports, however, that Mr. Volcker offered in response a ''Buddha expression'' that gave no hint of his intentions.
Some say they already detect a certain disengagement by Mr. Volcker. ''Paul seems somewhat more distant from the job today than I've ever seen him before,'' a senior New York bank economist commented. ''You can build a case that he assumes - or knows - he's going and he's already started his preparations for leaving.''
Some observers say that a major factor in his decision would be Mr. Volcker's relations with the board. As of Jan. 1, all the other governors will have been chosen by President Reagan (see Box).
But Fed watchers say the chances are small that serious intramural friction will erupt. If it did, Mr. Volcker would almost certainly continue to dominate the Federal Open Market Committee, a 12-member body that sets monetary policy. AT the first hint that Mr. Volcker might leave, intense speculation began to arise as to who might take his place. A survey of 371 investment decision makers taken by Drexel Burnham's Mr. Hoey last month before the Iran controversy heated up ranked E. Gerald Corrigan, the Volcker protege who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the man in whom they had the ''most confidence'' as successor.
Mr. Corrigan was favored by 26.2 percent of the respondents, followed by Mr. Greenspan, president of Townsend-Greenspan Inc., with 18.4 percent and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d with 8.9 percent.
However, when asked to name the most likely successor, the group listed Fed vice chairman Manuel H. Johnson, followed by Mr. Baker, Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Regan. Mr. Corrigan ranked fifth. Those who know Mr. Baker best insist that he has no interest in the job. Washington hands, in fact, believe a more likely choice - provided that Mr. Johnson does not become the first No. 2 to be elevated - is Mr. Shultz. This assumes both that Mr. Shultz, an economist by training, is not tainted by the Iran arms episode and that he is willing, at age 65, to take the post.
A dark horse is Paul W. McCracken, a former Fed official and a chief economic adviser to former President Nixon. He will turn 70 this week.
Whether a post-Volcker Federal Reserve would prove much different from today's central bank is almost pure conjecture.
''As far as monetary policy goes, the answer is flatly no,'' declared a top former Fed official. But others disagree, suggesting that Mr. Johnson, for one, would probably be inclined toward faster money expansion than Mr. Volcker. The latter is known to believe that 3 percent annual economic growth is quite acceptable in current circumstances, while the Reagan appointees tend to think this too modest a goal.
But many, including Mickey D. Levy, an economist at Philadelphia's Fidelity Bank, put little stock in such neat characterizations. ''The Federal Reserve,'' he declared, is ''very human'' both in the independence of its members and in their tendency to be heavily influenced by the latest economic statistics.
The biggest change, many say, could come in the Fed's approach to its role as supervisor. Mr. Volcker has resisted proposed liberalization in banking powers, arguing that a further blurring of the distinction between commercial and investment banking, for example, risked the integrity of the financial structure.
Of this, the former top Fed official declared: ''A new chairman might have a very different attitude, might seek to break new ground.''
It is also possible, if reappointment is offered to Mr. Volcker, that his decision could hinge on his assessment of the caliber, rather than the economic views, of the other board members. One clue to watch is the identity of the two new members to be designated shortly. One vacancy is reported likely to be filled by either George W. Douglas, a deregulation-minded former commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, or Edward M. Kelley, a Houston businessman. (Since both are Texans, only one can be chosen.) A high-quality, nonideological board might serve to convince Mr. Volcker that he could safely turn over the reins.
''Volcker's less interested now in putting up a fight for it than he was in 1983,'' summed up Jude Wanniski, an economic consultant who knows the chairman. ''If they ask him to stay on he would, but I don't think he's going to campaign.'' REAGAN'S 'GANG OF FOUR'
Last February, when Reagan-appointed governors became a majority on the Federal Reserve Board, there was much speculation that this Gang of Four would vote as a bloc for stepped-up expansion in the money supply. The foursome is generally more optimistic than its colleagues about how fast the economy can grow without producing unacceptably high inflation.
However, policy making seems to have been little affected by the Gang's arrival. Dissenting votes have been rare and, according to Fed watchers, there has never been a 4-3 decision along the presumed ''ideological'' lines.
Yet the possibility remains that Paul A. Volcker, whose second term as chairman runs out next August, could yet find himself in an untenable position because of changes in the board's composition. When President Reagan's choices to succeed the departing Henry C. Wallich and Emmett J. Rice are installed next year, Mr. Volcker will be facing, in theory at least, a Gang of Six.
Elevated to vice chairman of the board in August 1986, six months after becoming a governor. Age 37. Usually called
Manley. An ardent supply-sider while serving in the Reagan Treasury, he has played down or perhaps even modified his views since moving to the Fed. Said to have proven ''responsible'' and properly respectful of Fed traditions. Despite his youth, insiders say he has a shot at succeeding Mr. Volcker, although the No. 2 job has never been considered a steppingstone. A native of Troy, Ala. Earned a Ph.D. in economics at Florida State University in 1977. Taught economics at George Mason University. At Treasury, helped formulate economic policy and played a big role in designing the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Author of four books and has wide experience as a consultant. His term as governor expires in the year 2000.
A Kansas native who owes his seat to strong support by Senator Bob Dole. Age 56.
Proud of his diverse background as farmer, banker and college professor. Initially emphasized his ''pro-growth'' tendencies but recently has talked a strong anti-inflation line. His early outspokenness on the need to counter the depression in farming led some to perceive him as soft on inflation. Took a big gamble soon after joining the board by voting against Mr. Volcker on timing of a discount-rate cut. Since 1950, has been an active partner in a 3,300-acre Kansas farm. Ph.D. from University of Kansas. Long-time economics teacher at Ottawa (Kansas) University. Six years as member of the state House of Representatives. Extensive foreign travel. Sworn in on Feb. 7, 1986, the same day as Mr. Johnson, to fill an unexpired term ending in January 1994.
Second woman to serve on the board. Age 54. Was Michigan's
Commissioner of Financial Institutions in 1981-82, then professor of finance at Central Michigan University until nominated to the board. Opposed by many
Democrats, who called her unqualified, she survived a harrowing year-long struggle for confirmation. She has published little but describes her views as ''eclectic.'' After early experience as a Fed staffer in Washington and Chicago, spent 10 years as a commercial banker, including a stint as chief economist for the National Bank of Detroit. Close ties to the automobile business. Shortly after becoming governor, she made a highly publicized complaint that Mr. Volcker was running the Fed like a dictator. Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, where she was a protege of Paul W. McCracken. Installed in July 1984 to a full 14-year term.
The newest governor, only four months in office, he provides international expertise to fill the gap left by the resignation last week of his friend, Henry C. Wallich. Age 46. Born in Cologne, Germany, he came to the United States shortly after high school - and still marvels at his rise in the American financial establishment. A Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota, he taught at the Universities of California and Hawaii, spent four years at the International Monetary Fund. Head of international research for Bank of America just before joining the board. So far has kept a low profile and taken a pragmatic approach. Witty and urbane, he jokes that the Fed's regulatory work makes him feel like Judge Wapner of TV's ''People's Court.'' Well-connected with European central bankers. Author of five books. Filling an unexpired term that runs to 1996.

Abstract: There is bound to be a dispute about the priorities. Robert D. Hormats, vice president for investment banking at Goldman, Sachs & Company and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, is one who thinks that combating the risk of economic weakness should be the Fed's top priority. He notes that Senator Bob Dole, the Republican majority leader, has been ''speaking for further cuts in the discount rate.'' Mr. Hormats sees the United States in a ''bit of a Catch-22'' situation: If the United States does not reduce the dollar's exchange rate further now, the prospects of a worsening trade deficit will increase; but if the Fed fails to bring interest rates down, the economy will weaken, driving the dollar further down anyway. In Mr. Hormats's view, the right course is to take the risk of cutting interest rates to move the dollar down and stimulate the economy while you can afford the risk of inflation. He sees a greater risk that, if nothing is done, ''we can really lose control of our currency, as Britain did in 1976.''

Full text: WHEN Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, goes before Congress today to deliver the central bank's midyear review, he is likely to encounter a tougher grilling than usual on the Fed's forecasts and plans for correcting the economy's perceived weaknesses.
Anxieties about the economy were heightened yesterday by the Commerce Department's estimate that the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, grew at an annual rate of only 1.1 percent in the April-June quarter, the slowest pace since the end of the 1981-82 recession.
The Fed's report to Congress is cautiously optimistic about the economic outlook. For 1986, it expects real G.N.P. to rise within a range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. That implies a slight improvement in the second half over the 2.4 percent rate in the new figures for the first half.
However, the Fed's forecast of 2.5 to 3 percent for 1986 marks a downward revision from its 3 to 3.5 percent growth range, projected six months ago. The Fed has also marked down its inflation forecast for this year to 2.25 to 2.75 percent from its original range of 3 to 4 percent. The just-reported inflation rate in the second quarter, as measured by the G.N.P. deflator, was only 2.1 percent, the lowest rate since the second quarter of 1967.
For next year, the Fed sees a moderate pickup. It is projecting inflation-adjusted growth of G.N.P. at 3 to 3.5 percent, with inflation moving up slightly, to 3 to 4 percent. And it predicts that the unemployment rate will decline to 6 3/4 percent by the final quarter of 1987, down a bit from its forecast of 7 percent in the last quarter of this year.
The main issue facing Congress in reacting to the Fed's midyear review is whether it has given too high a value to the risk of inflation relative to the risk of sluggish growth or recession.
There is bound to be a dispute about the priorities. Robert D. Hormats, vice president for investment banking at Goldman, Sachs & Company and a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, is one who thinks that combating the risk of economic weakness should be the Fed's top priority. He notes that Senator Bob Dole, the Republican majority leader, has been ''speaking for further cuts in the discount rate.''
Mr. Volcker has often argued that the Fed should cut its discount rate in step with other countries, lest it cause a ''free fall'' of the dollar. Two weeks ago, however, it did cut that rate without waiting for the others, and the dollar, while continuing to slide, has not plunged in a free fall.
Mr. Hormats sees the United States in a ''bit of a Catch-22'' situation: If the United States does not reduce the dollar's exchange rate further now, the prospects of a worsening trade deficit will increase; but if the Fed fails to bring interest rates down, the economy will weaken, driving the dollar further down anyway.
In Mr. Hormats's view, the right course is to take the risk of cutting interest rates to move the dollar down and stimulate the economy while you can afford the risk of inflation. He sees a greater risk that, if nothing is done, ''we can really lose control of our currency, as Britain did in 1976.''
Not all economists think further cuts in the dollar's value provide the answer to the trade deficit, which has played so key a role in slowing economic growth. Jeffrey R. Leeds, managing director of the Chemical Bank of New York, says the bulk of United States trade with Canada and the Pacific Basin, excluding Japan, is ''unaffected by the highly publicized decline in the value of the dollar, since those currencies have tended to remain steady or have lost value relative to the dollar over the past 15 months.''
While cutting the dollar's value may not be the entire answer to the trade deficit, most economists consider it crucial to improving the American trade position. The alternative would be for Japan, West Germany and the other industrial countries to spur their economies as a means of increasing markets for American and other exports.
But the efforts of Mr. Volcker, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and other Administration officials to ''jawbone'' the Europeans and Japanese into adopting more stimulative fiscal and monetary policies appears to be getting nowhere.
The choice for the United States is whether to risk unilateral action to bring down interest rates and the dollar - or wait for cooperative action by the other industrial countries.
In his session with Congress today, Mr. Volcker is likely to find himself under pressure to stop waiting and take more action to reduce interest rates, to spur exports and domestic investment as a way out of a slump. It is a situation calling for the fanciest of footwork, at which his skills are legendary. But he is likely to wind up assuring Congress that the Fed will do whatever is necessary to prevent a recession.

Abstract: Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. and one of Wall Street's best-known foes of big deficits, sees a figure of $210 billion for 1986. For next year, he predicts $175 billion to $185 billion. ''But that's hardly an accomplishment,'' he said. ''It's still an extraordinary amount.'' Most projections exceed the earlier ones because the economy has taken some curious turns. One was the 50 percent plunge in oil prices, which has helped bring this year's inflation rate down a full percentage point or more to about 2 percent. ''I do agree that the political culture has probably changed,'' said Alan Greenspan, who was President Ford's chief economic adviser. The Senate's tax-revision bill, like the Gramm-Rudman law, shows the change. ''Twenty years ago you couldn't have gotten two votes for that,'' he said. ''The deficit will decline to a point where it has minor economic implications.'' ''We are headed for 2 percent of G.N.P., or $100 billion, from 5 percent,'' said John H. Palmer, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a policy research organization. ''We're on track with that without any additional action by Congress. We're there without any further cuts in domestic spending or with any tax increases. We don't need Gramm-Rudman to get us there. Gramm-Rudman just gets us from 2 percent to zero.''

Full text: The decline in the Federal budget deficit, a trend that the Reagan Administration, Congress and private economists saw in the cards for this year, has not shown up. It should, they say - maybe in a month or two, maybe next year - but so far expectations are running ahead of the evidence.
Such authorities still say that the deficit has been tamed for now, that in relation to the growing economy it is already falling and that its apparent damage, in high interest rates and the strong dollar, is abating.
But they also say that the actual deficit figures will start shrinking later and possibly more slowly than they thought. The main reason is that the economy is proving weaker, with less inflation and higher military spending, than they had predicted.
Early this year the President's Office of Management and Budget and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office arrived at similar deficits for the fiscal year 1986, which will end Sept. 30. The C.B.O. said it would be $208 billion, and the O.M.B. said $206 billion - both smaller than the record $212 billion of fiscal 1985. New Budget-Balancing Law
Both also predicted deficits of $181 billion next year and $104 billion five years from now. They arrived at these even without taking account of the cuts required in 1987 and beyond by the new Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law to drive the deficit to $144 billion next year and to zero by 1991.
The agencies have yet to produce new computations, but other numbers point up, not down. Through April of the fiscal year 1986, the Treasury's monthly reports of spending and tax receipts show a deficit of $126 billion, compared with a deficit a year earlier of $119 billion. If the accounts continue at that pace through September, this year's deficit would be $216 billion, or $4 billion bigger than last year's.
Extrapolating figures of such magnitude is risky. By year-end some economists expect them to show a larger deficit; some do not. John H. Makin, a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a research organization in Washington, says the deficit will be $220 billion this year and, without any Gramm-Rudman cuts, $190 billion next year. Outlook as Seen by Kaufman
Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. and one of Wall Street's best-known foes of big deficits, sees a figure of $210 billion for 1986. For next year, he predicts $175 billion to $185 billion. ''But that's hardly an accomplishment,'' he said. ''It's still an extraordinary amount.'' Most projections exceed the earlier ones because the economy has taken some curious turns. One was the 50 percent plunge in oil prices, which has helped bring this year's inflation rate down a full percentage point or more to about 2 percent.
Most people welcome lower inflation. It means they pay less than they otherwise would for much of what they buy. But it also means that businesses and individuals get lower profits and wages than they otherwise would. That, in turn, means that the Government's tax collections are less than they would have been had inflation remained above 3 percent.
Falling oil prices have fattened the deficit in another way. They put the relatively small part of the economy that benefits from higher oil prices -the energy industry and areas that depend upon it - on the ropes. Shrinkage of Tax Revenues
Bankrupt oil drillers, unemployed roughnecks and owners of empty office buildings in Dallas and Houston do not produce much taxable income.
Then there is the rest of the economy. Falling interest rates are supposed to give it a kick, but so far only the residential real estate business has taken advantage of them. Cheaper oil is supposed to help most businesses and consumers, and the cheaper dollar is supposed to help farms and industries that compete with foreigners. The help, however, has been slow in coming.
The economy grew at an annual rate of only 1.8 percent from October through March, about half what forecasters had expected, slowing the Government's tax revenues.
Another reason for the fatter deficit is military spending, which is mostly responsible for pushing all Federal outlays about 4 percent above last year's pace - even though the military budget has stabilized.
But the actual flow of the spending, with much of it authorized long before the Pentagon actually starts sending money to its suppliers, is hard to gauge ahead of time. And during the first half of the current fiscal year, it has run beyond analysts' projections. Fast Deficit Growth Ended
But economists and Government officials remain confident on their main point: Rapid deficit growth in the Reagan years, starting at $79 billion in 1981, has been arrested.
As recently as a year ago, the Congressional Budget Office and others were projecting deficits rising to $300 billion and beyond. But not now. ''Three hundred billion?'' said Mr. Makin. ''That's history. Congress has already done dramatic cutting in the non-defense area, and now they're starting in on defense.''
It is tough to find a member of Congress who says he is not committed to driving the deficits down, even if the Supreme Court, as widely expected, jettisons the mechanism in the balanced-budget law that forces $36 billion annual cuts in the deficits.
Congress might stop short of pushing the deficit anywhere close to zero, but it seems to want a substantial reduction. ''My view is, there must still be tough action to see that the downward path continues,'' said Representative William H. Gray 3d, Democrat from Philadelphia and chairman of the House Budget Committee. Change in Political Culture
''I do agree that the political culture has probably changed,'' said Alan Greenspan, who was President Ford's chief economic adviser. The Senate's tax-revision bill, like the Gramm-Rudman law, shows the change. ''Twenty years ago you couldn't have gotten two votes for that,'' he said. ''The deficit will decline to a point where it has minor economic implications.''
By the measure that many economists consider more significant than monetary figures, deficit spending is already declining. It has dropped from a Reagan-era peak (in 1983) of 6.3 percent of the overall economy, or the gross national product, to 5.3 percent last year and 5 percent now.
Legislation already on the books points to still lower percentages if the economy avoids a severe recession in the rest of the decade and if Congress holds military spending growth to the inflation rate or slightly above.
''We are headed for 2 percent of G.N.P., or $100 billion, from 5 percent,'' said John H. Palmer, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a policy research organization. ''We're on track with that without any additional action by Congress. We're there without any further cuts in domestic spending or with any tax increases. We don't need Gramm-Rudman to get us there. Gramm-Rudman just gets us from 2 percent to zero.''

U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT SLOW 1.7% RATE IN SECOND QUARTER

Abstract: The Federal Reserve's policy changes, in the face of the stalemate in Congress over the budget deficits, also carry risks of higher inflation and another recession. ''It's a difficult thing to pull off,'' Mr. [Stephen S. Roach] said. ''This was the slowest rate of nonfarm inventory investment in two years,'' said Joseph Carson, an economist at Merrill Lynch Economics. ''It points to some modest pickup in production in the third quarter.'' Other figures in the report that cheered economists were those for inflation. One gauge, the implicit price deflator, showed only 2.8 percent inflation in the quarter and another, the fixed-weighted price index, showed 3.8 percent. Both marked declines from the first-quarter rates. Among other things, he said that lower interest rates should stimulate new-home construction and automobile sales. ''Lower interest rates,'' he added, ''augur well for all interest-sensitive industries.''

Full text: The nation's economy grew at an annual rate of only 1.7 percent in the spring, the Commerce Department said today.
The April-to-June rate of gain for the gross national product, the country's total outpouring of goods and services, was much slower than the Government first estimated last month, but the figure did not surprise many.
The earlier ''flash'' estimate of 3.1 percent second-quarter growth was based on incomplete figures for April and May and none at all for June. As more figures for such areas as consumer spending, housing, investment and trade have been reported, analysts suspected that the overall G.N.P. growth rate would prove slower than the initial estimate.
Lackluster Behavior

Another important report today, showing growth of only one-tenth of 1 percent in industrial production in June, following a similar figure for May, was further evidence of the economy's lackluster behavior. [Page D2.] The new 1.7 percent G.N.P. figure, coming on top of a mere three-tenths of 1 percent rate in the first quarter, meant that, over the first six months, the economy grew at a rate of only 1 percent. Such a pace has proved too weak to produce declines in an unemployment rate that has been locked at 7.2 percent since February.
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted a moderately strong second-half rate of expansion of roughly 4 percent, but some other analysts were less optimistic, chiefly because of the large share of American markets imports have claimed. John M. Albertine, an economist and business lobbyist, foresaw at best ''less mediocre'' statistics for the rest of the year.
New Difficulties on Deficits

The slow growth of the first half and the possibility of little acceleration for the balance of the year suggest little reduction in unemployment and new difficulties for Congress and the Administration in their now-stalemated efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficits.
Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment firm, said that the lower tax collections of an economy growing at half the 4 percent rate the Administration originally predicted for this year could add $20 billion to $30 billion to the current fiscal year's expected deficit of well over $200 billion.
The report also provided new ammunition for members of Congress who have been pressing the Administration to adopt tough restraints on imported goods, particularly from Japan and other Far Eastern countries that export freely but restrict sales of imported goods in their own markets.
''The United States Government is sitting and watching as this country's manufacturing capacity is being dismantled brick by brick,'' said Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, author of a bill to impose a 25 percent import surcharge on such countries.
The report on the G.N.P., the Government's most comprehensive gauge of economic performance, comes at a moment when analysts suspect that the country appears to be sliding through the shoals of an important transition.
Partly as a result of an easier credit policy by the Federal Reserve Board to deal with the nation's trade deficit and the recession in manufacturing, they say, the dollar has fallen 15 to 20 percent from the peak it reached in February, and interest rates, which have been unusually high for five years, have dropped. Mr. Baldrige said that the dollar would have to fall 20 percent to 25 percent more before domestic manufacturers would be competitive again.
'Difficult Thing to Pull Off'

But the Federal Reserve's policy changes, in the face of the stalemate in Congress over the budget deficits, also carry risks of higher inflation and another recession. ''It's a difficult thing to pull off,'' Mr. Roach said.
The Commerce Department attributed the second quarter's small speedup in G.N.P. growth to a revival of business investment, continuing strong spending by consumers, a smaller rise in the trade deficit than in the first quarter and to Government spending, expecially by the military. Business investment, the strongest contributor, grew $6.9 billion in the second quarter after declining $800 million in the first. Investment in new housing, driven partly by declining interest rates, increased $2 billion after rising $800 million.
A significant drag on the economy during the second quarter could prove the silver lining of the third and fourth. Business's inventories of unsold goods and production materials rose only $5.8 billion in the second quarter after rising $35.9 billion in the previous two quarters. The sharp decline meant that business was expecting slower growth and adjusted its inventories accordingly, but now that they are low, economists assume that companies will have to start replenishing them.
''This was the slowest rate of nonfarm inventory investment in two years,'' said Joseph Carson, an economist at Merrill Lynch Economics. ''It points to some modest pickup in production in the third quarter.'' Other figures in the report that cheered economists were those for inflation. One gauge, the implicit price deflator, showed only 2.8 percent inflation in the quarter and another, the fixed-weighted price index, showed 3.8 percent. Both marked declines from the first-quarter rates.
View on Balance of Year

Discussing what to expect in growth for the balance of the year, Mr. Baldrige expanded on his view that, because of the lackluster first half, the Administration would not realize its expected 4 percent growth for the full year but might for the second half.
Among other things, he said that lower interest rates should stimulate new-home construction and automobile sales. ''Lower interest rates,'' he added, ''augur well for all interest-sensitive industries.''
The Federal Reserve also expects relatively strong growth for the balance of the year, of close to 4 percent, but some private economists see rates closer to 2 percent to 3 percent.
The Commerce Department also reported that word of the 1.7 percent G.N.P. figure leaked to the financial community early Wednesday afternoon. The department has asked its inspector general's office to track down the leak, and Mr. Baldrige said the department had some strong leads.
The department, which has not experienced such a leak in more than a year, said that, if any Government employees were involved, they would be subject to a $10,000 fine and a year in jail. The department tries to avoid such leaks because they can influence trading in the markets. In this case, however, Mr. Baldrige said he doubted that the leak had such an effect.

Abstract: Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, hailed the resolution on the treaty as a ''major victory for the forces of arms control.'' Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, added that the statement reflected a consensus in the Senate that the United States ''should do everything we can to restrain ourselves and for the Soviet Union to do likewise.'' ''I think the Senate ought to go ahead and be heard,'' said Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ''It makes a lot more sense to vote first.'' Some conservatives were less than enthusiastic, and Senator Pete Wilson, Republican of California, called the resolution ''mealy mouthed.'' But he said he would vote for it. The key provision states: ''The United States should, through Dec. 31, 1986, continue to refrain from undercutting the provisions of existing strategic offensive arms agreements to the extent that the Soviet Union refrains from undercutting those provisions, or until a new strategic offensive arms agreement is concluded; and provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the U.S. from carrying out other proportionate responses to Soviet undercutting or strategic arms provisions.''

Full text: The Senate overwhelmingly adopted tonight a compromise resolution urging President Reagan to continue to adhere to the second strategic arms treaty with the Soviet Union. But the statement also seems to give approval to a measured move by the Administration to respond to any Soviet violations of the treaty.
By a vote of 90 to 5, the resolution was attached to legislation covering programs for the Pentagon costing up to $232 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The entire bill, which would limit the increase in military spending to the inflation rate, was then approved, 92 to 3.
The military bill that is to go to floor of the House next week is even tighter, providing for no increase to account for inflation.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, hailed the resolution on the treaty as a ''major victory for the forces of arms control.'' Senator Dale Bumpers, Democrat of Arkansas, added that the statement reflected a consensus in the Senate that the United States ''should do everything we can to restrain ourselves and for the Soviet Union to do likewise.''
Approval of the resolution came as the Administration tried to set forth an updated policy toward the treaty, which was concluded with the Soviet Union in 1979 and expires at the end of this year. Although the pact was never ratified, each side has informally agreed to abide by its provisions if the other side does.
At a meeting in Portugal, Western European leaders told Secretary of State George P. Shultz that they would oppose any effort by the Administration to abandon the treaty.
Republican leaders and Administration officials had tried to stave off any expression of senatorial opinion until after Mr. Reagan announced his policy decision on the pact, which he is to do next Monday. But Democrats argued strenuously that the lawmakers should try to influence the Administration's decision.
''I think the Senate ought to go ahead and be heard,'' said Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. ''It makes a lot more sense to vote first.''
The resolution has no force of law, but according to Mr. Nunn it reflects ''continuing skepticism'' on Capitol Hill about the Administration's intentions toward arms control. Similar feelings helped convince the Senate last month to vote to limit MX missile deployment to 50 weapons, half the number requested by the President.
Phrase for Conservatives

In order to satisfy conservatives, who argued for renunication of the treaty, the compromise resolution states that the Administration could carry out ''proportionate responses'' to any Soviet violations of the pact. Senator Nunn said tonight that the phrase remained undefined, but it clearly implied Senate approval for something less than strict adherence to the pact.
Senator James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, said he supported the resolution because the ''proportionate response'' phrase gave the Administration greater flexibility in responding to Soviet violations.
''There are shades of seriousness to violations,'' he said, adding that not all of them should be answered by abrogating the entire treaty.
Some conservatives were less than enthusiastic, and Senator Pete Wilson, Republican of California, called the resolution ''mealy mouthed.'' But he said he would vote for it. The key provision states: ''The United States should, through Dec. 31, 1986, continue to refrain from undercutting the provisions of existing strategic offensive arms agreements to the extent that the Soviet Union refrains from undercutting those provisions, or until a new strategic offensive arms agreement is concluded; and provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the U.S. from carrying out other proportionate responses to Soviet undercutting or strategic arms provisions.''
The resolution also states that before the Administration decides to abrogate the treaty or alter its compliance, it should ''carefully consider'' the impact on existing arms agreements and American security interests, and should consult with Congress.
The policy review now under way in the White House has been brought on by two factors. One is a provision in the treaty that limits each side to deployment of 1,200 missiles carrying multiple warheads. The United States would exceed that limit this fall when a new Trident submarine, the Alaska, begins sea trials armed with 24 missiles.
If the Administration decides to adhere to the treaty, it could stay under the limit by dismantling a Poseidon submarine, which carries 16 missiles. Another option would be to remove 14 Minuteman missiles from their land bases beneath the Western plains.
The other factor causing the Administration's review is the treaty's expiration at the end of the year.
Soviet Violations Charged

In arguing for continued adherence to the treaty, Senator Bumpers said the Soviet Union had clearly violated several provisions of the pact. But he said Moscow would be far more restricted by the 1,200-missile limit than would Washington.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff have indicated they favor continued adherence to the treaty, on the ground that the pact restrains the Soviet Union more than it restrains the United States.
According to Administration officials, the probable result of the debate will be a decision to adhere to the pact, but with some modifications. For instance, instead of dismantling a Poseidon submarine and destroying its missiles to stay under the limit, the President might simply take the ship out of active service.
The resolution was the final obstacle blocking passage of the military bill, which continues or establishes most of the programs allotted to the Pentagon under the $302 billion Senate-passed budget. The rest of the programs would be authorized by other bills. Later in the year, Congress is to consider legislation to provide the funds.
Mr. Reagan originally requested a military spending increase of 6 percent on top of a rise to make up for inflation.
In addition to the provision limiting MX deployment to 50 missiles, the Senate bill would also permit testing of antisatellite weapons, call for a new generation of chemical weapons and make it harder for Government employees to parlay their positions into jobs with military contractors.

Abstract: In a speech prepared for delivery on the House floor Monday and made public today, Mr. [Les Aspin] described the funds as an ''unplanned'' and ''secret'' dividend for the Pentagon. Mr. [Caspar W. Weinberger] used somewhat different phrasing in an appearance on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' when asked about the issue of such surplus funds. ''We give it back and ask that it be applied to next year,'' he said. For developing and buying weapons and equipment, the Reagan Administration has applied a special inflation prediction which is 30 percent higher than the general prediction used for the rest of the Government. This factor is meant to reflect historically high costs for weapons. Seen Using Presidential budget statistics, Mr. Aspin said, ''The Administration has consistently overestimated inflation by a substantial amount, averaging about 1.7 percentage points a year.''

Full text: Because the Reagan Administration overestimated inflation, Congress appropriated $18 billion to $50 billion more than needed for Defense Department programs in the last four years, according to Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
In a speech prepared for delivery on the House floor Monday and made public today, Mr. Aspin described the funds as an ''unplanned'' and ''secret'' dividend for the Pentagon.
The Wisconsin Democrat said he did not suggest wrongdoing on the part of the Defense Department. In a letter, Mr. Aspin did ask Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger to cooperate in seeking ''a more rational and fair system'' to deal with the situation.
Taft Sees 'Achievement'

William H. Taft 4th, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, said in a written statement today that Mr. Aspin was correct in saying that billions of dollars were involved. But in it he said the Pentagon had made a ''remarkable achievement'' in spending less money than expected, which he attributed to better management and to Administration success in controlling inflation.
Mr. Aspin said Congress did not have enough information to calculate precisely the extra money that the Pentagon had received because of faulty inflation predictions. However, he used Pentagon statistics to argue that for the portion of annual military budgets devoted to such items as operations, maintenance and military construction, $18.2 billion had been appropriated to meet inflation levels that did not materialize.
A Subject for Debate

He took this figure as his minimum estimate. He said inflation had also been overestimated for such functions as buying weapons and paying for fuel and that the total surplus might be $50 billion.
The largely unnoticed inflation cushion will probably be an issue when the full House debates its budget resolution. The House Budget Committee voted last week to hold the military budget for the fiscal year 1986 to the same level as this year, with no allowance for inflation. Administration officials asserted that this was irresponsible and damaging to national security. The Senate's budget resolution permits military spending to rise by the Administration's estimate of inflation.
Mr. Taft's statement said, ''We have already returned to the taxpayer billions of dollars we have not spent.''
Mr. Weinberger used somewhat different phrasing in an appearance on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' when asked about the issue of such surplus funds. ''We give it back and ask that it be applied to next year,'' he said.
A staff member from the House Armed Services Committee, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said that, in fact, very little unspent money is returned to the Treasury, but in some cases Congress is made aware of some of the inflation overestimates and is then able to reduce future military appropriations accordingly.
He said this amounted to ''only a fraction'' of the total money involved. He estimated that the total surplus from lower inflation reported to Congress annually varied from $1 billion to $2 billion, a figure much lower than those put forth by Representative Aspin.
Several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed anger last week when Mr. Weinberger, in an attempt to stave off reductions in or elimination of any major weapon-buying programs, reported that the Pentagon had found $1.7 billion in inflation-caused surpluses in the current fiscal year and $3.5 billion in unspent contingency funds and other categories. The senators, including some backers of high military spending, said Mr. Weinberger had damaged his credibility, if only by the timing of his discloRepresentative Aspin suggested that to make inflation predictions more accurate, each appropriation should be calculated on the inflation that occurred in the previous year.
In his speech, Representative Aspin noted that the Pentagon used four different inflation estimates each budget year, including operations, fuel and pay.
For developing and buying weapons and equipment, the Reagan Administration has applied a special inflation prediction which is 30 percent higher than the general prediction used for the rest of the Government. This factor is meant to reflect historically high costs for weapons. Seen Using Presidential budget statistics, Mr. Aspin said, ''The Administration has consistently overestimated inflation by a substantial amount, averaging about 1.7 percentage points a year.''
Moreover, he said, some of the increase in weapon costs was a result of inflation but some was from other factors, such as inefficient production rates and design changes that prevented military industry workers from learning how to cheaply build equipment stable in design. If all or almost all of the cost increase since 1982 is unrelated to inflation, Mr. Aspin said, then ''we have appropriated an unnecessary $30 billion for major weapons.''

Abstract: Christopher Matthews, a spokesman for Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House, said the Mr. [Reagan]'s agreement ''is is the second time that President Reagan has tried to wriggle out of his 1980 campign promise,'' He was referring to Mr. Reagan's short-lived proposal in 1981 to reduce benefits. ''Democrats are going to keep him honest,'' he said. Mr. Reagan said the compromise faced stiff opposition in the Republican- controlled Senate. ''We all agree it is going to be a fight,'' he said. ''We are very optimistic and hopeful and think we have a very good plan.'' Alan K. Simpson, the Senate Republican whip, who was among the negotiators of the compromise, said, ''We have in effect alienated everyone in the United States with this budget. I don't predict where we will go when we get on the floor of the United States Senate and go through the painful votes that will come as people amend their favorite, magnificent projects back in - or try to.''

Full text: President Reagan said today that he thought the budget compromise reached by White House negotiators and Senate Republican leaders was ''a very good plan'' for reducing the deficit. But he was immediately attacked for his agreement to limit the cost-of-living increase for Social Security for three years.
The compromise, reached Thursday after two weeks of negotiations, would reduce spending by $52 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and nearly $300 billion over three years. It would cut the projected 1986 deficit to $175 billion from $227 billion.
Mr. Reagan, in comments as he left the White House for a vacation in California, said the proposal's 3 percent increase in the military budget, on top of an increase to make up for inflation, was the least he would accept. He argued that such an increase would not harm national security.
And he defended his agreement to limit Social Security cost-of-living increases, saying that any Democrats who used the issue in next year's campaigning would ''be lying in their teeth as they did in 1982.''
Attack at News Conference

Mr. Reagan was attacked on the issue in an afternoon news conference held by seven groups representing the elderly. Speakers said he had broken what they described as a pledge in the 1984 campign not to touch Social Security benefits.
White House officials argued that Mr. Reagan had not pledged to protect cost-of-living increases, but rather basic benefits. They said the compromise proposal was acceptable to Mr. Reagan because it guaranteed a 2 percent cost-of-living increase for three years regardless of the rate of inflation, rather than eliminating the increase for one year, as the Senate Budget Committee had proposed.
David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said Mr. Reagan would have preferred not to touch Social Security. ''But that became necessary to glue the package together and a fair way was found to compromise it,'' he said.
Major Concession on Military

The President originally requested a 6 percent increase in the military budget on top of an increase to make up for inflation. The agreement to accept the 3 percent increase, which is likely to be reduced further in Congress, is a major concession. Some Senate negotiators said it reflected Mr. Reagan's willingness to compromise when he decided the time was right.
In December he disappointed some of his staff and angered some Republicans by agreeing to not much more than cosmetic cuts in his proposed military budget.
But White House officals acknowledged that Mr. Reagan had to face the fact that the Senate Budget Committee, in the budget proposal it approved last month, provided no increase in the military budget beyond one to make up for inflation. Republicans in the Senate had argued that if the President did not compromise he faced even larger military budget cuts.
Limits on Social Security

On Social Security, the compromise plan limits the cost-of-living increase to 2 percent for 1986, 1987 and 1988, unless inflation exceeded 4 percent. Then the cost-of-living increase would be the rate of inflation minus two percentage points.
The White House described this agreement as a compromise that would provide larger benefit payments than the Senate Budget Committee's proposal to eliminate the cost-of-living increase for one year. But the compromise proposal limits cost-of-living increases for three years, while under the Budget Committee plan there would have been full increases for inflation after the one year freeze.
Over three years the compromise plan is expected to produce savings of $22.6 billion, slightly more than the $22.4 billion projected under the proposal the Senate Budget Committee approved. And in later years the saving is even greater.
Pepper Assails President

At the news conference of associations representing the elderly, Representative Claude Pepper, a Florida Democrat who is a chief spokesman for the elderly in Congress, said, ''I am shocked the President of the United States would repudiate a solid commitment he made to the elderly.''
The reference is to comments made both in the 1980 campaign and the 1984 campaign, which have been interpreted as pledges not to touch Social Security benefits.
Christopher Matthews, a spokesman for Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House, said the Mr. Reagan's agreement ''is is the second time that President Reagan has tried to wriggle out of his 1980 campign promise,'' He was referring to Mr. Reagan's short-lived proposal in 1981 to reduce benefits. ''Democrats are going to keep him honest,'' he said.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, opposed the cut in a letter to his colleagues. He said it would cost the average recipient a total of $1,300 in benefits by 1990.
Plan Includes No Tax Increases

The compromise budget plan includes no tax increases but does provide for new and increased fees, including new charges to commerical mariners and receational boaters for some Coast Guard services, fees for Government-sponsored credit agencies which borrow through the Treasury, and increased fees for Federal recreational facilities.
The proposal does not set specific fee increases; it estimates, however, that the changes would raise an additional $750 million in 1986.
Mr. Reagan said the compromise faced stiff opposition in the Republican- controlled Senate. ''We all agree it is going to be a fight,'' he said. ''We are very optimistic and hopeful and think we have a very good plan.''
Alan K. Simpson, the Senate Republican whip, who was among the negotiators of the compromise, said, ''We have in effect alienated everyone in the United States with this budget. I don't predict where we will go when we get on the floor of the United States Senate and go through the painful votes that will come as people amend their favorite, magnificent projects back in - or try to.''

Full text: Increasing confidence that inflation will remain low and the willingness of some investors to shift funds out of low-yielding short-term securities led to a modest rise in Treasury note and bond prices yesterday.
Although investor buying was well short of a stampede, and many potential buyers are still worried about an upturn in rates later this year, Government securities dealers said there was a modest amount of buying yesterday by small and large investors. By late in the day, the 11 3/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2014 were offered at 103 21/32, up 10/32, to yield 11.31 percent. As recently as Jan. 4, the bellwether Treasury bond was offered at 100 1/2 to yield 11.68 percent.
The latest sign that inflation remains subdued was the two-tenths of 1 percent rise in the December Consumer Price Index announced by the Commerce Department yesterday. The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 4 percent during 1984, and many economists expect that falling oil prices and a strong dollar in foreign exchange markets could prevent inflation from accelerating this year.
The eagerness of some investors to shift funds out of short-term securities yielding 8 percent or less into longer maturities was evident at the Treasury's regular monthly auction of two-year notes. Although the average yield on the 9 3/4 percent notes fell to 9.83 percent from 9.92 percent in December and 10.47 percent in November, the issue still attracted nearly $26.8 billion of bids, up from $22.7 billion at last month's sale.
Joseph Bench, a vice president at Shearson Lehman/American Express, said, ''We are seeing quite a bit of maturity extension by individuals, and some of the big players are reluctantly moving in the same direction.''
Longer Term Securities

Longer-term securities are subject to greater price volatility than short- term issues due in less than a year, but many analysts noted that investors are being compensated with note and bond yields that are unusually generous compared with short-term issues. For example, at a discount rate of 7.64 percent, the bond equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills is about 7.9 percent, or roughly 3 1/2 percentage points less than 30- year Tresuary bond yields and more than 1.6 percentage points less than the yield on four-year Treasury notes.
According to R. A. Froehlich Arbitrage, a Mount Kisco, N.Y., firm, the spread between three-month bills and 30-year bonds is the widest it has been since late May 1984, when Treasury bond yields touched 14 percent. As recently as September, the bond yield was only about 1.4 percentage points greater than the three-month bill yield.
On the inflation front, market participants are well aware that prices have not increased as fast during the economic expansion as was feared. But they note that bond yields and inflation do not move in lock step, and it is difficult to predict when and how expectations of lower inflation become powerful enough to bring down bond yields.
Elliot Platt, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said in a recent publication that his forecast for declines in long-term bond yields by year-end ''rests on our perception that inflation will remain moderate and that investors' inflation expectations will continue to fall.''
Even though huge Federal budget deficits will prevent too steep a drop in long-term bond yields, Mr. Platt noted that recent yields of around 11 1/2 percent for Treasury bonds are ''inordinately high'' compared to expectations of inflation.
Although there are no indications that the Federal Reserve is encouraging lower short-term interest rates, the short-term markets were liquid enough yesterday for short-term rates to fall slightly. Three-month Treasury bills, for example, fell to 7.64 percent from an average of 7.68 percent at yesterday's auction.
Overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market fluctuated around 8 3/8 percent, or slightly higher than the 8 1/4 percent average for the two weeks ended Jan. 16.
In the tax-exempt market, this week's new issues have been well received, even as underwriters raised prices enough to reduce yields by as much as 20 basis points from the levels set early Tuesday.

Abstract: The record level to which the dollar has risen is ''unsustainable'' and potentially ''detrimental'' to the United States and the rest of the world, the International Monetary Fund said today in its annual report. The I.M.F. also noted that, largely following patterns set by the United States, the average of short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries rose to 9 3/4 percent in the first half of 1984. The rates had fallen to 9 1/4 percent in the first half of 1983, from a peak of some 15 percent during 1981. ''The recent rise in interest rates,'' the report said, ''has been strongest and most persistent in the United States, where both short-term and long-term yields in the spring of 1984 reached levels roughly two percentage points higher than in the early months of 1983.''

Full text: The record level to which the dollar has risen is ''unsustainable'' and potentially ''detrimental'' to the United States and the rest of the world, the International Monetary Fund said today in its annual report.
The report appeared to presage another spirited debate about the dollar and Washington's policies when the fund's 147 member countries meet here later this month. The joint annual meeting of the fund and the World Bank starts Sept. 24.
The report also repeated earlier I.M.F. criticism of the large United States budget deficit, but went a step further by warning of some of the perils of the high dollar.
The 203-page report noted that at around midyear, when the study was being drafted, the dollar had risen to about 15 percent above its average value for the period 1973 to 1982 in relation to the Japanese yen and the British pound. It was up 40 percent over the West German mark and nearly 50 percent over the French franc.
In recent days the dollar has reached record levels against the pound, the franc and the Italian lira and an 11 1/2-year high against the mark.
Impact of the Deficit
The I.M.F. document, whose key passages are negotiated by governments and represent a consensus of the membership, said the United States budget deficit, by intensifying competition for savings, contributes to high interest rates, which in turn increases the value of the dollar.
The Reagan Administration does not endorse this causal relationship. It argues that the dollar's popularity is spurred by low inflation, high growth of the American economy and profitability of American investments.
The report cited the dollar's strength as ''an important factor'' contributing to the deterioration in the American trade accounts - to an estimated $130 billion merchandise trade deficit this year.
The I.M.F. study said the trade deficit ''could have disquieting implications for the international allocation of world private saving,'' by drawing in savings to the United States from the rest of the world to finance the deficit.
Easing of Debt Crisis
At the same time, the international agency, which has more than $30 billion of short-term credits outstanding to more than 40 countries, said that the trade deficit had contributed to an easing of the world debt crisis. The huge American appetite for imports has spurred economic activity abroad and has especially helped many third world countries improve their cash position and pay their debts, the I.M.F. report notes.
The I.M.F. also noted that, largely following patterns set by the United States, the average of short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries rose to 9 3/4 percent in the first half of 1984. The rates had fallen to 9 1/4 percent in the first half of 1983, from a peak of some 15 percent during 1981. ''The recent rise in interest rates,'' the report said, ''has been strongest and most persistent in the United States, where both short-term and long-term yields in the spring of 1984 reached levels roughly two percentage points higher than in the early months of 1983.''

Abstract: The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, in Tokyo with President Reagan, called the October figure ''a significantly low rate of inflation,'' adding, ''In recent weeks we have seen a remarkable string of indicators of a flourishing economy. The October producer prices showed that the foundation for the recovery is strong.'' Donald Ratajczak, economic forecaster at Georgia State University in Atlanta, predicted that inflation at the producer price level, an indication of price increases at the consumer level in the months ahead, would remain modest, at about 4 percent next year. ''It looks like we've knocked double-digit inflation out of the system,'' he said. The report also said that new-car prices jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent and light truck prices soared 10.8 percent last month. ''The October advances reflected price hikes for 1984 model-year vehicles by domestic producers,'' it said.

Full text: Falling energy prices helped to offset a big jump in food costs as the Producer Price Index for finished goods rose a seasonally adjusted three- tenths of 1 percent in October, the Labor Department reported today.
For the 10 months through October, the index for finished goods, which measures the price of goods as they leave the factory ready for sale at the retail level, rose at an annual rate of six-tenths of 1 percent, compared with 3.7 percent for all of 1982.
Analysts are forecasting that this year's rise will be between 1 percent and 1.5 percent. That would be the lowest figure since the increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in 1964.
'Significantly Low'
The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, in Tokyo with President Reagan, called the October figure ''a significantly low rate of inflation,'' adding, ''In recent weeks we have seen a remarkable string of indicators of a flourishing economy. The October producer prices showed that the foundation for the recovery is strong.''
Donald Ratajczak, economic forecaster at Georgia State University in Atlanta, predicted that inflation at the producer price level, an indication of price increases at the consumer level in the months ahead, would remain modest, at about 4 percent next year. ''It looks like we've knocked double-digit inflation out of the system,'' he said.
Other economists, however, say the producer price index for finished goods figure could rise by 6 percent in 1984.
The October advance in the Producer Price Index was in line with the gain of four-tenths of 1 percent in August and that of two-tenths of 1 percent in September.
Food Prices Jump 1.1%
The main reason for the October rise in the Producer Price Index was a strong 1.1 percent increase in food prices, the sharpest since a similar gain in April. Fresh fruit prices soared 18.5 percent and vegetable prices 5.3 percent, reflecting the harsh weather of last spring and summer, analysts said.
Beef and veal prices climbed 2.4 percent after tumbling in the three previous months. Pork prices were 2.5 percent lower. Meat prices have been plunging in recent months because producers have been liquidating their herds rather than paying higher feed grain prices. A sharp reversal in prices is expected next year once meat supplies dwindle.
Energy costs fell one-tenth of 1 percent, the first decline in six months.
Natural gas prices were down 2.8 percent. Over the past year, those costs have slipped seven-tenths of 1 percent, their first 12-month decline since 1965. Analysts attributed it largely to a surplus of reserves caused by mild fall weather and by an increasing switch by industrial users to other fuels. Canada also has cut its prices to some American customers, they said.
Gasoline Prices Drop Slightly
Gasoline prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent, a bit more than the decline of one-tenth of 1 percent a month earlier. Fuel oil prices soared 4.2 percent, after rising 2.5 percent in the previous month.
The energy price calculations reported today were for September. That component of the Producer Price Index lags a month because energy companies report their prices later.
The report also said that new-car prices jumped eight-tenths of 1 percent and light truck prices soared 10.8 percent last month. ''The October advances reflected price hikes for 1984 model-year vehicles by domestic producers,'' it said.
Prices for cars and trucks had tumbled sharply in September when dealers gave customers special deals to close out the 1983 model year. Capital equipment costs were up three-tenths of 1 percent, after falling by the same amount in September. Those costs are for machinery and transportation equipment used by business.
In all, the Producer Price Index stood at 287.9 in October, meaning that goods costing $10 in 1967 would have cost $28.79 last month. The actual rise in the index for October was 0.3137 percent.
Prices for goods at the intermediate stage of production, such as steel or cloth, increased three-tenths of 1 percent in October, after having risen seven-tenths of 1 percent in September. An index measuring prices of raw materials declined two-tenths of 1 percent, after having risen five- tenths of 1 percent in September.

BONN BALKS AT WEINBERGER'S ARMS PLANS

Abstract: Manfred Worner, Bonn's Defense Minister, at a news conference today with Mr. [Caspar W. Weinberger], said that ''close financial limits'' would prevent Bonn from contributing financially to such projects as relocating United States troops within West Germany or improving NATO's conventional arms. He added: ''We do not want it to become pure rhetoric. But we have financing difficulties.'' Last year, the United States and Norway were the only NATO nations to fulfill the pledge. Mr. Worner said West Germany was preparing a study on raising conventional defense capacity by applying new technologies. Indicating, however, that only modest results could be expected, he said, ''Finances will play a considerable role.'' If the imbalance continues, he said, there would be more weapons trade between European countries and we'd be ''buying less from the United States.'' He added, ''What we are discussing is a trade balance, not an embargo.''

Full text: Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, on a weeklong visit to Western Europe, is encountering unusually stiff resistance to increased military spending from allied governments strapped by recession and high unemployment.
Manfred Worner, Bonn's Defense Minister, at a news conference today with Mr. Weinberger, said that ''close financial limits'' would prevent Bonn from contributing financially to such projects as relocating United States troops within West Germany or improving NATO's conventional arms.
Mr. Weinberger traveled to Brussels this afternoon for two days of talks with NATO defense ministers. West German officials said the ministers would present a report saying that Europe had little room to increase its contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which it said the United States largely underestimated.
Among the topics Mr. Weinberger reportedly discussed in two days with Bonn officials were plans to shift some United States forces within Germany closer to the East German border, as well as ideas for toughening NATO's conventional military capacity. 'We Have Financing Difficulties'
Most Western European governments, including Bonn, are sharply cutting spending to revive their flagging economies. Mr. Worner, asked about a 1978 NATO commitment to seek annual increases of 3 percent in military spending, after inflation, called the pledge an ''effort clause.''
He added: ''We do not want it to become pure rhetoric. But we have financing difficulties.'' Last year, the United States and Norway were the only NATO nations to fulfill the pledge. Mr. Worner said West Germany was preparing a study on raising conventional defense capacity by applying new technologies. Indicating, however, that only modest results could be expected, he said, ''Finances will play a considerable role.''
Bonn was also understood to be unwilling to increase the number of its reserves, a request the United States proposed to supplant American forces that might be removed from Germany to a crisis area, such as the Middle East, in an emergency. Effort to Counter U.S. View
The officials said the European nations' report would point out that they supply 80 to 90 percent of NATO land forces, airplanes and tanks in Europe, and 70 percent of warships. The report was said to be part of an effort to counter what is perceived as an American view that Europe contributes too little to NATO's military forces.
In Bonn, Mr. Weinberger and German officials also discussed plans to deploy Pershing 2 and cruise missiles here later this year, if the Geneva disarmament talks fail to produce results.
Mr. Weinberger, in discussing the plans at the news conference, said the ''production and deployment schedule is proceeding on schedule.''
He added that, if agreement was reached in Geneva, ''We can halt, or take out deployment that has occurred.'' ---- 'Buy European' Policy Hinted
BRUSSELS, May 31 (AP) - Western European defense ministers today denounced American dominance of NATO arms trade and warned they may institute a ''Buy European'' strategy if the imbalance continues.
Ministers from 12 NATO countries here for a defense planning meeting issued a communique demanding a change in ''the present unsatisfactory imbalance,'' in favor of United States weapons and technology producers.
Defense Minister Anders C. Sjaastad of Norway, spokesman for the 12 European representatives, said, ''Our problem is that in Congress there are restrictions which make it difficult to export our products to the United States.''
If the imbalance continues, he said, there would be more weapons trade between European countries and we'd be ''buying less from the United States.'' He added, ''What we are discussing is a trade balance, not an embargo.''

SLOWER INFLATION LEADS O.E.C.D. TO URGE GROWTH

Full text: French-American differences pose a barrier to taking unified economic action. News analysis, page D4.
PARIS, May 10 - The chief industrial countries can now safely promote faster economic growth because of progress in reducing inflation, finance and foreign ministers from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today.
Their stand, announced at the end of their annual two-day meeting here, represents a major shift: For the first time in a decade, the 24 O.E.C.D. members collectively agreed that the top economic priority for the most prosperous nations was reducing unemployment, rather than fighting inflation.
In their final communique the ministers said: ''In a number of countries, accounting for about 70 percent of O.E.C.D. gross national product, inflation is approaching the level of the 1960's. Confidence has strengthened; progress has been made in tackling structural imbalances,'' and activity has started to pick up.
''For such countries,'' the communique went on, ''ministers agreed on the importance of taking advantage of the room that has emerged for increased output and employment.''
These nations must now make ''sus-tainable noninflationary growth'' their major priority ''in order to reduce the present very high levels of unemployment.''
At a closing news conference, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said: ''The U.S. has been, remains and will continue always to be interested in world economic growth. We are glad to be aboard and leading the charge.''
The United States and the other industrial countries also used today's final sessions with reporters to express reservations about President Francois Mitterrand's call Monday for a conference to reestablish fixed exchange rates between major world currencies.
While accepting the eventual need to ''discuss in more detail monetary problems and currency fluctuations,'' Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan said of the French leader's proposal, ''I don't think the time is ripe.''
The West German Finance Minister, Otto Lambsdorff, conceded that the present international monetary system ''doesn't work very well.'' But he said the fault lay not with ''the lack of fixed exchange rates, but with the lack of internal discipline by countries operating the system'' - an implied criticism of the French Socialists, whose inflationary economic policies have resulted in three franc devaluations in two years.
In the O.E.C.D.'s view, the countries in which inflation is now so firmly under control that governments can afford to concentrate on promoting expansion are the United States, West Germany, Britain, Canada and Japan. In all of them, inflation is now running at rates well below the average for the 1960's, O.E.C.D. officials say.
A second group of countries, chiefly made up of France and Italy and accounting for about 20 percent of the O.E.C.D. gross national product, must still concentrate on reducing inflation, the communique said. Consequently, this group will have ''less growing room in the near term.'' In the remaining countries inflation-fighting remains the top economic priority, the ministers agreed.
This week's meeting avoided any outright call for stimulative measures, such as increased public spending or big tax cuts. In the past the group's secretariat, with the support of France and many smaller members, has tried without success to persuade countries with good inflation records to expand their economies rapidly in order to serve as ''locomotives'' that could pull the rest of the world out of recession.
But such thinking has been generally discredited through the staunch opposition of the United States, West Germany, Britain and other conservative members, who have argued that stimulative tactics are self-defeating because they merely result in higher inflation. Instead, they believe that output will start expanding of its own accord as inflation is brought under control, with only marginal help from Governments.
As a result, the policy recommendations aimed at encouraging faster growth that were approved at today's meeting are phrased in cautious terms and placed firmly in a medium-term perspective.
The communique urged countries where the threat of future budget deficits ''looms large'' to take urgent action to reduce that portion that does not involve recession-linked social benefits, in order to bring down interest rates. Although no members are mentioned by name, officials say that the meeting had the United States in mind.
The other low-inflation countries were told to be cautious in reducing that part of their deficit. In addition, low-inflation countries are warned against futher reducing their monetary growth targets to reflect the expected drop in inflation caused by weaker oil prices.
The meeting also made a strong commitment to rolling back protectionist measures taken during the recession, as unemployment rose. It asked the organization's Secretary General to propose specific plans for doing so.
Delegates generally agreed that the prospect of more growth in the world, together with the growing recognition that the battle against inflation is finally being won, helped make this year's meeting an unusually cooperative and peaceful one. In particular, there was little evidence in the communique of the kind of divisive quarrels between conservatives and liberals that marked earlier meetings.
Nevertheless, divergent currents of thoughts could be discerned in the speeches and private comments of individual ministers. The French Finance Minister, Jacques Delors, was skeptical about the strength of the economic recovery in the United States and made clear that he favors more aggressive stimulation by the low-inflation countries. Several Scandinavian countries supported him.
Another difference of viewpoint emerged over trade and interest rates. Mr. Regan argued strongly that the best way to sustain and broaden the present recovery is by rolling back protectionist measures so that world trade can increase and deeply indebted third world countries can earn enough to service their debts. But many of the smaller European countries argued that a rapid reduction in United States interest rates and a fall in the dollar's value would have a more immediately beneficial effect on the world economy.

WITH INFLATION DOWN SHARPLY, INDUSTRIAL NATIONS ARE CASTING ABOUT FOR WAYS TO GROW

Author: Lewis, Paul

Abstract: That interpretation was short-lived. In Washington, Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, quickly responded: ''I don't believe there is any basis for believing that there has been any change in current Administration policy.'' And Marc E. Leland, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, under orders from a reportedly outraged boss, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, said Mr. [Beryl Sprinkel] was ''speaking for himself.'' The view in Europe is that the choice is simple, and inexorable. Either those countries that have gotten a grip on inflation - and now have what the Europeans call a ''margin of maneuverability'' - address the international debt crisis, and finance a gradual adjustment to create a larger market for exports, so that third-world countries can export and import more, or they rely on a ''marketplace adjustment,'' which the Europeans fear could be jolting. In a marketplace adjustment, this view holds, private banks would cease to lend, the poorer nations would be forced to reduce or eliminate imports and a depression would ensue. Economists see Poland and other East European countries, which have canceled many orders with the West, as examples of what might happen to curtail world trade if the financial situation is not eased soon by a return to growth in the major industrial nations. A key element in the emerging European approach to growth policy will be to to encourage countries that have already won the battle against inflation to divide their deficits into two parts, an ''automatic'' deficit, which is created by recession and will disappear with it, and a ''discretionary'' deficit, which results from specific governmental policies that can be controlled. This division should help governments focus attention on the parts of the budget they can increase directly to spur recovery.

Full text: PARIS WHEN Beryl Sprinkel, the Under Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, urged industrial nations toward ''credible economic expansion'' at a meeting of finance ministers in Paris last week, European financial leaders thought the economist was signaling a change in the Reagan Administration's fiscal policies, from a preoccupation with inflation to a drive for growth.
That interpretation was short-lived. In Washington, Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, quickly responded: ''I don't believe there is any basis for believing that there has been any change in current Administration policy.'' And Marc E. Leland, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, under orders from a reportedly outraged boss, Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, said Mr. Sprinkel was ''speaking for himself.''
That spat remains to be resolved. Nonetheless, the Europeans are clearly rooting for the United States to demonstrate a greater concern for the financial strains that the industrial world's longlived recession has caused and the potential for the recession to escalate into a depression.
The Europeans cheered in late summer, when Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, seemed to shift Fed policy onto a more stimulative course. And they have watched eagerly as the Reagan Administration has wrestled to prepare an economic game plan for 1983 that would insure a quick and lasting recovery for the weak United States economy.
The Europeans themselves are groping for a strategy that will bring their major industrial economies that same result: growth, without the risk of another virulent bout of inflation. Several countries have already begun to walk this course; Sweden and Austria, for instance, have carefully aimed discretionary public spending at boosting investment, rather than at increasing personal consumption, while Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy and Sweden have all either introduced wage and price freezes or refused to raise wages automatically in line with inflation.
Last week, the ministers of the so-called Group of 10, the 10 wealthiest Western countries, and Switzerland, asked the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to develop by late spring proposals for economic growth that would not reignite inflation.
THE O.E.C.D., an organization of 24 industrial nations, will make its recommendations when its ministers meet in Paris in May, the I.M.F. when its ministers gather in Washington in June. The Europeans are convinced -and they hope the United States is, too - that the fight against inflation has gone far enough, indeed, too far, and that the dangers posed by international debt and a stagnant world economy now far outweigh the dangers of inflation. ''Is there an increasing asymmetry of risk? That is the question,'' said Silvia Ostry, one of the architects of the O.E.C.D.'s economic policies.
The Europeans' hunt for a growth policy is a variation on an old theme -the ''locomotive'' strategy of 1977 and 1978, in which the three most successful Western industrial nations - the United States, West Germany and Japan - were expected to push or pull weaker nations into prosperity by expanding rapidly themselves. Their growth would generate demand for exports in less prosperous nations throughout the world, leading eventually to a chain reaction of growth around the globe. That strategy, which rested on the Keynesian theory that a large fiscal stimulus should be applied to the whole economy, was proposed by a panel of economists headed by Paul McCracken, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Richard M. Nixon. But the locomotive stalled on rising oil prices and was sidetracked completely by the dollar crisis of 1979.
Now, the O.E.C.D. is casting about for a more sophisticated approach, under which any stimulus would be carefully channeled into noninflationary areas and would be combined with other measures designed or intended to make economies function more efficiently - and with less inflation - as they move toward full employment.
The view in Europe is that the choice is simple, and inexorable. Either those countries that have gotten a grip on inflation - and now have what the Europeans call a ''margin of maneuverability'' - address the international debt crisis, and finance a gradual adjustment to create a larger market for exports, so that third-world countries can export and import more, or they rely on a ''marketplace adjustment,'' which the Europeans fear could be jolting. In a marketplace adjustment, this view holds, private banks would cease to lend, the poorer nations would be forced to reduce or eliminate imports and a depression would ensue. Economists see Poland and other East European countries, which have canceled many orders with the West, as examples of what might happen to curtail world trade if the financial situation is not eased soon by a return to growth in the major industrial nations.
To the Europeans, there is no real choice. The only option for policy makers is growth. That was the message that came out of last week's meeting in Paris of finance ministers from the Group of 10, and Switzerland. It was the message the Europeans thought they heard from Washington through Mr. Sprinkel.
His remarks about third-world debt and recession anticipated the ministers' final communique, issued Tuesday, in which they acknowledged that faster growth is needed to expand world trade, and reduce debt problems and unemployment.
There is no point in giving the I.M.F. more money to finance a gradual reduction in third-world debts unless these countries can export and expand their earnings as well, economists have warned. Nonetheless, the finance ministers agreed to increase to $19 billion from $7.1 billion the amount of money their countries will make available to heavily indebted countries.
And so the locomotive has been rolled forth again, this time sporting what the O.E.C.D. calls a ''differentiated'' outlook for the Western economies. In the United States, Japan, West Germany and Britain, inflation has come down sharply and current rates are roughly comparable. Yet growth prospects differ. The United States seems headed for a mild recovery with growth in the 2 to 3 percent range. Japan may do a little better. But the German economy, shaken by falling exports and political uncertainty, is likely to contract for the third consecutive year, and Britain faces near-stagnation.
Unlike 1977, there is a feeling now among O.E.C.D. economists that any new recovery strategy must be more subtle. The O.E.C.D.'s specific recommendations, to be made in May, are of course still unknown. But they were foreshadowed last month, when a panel of 26 economists brought together by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics and chaired by its director, C. Fred Bergsten, produced its own blueprint for ''a coordinated economic recovery strategy.'' The panel's report is very close, O.E.C.D. sources say, to what they hope to propose in May.
This time, the O.E.C.D.'s emerging tactic, labeled ''The Differentiated Recovery Strategy,'' is an attempt to work out for each major country a set of detailed policy prescriptions that meet governments' concerns and which, when put together, would do more to promote recovery than what any nation could do alone. And, the economists are betting that there will not be a shock of higher oil prices to get in the way of growth this time around.
IN fact, all Western governments have already started to stimulate their economies through a relaxation in monetary policy and lower interest rates. ''Germany, Britain and Switzerland are all now following mildly stimulative monetary policies,'' said Hans Maast, chief economist at the Swiss Credit Bank in Zurich. So far, Mr. Maast argues, this relaxation is free from inflationary dangers because oil prices are weak, personal savings are increasing and trade unions, shellshocked by rising unemployment, are keeping wage claims moderate.
Yet the power of the financial markets in the United States is keeping the Federal Reserve on what one O.E.C.D. economist called ''a knife edge.'' Too much laxity could arouse inflationary fears, push interest rates up, boost the dollar and force European countries to jack up their rates again to protect currencies.
Dr. Klaus Wieners, chief economist at the Westdeutsche Landesbank in Dusseldorf, West Germany, says that further monetary relaxation offers the most credible strategy for securing faster expansion, because restrictive budgetary policies could be politically difficult for governments.
A key element in the emerging European approach to growth policy will be to to encourage countries that have already won the battle against inflation to divide their deficits into two parts, an ''automatic'' deficit, which is created by recession and will disappear with it, and a ''discretionary'' deficit, which results from specific governmental policies that can be controlled. This division should help governments focus attention on the parts of the budget they can increase directly to spur recovery.
THE strategy would be to move ahead rapidly with such stimulus, but with care. The Bergsten panel urged that money go for infrastructure projects, such as repairing bridges and highway systems and not for new social programs that are difficult to curtail or cancel when the economy picks up. The O.E.C.D. believes such discretionary government spending should be carefully aimed at boosting investment rather than personal consumption, as some of members countries have already done.
However difficult the challenge of persuading governments to adopt a coordinated recovery strategy, there is a growing belief that the world promises to pay a heavy price for its present economic performance. The Bergsten panel said, ''The perpetuation of stagnation raises the specter of a breakdown of the world economic order.'' Contributing to that breakdown is the inability of thirdworld countries to repay their debts.

Abstract: THE news of this holiday season lacks the old ho-ho-ho. Unemployment afflicts the industrial world, and looks to get worse before it gets better. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecasts that the jobless rate will stay above 10 percent in the United States at least until the summer of 1984 and will climb to almost 12 percent in Western Europe by that time. ''The situation is extremely serious,'' said Dr. Sylvia Ostry, who is about to lose her own job as O.E.C.D.'s chief economist. The United Nations has never been more disunited; bitter speeches in the tower overlooking Turtle Bay reflect the turmoil of the world. ''Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth, and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth,'' the Book of Genesis says. Contemporary prophets are trying to find new ways to give the nations a common tongue. ''Cooperation among economic ministries, finance ministries, central banks, private commercial banks and international financial agencies, which has not always been close, must become very much closer,'' the venerable Dr. [Arthur F. Burns] declares. ''Meetings among members of the foreign policy and defense establishments of the alliance must occur still more frequently, and become more thorough as well as more timely.''

Full text: THE news of this holiday season lacks the old ho-ho-ho. Unemployment afflicts the industrial world, and looks to get worse before it gets better. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecasts that the jobless rate will stay above 10 percent in the United States at least until the summer of 1984 and will climb to almost 12 percent in Western Europe by that time. ''The situation is extremely serious,'' said Dr. Sylvia Ostry, who is about to lose her own job as O.E.C.D.'s chief economist.
The Institute for International Economics, surveying the dismal global scene, reports: ''World trade is declining. Commodity prices are at their lowest real levels for 30 years. Per capita incomes are falling in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, and growth has been halved even in the dynamic economies of East Asia. Corporate bankruptcies are high and rising, debt reschedulings and arrearages are widespread, and the threat of a financial collapse looms large.''
The Americans and Europeans are angry with the Japanese for taking away their markets while failing to open their own more widely to Western manufactured goods. Yesterday's tariff cuts fall far short of what the West wants.
The developing countries are angry at the developed countries for excluding their manufactured goods and for being so tight-fisted about foreign aid.
The West Europeans are angry with the United States for trying to obstruct their trade with the East Europeans and the Soviet Union. They blame the United States for tight money and high interest rates that, they believe, dumped the world into the slump. The United States says they helped dig their own grave, and the inflation had to be stopped or worse disasters would have followed.
The United States complains that the European Common Market is protecting its agricultural interests against American foodstuffs, and the Europeans denounce American quotas on imported meat and dairy products.
The tone of discussion grows bitter. For, in hard times, as Arthur F. Burns, the American Ambassador to West Germany, put it recently, the ''gentle voices of spokesmen of economic interests are apt to become loud and strident, and even the customary composure of academicians and high government officials tends to suffer.''
Economic conflicts spill over into the political and military realms, within and between nations and blocs. The Atlantic alliance is suffering intense strains, as is the Soviet bloc. Even the member countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are at each other's throats, unable to agree on a common strategy to make things difficult for the oil-importing countries by cutting production enough to sustain prices.
The United Nations has never been more disunited; bitter speeches in the tower overlooking Turtle Bay reflect the turmoil of the world. ''Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth, and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth,'' the Book of Genesis says.
Contemporary prophets are trying to find new ways to give the nations a common tongue. ''Cooperation among economic ministries, finance ministries, central banks, private commercial banks and international financial agencies, which has not always been close, must become very much closer,'' the venerable Dr. Burns declares. ''Meetings among members of the foreign policy and defense establishments of the alliance must occur still more frequently, and become more thorough as well as more timely.''
Many voices are raised to urge conferences among the most powerful national leaders, but after the last summit meeting in Versailles, summitry has acquired a bad name. National leaders seem to believe they can never buy anything at a summit meeting half so valuable as the thing they have to sell. And today they are selling different political ideologies and different economic theories. Some believe that inflation remains the great menace, others that the true danger now is worsening unemployment and a vicious downward spiral.
But in this season of hope it may not to too farfetched to see the seeds of change taking root in all this adversity. The very depth of the world economic crisis - and the threat of the political dangers to which it might lead - could well restore a sense of common purpose and common human need.

Abstract: The 1980's are different from the 1930's, of course, but the basic principles of a modern R.F.C. would be the same. The R.F.C. would be the investment and development bank of the Government, publicly accountable, but sheltered from political pressures. It would be a focus of American commitment to our basic industrial underpinning as well as to rebuilding cities, harbors, transportation systems - the complex of facilities known as infrastructure. Slowdowns in the growth of Social Security and health-care costs are absolutely essential. At the same time, our defense program cannot be immune from both retrenchment and transfer of funds to domestic nonmilitary investment. If we are serious about defense, we should reinstate the draft and increase our conventional capability. The draft is not an economy measure but a philosophical one: National service cannot be limited to the children of the poor and the minorities; it must include the children of the middle-class and the well-to-do. The current target for defense spending over the next five years is about $1.6 trillion. It is hard to believe that $100 billion could not be provided for the R.F.C. and other nonmilitary needs from those funds; in addition, considerable economies could be made in the military programs themselves. The reduction of nuclear weapons is both a moral and an economic issue. On both counts, it has to happen. An R.F.C. could be funded initially by the Treasury at $5 billion and with the capacity to issue an additional $25 billion of government-guaranteed bonds. By requiring outside matching funds, it would thereby generate a minimum of $60 billion of new investment over a period of time. Improving life in the inner-city ghetto would be another objective of an R.F.C. Regional development corporations as well as city and state business and labor groups would be created to work with the R.F.C. If the auto industry and Middle Western cities were to get new funds, for example, the program should include inner-city manufacturing facilities tied directly to inner-city school systems, union commitments to minority apprenticeship and possibly two-tier minimum wages during training. The programs should be run by private industry, in facilities financed by the R.F.C. and leased to the companies, in the same manner as the defense plants leased by the R.F.C. during World War II.

Full text: I have been in business for 34 years and I believe we are facing the most dangerous worldwide economic situation of my professional experience. We are facing it with a political philosophy that appears to be uncaring and backward and without a governmental process worthy of the name. We are facing it with less international cooperation than at any time since World War II.
All over the world, trade and economic activity is contracting, unemployment is growing and financial structures are getting weaker. In America, a victory over inflation (which may turn out to be Pyrrhic) has been achieved at a very high cost in terms of unemployment, a collapse of investment and a polarization of our political system. The present best-case scenario for 1983 calls for a slow recovery for the economy. That will not be good enough for our basic industries, not good enough for investment in public-works projects, not good enough for employment and not good enough for the health of a seriously strained international banking system.
We are currently lulled by the tremendous rise in the stock market over the last few months. This rise is mostly due to short-term interest rates falling as a result of a belated change in Federal Reserve policy. A market structure dominated by large institutions, none of which wants to be left behind, and vast amounts of foreign capital looking for relative political stability have had an effect as well. None of this reflects a successful economic program; the rise in the stock market might create a more positive psychology and encourage more consumer spending this winter, but it is a far cry from economic growth spurred by capital investment and savings that we were promised two years ago. It does not begin to address the economic crisis of the rest of the world and the dangers of a deflationary spiral to the international financial system.
Although it is dangerous to generalize about the meaning of any election, especially in an off year, some conclusions may be drawn about the recent one.
To the extent that the election was a referendum on the Administration's economic program - not necessarily its goals, but its effectiveness - the Administration and the Republican Party lost rather decisively. And on arms control, voters from New England to California expressed disillusionment with a program that will continue to build expensive new weapons rather than try to negotiate a reduction in arms.
With few alternatives presented, voters expressed mainly disillusionment. In most races, Democratic candidates felt they could comfortably attack the current economic program, usually on the basis of its unfairness. This is a valid criticism, but it is not an alternative. Alternatives to Reaganomics must be put forward. Reaganomics is not simply an economic doctrine embodying supplyside economics and strict monetarism. It is a philosophy and a process of government, and it is in those areas that it departs most radically from our experience in the last 50 years.
While the stated objectives of supply-side economics are valid - encouraging savings and investment, limiting the growth of government spending, promoting tax reduction and less regulation - the application of the program has been totally incoherent and expectations were raised that could not be fulfilled. Massive tax cuts and huge increases in defense spending combined with tight money to create high interest rates, steep recession and high unemployment.
Nor is rational monetarism necessarily lethal. The notion of slow, steady growth in the money supply has much to commend it. The difficulty lies in defining money supply. In a volatile economic climate, money-supply measurements are suspect and a strict application of monetarism can be dangerous.
The Reagan philosophy construes government to be the source of most evils; virtue is reserved for the theoretical free marketplace. Since such a philosophy does not believe in government, it has no process with which to govern. The incoherence of the program combined with the absence of a means to carry it out aggravates rather than diminishes many of our more serious difficulties.
One of the strongest lessons that we have learned from the economic failures of the past decade is that the way we reach and implement a program or policy is fully as important as its theoretical and substantive design. The problems we face cannot be solved without cooperation, and the price of that cooperation is involvement in the decision-making process. My conservative Republican friends take me to task for what they consider my dangerously interventionist, liberal views. But I believe that large social, economic and political problems can be handled only when there is a conviction that government has not only a right but a duty to intervene when imbalances become too great. The process must accommodate the bargaining and all the constituencies must be heard in order to find solutions. This is particularly true in times of economic strain, when sacrifice has to be negotiated; over the long run, it cannot be legislated.
Our most urgent national objective has to be the reduction of unemployment through high economic growth rates and low interest rates. Our objectives for growth must be raised from their present modest rates and coordinated with Europe and Japan. A coherent program to bring this about must begin with a bipartisan social contract involving the Executive, the Congress, business and labor, and the Federal Reserve in an effort to bring about a balanced budget within five years and maintain low interest rates. Current budgetary projections indicate annual deficits ranging from $180 billion to $200 billion for the foreseeable future, possibly reaching as high as 6 percent of gross national product. This cannot be tolerated. To reverse the trend would require cutting the growth in Social Security and health-care costs, cutting the growth in military expenditures and imposing new taxes.
However, in a period of deep recession, any new taxes are dangerous. It would be a mistake at this point to cancel the 1983 tax cut. A plausible argument can probably be made, in view of the weak economy, to advance it to Jan. 1, 1983, but the prospect of higher deficits could unsettle the financial markets. It is not worth the risk, since lower interest rates at this point are the most important stimulus.
The imposition of a tax on gasoline would be much less damaging to the economy if the proceeds of the tax were recycled as part of a major national investment program. There is, at present, a proposal for a 5-cent gasoline-tax increase to finance such things as road and bridge repairs. This is grossly insufficient. A gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon should be phased in over a five-year period, at the rate of 10 cents a year, with rebates to lower-income groups. Coupled with an import fee on crude oil, it could ultimately reduce our deficit by up to $50 billion a year, improve our balance of payments, protect the auto industry's huge investments in small cars and prepare us for the next OPEC shock.
A critical part of a budget compact would be a commitment on the part of the Federal Reserve to accelerate its downward pressure on interest rates, especially long-term rates. We must recognize the fact that real, as opposed to nominal, interest rates have not come down at all. The real rate of interest today, namely the difference between the nominal rate and the rate of inflation, is, if anything, higher than it was a year ago. That is the real impediment to investment and recovery.
We must then face the issue of employment. We cannot stimulate our economy sufficiently and reduce unemployment without major investment in industry and rebuilding the infrastructure. To reach those sectors that normal market forces or government policy have neglected, new structures should be created, notably a modern version of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the 1930's.
The original R.F.C., set up by Herbert Hoover and energized by Franklin Roosevelt, functioned essentially from 1932 to 1945, though it lasted until 1953. During that period, it saved thousands of banks, railroads and businesses, financed public works and ultimately defense plants in World War II. It created organizations functioning today, such as the Commodity Credit Corporation and the Rural Electrification Administration, and it returned a profit of $500 million to the taxpayers.
The 1980's are different from the 1930's, of course, but the basic principles of a modern R.F.C. would be the same. The R.F.C. would be the investment and development bank of the Government, publicly accountable, but sheltered from political pressures. It would be a focus of American commitment to our basic industrial underpinning as well as to rebuilding cities, harbors, transportation systems - the complex of facilities known as infrastructure.
A commitment to basic industry would not be easy, but it is important. A major world power like America cannot be credible without a strong, competitive manufacturing base.
Today, high technology is a very glamorous notion; basic industries such as automobiles and steel are not. But the auto industry is one of the largest customers of microprocessors as well as of industrial robots and many other high-technology products. In the future, we will employ far fewer workers per automobile or per ton of steel. But that does not mean that those same workers, with proper training, cannot make the robots, the machine tools and the many products of tomorrow that will go into a car or a ton of steel. That will not happen, however, if we take the position that we do not care about the survival of our auto industry as long as we make better semiconductors. This year the American auto industry will manufacture roughly 5,000,000 cars; the Japanese will manufacture 7,000,000 cars, of which we will buy about 1,700,000. What would the Japanese minister of industry say to a suggestion to cut his auto industry in half in order to invest in biotechnology? Obviously, retraining for the industries of the future has to be part of any economic and social program, but we must first save what we have today.
At the same time, there is much talk in Washington today of a need to invest in public infrastructure, partly to create jobs and partly to fill a real need. The program proposed by The Administration call for a five-year, $32.9 billion highway and mass-transit investment, to be financed largely by the proposed increased gasoline tax. No one knows what level of investment may be required to bring our national capital plant back from its present decay. Some estimates run to over $1 trillion. The New York City mass-transit system alone is estimated to require $5 billion over the next five years, and the city as a whole has estimated a need for up to $40 billion during the 1980's. The Federal Government will obviously have to make a much greater effort than is currently being discussed, because local government cannot afford it.
Slowdowns in the growth of Social Security and health-care costs are absolutely essential. At the same time, our defense program cannot be immune from both retrenchment and transfer of funds to domestic nonmilitary investment. If we are serious about defense, we should reinstate the draft and increase our conventional capability. The draft is not an economy measure but a philosophical one: National service cannot be limited to the children of the poor and the minorities; it must include the children of the middle-class and the well-to-do. The current target for defense spending over the next five years is about $1.6 trillion. It is hard to believe that $100 billion could not be provided for the R.F.C. and other nonmilitary needs from those funds; in addition, considerable economies could be made in the military programs themselves. The reduction of nuclear weapons is both a moral and an economic issue. On both counts, it has to happen. An R.F.C. could be funded initially by the Treasury at $5 billion and with the capacity to issue an additional $25 billion of government-guaranteed bonds. By requiring outside matching funds, it would thereby generate a minimum of $60 billion of new investment over a period of time.
The leverage of government-backed credit can best be observed by New York City's four-year financial plan. A $4.5 billion financing package was put together in 1978 on the basis of $1.6 billion of Federally guaranteed bonds with the balance coming from the public and private financial markets. Every Federal credit dollar produced $3 of financing. A similar ratio applied to the R.F.C. would produce roughly $90 billion of investment.
In the industrial field, the R.F.C.'s investments would be limited to those basic industries such as automobiles and steel that could be made competitive. The R.F.C. would provide funds only if there were concessions on the part of labor, management, suppliers and bankers sufficient to make the company competitive with the the best foreign producers.
Similarly, in the public-infrastructure field the R.F.C.'s capital would be available only if local support - such as tax changes, union productivity and wage concessions, fare and user fees -assured the viability of the projects. These would include mass-transit systems, sewers, roads, bridges and so on.
The need for political independence for an organization like the R.F.C. is obvious. It would need to husband its resources and to target them. It should require matching investments from the private sector in the case of industrial investments and by local governments in the case of public investments.
The R.F.C. could not be a substitute for an industrial or a regional policy. It would be a useful tool and a needed focus. It would be a small part of a large program, but it could play a critical, temporary role. It should self-destruct in 10 years.
Improving life in the inner-city ghetto would be another objective of an R.F.C. Regional development corporations as well as city and state business and labor groups would be created to work with the R.F.C. If the auto industry and Middle Western cities were to get new funds, for example, the program should include inner-city manufacturing facilities tied directly to inner-city school systems, union commitments to minority apprenticeship and possibly two-tier minimum wages during training. The programs should be run by private industry, in facilities financed by the R.F.C. and leased to the companies, in the same manner as the defense plants leased by the R.F.C. during World War II.
Any such program of government-assisted financing obviously would require the input of business and labor as well as government. The board of the R.F.C. would be an obvious focus for this; it would also become a focus for a policy that could relate wage increases to real productivity improvements.
The kind of stimulus our economy needs, both to insure our own future and to avoid a worldwide credit crisis, is much greater than the current forecasts. It will require guarding against a renewal of inflation caused by wage settlements in excess of productivity improvements. Wage and price controls in an advanced industrial society cannot work for long, and a formal, legislated policy, such as a tax-based incomes policy, is probably neither practical nor fair. However, a change in our labor cost structure has to be examined if low inflation is to co-exist with high growth. The most practical way to approach this would be for all major labor contracts to expire simultaneously every year, with wage increases related to existing economic conditions and current inflation; significant elements of profit-sharing should reward real productivity improvements. We should take a cue from Japan and Germany and have an annual, national wage negotiation involving business, labor and often the government. The result should be keyed to the performance of the economy. This is the practical equivalent of an incomes policy for most of the economy.
A viable, growing economy and containment of poverty and healthcare programs have to be the first step to the New Federalism proposed by the Reagan Administration. This would then make possible a swap providing for the assumption of all poverty programs by the Federal Government in exchange for state assumption of various Federal programs. A portion of a national gas tax or an energyseverance tax could make up any shortfall sustained by the states. Local tax increases, in all but the energy-producing states, have been, and will continue to be, an enormous drag on the national economy. A constructive approach to New Federalism should carry with it the possibility for local tax cuts rather than increases. The Federal Treasury gets a portion of that benefit anyway, since local taxes are deducted from Federal income taxes.
Without an active business-labor-government process of cooperation, coupled with real bipartisanship, none of this can happen. Neither an R.F.C. nor a new approach to labor costs nor a balanced budget with all its implications nor a new and fair Federalism will be politically possible. Such a result will not happen with a hands-off government and a blind faith in the market process. A different process and a different philosophy are needed in the international sphere as urgently as they are needed in the domestic arena. We are in a worldwide recession for the first time since World War II, with dangerous deflationary overtones. The international banking system is badly overextended with many large overseas borrowers in danger of bankruptcy. Western Europe and Japan are in difficulty; Canada is in a crisis; much of Eastern Europe is bankrupt; Mexico, Argentina and Brazil are staggering under huge debt; the third world economy is largely a disaster.
A worldwide recovery of sufficient magnitude to give us some margin of safety can only come about with coordinated, stimulative policies of the major NATO partners and Japan. In the United States, the Federal Reserve narrowly avoided a catastrophe and changed to a stimulative policy. We must aim at significantly higher real-growth rates than the 2 to 3 percent presently forecast. This must then be coordinated with our major trading partners to enable many large debtor nations to service their debts and maintain social balance. For 25 years after World War II the international monetary system functioned as a result of the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944, which produced extraordinary growth and wealth throughout the world. Because it posed many problems, we have replaced this international system based on fixed exchange rates with a system based on floating rates, which poses even greater problems. The wild fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, speculative raids on individual currencies, the uncontrolled growth of the Eurodollar market -all have contributed to worldwide inflation and destabilization. Cooperation among America, Japan and Western Europe in an effort to synchronize economic policies geared to sound growth is now vital.
As part of any program of industrial redevelopment, we will need a change in our trade relationships with Japan. This should include not only opening Japanese markets to our goods, including agriculture, but negotiating a fair and stable exchange relationship between the dollar and the yen. It is impossible for our industries to compete effectively, no matter how much we invest and no matter how efficient we become, at the present level of approximately 260 yen per dollar. A quick agreement should be negotiated between our respective governments and their central banks to bring the dollar/yen relationship to approximately 200 yen per dollar.
The central banks of America, Japan and Western Europe must also cooperate in controlling movements of currency. Such major currencies as the pound, the mark and the yen have fluctuated wildly over the last few years; these swings have been accentuated by speculative forces. There should be clear and public commitments among the major central banks to maintain their respective currencies within specific limits as long as their respective governments maintain rational economic policies. One way to do this would be to expand the European monetary system to include America, Japan and possibly Canada. Such close cooperation is obviously inconsistent with actions such as the recent sanctions against American and European companies involved in the construction of the Soviet gas pipeline; however, it would certainly permit negotiations aimed at tightening European subsidies of exports to the Soviet Union or anywhere else.
As part of any such program, we must challenge the Soviet Union to share with the West the burden of financing Eastern Europe. This should become part of arms-control negotiations and should be aimed at diverting investment in weapons to economic development.
Further, the wealthy OPEC countries must bear a greater burden with respect to the financing of the third world. The oil producers' great wealth will not be protected - nor their ruling classes be immune - from the effects of worldwide economic crisis. I believe that we are presently running not only economic risks but risks to our political system. Many of my friends believe that I am seeing ghosts, and I hope they are right. But I did grow up in Europe in the 1930's and I have seen the fragility of democracy when economic events get out of hand. We are now told that basic, permanent unemployment in this country will be close to 6 or 7 percent, but our current, real unemployment would reach 14 percent or more if one were to count unemployment honestly. Not counting those who have given up looking for work is like listing only the walking wounded as casualties in a war. This means that almost every third family in America will be affected. Educational and income disparities are increasing, and even though fairness is a much overused term, too many people question the fairness of the present program to be ignored. A no-growth economy causes the most suffering among those who have the least; it is unfair but inevitable. The recent budget and tax programs, however, have created more instead of less disparity. They will have to be corrected. A democracy, to survive, must at the very least appear to be fair. This is no longer the case in America.
In looking for alternatives to Reaganomics, we therefore need a different philosophy and a different process. We also need a Democratic Party less frightened of its past and more willing to assert its own philosophy and process. There are desirable aspects to Reaganomics and they deservedly enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. Those objectives of Reaganomics that are desirable should be included in an alternative program. An R.F.C., after all, is the liberal version of stimulating the supply side of the economy and a gasoline tax is a perfectly respectable way to tax consumption in order to encourage investment. A balanced budget is a completely reasonable goal as long as everyone pays the price, including Social Security and the military. A viable version of New Federalism should undoubtedly get support among all groups.
All over the world, systems of the right and of the left are trying to find the answers to the same question: how to have a viable economy and a fair and balanced social structure. There may be no viable answers to some of the problems, but there is no alternative to trying, being willing to fail and trying again. There is no alternative to real bipartisanship any more than there is an alternative to real business/labor/ government cooperation.
The Democratic Party will undoubtedly produce many alternatives to Reaganomics. In doing so, there is no need to claim a plethora of new ideas. First of all, it is not true; secondly, it is not necessary. A simplified tax system with lower maximum rates as proposed by Senator Bill Bradley and Congressman Richard A. Gephardt is a good idea. So is the notion of encouraging high technology, as suggested by Senator Gary W. Hart and Congressman Timothy E. Wirth. These are good ideas without being new. Good ideas have been around for a long time (including some from John Maynard Keynes as well as some from Milton Friedman). There are no technological breakthroughs in government and economics, and those who pretend to have them should be treated with great skepticism. Albert Einstein told the French poet Paul Valery that he had only had two original ideas in his whole life. But that was more than enough.
New York City and New York State are about to face once again the harshest kinds of budget problems. They will be met with painful and destructive service cuts and tax increases. This time, however, New York is not alone. All over this country, if not all over the world, the process of contraction is continuing and the danger of spiraling downturn is very real.
Economists are fighting the last inflation just as generals always fight the last war. The immediate concern is unemployment and deflation, which only growth can cure. Stimulating growth runs the risk of inflation; it can be contained, however, and it is the lesser risk.
We can no longer deal marginally with a problem that vastly transcends our shores. Whether a Republican or a Democrat is President, bipartisanship at home and statesmanship and cooperation abroad will be required. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's type of leadership in wartime will have to be re-created in the 1980's.

Abstract: The commission's language was unusally abrupt. Europe lags, it said, in its ''ability to adapt'' and is ''increasingly incapable of reacting rapidly to changes in the economic environment.'' According to the commission, Europe's economies are characterized by ''a growing structural rigidity'' or an incapacity to abandon old, played-out sectors and invest in new fields. ''There's the possibility of a new kind of class emerging, especially among young people who've never had a job, that has very little to do with the rules of society as we know them,'' Mr. [Ulrich Borsdorf] said. ''It's impossible to say constantly growing unemployment would lead to an explosion in West Germany, but I say flatly it's a danger for the republic. You can move to a point where there's a legitimacy crisis. I don't mean a government but the state. It's not capital versus labor anymore. It's power against no-power - maybe even the people who work against those who don't.'' Part of the explanation appears to be related to Britain's victory in the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands , but Mr. [David Lee] of the Trade Union Council said: ''The electorate just doesn't blame unemployment on her. They say it's the world recession, and then, 'Somehow it's good for us.' She's succeeding in convincing people it isn't her fault.''

Full text: A host of social arrangements have softened the impact of the recession in Western Europe, but Europe's economic troubles are widely regarded as more difficult to resolve than the recession in the rest of the industrialized world.
Although Europe's unemployment rate of 10.3 percent roughly equals that of the United States, the European countries' tightly woven social security systems mean that there is no talk of anyone's going hungry or being turned out into the cold.
In Britain, for instance, the benefits for those who are thrown out of work go far to make up for their lack of a paycheck. A similar structure of organized aid exists in West Germany, at least for workers who had long employment records before being laid off.
At the same time, however, there is deep concern that Europe has fallen so far behind in creating new markets and is so bound to expensive social service mechanisms that it does not have the same capacity as the United States or Japan to lift itself out of the recession.
''The elan of the postwar period is gone,'' said Arthur Krumper, head of the research department of the Institute for Economic Research in Munich, one of Europe's largest independent organizations studying the business cycle. ''We are very much less risk-oriented. We are vastly more cautious, security-minded people than 25 or 30 years ago.''
The executive commission of the European Economic Community, which usually judges the state of its members with considerable bureaucratic caution, said in its 1982-83 report, issued in October, that there were reasons to fear that the Common Market countries were moving into a depression.
The commission's language was unusally abrupt. Europe lags, it said, in its ''ability to adapt'' and is ''increasingly incapable of reacting rapidly to changes in the economic environment.'' According to the commission, Europe's economies are characterized by ''a growing structural rigidity'' or an incapacity to abandon old, played-out sectors and invest in new fields.
The lack of mobility of its citizens, resistance to new technology and nuclear energy, and the cost of financing social services - lumped together by the commission as rigid ''social-economic behavior'' - have, it said, ''profoundly altered the long-term dynamics of the business cycle.''
At the same time, there has been progress in some countries in bringing down inflation and interest rates. And some politicians feel there is a new willingness among Europeans, admittedly difficult to quantify, to reconsider whether some social services can be restrained. But such bright elements do not dominate the thinking of many analysts. Diversity of Expectations
Two government economists from the same country, who granted separate interviews with the understanding that their functions could not be more directly described, agreed that the causes of the recession in the United States and Western Europe were similar - budget deficits, high cost of energy, inflation and aging industries - but both said they worried more about Europe.
''The American private sector is very much more able to adjust,'' one of the officials said. ''There, the marketplace still works. People move. They just don't have the same expectations the Europeans do. I'm ultimately more confident in the United States than in ourselves.''
Most economists have difficulty isolating a precise cause for Europe's troubles. Hartmut Gorgens, a chief economic analyst for the executive board of the German Labor Federation, said that there were many layers of problems, including interest rates in the United States, but that he was unable to define exactly what went wrong. Generally, in discussions of causes, the economic arguments become political. The analyses of a Thatcher Conservative and a Mitterrand Socialist rarely intersect. Little Talk of Budget Cuts
Under any circumstances, the European countries seem pursued by the kind of problems that would not necessarily go away even if their budget deficits shrank to nothing and if interest rates virtually disappeared. Indeed, little is heard in Western Europe about limiting deficits by cutting military spending (as currently debated in the United States) because military outlays have already been widely reduced without much effect.
The Europeans can expand output and productivity without creating new jobs because of low use of manufacturing capacity and the availability of new labor-saving technology. At the same time, profit margins are so low - especially in Britain and Belgium - that there is little incentive to invest. Union leaders contend that recent gains in productivity really reflect a shakeout of labor.
In the end, the Europeans are largely dependent on export markets that they cannot control. Even if those export markets were active, Europe has priced itself out of the running for some heavy industrial products. And Europe is in an extremely weak competitive position against the United States and Japan in the most advanced technological sectors, such as electronics. A Reservoir of Confidence
Nonetheless, there is still European confidence in the ability of the international monetary and trade organizations to head off catastrophe - enough confidence to restrain predictions of trade and devaluation wars as well as of an economic collapse that would rival the one in the 1930's. In the opinion of economists and labor and government officials interviewed in West Germany, France and Britain, experience, better communications and a more stable environment within the community of industrialized countries appear to reduce the likelihood of a complete breakdown.
But there is considerable political nervousness. In almost every European election for the last two years, the group holding power (regardless of its politics) has been forced to leave - and almost always over economic issues.
Although public opinion polls find that unemployment is an overriding concern, there are some places, such as England, where the persistence of this problem has at last begun to produce signs that people may have become slightly inured to it. By comparison, in countries that felt immune to unemployment until recently, notably West Germany, pessimism and expressions of fear about the political system are more widespread than elsewhere. Gauging the Political Effects
The differences in viewpoint about the long-term political effects mean that in London a labor official such as David Lee, assistant general secretary of the Trades Union Council, can reply to a question about the possibility of open rebellion in five years as a result of continuing high unemployment by saying, ''I don't like monosyllables, but the answer is no.'' A similar question posed to Ulrich Borsdorf, a Social Democrat and sociologist at the German Trade Union Federation in Dusseldorf, stirred a response of great concern.
''There's the possibility of a new kind of class emerging, especially among young people who've never had a job, that has very little to do with the rules of society as we know them,'' Mr. Borsdorf said. ''It's impossible to say constantly growing unemployment would lead to an explosion in West Germany, but I say flatly it's a danger for the republic. You can move to a point where there's a legitimacy crisis. I don't mean a government but the state. It's not capital versus labor anymore. It's power against no-power - maybe even the people who work against those who don't.''
Unemployment in the European Economic Community has averaged an estimated 9.4 percent for 1982 as a whole. At present, according to statistics recently released by the Common Market, there are 11.5 million people without jobs, or 10.3 percent of the working population, in the member countries. The current jobless rate compared with 10.4 percent in the United States for the same period. Outlook for Unemployment
Inflation this year was estimated to be running at 10.5 percent in the Common Market countries, or about double that of the United States.
The executive commission expects European inflation to decrease a bit next year, to 8.8 percent. Unemployment, however, is expected to grow by one million workers. The projection of economic growth for next year is 1.1 percent, but Tommaso Padua-Schippa, the commission's general director for economic affairs, said the figure might be optimistic. (According to the Common Market's forecasts, the American growth rate should be about 2 percent.)
In West Germany, regarded as the economic motor of Europe, the commission reports a possibility of total stagnation for the third year in a row.
The unemployment figures are even worse than they appear, according to the commission, because they represent a deep and long-lasting trend. The number of new jobs in Western Europe did not increase over the last 10 years, while it was growing in North America by 20 percent and in Japan by 10 percent. PICK UP FIRST ADD EUROPE Progress in U.S. and Japan
Comparing Europeans with the Americans and Japanese, the commission said profitability fell to its lowest level in Europe during the 1970's, and it said labor costs in Europe were far less able to respond to economic swings than in other industrialized areas. Over that decade, the commission added, the United States and Japan had ''good performances in creating jobs, a more favorable evolution in profitability and a greater capacity'' for change.
Some projections for the economic future of Europe are deeply pessimistic. The research branch of West Germany's Labor Office, which keeps federal employment statistics and analyzes the job market, foresaw the possibility of about 16 percent unemployment in West Germany for the period of 1990 to 1995.
The calculations, which spoke of a 13.5 percent jobless rate in Western Europe for 1990, are debatable because they are based on projections for migration to the Common Market countries from nations now outside its structure. Target for German Growth
But one aspect of the equation is widely accepted by West German economists. It is that a yearly growth rate in the vicinity of 3 percent is necessary in West Germany to increase the number of available jobs. A growth rate of less than 3 percent means that the number of jobs retracts. This seems to suggest an inevitable and significant increase in unemployment in the country because a 3 percent growth rate appears unattainable.
Over all, Western Europe's reaction to mass unemployment has not been violent. There have been demonstrations and clashes with the police during some factory closings, most recently with the shutting down of steel plants in eastern France, but the unrest at present is verbal rather than in the streets.
Visitors to West Germany's Ruhr district, which looks rough and grimy in the best of economic times, find it little changed. There are signs of poverty in the Lorraine industrial valley in France and in Wallonia, the French-speaking part of Belgium, but these areas have been in decline since the early 1970's. A Wave of Bankruptcies
Bankruptcies are at record levels in many countries, and businessmen are increasingly pessimistic. A reporter talking to a representitive of Otto Spaeth, a German manufacturer of truck and tractor axles, was told that it had not received an order in six months. Mannesmann, the German pipe manufacturer, said it had no orders, and 57 percent of the manufacturers responding to a questionnaire from the Confederation of British Industry reported decreasing contracts.
But there is little talk of material suffering. Trade union officials in countries such as Britain, where social security benefits can sometimes be more attractive in purely cash terms than holding a job, tend to avoid such talk altogether. A British labor leader, in a conversation with a reporter, said there was ''no misery'' in his country. Later he asked that his name not be used in connection with that remark.
Mr. Borsdorf of the West German labor organization said the situation was being met by social services. ''No one's existence is threatened,'' he said. ''The suffering is not a material problem.'' But difficulties may develop, he added, as more young people not entitled to unemployment benefits fail to find their first jobs. Mrs. Thatcher's Popularity
The relationship between joblessness and politics is far from constant. In Britain, which has endured the longest experience with tangible economic decline, the situation can be confounding.
Since Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister three and a half years ago, unemployment has risen from 6 percent, to an estimated average of 12.2 percent for all of 1982, but her popularity and that of the Conservative Party remains high. In a poll in late October, the Conservatives had 44.5 percent of the potential vote, compared with 34 percent for Labor. Mrs. Thatcher got a ''good'' or ''very good'' rating from 50 percent of the people polled.
Part of the explanation appears to be related to Britain's victory in the war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands , but Mr. Lee of the Trade Union Council said: ''The electorate just doesn't blame unemployment on her. They say it's the world recession, and then, 'Somehow it's good for us.' She's succeeding in convincing people it isn't her fault.''
Michael Alison, the minister of state for employment in the Thatcher Cabinet, wondered in an interview whether ''unemployment is more of a politician's preoccupation than a genuine public concern.'' 'Pain' Versus 'Vague Unease'
Explaining his point of view, he said: ''Joblessness is indeed our most important anxiety, but the politicians extrapolate that the pain of the hard-core unemployed is that of everyone. The concern of the rest of the population is not that pain - it's vague unease. The politicians register the trauma of the hard core and put it on everyone else.''
The difference, Mr. Alison said, between Britain and other European countries - Mrs. Thatcher is hardly regarded on the Continent as a proponent of enlightened social policy - may be that ''we've learned to live with the affliction.'' He said: ''We see a way out of low growth and high inflation. The Germans are getting to know the problems.''
What the various European countries can do about their situation is limited by their lack of resources, the costs of financing social programs on diminished tax revenues and their inability to accelerate private investment.
In some cases, there have been reactions that have met with wide disapproval for their apparent nationalistic and protectionist character. France's Import Restrictions
In France, where there is much talk about ''the reconquest of the domestic market,'' the Government has placed restrictions on imported video recorders, making it necessary to send them for inspection to the small city of Poitiers - roughly equivalent to requiring all wines imported by the United States to pass through a customs shed in Des Moines.
In Sweden the new Prime Minister, Olof Palme, ordered a devaluation of the krona by 16 percent immediately after taking office, a unilateral step angrily criticized by Sweden's main trading partners.
Attempts on a wider scale by one nation to impose its formula for ending its economic troubles have met with defeat. The five West German economic institutes, in presenting their fall report on the world economy to the Government in Bonn, described the French attempt to increase economic activity through encouraging consumption as a failure.
By American standards, modest attempts to tighten control over individual economies can clash with the habits formed during richer decades. In Belgium, where unemployment has risen to 14.8 percent and the inflation rate is close to 10 percent, there is talk of indexing wages to price levels, a practice abandoned earlier. The Government is also talking of cutting working time in industry by 5 percent and getting employers to increase their work force by 3 percent. Placing Blame on Others
This type of situation is sometimes accompanied by a degree of general passivity and resistance to the idea that Western Europe's problems are largely its own. For most of the last year, European politicians spent much time attacking high interest rates in the United States as the central cause of their domestic economic problems.
For the time being, this approach appears to have stopped in such places as France and Britain. But just a few days after he left power, former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany told an audience in Vienna that the world was in a social-economic crisis. This, he said, was related to the United States ''budget crisis, caused by sheer arrogance.'' To Mr. Schmidt, the state of the American economy, because of its size, is ''weighing the world economy down for all of us with its self-made recession.''
The Common Market commission's current economic report does not place the blame so far from home. It suggests that Western Europe can do something for itself, but its prognosis is guarded. Its recommendations for Europe involve standard policy thinking such as cutting budget deficits, limiting inflation and encouraging investment, while safeguarding jobs - all widely accepted, but not surprising, notions.
The general outline for economic policy-making proposed by the commission includes two sober phrases, however. They are: ''Europe's economy will enter a fourth year of stagnation in 1983. Nothing permits excluding the idea of a lasting deflationist situation.''

Abstract: In the 1970's, for example, lenders provided large sums to developing and Eastern European countries, which enabled them to finance new investment and imports. This, in turn, helped to sustain the growth and development of the industrialized world. At the same time, however, heavy borrowing led to heavy debt, and while under normal circumstances the I.M.F. might have required countries to curb unsustainable imports and borrowing and otherwise tighten belts, private financing allowed some nations to postpone recourse to the I.M.F. and necessary reforms as well. The result has been to dimininish the I.M.F.'s effectiveness. It would be useful for GATT to form a group of distinguished individuals from industrialized and developing nations - a group of wise men, if you will - to recommend ways to improve the trade and investment system in the decade ahead. The group should work closely with the I.M.F. to understand better how to reduce trade disruptions that result from sharp movements in exchange rates. And it should consider how to strenghten trade relations beween industrialized and developing nations, and avoid trade problems resulting from practices such as industrial polices and investment performance requirements. Finally, an adequate and predictable level of economic assistance is crucial to the ability of many developing countries to maintain sufficient economic growth and imports, and therefore important to the exporting countries of the industrialized world. Support for the World Bank - particularly its ''soft-loan'' window, the International Development Agency -as well as for sustained bilateral aid (however unpopular during periods of tight budgets and high unemployment) is necessary in any successful medium-term strategy.

Full text: The world economy is facing the most serious threat to its cohesion and prosperity in the postwar period. Inflation, recession, high unemployment and extraordinary trade and financial pressures are placing the principles and institutions of international economic cooperation under enormous stress.
The next few months will test the ability of many countries, ours included, to work with one another to reverse this deterioration. While it is unrealistic to expect that any single action or meeting can in itself achieve dramatic progress, a series of soundly conceived steps starting with this week's ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in Geneva, can taken together contribute to economic recovery.
Why are so many economic difficulties coming together all at once? The major reason is that many countries are paying the price for not adequately addressing economic problems during the 1970's. Because they did not achieve sustained reductions in inflation in that decade, a number of governments have been forced to take painful corrective action -tighter budgets, for example, and higher interest rates. These policies, in turn, have led to simultaneous recessions in the industrialized world, and, by weakening markets for exports from the third world, have added to developing countries' debt problems. The net result has been a mutually reinforcing contraction of world trade and growth.
This contraction in turn contributes to, and is made worse by, demands for new subsidies and import restrictions - in some cases to protect sensitive industries from foreign competition, in others to reduce trade deficits and thus control foreign debt. Whatever the reason, any country whose economy depends in some degree on exports is hurt.
One further problem is that the multilateral institutions that did so much to keep the world economy on an even keel in the 1970's - the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, GATT and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - are not as effectively used as they once were. This is particularly unfortunate at a time when economic interdependence has reduced the ability of individual countries to resolve problems by themselves.
In the 1970's, for example, lenders provided large sums to developing and Eastern European countries, which enabled them to finance new investment and imports. This, in turn, helped to sustain the growth and development of the industrialized world. At the same time, however, heavy borrowing led to heavy debt, and while under normal circumstances the I.M.F. might have required countries to curb unsustainable imports and borrowing and otherwise tighten belts, private financing allowed some nations to postpone recourse to the I.M.F. and necessary reforms as well. The result has been to dimininish the I.M.F.'s effectiveness.
A similar fate has befallen GATT, the 87-nation compact that has set rules for world trade for 35 years. As world trade has slowed and unemployment increased, the trend toward trade liberalization, which enjoyed popular support in better times, has been reversed by a series of restraints, including nontariff barriers (onerous inspection procedures, for example), and increasing use of subsidies by some countries to give their own industries an advantage. Such measures generally have bypassed GATT because its rules either did not limit the particular practice or were ambiguous enough to be discounted. Equally serious is the inadequate support GATT receives from many members.
Reversing the deterioration in the world economy requires a sound medium-term strategy to achieve increased growth and employment while avoiding a return to the inflationary policies and structural rigidities that contributed to many of today's difficulties.
Such a strategy, with growth and employment as its two objectives, would involve several components. For major industrialized countries, it would mean a concerted effort to make monetary and fiscal policy more growth-oriented, while avoiding rekindling inflation or an increase in interest rates.
In this context, the United States should continue the momentum toward lower interest rates and lower inflation by significantly cutting the budget deficits projected for fiscal 1984 and 1985. This - together with continuation of present Federal Reserve policy - would reduce long-term interest rates and thereby encourage increased investment and a reduction in the exchange rate of the currently overvalued dollar. And it would enable other countries to relax somewhat their monetary policies without suffering an excessive outflow of capital or weaker exchange rates.
In order to generate more jobs within the context of a lower Federal deficit, the United States and other industrialized countries ought to increase the portion of government expenditures devoted to productive economic infrastructure - to roads, bridges, railroads, for example. Similarly, a substantially increased government-sponsored educational and training program, particularly necessary at a time of rapid technological change, is a good investment in increased, and more productive, employment and lower inflation.
While each country must determine what it can do, a ministerial meeting of the 24-nation O.E.C.D. might identify, and encourage countries to make, policy improvements that even if individually modest could reinforce one another and thus together improve prospects for steady recovery.
Parallel with this effort, a strong commitment is needed to avoid new impediments to productive investment and to phase out those that are proving most troublesome. Moves by Denmark and France to eliminate wage indexing, which tends to spur inflation, are good examples of what can be done, even in difficult circumstances.
For a number of developing countries, a sound medium-term strategy would involve policies to restore a strong balance-of-payments position. Each, of course, carries primary responsibility for its own efforts, but the adverse international impact of insufficient measures to reduce deficits or a sharp decline in developing countries' ability to grow and import gives other nations a strong interest in seeing that the stabilization process is smooth and that it permits future borrowing on a sustainable basis.
The I.M.F. must be able to play an effective role in supporting stabilization policies. For this it needs a large pool of its own resources, and backup funds on which it can call in extraordinary situations. A large (at least 50 percent) quota increase and a contingency support fund are both necessary. In addition, closer collaboration among the I.M.F., private lenders and national monetary authorities is needed to encourage corrective measures at an early sign of trouble, before balance-of-payments problems become acute. Such action might have prevented the problems Mexico now faces.
The GATT meeting offers a timely opportunity to begin the process of improving trading rules and procedures and to demonstrate that nations are still capable of working cooperatively to resolve trade problems. To be sure, nations tend to look inward in difficult circumstances rather than focus on systemic improvements. But there should be a consensus enough for the participants to confront the need for a system of rules that promotes fairness and predictability in world trade. Work must begin, for example, on ways to address thorny issues such as trade in services and farm products and to find ways of streamlining GATT's mechanism for settling disputes.
In order to avoid further deterioration while this work is going on, countries should declare a freeze on new trade restrictions and subsidies not clearly consistent with GATT. Unless genuine multilateral progress can be made in these areas, it will be difficult for many countries to resist pressures for unilateral actions that will further erode the trading system.
It would be useful for GATT to form a group of distinguished individuals from industrialized and developing nations - a group of wise men, if you will - to recommend ways to improve the trade and investment system in the decade ahead. The group should work closely with the I.M.F. to understand better how to reduce trade disruptions that result from sharp movements in exchange rates. And it should consider how to strenghten trade relations beween industrialized and developing nations, and avoid trade problems resulting from practices such as industrial polices and investment performance requirements.
Finally, an adequate and predictable level of economic assistance is crucial to the ability of many developing countries to maintain sufficient economic growth and imports, and therefore important to the exporting countries of the industrialized world. Support for the World Bank - particularly its ''soft-loan'' window, the International Development Agency -as well as for sustained bilateral aid (however unpopular during periods of tight budgets and high unemployment) is necessary in any successful medium-term strategy.
The next few months will be critical. The worse the situation becomes, the greater the risk of permanent damage to the international economic system and major harm to economies, such as ours, which increasingly depend on it. A credible and tangible affirmation of willingness to act together is urgently needed in the major capitals, and in international forums, beginning this week in Geneva. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Robert D.

Full text: Following is a transcript of the address by the President to the nation from Washington last night, as recorded by The New York Times: My fellow Americans, in recent days all of us have been swamped by a sea of economic statistics, some good, some bad, and some just plain confusing. There are times when I think that the paper traffic that crosses my desk in a week could fill a big city phone book, and then some.
The value of the dollar is up around the world. Interest rates are down by 40 percent. The stock and bond markets surge upward. Inflation is down 59 percent. Buying power is going up. Some economic indicators are down. Others are up. But the dark cloud of unemployment hangs over the lives of 11 million of our friends, neighbors and family.
At times, the sheer weight of all these facts and figures makes them hard for anyone to understand. What do they really mean, and what can we do to make them better?
Well, the first step is to understand what they mean in human terms, how they're affecting the everyday lives of our people. Because behind every one of those numbers are millions of individual lives: young couples struggling to make ends meet, teen-agers looking for work, older Americans threatened by inflation, small-business men fighting for survival, and parents working for a better future for their children. 'Want to Make It a Better Place'
All of them have one thing in common. They're Americans who love this country of ours and want to make it a better place. They're brave, hard-working people who know that America today faces serious problems that were long years in the making. And they're desperately trying to make sense out of all the statistics, slogans and political jargon filling the airwaves in this election year. Above all, they're concerned citizens who are looking for guideposts on the road to recovery, for ways to help see our country through to better times.
I know because I hear from hundreds of them every day, in meetings here at the White House, on visits to schools, meeting halls, factories and fairgrounds across the country, and in thousands of phone calls and letters. I only wish I could share with you tonight all that they have to say - their hopes, their fears, their concerns and, most of all, their quiet, patient courage. Letter From Selma, Ala.
But let me just give you one example that speaks for so many of you, a letter from a wife and mother named Judith, who lives in Selma, Ala.
''Dear Mr. President,'' she writes. ''It's 3:45 A.M., and for over an hour I've been unable to sleep ... this morning I need very much to believe in something ... I'm not writing so much as an individual, but as a representative of so many. We need to talk with you - to believe that you hear us ...
''After years of training and experience, we can't find jobs. National unemployment figures sound almost healthy next to the almost 19 percent we're enduring in Selma.
''The costs for basic survival are nearly beyond belief ... there may never be a house - home of our own -that dream we've worked for for so many years .... We have said 'no' to so many things ... we're afraid and confused. We've worked hard - we conserved - we planned - we were frugal - careful. We feel so out of control. We don't want a handout - we just want to help make the system well again.
''We must know that in the tons of bureaucracy ... we've not been lost ... we want to help. We want a better life, and we're willing to work for it. We believe. We must - it's all we have.'' The American Dream
Well, Judith, I hear you. And millions of other men and women like you stand for the values of hard work, thrift, commitment to family and love of God that made this country so great, and will make us great again. And you deserve to know what we're doing in these difficult times to bring your dream - the American dream -back to life again after so many years of mistakes and neglect.
Tonight, in homes across this country, unemployment is the problem uppermost on many people's minds. Getting Americans back to work is an urgent priority for all of us - and especially for this Administration.
But remember, you can't solve unemployment without solving the things that caused it - the out-of-control government spending, the skyrocketing inflation and interest rates that led to unemployment in the first place. Unless you get at the root causes of the problem - which is exactly what our economic program is doing - you may be able to temporarily relieve the symptoms, but you'll never cure the disease. You may even make it worse.
I have a special reason for wanting to solve this problem in a lasting way. I was 21 and looking for work in 1932, one of the worst years of the Great Depression, and I can remember one bleak night in the Thirties when my father learned on Christmas Eve that he'd lost his job. To be young in my generation was to feel that your future had been mortgaged out from under you - and that's a tragic mistake we must never allow our leaders to make again. Today's young people must never be held hostage to the mistakes of the past.
The only way to avoid making those mistakes again is to learn from them.
The pounding economic hangover America's suffering from didn't come about overnight and there's no single, instant cure. In recent weeks, a lot of people have been playing what I call the ''blame game.'' the accusing finger has been pointed in every direction of the compass and a lot of time and hot air have been spent looking for scapegoats.
Well, there's plenty of blame to go around. The problems we face are bigger than any one party or group of people. They're the result not of weeks or months, but of years - even decades - of past mistakes. The problem isn't who to blame - it's what to blame. So tonight let's forget about party politics and take a look at how our country got into this fix and what we can do to get her out of it.
When I said this problem was years in the making, I wasn't just using a figure of speech. This chart shows you what I mean. You see that red line. It represents the rate of unemployment from 1968 through the present and it tells us two important things. First of all, it's a jagged line, representing rises and dips in unemployment as our economy passed through boom periods and bust periods over the past decade. This reminds us that the current recession is part of a long series - a series that hasn't stopped because, in the past, when the crunch came, too many in government resorted to quick fixes instead of getting to the root cause.
Each time they applied the quick fixes, unemployment dipped for awhile, only to take off again. In that sense, you could say that we've been on a decade-long roller coaster ride. 'Kept Notching Upward'
The only difference is that, on a roller coaster, you end up on solid ground once the ride is over. As you can see from the chart, while unemployment zigzagged from year to year, its long-term direction kept notching upward. Notice that each so-called recovery left unemployment higher than before the recession.
In 1968, unemployment stood at 3.6 percent. In 1971, it shot up to 5.9 percent. Then it started coming down again, but instead of going all the way back to 3.6 percent, it bottomed out at 4.9 percent. In 1974, it started shooting up again, and the same thing happened. It bottomed out at a higher level than before. In other words, for all its short-term ups and downs, the unemployment roller coaster was really an escalator, edging its way up the charts throughout the last decade. Unless we reverse that trend, it can only get worse, not just for us, but for our children and grandchildren.
Now let's look at what's behind this bad trend in unemployment. What's been causing it for over a decade? A second chart tells much of the story, but before we look at it, I'll bet many of you've already come up with the answer. 'Single Most Pressing Problem'
It's a phenomenon that, last year, a majority of Americans correctly identified as our single most pressing long-term problem - inflation.
Inflation, and the high interest rates it leads to, are the real culprits. They create the economic climate that leads to unemployment.
This blue line represents inflation. Like unemployment, inflation has zigzagged over the last decade, but, you can see that, up to now, the long-term trend has been upwards. Again, as with unemployment, the old quick fixes simply did not work. Each time they were applied, they gave a little temporary relief to the patient, but left him weaker than he was before.
It's a consistent pattern. Each time inflation has shot up since 1969 there has been a deadly, delayed reaction of rising unemployment. Inflation is like a virus in the economic bloodstream, sometimes dormant and sometimes active, but leaving the patient weaker after every new attack.
My fellow Americans, we've got to stop these trendlines to disaster. To do that we have to understand what causes them. Well, for starters, our Federal Government has been living beyond its means for more than a generation. One of the wisest of our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, warned that the public debt is ''the greatet of dangers to be feared.'' He believed that it was wrong for one generation to forever burden the generations yet to come, and, for the first 150 years of our history, our leaders heeded Jefferson's warning. 'Rage Out of Control'
But not lately. In our lifetimes we've seen Government spending rage out of control. We've only had one balanced budget in the last 22 years.
So now, we're staggering under a trillion dollar debt. This year, before Government can spend one dime to feed the hungry, care for the sick or protect our freedom, it must plan to spend $110 billion just to pay interest on that debt. And still the big spenders wonder why the American people want what a stubborn minority in the House of Representatives denied them just 12 days ago, a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
All of this Government spending and red ink can only spawn higher taxes and whopping deficits which, for nearly two decades, led to inflationary increases in the money supply. Inflation and massive Government borrowing drive up interest rates. That makes it difficult or impossible for families to get the credit they need to buy homes, cars and appliances, or for businesses to invest in greater productivity. And, ultimately, inflation leads to recession and unemployment. We've had eight recessions since World War II. Impact of Inflation
At the bottom of it all is inflation -Government-caused inflation. Over the years, our leaders adopted something called the ''new economics'' based on a belief that a little inflation each year created prosperity. But, each time the economic disruption caused by inflation triggered another round of recession and high unemployment, the Government reacted, not like your family would - by putting its own house in order - but by spending, borrowing and printing more money.
Unemployment would dip for a time, but the same quick fix that temporarily eased unemployment was sending inflation back through the ceiling.
It was a vicious cycle. Too many people played politics with the economy for too long, and those twin disaster lines kept inching ominously upward, bringing our society closer and closer to catastrophe.
In a way, I guess I can understand why so many of our political leaders fell into this trap. I'm sure they did it with the best of intentions. It's easy to lose touch with reality when it's other people's money that you're spending and there are so many things you want to do for those or this or that special-interest group - so many programs, many of them quite attractive and well-meaning, that can only be subsidized by more Government taxing, spending and borrowing. I can understand how it happened. Indeed, like many others, for a time I accepted Government's claim that it was sound economics, but there came a day when I, and millions of other Americans, began to realize the terrible consequences of all those years of playing politics as usual while the economic disaster lines crept higher and higher.
Well, at my age, I didn't come to Washington to play politics as usual. I didn't come here to reward pressure groups by spending other people's money. And, most of all, I didn't come here to further mortgage the future of the American people just to buy a little short-term political popularity. I came to Washington to try to solve problems - not to sweep them under the rug and leave them for those who will come later. Worst Enemy Is Economic
A President's greatest responsibility is to protect all our people from enemies, foreign and domestic. Here at home, the worst enemy we face is economic - the creeping erosion of the American way of life and the American dream that has resulted in today's tragedy of economic stagnation and unemployment.
Now I don't pretend for a moment that, in 21 months, we've been able to undo all the damage to our economy that has built up over more than 20 years. The first part of our program has been on the books only one year and 13 days. Much of the legislation we need has still not been enacted. We've still got a long way to go before we restore our prosperity. But what I can report to you tonight, my fellow Americans, is that, at long last, your Government has a program in place that faces our problems and has already started solving them.
Twenty-one months ago, we faced five critical problems: high taxes, runaway Government spending, inflation, high interest rates and unemployment.
Getting to the roots of unemployment meant fighting inflation and high interest rates caused by runaway Government spending and taxing because we know that, when inflation shoots up, it triggers a delayed-action rise in unemployment; now inflation is being driven back down, and lower unemployment will follow.
So we started by winning the first real tax cut for the American people in nearly two decades. Our program brings down income tax rates 25 percent. At the same time, we've been cutting costly, wasteful Government regulations and the rate of increase in Government spending. We've reduced the rate of Government spending growth by nearly two-thirds. Cites Decline in Interest
Inflation, which registered 12.4 percent in 1980, is down to just 5.1 percent so far this year. Interest rates, which had climbed as high as 21 1/2 percent before we took office, have this week fallen to 12 percent, not low enough, but certainly heading in the right direction.
Unemployment, always a lagging indicator in times of recession has not yet stopped its upward drift. But in 21 months, we've already brought tax rates down by a quarter, with the third installment coming next July, and brought down the rate of increase in Government spending by nearly twothirds. That's helped us to bring down the rate of inflation by more than half, and that's helped us to bring down interest rates by 40 percent.
So, on four out of five problems that faced us in 1980, we've made important progress. We haven't solved them all, but we're making headway. Just last week, the Federal Reserve Bank decided to lower its discount rate to 9.5 percent, the first time this key interest rate has gone below two digits since 1979, and the fifth reduction in just four months. This demonstrates the Fed's confidence that inflation and market rates will continue coming down, and its confidence that we can work together for a healthy, noninflationary recovery. All of this lays the ground work for a recovery that will mean more jobs and more opportunity for all our people, but it's a delayed reaction. 'Remember the Trendlines'
Remember the trendlines. Just as surely as skyrocketing inflation created a negative reaction that drove up unemployment, bringing down inflation and interest rates is creating a positive reaction that will boost employment. I wish there were a quicker, easier way, Some magic short cut, But unemployment is always one of the last things to turn around as an economy heads into recovery.
And make no mistake, America is recovery-bound and the world knows it. The American dollar, beaten down and distrusted in the late 1970's, is showing new strength. Recently, we've been seeing a surge of investment in our stock and bond markets. This is no flash in the pan. Markets will go up and they will come down, but the trend in the United States is up.
What's more, this investment is coming from all over, from home, from abroad, from small investors on Main Street, to those who manage billions of dollars, including our workers' pension funds.
Why aren't these people heeding the drumbeat of doom and gloom coming from Washington? Because they've been watching this country's inflation and interest rates dropping for months. They realize this Administration means business in the battle against inflation. Their decision to put cash on the line is a strong vote of confidence in the foundation being laid for America's recovery, Healthy, stable growth that will bring new jobs and opportunity for our people without returning us to runaway inflation and interest rates.
That's the one big difference between the recovery America is headed for today, and the shaky, temporary recoveries of the recent past - this one is built to last.
With your support we can show the world that we've learned our lesson and that this time we'e going to get the job done and get it done right. This time we'e going to keep inflation, interest rates and government spending, taxing and borrowing down, and get Americans back on the job.
Much of the work that remains to be done requires Congressional cooperation. As you know, Congress adjourned Oct. 2 for the election campaign, but it left behind a lot of unfinished business. For this reason, I urged the Congress to reconvene, after the elections, so they can do its part, as quickly as possible, to continue the work of recovery. We simply can't afford to wait until next year when something as vital as the economic health of America is at stake.
The Congress will return on Nov. 29. It will face five top economic priorities - priorities that must be addressed. He Lists the Priorities
First, the Congress must do its part to control Government spending. Before adjourning, it sent me only two appropriationbills. Eleven more remain to be passed, and I will use the veto if necessary to keep them within the budget. When the Congress passed the tax package this summer, it pledged to save $3in outlays for every $1in new revenues. I intend to hold the Congress to its word.
Second, I urge the Congress to reconsider the Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. This crucial measure was passed by the Senate and supported by a clear majority in the House of Representatives. It was only defeated because of the hard core opposition of a minority of Representatives who prefer continued big spending.
Third, the Congress should act on regulatory reform to help make Government more economical and efficient, and the private sector more productive. Regulatory reform legislation was passed unanimously by the Senate, but was bottled up in committee in the House.
Fourth, the time has come for passage of the Enterprise Zones Initiative to revive declining inner city and rural communities by providing new incentives to develop businessand jobs. This program was approved by Senate Finance Committee but still awaits action on the Senate floor and in the House.
And, fifth, we need to pass the Clean Air Bill which, while protecting the environment, will make it possible for industry to rebuild its productive base and create more jobs. 'It Is Not an Easy Job'
But it isn't an easy job, this challenge to rebuild America and renew the American dream. And I know it can be tempting, listening to some who would go back to the old ways and the quick fix. But consider the choice. A return to the big spending and big taxing that left us with 21 1/2 percent interest rates is no real alternative. A return to double-digit inflation is no alternative. A return to taxing and taxing the American people, - that's no alternative. That's what destroyed millions of American jobs. Together we've chosen a new road for America. It's a far better road. We need only the courage to see it through. I know we can. Throughout our history, we Americans have proven again and again that no challenge is too big for a free, united people.
Together we can do it again. We can do it by slowly but surely working our way back to prosperity that will mean jobs for all who are willing to work, and fulfillment for all who still cherish the American dream.
We can do it, my fellow Americans, by staying the course. Thank you, good night and God bless you.

Full text: International U.S. Marines will land in Beirut today and will remain there until Israeli and Syrian forces are withdrawn from Lebanon, President Reagan announced at a televised news conference. An American official said the Marines could be in Beirut ''for some time.'' (Page A1, Column 6.) A full inquiry on the Beirut massacre of Palestinians was approved by Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The Israeli leader dropped his opposition to establishing a judicial commission to carry out a thorough investigation in the face of intensive pressure from within his governing coalition as well as mounting criticism by many Israelis. (A1:4-5.)
Israeli troops withdrew from the port of Beirut, and the Lebanese state radio said that American marines would land today. (A1:5-6.) Twelve U.S.-Vietnamese children are set to leave Ho Chi Minh City tomorrow for the United States, State Department officials said. The youngsters, all United States citizens, are the first substantial group of Amerasians to leave Vietnam in years, and relief officials hope that others may soon be free to depart. (A16:1-5.)

Mexicans are pressing property sales in the United States worth billions of dollars as a result of Mexico's currency crisis. The dumping of property, particularly of high-priced condominiums in resort areas, has followed curbs on currency movement that have made it impossible for most of the Mexicans to make mortgage payments because they cannot send money out of Mexico. (A16:1-5.) A derailment and toxic fire forced the evacuation of 2,000 residents of a five-mile area around the south Lousiana town of Livingston. The derailment of the 101-car freight carrying explosive and poisonous chemicals ignited a roaring blaze so intense and explosions so hazardous that officials were at a loss over how to battle the blaze. Louisiana declared a state of emergency. (A16:1-2.) Proponents of a breeder reactor broke ground at the Clinch River in Oak Ridge, Tenn., after more than a decade of controversy. The Senate is nearing a vote on a proposal to halt financing for the project, which would be the nation's first plutonium-fueled nuclear breeder reactor. (D27:1-4.) A milestone for pay-per-view TV has been marked with a showing of ''Star Wars'' for about 1.5 million cable-television subscribers who mailed in $8 apiece to see the biggest box-office hit ever two years before it will be broadcast by CBS-TV. The experimental showing, along with others scheduled, will shape the future of the cable-television industry. (A1:1-3.) Paul Kollsman, the inventor of the altimeter in the late 1920's, died in a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 82. Mr. Kollsman was a prolific inventor, and his altimeter, which enables a pilot to fly ''blind'' by measuring and registering a plane's altitude, was a milestone in advancing aviation. (D26:6.) Metropolitan A trade-in of Westway funds for mass transit aid would get a sympathetic White House hearing if Lewis E. Lehrman, who opposes the project, is elected Governor and requests a trade-in, according to James A. Baker 3d, President Reagan's chief of staff. Mr. Lehrman said he favored a more modest highway for Manhattan and would seek the trade-in. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic-Liberal candidate, favors Westway. (A1:1.) The first debate in Connecticut's gubernatorial campaign was held before an audience of about 600 in a New Haven church. Gov. William A. O'Neill and his Republican opponent, Lewis B. Rome, traded allegations of incompetence, irresponsibility and dishonesty. (B1:2-3.) Detention of teachers who continue to defy a court order to halt a strike in Teaneck, N.J., was threatened by Superior Court Judge Sherwin D. Lester. He said he was ready to order into custody large numbers of teachers and, if necessary, hold them in a public school, with Bergen County sheriff's men as guards, if they refused to return to classrooms today. (B2:6.) Norman Armour died at his home at the age of 94. The career Foreign Service officer served as minister or ambassador to a dozen countries and had been Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs. (D26:1-2.)

Abstract: You've seen the ''Peanuts'' classic. Lucy's index finger is on a football awaiting Charlie Brown's big toe. ''Come on, Charlie Brown - kick it!'' she says. Charlie Brown says no. ''Come on, Charlie Brown,'' she says, ''kick it!'' Every year Lucy plays this dumb trick on him. Just as he runs to the ball and begins to kick she whisks the ball away, and he lands boink! on his head. This year, he tells her, he's not going to fall for it. Lucy swears up and down that this year she'll really hold the ball - ascribes past behavior to immaturity, since outgrown - but Charlie Brown shakes his head. ''I swear I won't pull the ball away,'' she says. ''I swear!'' This year, she means it. She really, really means it. So, trusting soul, Charlie Brown runs up to the ball, kicks his little heart out - and lands boink on his head. Lucy laughs hysterically. ''Well, I suppose it's that concern put in its crudest form, but you don't even have to put it that way. It's not that Congress goes and legislates a different policy, which is the ultimate possibility. Your policy itself is not going to be successful if you haven't got a reasonable degree of understanding around the country of what you're trying to do and a kind of willingness to support it. I'm not saying you have to have a majority vote. You can have a lot of opposition. But I don't think you can sustain a policy whose purpose nobody understands. So you've got to operate under that general constraint, if for no other reason than if they don't understand it, they don't think it's going to last. Which is where you come back to your psychological point - getting people to believe.'' With everyone in ''the big environment'' screaming about interest rates, the effort now is to ease up, insofar as may be justified, without reigniting inflation. That is a two-part effort. First you have to figure out how much easing is justified; then you have to get the financial markets to ''agree.'' ''That's all I'm saying: that some day the good scenario ought to feed upon itself. So the question you're raising, I think, is: How long does the bad scenario feed upon itself before it gets overtaken by the good one? I hope we're pretty close to that point. And I think we are. But of course I can't prove it.'' One night, a few months before he made these rather prescient comments, the chairman was going to dinner with his wife. (Barbara Volcker is a bookkeeper at a New York architectural firm. He usually flies up on weekends to the Manhattan co-op they bought in 1975, ''when everybody thought New York was going to go bust.'' Sometimes she comes to stay in the modest one-bedroom apartment he rents within walking distance of the Fed.) He went out and got in the car, behind the Federal Reserve driver. ''I look over his shoulder'' -Volcker enjoys telling this story - ''and he's reading a book. The name of the book was: 'How to Make Inflation Pay.' I don't know who it was written by, but it was one of those books. Two or three months ago, you know, we'd had a string of good price statistics, and I keep making speeches about how things are going to get better. And there he is reading this book!

Full text: We are hardly out of the economic woods. But last June, when Paul A. Volcker sat for the first extended on-the-record interview since he became chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, things were worse.
Yet even then, with the stock market dismally low and headed lower, with unemployment high and headed higher, with interest rates stuck in what some considered an impossible deadly gridlock - even then, Volcker made a strong case that much of the worst was behind us. That this decade, if we keep our wits about us, could become the reverse of the last one: falling inflation, falling interest rates, rising productivity, rising real wages, falling unemployment.
Given today's improved but still precarious environment, it sounds almost too good to be true. Is it possible things could actually go right for a change?
''This is not an impossible vision,'' Volcker reported to Congress earlier in the year. ''Much of the groundwork has been laid.'' There has been the Fed's own restrictive monetary policy, a steady ''leaning against the wind'' of inflation, which Volcker vows to continue. There have been, too, moves toward deregulation, a moderating in the demands of labor and changes in the tax code to encourage investment (one little-noted result: some 14 million Americans set up Individual Retirement Accounts in just the first three months of this year).
''What we're aiming for,'' says Volcker, ''is a situation in which people can proceed about their business without worrying about what prices are going to do over the next year, two years, three years, 10 years, and can take it for granted that they're going to be more or less stable. And in that kind of environment you ought to have the interest rates we had in the mid-60's, anyway.''
The prime rate in 1965 averaged 4 1/2 percent. Municipal bonds yielded 3 1/4 percent. Home mortgages were still under 6 percent, as they had been, with only minor exceptions, for more than a century.
''Today,'' he says, ''we are acutely aware of disturbed capital markets, high interest rates, economic slack and poor productivity. But when the economy begins to expand, productivity should rise. That will permit prices to rise more slowly than wages, encouraging further moderation in wage demands.'' And further disinflation. ''As confidence returns to securities markets, prices of bonds and stocks should rise. Lower interest rates will, in turn, support the continuing growth in investment and productivity.'' Things could gradually get better and better. ''With appropriate budgetary and monetary discipline, the process could be sustained for years.'' In the broadest sense, the principal responsibility of the nation's central bank is to see to the health of the national currency: the dollar. Inflation wrecks a nation's currency, and the inflation Volcker inherited on Aug. 6, 1979, was of a type so prolonged and virulent that many young Americans - as he frequently points out - have never not known it.
In theory, faced with economic and social chaos - for this is what prolonged, accelerating inflation inevitably brings - the Fed would get tough, which it has; and so would Congress - which it hasn't. (''The trouble is Congress,'' opined Business Week on its Aug. 16 cover.)
Notwithstanding the $98.3 billion tax package the President managed to ram through recently, Congress has given us a 1983 budget deficit projected to approach $150 billion. In a recession, such a deficit, given the size of our economy, should be tolerable. Far worse, however, is this: The deficit is projected at similar or higher levels in 1984 and 1985. Even with an economic recovery. (It's one thing for a family to spend more than it earns for a while, after one spouse has been laid off; quite another to overspend all the time.)
One best-selling doomsayer thus describes the Fed's efforts, which he lauds, as ''one hand clapping.'' Buy gold, he says, the next round of inflation will be much worse. (''Is he still saying that?'' Volcker asks.)
There are lots of complicated technical things the Fed can do to ''administer monetary policy,'' but really they boil down to two: The Fed can ease up, by expanding the money supply, which it does by buying Treasury securities, thereby putting more money in the banking network; or tighten up, by restricting it (selling those securities).
Here's the way it's supposed to work: If the Fed pumps money into the system, interest rates - the price of money - fall. (Money is like anything else: When you increase its supply, its price falls.) Lower interest rates allow more people to buy cars and houses; business booms; unemployment falls; tax receipts rise; everything is wonderful.
Except that if you pump money into the economy faster than is needed to keep up with real growth, you fuel inflation. Pumping new dollars into the system cheapens those already in existence.
So what's been happening - at least until recently - is that when the financial markets (which include anyone with a few dollars to invest) perceive an easing in money, they fear a new round of inflation - and so they demand higher interest rates.
Great! Tighten up and interest rates rise; ease up -and they also rise. This does not leave a lot of room to maneuver. The trick is for the Fed to be able to ease up a bit, occasionally, as conditions warrant, while persuading the financial markets that the fundamental anti-inflationary policy has not been abandoned.
It's not enough simply to say the policy has not been abandoned. We've been through too much to believe all the pronouncements of our elected and appointed officials. That only worked in a simpler, more innocent time. Anyone who bought 8 1/2 percent 30-year bonds in 1976, when inflation had been damped down from double digits to a mere 5 percent, trusting promises of a sound dollar ever after, carries a deep scar. Volcker appreciates the problem. Credibility must be earned, he constantly reasserts, by persistence and performance.
Affirms Ashby Bladen, author of ''How to Cope With the Developing Financial Crisis,'' as skeptical of government pronouncements as anyone: ''The only way that confidence and, therefore, moderate and stable interest rates can be restored,'' ''is through a long period of responsible and noninflationary policies.''
''Recently,'' he adds, ''Fed policy has been rather reassuring.''
You've seen the ''Peanuts'' classic. Lucy's index finger is on a football awaiting Charlie Brown's big toe. ''Come on, Charlie Brown - kick it!'' she says. Charlie Brown says no. ''Come on, Charlie Brown,'' she says, ''kick it!'' Every year Lucy plays this dumb trick on him. Just as he runs to the ball and begins to kick she whisks the ball away, and he lands boink! on his head. This year, he tells her, he's not going to fall for it. Lucy swears up and down that this year she'll really hold the ball - ascribes past behavior to immaturity, since outgrown - but Charlie Brown shakes his head. ''I swear I won't pull the ball away,'' she says. ''I swear!'' This year, she means it. She really, really means it. So, trusting soul, Charlie Brown runs up to the ball, kicks his little heart out - and lands boink on his head. Lucy laughs hysterically.
''Is it fair to say,'' Volcker is asked, ''that this is the nub of the whole thing? That your very biggest problem, in a way, is somehow convincing the financial markets that you really, really mean it?''
''Yes. Without killing the economy in the process.'' The Fed is charged with managing the money supply. O.K. - what's money? Cash, of course, and checking-account balances. But do you include money-market funds? Savings accounts? Saving certificates? Savings bonds? (Corporate bonds? Stocks? Options? Diamonds? Baseball cards?) How about borrowing power?
It used to be that the only way to buy something was to have coins in your pocket. Someone with no coins had no money. Today, someone with no coins but $2,000 of unused credit on his MasterCard can buy $2,000 worth of goods. Is that credit line ''money''?
Ultimately, says Volcker, you could technically get to the point where nobody keeps any cash or checking-account balance at all. Everybody runs an overdraft all the time. ''Then what do you call the money supply? The total of their overdraft limits?''
''Basically, we've got a problem of interpreting what is going on ourselves,'' Nancy Hays Teeters, a Fed governor, told The New York Times recently. Echoed Frank E. Morris, the president of Federal Reserve Bank of Boston: ''I have ... concluded, most reluctantly, that we can no longer measure the money supply with any kind of precision. ...''
If you can't define it or measure it, how do you control it? ''Obviously,'' Volcker responds, ''our presumption is that you can do it within a narrow enough band - which is not as narrow as some people think it is - in a way that's meaningful in today's conditions. But I don't think you can just write a rule that's supposed to last for 10 years or something'' (as it was recently proposed).
What many laymen, and some congressmen, fail to grasp, is that economics may be a ''science,'' but it works less neatly in the real world than in textbooks. It's one thing to get a couple of chemicals to react the way they should; people are less predictable. You can feed new dollars into the system, for example, but how do you feed people the confidence to borrow and invest them?
Consider: If the projected budget deficits were smaller, interest rates would be lower (because Treasury borrowing and inflationary expectations would ease). Yet if only interest rates were lower, the budget deficit would be smaller (because tax receipts would be higher, expenditures lower).
It is one of those circular problems very much on the order of ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' Today's version: ''If we had confidence inflation were ending'' - and consequently moderated our wage demands, committed our money to productive longterm investments, and so forth - ''inflation would end.''
And yet, one Fed governor acknowledged, ''you can push the economy so hard to kill inflation that you discourage the investment that killing inflation was meant to stimulate.''
As the economists at the Aetna Life and Casualty Company put it this summer: ''Our central bankers have so far engineered the economy along the razor's edge between reinflation and financial chaos. The more doctrinaire monetarists'' - Treasury Under Secretary Beryl Sprinkel's crowd - ''may call this irresponsible. We prefer to call it the application of reasoned human judgment.'' Given the extraordinary difficulties Volcker has faced, and still faces, as chairman of the nation's central bank, it is hard not to wonder whether he actually likes his job. ''Do you like this job?'' he is asked as he settles his 6-foot-7-inch frame onto the couch under one of two large paintings in his office (a garden scene, by the wife of the staff director for monetary and financial policy). He is wearing a banker's pin-striped suit and has a sharp pencil sticking out of the pocket a dandier soul might use to display a handkerchief.
The question makes him laugh. Volcker has a voice like the largest drum in the band, tapped gently, for the most part, and an almost Santa-like laugh. He is entirely forthcoming.
''I don't think of it in those terms,'' he says, ''I really don't. I know some people say, 'Gee, is it exciting?' or, 'Are you having fun?' -that's a favorite question -and I suppose in some deeper sense I am, but ...'' (his voice rises to a low boom as he laughs) ''... I don't think of it as fun on a day-to-day BA-A-sis! There's a satisfaction, I guess, but it seems to me you do it because it's here, and you got picked.'
Volcker got picked by Jimmy Carter to succeed the undistinguished chairmanship of G. William Miller (1978-79), who had succeeded Arthur F. Burns (1970-78), who had succeeded William McChesney Martin Jr. (1951-70). There were Fed chairmen before Bill Martin -Charles Hamlin, in 1914, was the first - but that's not important. Not important, either, but the principal way the public has perceived these men: Burns smoked a pipe, Miller smoked nothing and posted a sign requesting the same of his colleagues (with mixed results), and Volcker smokes Antonio y Cleopatra Grenadiers, $1.45 the half dozen.
Periodically as he speaks, legs outstretched on the sofa, he absent-mindedly waves a match in the air to extinguish it, then tosses it into a large pewter ashtray (that reads: ''When You Leave New York, You Ain't Going Nowhere''). Still smoldering, the match bounces out onto the hardwood coffee table. Again and again, his interviewer reaches over to make the save. Volcker played basketball for Princeton, but only second string. Now his sport is fishing. This is important, since it reflects one of his principal attributes: patience. Two others: consistency and, as one senator put it near the end of a 190-minute subcommittee grilling session, ''coolness under fire.''
Volcker did not succeed Bill Miller thinking he had all the answers. ''In a very general way, I thought I had some sense of what the problems were,'' he says. ''It's a field I've been in virtually all my life. But I did not have the sense that this was an ideal time - and certainly not an easy time - to become chairman of the board.''
Prior to assuming the chairmanship, he had presided over the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. There he earned $116,000. As chairman of the entire 12-bank system, he earns $60,663. For this princely stipend, some would say, he bears the weight of the Western world on his shoulders. But Paul Volcker, 55, does not appear to be a man raw from criticism or awesomely burdened. He has no great difficulty sleeping.
''I see myself to a considerable extent as part of an institution,'' he says. ''And not just the institution of the Federal Reserve, but in a broader sense as part of a bigger governmental apparatus. I don't personalize it as much as people outside do.'' Like the 2,000 construction-industry folk, a couple of years ago, who slapped $1.81 in postage on blocks of 2-by-4's, addressed them to Paul A. Volcker, ink on wood, and dropped them in the mail. ''I've become the symbol for monetary policy. Maybe I don't feel quite as burdened as I might if I really had all the power people think I have.''
(When ''leaders in 30 fields'' were asked by U.S. News & World Report to rank the most influential men and women in America, Ronald Reagan ranked first; Paul Volcker, second.)
Born in Cape May, N.J., Volcker went to Princeton, to Harvard and to the London School of Economics. From there he went to work for the Fed, for Chase Manhattan, for the Treasury, for Chase Manhattan again, for the Treasury again (Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs) and then spent a year as a senior fellow at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School. In August 1975 he was tapped to run the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The situation he inherited four years later as chairman of the Fed was alarming. ''You had a sense in the summer of '79 that psychologically and otherwise inflation was getting ahead of us. I suppose we're interested in inflation in the end because the economy over a long period of time can't operate very well without a stable currency.
''So more forceful action probably had to be taken, and it was only a couple of months after I was here that we adopted this new operating technique - I'm not sure we understood all the implications. You never do. But we understood some of them, certainly.''
The new technique, which remains in effect, was a major refocusing. Rather than concentrate on managing the level of interest rates in its fight against inflation, as it had done in the past, the Fed announced in October 1979 that it would, from then on, concentrate on controlling the money supply directly, letting interest rates fall - or rise - where they may.
''What we did was not basically a new idea. I'd thought about it some, but I can't say I'd been an advocate of it. It had some problems. What persuaded me was the need to somehow get a grip on the situation, and on psychology, and this seemed to me a way to do it.
''We had taken some tightening moves in August-September that didn't seem to make much of an impact. So I thought, how can we change the approach a little bit here to get people's atTENtion!'' Mr. Volcker's laughter erupts through his words in capital letters.
''One of the things we did anticipate - that it would inject more instability into the market in the short run -was not considered altogether undesirable at that point. A little more uncertainty, we thought, might have favorable effects on psychology and behavior, speculative behavior in particular.''
Gold had nearly doubled in the previous year and its rise was accelerating. In California, people were buying extra houses to capitalize on inflation. From going largely unnoticed a decade earlier, inflation had become so entrenched that middle America was devising schemes to exploit it.
The Fed's refocusing, which 31 Democratic senators are attempting to undo, was initially well received. But interest rates proved even more volatile than the Fed had anticipated and rose higher. The Fed's second big move came in March 1980: the imposition of controls on consumer credit. In hindsight, not such a great idea. ''I think cer-ERtainly, with the benefit of hindsight, we would have done a few things differently during this period!'' booms Volcker. At the time, though, something had to be done. Inflation was raging along at an 18 percent annual rate. ''Despite what we had done up to that point, people had gotten more scared than they were before, I think.
''And you kept getting reports from the market that interest rates may be high, but everybody wants to lend like crazy. Nobody wants to restrain anything - they're all looking to more inflation. So the general idea of maybe having to do something more forceful was not foreign to me.''
''The President wanted to put together a big program, which I was encouraging him to do.'' But what Carter came up with was a plan to limit the growth of consumer credit. ''I did not want to invoke the Credit Control Act. I thought it was very much a two-edged sword. You never know what the results of these sorts of things are going to be. We were talking about some narrow sector of consumer credit, but what specter is that going to raise in everybody's mind?'' Federally mandated credit allocation? Interestrate controls? ''But we finally went along with it. The President wanted to invoke the act, and we would have had a confrontation if we refused to administer it. So we agreed to do something in the consumer-credit area, and we found out that it had a lot bigger psychological repercussions than we or the Administration had assumed.''
Purveyors of consumer credit were told that to the extent they allowed their loans to increase, they would have to pay a small penalty, which they could pass on to their customers or not as they saw fit. Secured loans, for cars and houses, were not included.
''The action that was taken was frankly the mildest we could think of. In economic terms it was a small action. But when the President of the United States announces that we don't want people using their credit cards, and that measures would be taken, the message that came through was: 'Don't use consumer credit!' Including automobile credit and that kind of stuff, which we'd exempted. And you got a very sharp reaction in the economy.''
The economy plunged. ''It looked like a recession, and it went down in the history books as a recession, but I guess in retrospect it was an odd kind of contrived affair. We lifted those controls as soon as it looked reasonable to do so, because we didn't want them on any longer than we had to. It was always in my mind that it would be temporary.''
Imposed March 14, 1980, the controls were partially dismantled 10 weeks later and removed entirely by July 4. But if Chairman Volcker and his six fellow Fed governors knew the controls would be fleeting, the public was less certain.
''The people who were really worried were the retailers - and it became quite clear why. They were worried about the Christmas season, when you get a big seasonal increase in consumer credit.
''Well, I must confess it was a problem we had not thought about, because I know in all my thinking I did not imagine that the thing was still going to be on nine months later during the CHRI-Istmas season! But, from their standpoint, they had to begin planning, and it was a perfectly natural concern.
''Anyhow, the economy had this abrupt fall, and the money supply fell very rapidly with it. It was an artificial reaction precisely to the consumer-credit controls. Consumers suddenly thought they'd better not use their credit cards, or consumer credit at all. But they had bills to pay, and so they drew down their cash balances. So you had this wild decline in the money supply for six weeks or so. Interest rates fell like a stone, too.''
And why not? The demand for credit had been suddenly stifled. But the action backfired. ''In a sense you had the psychological result that everybody says, 'The problem's over with.' The basic problem of inflation was not over with.'' But once the credit restrictions were lifted, says Volcker, ''it seemed as if everything was easy again -business as usual. We lost some psychological ground.''
The money supply began rising again. ''It began bouncing back, which we didn't mind for a month or two because it was just offsetting the decline. What we did not judge, we nor anybody else, was that the economic decline itself was going to be so short-lived.''
The Fed kept expecting growth in the money supply to slow down, but it didn't. ''And part of the reason it didn't,'' says Volcker, ''was that the economy was picking up much faster than people realized. If it hadn't been the focus of so much attention, I don't think it would have made much difference, but everybody had come to look at the money-supply figures as the symbol of policy. And we were in the midst of an election campaign, so everybody could attribute political interpretations to everything that happened. That didn't help any.''
Down from nearly 20 percent in April 1980 to 11 percent by August, the prime hit 21.5 percent in December. ''The net of that long story is that the kind of discontinuity introduced by the credit controls in hindsight was harmful rather than helpful.'' The net of that long story may also be that running the Fed and charting appropriate monetary policy have as much to do with psychology as with finance.
''You do get in that dilemma,'' Volcker acknowledges. ''Sometimes, the technical analysis runs in the same direction as the psychology, so making policy is easy. But sometimes they run in opposite directions. Then they do create a dilemma. And the psychology often runs to extremes. You go back to early '80 - I mean, people were really scared! 'The Federal Reserve isn't restrictive at all; this thing is never going to stop, credit expansion is going to go on forever' - and of course within three weeks the view was all changed, but that was the psychology that existed. And you're tempted to respond to the psychology. Sometimes I think you have to. But on purely technical grounds it can be a mistake.
''Sometimes it means there is no right policy, I think. You know, what seems technically right isn't right if the psychology is running in the other direction and it makes no impact. It can be very hard to deal with in the short run.''
You can do all the sensible technical things, but if you can't persuade the marketplace of your long-term intentions and resolve, you've failed. But how do you persuade the marketplace without killing the economy in the process?
''That's the basic dilemma. You've got so much underlying inflationary momentum, exaggerated at times, but it's clearly there - reality I'm talking about now.'' Wages really have been going up faster than is consistent with price stability. Productivity really has stagnated. We really have suffered from a degree of managerial complacency born of decades of world economic superiority. People really have bet on the future of inflation. ''All this comes along and collides with a restrictive monetary posture, sooner or later, and there is a real collision if there isn't enough money to permit this momentum to continue. There's a kind of psychological collision, too, because behavior doesn't change very readily. And if people don't believe that you're going to carry thrOU-U-gh, it'll change all the more slowly!
''But if it changes too slowly,'' says Volcker quietly, ''then you got an impossible problem.'' To get people to believe the Fed is really going to carry through this time, what would he think - just for example - of Reagan's announcing, now, that when Volcker's term expires next August he will be reappointed for another four years. The chairman snorts in amusement. He relights his cigar, bouncing a smoldering match out of the ashtray onto the table.
''People reach out and try to think of something that's going to symbolize what you're after here,'' he says. ''I think that's the root of the interest in the gold standard. You're saying, in effect, how about a 'Volcker standard.' Or other people would say, write in a monetary rule'' -by which Congress would set the rate, now, at which the money supply would be allowed to grow ever after.
''I wish it were that SI-IMple,'' he laughs, ''but I don't think we're going to win it just by hanging out some dramatic symbolic action, whatever that action is. That's the basic trouble with the gold-standard thing -there are lots of technical troubles, but the trouble with that argument is: Great, we're going on the gold standard, so 30-year bond rates are going to go down to 5 percent because investors know we're on the gold standard. But they know much more than that! We went off the gold standard 10 years ago, and when you're looking at a 30-year bond ... You know, once you've bit the apple, you can't say you haven't left the Garden of Eden.
''I'm not a disbeliever in all symbolism; in fact, the older I get the more importance I think there is in just conveying a message to the public. You've got to keep things simple in order to affect behavior, without getting caught by the simplicity of what you're SAY-AYing, and having the real world jump up and bite you.'' You've also got to take account of political realities. ''I think these criticisms that the Federal Reserve was a great engine of inflation are really unfair,'' Volcker says. ''An institution does what it can within the framework of a big environment.''
Volcker hasn't met with the President since February, but he does meet frequently with Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, and he makes frequent trips to the Hill. The Fed is independent by law, but laws can be changed.
''Well, I suppose it's that concern put in its crudest form, but you don't even have to put it that way. It's not that Congress goes and legislates a different policy, which is the ultimate possibility. Your policy itself is not going to be successful if you haven't got a reasonable degree of understanding around the country of what you're trying to do and a kind of willingness to support it. I'm not saying you have to have a majority vote. You can have a lot of opposition. But I don't think you can sustain a policy whose purpose nobody understands. So you've got to operate under that general constraint, if for no other reason than if they don't understand it, they don't think it's going to last. Which is where you come back to your psychological point - getting people to believe.'' With everyone in ''the big environment'' screaming about interest rates, the effort now is to ease up, insofar as may be justified, without reigniting inflation. That is a two-part effort. First you have to figure out how much easing is justified; then you have to get the financial markets to ''agree.''
One might imagine, for example, that when the stock market takes a frightening plunge, the money supply has in a sense plunged, too. Stockholders feel poorer, can borrow less, spend less freely.
''I wouldn't call it the money supply or even the credit supply, but I agree that it's a factor,'' says Volcker. ''The big engine for this kind of stuff has not been stocks recently, but houses. Everybody began taking out their equity with second mortgages, convinced that that equity was going to increase forever and ever.''
So doesn't the drop in real-estate values give the Fed a legitimate rationale to pump up the money supply, just by way of compensation? ''Yeah, if we just looked at that I think it is accurate. But here's precisely where we get into the problem. Suppose your analysis is exactly right. We could say, 'Look, people are going to spend less money, and they're going to want higher cash balances because the value of their houses has gone down. So we think precisely the right thing to do is to increase the money supply by 7 1/2 percent where previously we had said we were going to increase it by 5 percent.' How do you explain that?
''Hey,'' Volcker goes on, ''we've got that problem right now! It's a more general phenomenon, but it's not unrelated: People want to be more liquid. And part of being more liquid is holding more money in the bank. It's very easy to relate it to fear about the recession, fear about the financial system.
''Now if that phenomenon is going on, I think it's true to say you would not want the money supply to be as low as it otherwise would have been, because in economic terms you're tighter than you intended. But try to quantify that and try to explain it!''
(The more work any given dollar bill can do in a year -the more hands it can pass through - the greater its ''velocity.'' And the fewer of them the economy needs to function. So when velocity increases, the money supply in a sense increases, even though the actual number of dollars in circulation may have remained constant. By moving around faster, they can handle an expanded level of transactions. To conduct monetary policy, therefore, you must not only ''count'' the number of dollars in the money supply, you've got to figure out how fast they're moving.)
It is doubtless a sound economic notion: Dollars frozen in the checking accounts of people too scared to spend or invest them support less economic activity than dollars that move around faster. But can the Fed announce an easing in monetary policy based on such a thing?
Every Friday just past 4 P.M., East Coast time, men and women throughout the nation and much of the world stop what they're doing to await the weekly money-supply figures (much to the annoyance of the Fed, which wishes less attention were paid to the weekly fluctuations). And you expect them to believe that a huge jump is O.K. because of some behavioral ''phenomenon''?
''Try to explain it to somebody who thinks that the perpetual mistake of the Federal Reserve has been being too easy all the time,'' Volcker says. ''All he'll say is, well, this is just another rationale for being too easy. And there's always the danger that he's right. So you've got to be a little cautious about it.
''I suppose we've compromised. We've been restrictive, but not nearly as restrictive as we would have been if we didn't think that this phenomenon was going on.'' Volcker is not one who abhors any deficit (particularly in a recession) or who dreams of paying off the national debt. There may be times, he says - this is not one of them - when it would be appropriate public policy to pay off some of the debt, to make room for more private borrowing. But, he says, ''a substantial national debt is not a problem. In the context of a huge economy, it's supportable. It's a question of the speed at which it grows -that's the risk now.''
Part of the problem is an Administration not entirely of one mind. It demands lower spending to finance tax cuts it insists can't be delayed, but insists, too, on much larger defense expenditures and then tax increases to protect its tax cuts. A larger part of the problem is a Congress that passed the initial tax cuts only after tacking on many billions in extra cuts of its own, and that simply cannot summon the nerve to cut the growth in spending in politically sensitive areas.
''I remain convinced,'' Senate Banking Committee chairman Jake Garn has said, ''that it is the Congress that is primarily to blame for the failure of interest rates to decline as quickly as inflation.''
''There is a great effort by Congress,'' he told Volcker at the committee's semiannual hearing on monetary policy last July 20, ''to pass the buck to you. You are one of the favorite topics of speeches by congressmen and senators of both parties: 'If only we could get that damn Paul Volcker to do something, all this would go away.' There's never much talk about fiscal policy; never much talk about our role in it.
''If we really don't like these budget deficits, why don't we just shut up and do something about it?'' Quite a number of congressmen are incensed at the Fed's intransigence. They are priming the Treasury to borrow half a trillion or so to finance the deficit of the coming three years, and they just don't understand why the average investor, in the face of this, is not willing to accept 4 percent or 6 percent or 8 percent on a long-term bond, the way he always used to.
In June, Senator Edward M. Kennedy walked in near the end of a session at which Volcker was present and began decrying the Fed's independence. ''If you were up here as a member of the Treasury,'' he glowered, ''our relationship would be different.'' Responded Volcker calmly: ''That's probably true, but I believe that it was intentionally designed this way.''
Does Volcker ever feel incredibly frustrated that congressmen and senators, for selfish political reasons, are letting the country go down the tubes?
The chairman's eyes widen at the notion that he would even consider answering a question like that. ''You're leaving on the microphone?'' he asks; then answers only: ''Elections obviously don't make things any easier.''
His view of the budget compromises then sorting their way through Congress is hopeful but realistic: ''If they follow through, it would be a very considerable step in the right direction. But the time has probably passed when you could have had a sharp impact on psychology. It's too late for a bipartisan, 'everybody-go-out-of-the-room-together' sort of thing.''
Instead, you get this sort of thing (from The Wall Street Journal, Aug. 4): ''In a partisan showdown vote, the House refused to limit to 4 percent the annual cost-of-living increase in Civil Service retirees' pay, as called for in the fiscal 1983 budget. The Democratled House, which had balked at placing the unpopular ceiling on Federal pensions in this election year, managed to put Republicans into the uncomfortable position of having to propose the limit without Democratic support if they wanted it passed. The Republicans refused.'' The doomsayers know exactly how this goes. Inflation heats up, so monetary policy tightens. But that becomes painful, so political pressure is brought to bear. Then, rather than follow through, the Fed steps on the gas. That brings on worse inflation, followed by even more painful tightening, followed by hyperinflation, followed by complete collapse. It's not certain how many cycles this takes, or which one we're in, but the doomsayers are convinced that in the midst of the current misery, the public will forget how much they hated inflation. After all, what's really so terrible about a little inflation?
''More and more people will probably be saying that at this point,'' Volcker agrees. But inflation, at this stage, is not the harmless little phenomenon it once was. It goes to the very roots of trust in government and society.
''You know,'' he says, ''I grew up and was educated in the period when advanced thinkers said a little bit of inflation was a good thing. People thought they were a little richer each year, the profits were always a little higher than expected, it's nice to have the price of your house going up - and, the argument ran, all that will lead to a good economy.
''In fact, I think there is some truth to that, but it's got a big catch: There's only some truth to it so long as people are 'surprised,' implicitly or explicitly, by the inflation. Once they begin getting the sense that it's a game, and they're just trying to keep ahead of it but can't, then you've got an entirely different set of circumstances.
''I think that is the watershed we passed in the 70's.'' ''I believe we have a desperate situation on our hands,'' an agitated Senator Donald W. Riegle told Volcker repeatedly at the July 20 hearing.
The situation seems a little less desperate now. But through most of the summer, at least, much of the nation was having a severe - well-founded - anxiety attack.
It is in that context that Volcker is asked: Can we get out of this economic box? He answers in a way that suggests he knows this box very, very well. (A final match bounces out of the ashtray. As an experiment, the interviewer decides to sit pat. Is this man oblivious to the real world as some of his critics charge? Slowly, the chairman leans forward, reaches out a long arm and retrieves the match.)
''Well,'' he says, ''you're asking the question, I guess, how big the box is. The box is certainly tougher, or pieces of the box are stronger, than you would hope. I think we're about to get out of the box, in some sense - but that's a projection.''
(And, as it turned out, not a bad one.) ''I don't expect anything very exuberant - and I wouldn't want anything too exuberant, because sustainability is very important -but you get some recovery going for a while, and at the same time you get interest rates going down, and you get the inflation rate continuing to go down. I think then things begin interacting in a nice way.
''And if you could restrain a recovery and have the inflation rate continue to fall -inflation did fall in the last recovery for a year or so -then you have a quite different setting. Suppose the inflation rate is falling for two or three years and suppose by that time you're back to something that people are willing to live with. Then you've won the game in some sense.
''That's all I'm saying: that some day the good scenario ought to feed upon itself. So the question you're raising, I think, is: How long does the bad scenario feed upon itself before it gets overtaken by the good one? I hope we're pretty close to that point. And I think we are. But of course I can't prove it.'' One night, a few months before he made these rather prescient comments, the chairman was going to dinner with his wife. (Barbara Volcker is a bookkeeper at a New York architectural firm. He usually flies up on weekends to the Manhattan co-op they bought in 1975, ''when everybody thought New York was going to go bust.'' Sometimes she comes to stay in the modest one-bedroom apartment he rents within walking distance of the Fed.) He went out and got in the car, behind the Federal Reserve driver. ''I look over his shoulder'' -Volcker enjoys telling this story - ''and he's reading a book. The name of the book was: 'How to Make Inflation Pay.' I don't know who it was written by, but it was one of those books. Two or three months ago, you know, we'd had a string of good price statistics, and I keep making speeches about how things are going to get better. And there he is reading this book!
''I said, 'Mr. Pena, how can you be reading that book?' He says, 'I was in a bookstore the other day and I saw it marked down from $10.95 to $1.98.' ''
A small sign, but a sign. More recently, at the July 20 hearing, Volcker told Congress: ''The evidence now seems to me strong that the inflation tide has turned in a fundamental way.'' Business borrowing, he believes, is no longer premised on expectations of ever-higher inflation.
The Fed has lowered the discount rate (the rate it charges depository institutions) from 12 percent to 10 percent. And there's been a widely perceived easing in its day-to-day market operations.
Does this mean the Fed is quietly caving in again? Is it the old election-year pump priming, and just in the nick of time? Volcker says no, of course. But does he mean it? Does he really, really mean it?
To give in now, he tells audiences wherever he speaks, when so much headway has been made in the fight against inflation, could only greatly complicate matters over the long run. Too much has been accomplished not to move ahead and complete the job. ''It would strike me as the cruelest blow of all,'' he says, ''to the millions who have felt the pain of the recession directly to suggest, in effect, it was all in vain.''
Listening to him, it's hard to resist the temptation to put at least some of one's money, should one be so lucky as to have some money (the chairman's own net worth, exclusive of his co-op, is listed at $56,000), into long-term bonds.

Abstract: Treasury Secretary [Donald T. Regan], for one, forewent the usual briefing on the forecast, released Friday two weeks later than usual, giving instead a background report on banking deregulation. ''I may be dumb but I'm not stupid,'' he said. ''I have to take care of my own priorities.'' And President Reagan himself, at his news conference, came across far glummer than the review. The review predicts that the economy will begin picking up any day now, expanding at an annual rate of almost 5 percent over the last six months of 1982 and 4.4 percent in 1983. ''The recession appears to have bottomed out,'' said the report, the handwork of the Office of Management and Budget, ''and the economy is beginning to display the early signs of improvement that are characteristic of the turning zone of recovery.'' But the budget office concedes that unemployment will remain in the problem zone; joblessness will likely average 9.1 percent in the last quarter of 1982 and won't drop to 8 percent until near the end of 1984. Other doubters included Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that the economy won't hit its stride ''unless interest rates fall in the very near future.'' He said, the C.B.O.'s forecast of slow going between now and New Year's Day was probably more on the mark. Murray L. Weidenbaum, who resigned last month as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has said he told the President the Administration's projections for recovery were too rosy. That view was supported last week by the Government's index of leading economic indicators. The broad measure of future economic activity stayed flat in June.

Full text: WITH debate over the state of the economy growing as indicators flag, The Week in Review asked Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and Charles L. Schultze, chairman of President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, to reason together on economic policy. Excerpts of last week's discussion with Edward Cowan, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, Caroline Rand Herron, an editor of The Review, and Peter Kilborne, an editor in The Times's Washington bureau, follow.
Question. The President in his press conference Wednesday night gave a new and bleak assessment of where the economy is and how far we've got to go. Terms like 'tough slow work' and 'enormous effort and patience' before an economic recovery are in striking contrast to earlier assessments - and to initial promises. What happened and how bad is it?
Mr. Regan. What the President is indicating is that the recession that started in July of 1981 has gone a lot deeper than most thought. From that low base, trying to come back with the intractable interest rate picture that we have means that it's going to take us a lot longer than might have been presumed before.
Mr. Schultze. I wouldn't disagree with the President's assessment. I would put a somewhat different emphasis on it. The problem is not so much the depth of the recession but current budget and monetary policy. We are most unlikely, unless major changes are made, to have anything but a very sluggish recovery.
Now I would add one footnote. Under any set of policies, we would have been in for some difficult times to wring inflation out. However, the pain is larger and the extent of time over which we are going to have to suffer is greater, because of the policies that we have.
Mr. Regan. A couple of things, for the record. We did inherit a money supply figure that was really rolling. I spoke out at the time about a loose monetary policy. Now, at the same time, the problem we inherited was really serious inflation in double digits. We had to take steps to correct that. We worked with the Fed on this.
We, I think, are penalized by our own success. Instead of inflation coming down gradually, as we had hoped it would, it came down very rapidly. We probably have penalized ourselves somewhere in the neighborhood of $45 billion to $50 billion of tax monies as a result of that disinflation. The other thing we have to contend with - which is unlike any other time that I can recall from my experience in finance - is that interest rates have not come down with inflation.
Mr. Schultze. First, just a minor correction. the double-digit (in the money supply) was only a very short period of time. More importantly, it seems to me, are two or three things at stake here. Throughout the world, economies are going through the pain of disinflation. It does mean slow growth and perhaps occasional recessions.
Secondly, that inevitable pain - not so much today but in the future - will be made greater by (Administration) policies. They took a tax cut - which was needed -and made it far too big. At the same time they added to defense expenditures very substantially.
Now after the Congress has enacted a budget resolution calling for a $170 billion reduction in the deficit by 1985 - if they do it all - if you take the Congressional Budget Office's latest revisions, you (still) get up to something like a $140 billion or $160 billion deficit. The prospect of that amount of deficit, even after herculean efforts by Congress, combined with what I think is too tight a monetary policy on the part of the Fed - the two together are giving us a currently high long-term rate, because the markets anticipate this. Forecasters Differ
Mr. Regan. Mr. Schultze has taken C.B.O. figures which even they don't subscribe to. They say this could happen under this type of scenario. We don't believe that. Our forecast has (growth) this year somewhere around 4.2, 4.4 percent, and next year around 4.1 percent. This is the eighth post-World War II recovery. In all of the previous ones the average has been better than 5.5 percent. So even our own forecasts are showing that the recovery is going to be less than average.
Q. Mr. Secretary, on the tax cut and what you call intractable interest rates: If you had to do the 1981 tax cut all over again, would you do it differently, and if so how?
Mr. Regan. Yes. I would have a 10-10-10 (three-year tax cut of 10 percent a year) and I'd have it passed January 1, 1981 (as the President originally proposed). Assume that we had had that, and assume that we were in the same recession that we were, even good Keynesians would say that that would have been quite a remedy to offset much of that recession.
Mr. Schultze. I think it is probably true. I always thought this Administration would come back to Keynesianism. That's the seventh step in Reaganomics.
However, had you done that you would now have higher interest rates. So, I agree partly, but it wouldn't get you out of your fundamental problems.
Mr. Regan. Well, let's attack them. We haven't - at least I haven't - spoken about monetary policy yet. What we're calling for, so much so that I say this almost like a litany in my sleep, is slow, steady growth in the money supply. We've said consistently if the Fed is at the top end of its range that will be sufficient. The marketplace would be very much stimulated, and the economy could be.
What's happened here, unfortunately, is that the marketplace has learned that we have a very imprecise method of arriving at a growth in the money supply. It's either too much or too little, on and off. This has confused the marketplace. We're getting premiums and interest rates because of that uncertainty. While many say that they're afraid of inflation, what they really are literally afraid of is too much money.
Mr. Schultze. A point about tight money. There's no question very tight money does have a payoff in reducing inflation. Secondly, like all good things there can be too much of it. Tight money is a little bit like fertilizer. Enough will make the grass grow green and too much will kill it. The question is not whether you have easy or tight money, but whether today's high interest rates and the combination of today's high deficits aren't too much for the economy.
Q. Is it time for the Fed to ease up a little bit?
Mr. Regan. I think that the Fed probably has eased. The discount rate (the rate the Fed charges banks) has come down. There is room for it to be accommodative.
Mr. Schultze. It seems to me that only after the November election can you probably get what I at least think is really necessary by way of fiscal policy. There has to be something done on Social Security; there has to be something further done on taxes; something further has to be done in cutting defense.
With that in hand, it seems to me that (Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul) Volcker clearly ought to ease up. Q. Mr. Secretary and Mr. Schultze, your administrations have something in common with all administrations in recent years - a tendency for the budget deficits to be bigger than projected. Right now, some projections are of deficits of $140 billion or more for the next three years. Does that suggest the possibility of tax increases?
Mr. Regan. Not from my point of view. Even with those types of projections, given the natural increase in gross national product, the deficits that we're projecting will be coming down from where they have run as much as 3 1/2 percent of G.N.P. to less than 2 percent of G.N.P.
We think the proper way to have a good and a sustainable recovery is to have tax cuts. We don't agree with the theory that the Federal Government spends money better than does the private sector.
Mr. Schultze. The point of a tax increase would not be for the Federal Government to spend it. You would combine a tax increase with further spending cuts. The question is whether or not the obvious dampening of economic activity you would get through the tax increase can -when matched by easier monetary policy - give you a better more balanced recovery.
Can I go back to one point? I think there is a serious problem that's got nothing to do with Democrats versus Republicans or anything else. There is a tendency for all administrations, particularly when you're going beyond next year's forecast and laying out a path for the budget over the next four to five years, to project at the utter limit of the feasible and then to budget on that basis. And since you're very unlikely to make all your targets, your budget deficits always get a lot worse.
I would have judged this administration, in one area, to be superior to very many others. Last year, more than any administration I know, they proposed a very ambitious program and got virtually all of it. So, whatever our problems, it seems to me it's a little bit because they got what they wanted. Economic Diplomacy
Q. There also seems to be a very ambitious foreign economic policy - the extraordinary antagonism that has arisen in Europe because of the ban on the sale of American oil and gas equipment for the Soviet pipeline, the recent steel decision, the view of the Japanese that the United States is waging economic warfare because of the slew of cases brought against Japanese companies.
Mr. Regan. First of all, we are not trying to engage in any other type of economic foreign policy than we originally had. It's happened by accident that all of them came about at the same time, post-Versailles.
The President carefully enunciated prior to and after Versailles that he would be making the pipeline decision after he returned home. The steel cases were heard long before; the time for their decision was coincidental. This is a finding of fact; this has nothing to do with policy. As the case was decided, certain steel companies in certain countries were dumping products into this country. There is a provision in our law that we must now carry out.
As far as the Japanese were concerned, this is an entirely different thing. A grand jury was called by the United States attorney with evidence supplied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Again, nothing to do with the steel cases, with foreign policy. It was merely a case of American law violated. The case was then settled by the parties. That is not economic warfare.
Now as far as the pipeline is concerned, that very definitely is part of our policy, which is an anti-Soviet policy. They were intransigent in what they did in Afghanistan and, more importantly, what they did in Poland.
Q. There is a perception nevertheless that this is penny-wise, pound-foolish - that foreign manufacturers are now being given license to produce goods that we had a virtual monopoly on.
Mr. Regan. Is this hurting American business? Yes. It is. We don't like that aspect of it. But nevertheless, this is one case where foreign policy considerations overrode domestic economic considerations.
Mr. Schultze. I would agree that the mere fact that we are hurting American business is not sufficient reason to turn it off. (But) I think it's a very ineffective way of doing anything. The Europeans themselves do not believe this hurts their security. They made it clear they were going to go ahead. And finally it is going to be very ineffective in terms of turning anything around in Poland, as far as history will tell you of what trade sanctions do. The Merits of Embargoes
Mr. Regan. That came from an officer of an administration that gave us the grain embargo at the time of Afghanistan and the effects on our farmers. Secondly, if you stand for principles, you just have to stand for them.
Mr. Schultze. With respect to the grain embargo -the first year it more or less worked simply because we had already ended the crop year and there wasn't much grain around. The second year didn't make any sense and I have no quarrel with taking it off.
Q. If the strategy is to change Soviet behavior by punishing the Soviet Union, would an interdiction of grain supplies hurt the Soviet Union more than what we're trying to do on the pipeline?
Mr. Regan. We don't think so, because we think that the pipeline is going to give them hard cash - to wit, between $5 billion and $10 billion per year indefinitely, which is the foreign exchange they need to buy additional high tech as well as food products from the West.
Q. Let's go back to hard cash for Americans. Mr. Schultze wants tax increases. Mr. Regan, you're opposed. What do you think of the flat tax notion?
Mr. Regan. A flat tax is an intriguing prospect. The longer one sits as the Secretary of Treasury, and gets into disputes over closing loopholes and opening them, the more one hopes that someday there could be a flat type of tax.
It's very complicated, though. What do you mean by flat tax? Do you mean that the tax rate should be the same for someone who earns $15,000 or who earns $150,000? It's not a flat tax when you start thinking in terms of graduation or in exemptions.
What are the effects from an economic point of view? I headed a major university's drive, the University of Pennsylvania. We raised $260 million. How much charitable giving could we get if we didn't have deductions for it? Take our home building - an industry that has been key to the prosperity of the United States over the last 25 years. How much of that would be possible without the deductions for interest on mortgages?
Mr. Schultze. You've got to distinguish between the flatness of the tax and having a broad base. I think a flat tax is unfair. A broader base would be a great idea at the right time and it may be the only way to do it.
However, this country is just going through a major change in monetary policy, a major change in financial institutions, supplyside economics with a massive tax cut. We are now going through the throes of a balanced budget debate. The last thing the economy needs at the moment is the kind of shaping up and chaos that would come with a massive change in the tax system again.
Q. How would you like to see the balanced budget debate come out?
Mr. Shultze. It's bad economics. We took a look at this two years ago. A balanced budget in 1975 would have meant 12 percent unemployment. It is bad government. It sets up tremendous incentive to change the structure of government and the budget process in bad ways. Given the ingenuity of budget directors, Congressional committees and the like, there would be all sorts of ways discovered to do things by regulation.
Why fight (in) every recession the problem of cutting elsewhere to let unemployment compensation go up? Mandate that employers pay it out of their own pockets. Medicare: mandate employers to do it. Employment training: mandate employers to do it.
Q. Could the balanced budget amendment that the Reagan Administration supports lead to all those devices?
Mr. Regan. I don't think so. I think that the balanced budget amendment - if it is passed as we now have it -has certain problems. But they are not insuperable. I do think, in my short dealings with the budget process, we will never get to a balanced budget without some type of constitutional amendment. You know, better than 40 states now have balanced budget amendments and yet those states have not fallen flat on their faces.
Q. Don't they have capital budgets, for construction, which the Federal Government does not?
Mr. Regan. That's something that perhaps the Federal Government should have whether it has a balanced budget amendment or not.
Q. A last question. The President said in his news conference, 'I think the recovery that we're talking about with the plan that we put into effect is based on being a more or less permanent one.' Mr. Schultze, your administration tried to repeal the business cycle when it planned for a soft landing instead of a recession.
Mr. Schultze. I don't agree with the President on many things. But I must say I think every administration ought to aim for a policy which gives stability in economic growth, recognizing it cannot finetune for every wheel.
Q. Mr. Secretary, do you think Reaganomics can repeal the business cycle?
Mr. Regan. I don't think the President inferred that. I agree with Charlie, I think you have to aim high. If you don't aim high, what's the sense of being there?
JUDGING from the early critiques, the optimists in green eyeshades who crafted the White House's latest midyear economic review don't have a hit on their hands - even among prominent partisan-minded Administration officials.
Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, for one, forewent the usual briefing on the forecast, released Friday two weeks later than usual, giving instead a background report on banking deregulation. ''I may be dumb but I'm not stupid,'' he said. ''I have to take care of my own priorities.'' And President Reagan himself, at his news conference, came across far glummer than the review.
Last year's edition wasn't a model of dispassionate forecasting either, all but certifying good times and a balanced budget as the quick result of Reaganomics. The 1982 report admits that deficits will be with us for the foreseeable future ($115 billion is forecast for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1). But it asserts that the era of triple-digit red ink should end with the dawn of fiscal 1984, and that by 1985 the Federal Government will come within $73.6 billion of living within its means.
The review predicts that the economy will begin picking up any day now, expanding at an annual rate of almost 5 percent over the last six months of 1982 and 4.4 percent in 1983. ''The recession appears to have bottomed out,'' said the report, the handwork of the Office of Management and Budget, ''and the economy is beginning to display the early signs of improvement that are characteristic of the turning zone of recovery.'' But the budget office concedes that unemployment will remain in the problem zone; joblessness will likely average 9.1 percent in the last quarter of 1982 and won't drop to 8 percent until near the end of 1984.
Earlier in the week, Alice M. Rivlin, head of the Congressional Budget Office, told a Senate committee that the worst of the bad times did indeed appear almost over. But according to her staff's calculations, she said, the recovery will be a slow one. Further, Federal deficits will total closer to $140 billion to $151 billion in fiscal 1983, the C.B.O. reckons - even if Congress sharply reduces nonmilitary spending and raises taxes - and range between $140 billion to $160 billion for each of the next two years.
Other doubters included Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that the economy won't hit its stride ''unless interest rates fall in the very near future.'' He said, the C.B.O.'s forecast of slow going between now and New Year's Day was probably more on the mark. Murray L. Weidenbaum, who resigned last month as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has said he told the President the Administration's projections for recovery were too rosy. That view was supported last week by the Government's index of leading economic indicators. The broad measure of future economic activity stayed flat in June.

Abstract: Conservatives said they took comfort in President [Reagan]'s insistence, in Mr. [Barry Goldwater]'s words, that the United States would ''be the sole judge, along with Taiwan,'' of its pledge to China not to step up arms supplies to Taiwan. For months, the United States has sought through secret negotiations to work out some agreement with Peking but has so far failed. The Chinese had wanted an American guarantee that at some date all American arms deliveries to Taiwan would be stopped, but the Reagan Administration refused. The President pledged to carry out the Taiwan Relations Act, which requires the United States to provide for Taiwan's ''defense needs.'' He quickly coupled that with the pledge not ''to abandon our longtime friends and allies on Taiwan'' and the reassurance that ''we have no secret agreements of any kind or anything that should cause the Government of the people of Taiwan to have any concern about that.''

Full text: President Reagan met today with pro-Taiwan Senators and Congressmen to spell out an American compromise on arms for the Nationalist Government that includes a new arms deal for Taiwan and a pledge to Peking that future American arms deliveries to Taiwan will not exceed current levels, members of Congress disclosed.
Participants said that in a classified briefing, the President and his aides said the Administration would notify Congress within two weeks of a new deal on F-5E fighters for Taiwan. Any further delay would interrupt the production schedule of those planes in Taiwan, and the President was quoted by participants as saying he would not let that happen.
President Reagan also told the group that the State Department had sent Peking a letter asserting that future American arms deliveries to Taiwan would not go beyond current levels, either in quantity or quality, members of Congress disclosed.
Previously, the Administration had been reported to be seeking China's agreement to a joint statement on the Taiwan arms issue. But today, the Congressional group was told that the State Department, apparently unable to obtain Chinese agreement, had stated the American position and Washington hoped China would acquiesce. Some Conservatives Pleased
Some conservatives, including Senator Steven D. Symms, Republican of Idaho, emerged from the 30-minute White House session pleased with the outcome after months of delay and delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations with both China and Taiwan.
Through aides, Senator Barry Goldwater, Republican of Arizona, who had criticized the Administration earlier this week for its apparent willingness to put a ceiling on future arms aid to Taiwan, remarked, ''I could not say I'm upset.''
Conservatives said they took comfort in President Reagan's insistence, in Mr. Goldwater's words, that the United States would ''be the sole judge, along with Taiwan,'' of its pledge to China not to step up arms supplies to Taiwan.
Representative Robert E. Badham, a California Republican, said Administration officials asserted that the formulation of the American position had been left deliberately vague.
In the discussion, he and Senator Goldwater said, Administration officials said this ambiguity left the United States free to determine whether maintaining the arms flow at current levels would allow for changes in the overall mix of arms for Taiwan as well as increases for inflation, technological advances and even improvements in the Chinese arsenal facing Taiwan. Issue of Vagueness
The President was urged by some of the Congressional participants in today's meeting to make the American interpretation of the agreement more concrete and specific to avoid future misunderstandings with Peking. But others argued that vagueness would allow a more favorable interpretation for Taiwan later on.
The Administration informed Congress this year that military aid to Taiwan would run about $97 million, roughly a fifth of what it was before President Carter established full diplomtic relations with China and abrogated the defense treaty with Taiwan.
At today's meeting, President Reagan was joined by Vice President Bush, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and William P. Clark, the President's national security adviser.
The 20 Congressional participants included such well-known pro-Taiwan Republicans as Senators Goldwater, Symms and William L. Armstrong of Colorado, and Representatives Jack F. Kemp of Buffalo, Edward J. Derwinski of Illinois and John H. Rousselot of California.
The group also included ranking Republican members of the Senate and House committees on foreign relations and the armed services, many of them also conservatives who are strong supporters of Taiwan. Fear of Peking's Reaction
White House and State Department spokesmen would not comment on the new arrangements because of the extreme delicacy of the issue for both China and Taiwan. Some Administrtion officials have feared that Peking might pull back from Washington and even downgrade diplomatic ties in protest over the new American arms deal for Taiwan.
President Reagan decided last Jan. 11 to extend the F-5E coproduction arrangements with Taiwan beyond the current program, which runs into 1983. But because of Chinese protests he has repeatedly put off the required legal notification to Congress that would allow the Northrop Corporation to go ahead with the arrangement.
For months, the United States has sought through secret negotiations to work out some agreement with Peking but has so far failed. The Chinese had wanted an American guarantee that at some date all American arms deliveries to Taiwan would be stopped, but the Reagan Administration refused. The President pledged to carry out the Taiwan Relations Act, which requires the United States to provide for Taiwan's ''defense needs.''
Members of Congress said that Mr. Reagan had reasserted that commitment again today, as he did Wednesday night at his news conference. Over national television, the President said that his Administration wanted to continue the American relationship with Peking, begun under President Nixon and expanded under President Carter.
But he quickly coupled that with the pledge not ''to abandon our longtime friends and allies on Taiwan'' and the reassurance that ''we have no secret agreements of any kind or anything that should cause the Government of the people of Taiwan to have any concern about that.''

EUROPE'S TROUBLED ECONOMY

Abstract: ''The next half decade will be difficult,'' said Manfred Lahnstein, West Germany's Finance Minister, in an interview. ''To adapt structures needs time. You need to look beyond five years.'' With 7.2 percent of its work force jobless, Germany today has its highest unemployment rate in 30 years and faces the prospect of 200,000 new entrants into the labor force annually for the next several years. ''The speed with which the jobs crisis has come has left a lot of people and governments running scared,'' said Ivor Richard, a commissioner of the European Economic Community. ''Even when economic activity picks up, you're just going to have to live with levels of unemployment in Europe the likes of which we've never had to live with at all.'' The ''low inflation'' countries, such as West Germany and the Netherlands, mostly began to lower their rates several months ago, a process that has become known as ''decoupling.'' In Germany, rates have been reduced by 2 1/2 percentage points over the last year. But Bonn officials say they would still welcome the flexibility that a decline in the dollar would give them, particularly considering their country's large balance-of-payments surplus.

Full text: European nations, confused about American strategy and divided in their own policies, are facing the prospect of an economic upturn with only modest expectations.
For the principal countries, the recession that was so pervasive just a year ago has receded. In its place has come growth - a discernible expansion but far from the robust growth of the past.
The economies of the six major Common Market nations, for example, are likely to grow 1.2 percent this year after having contracted by one-tenth of 1 percent in 1981, according to a forecast by Data Resources Inc.
But that considerable improvement, which is also expected to be accompanied by slower rates of inflation in most European countries, has only modestly eased the economic discouragement that pervades Europe, a phenomenon that Emile van Lennep, secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, calls ''Europessimism.''
Summit Meeting Approaches
It is against this dark backdrop that leaders of major industrial nations will gather to discuss economic problems at their eighth annual summit conference next weekend at Versailles, France.
For Europe as a whole, unemployment - perhaps the most politically sensitive of all indicators - has reached levels not seen since the 1930's. Moreover, despite the signs of recovery, joblessness is continuing to rise across the Continent as a result of unfavorable demographics and efforts to improve industrial efficiency.
''The next half decade will be difficult,'' said Manfred Lahnstein, West Germany's Finance Minister, in an interview. ''To adapt structures needs time. You need to look beyond five years.'' With 7.2 percent of its work force jobless, Germany today has its highest unemployment rate in 30 years and faces the prospect of 200,000 new entrants into the labor force annually for the next several years.
As they look toward an unencouraging future, European leaders have been left uneasy by Washington's economic policy. In the last year, the Europeans have publicly expressed unhappiness about high United States interest rates, and now they feel a broader concern about the Americans' ability to agree internally on a coherent policy. Budget Struggle Watched
That mood has resulted mainly from the continuing impasse between the Reagan Administration and Congress over the budget for the coming year. Europeans feel that the Administration is preoccupied with domestic economic questions.
''It is more important to us in Europe that the budget dispute should be settled than that it should be settled in any particular way,'' a senior British official said in an interview.
Europe's recession last year primarily came, rather than from any American shock waves, from its efforts to contain the inflation that was caused by the Iranian oil shock of 1979-80 and from the rapid economic growth in most European nations over the preceding few years. Europe also was penalized by the first signs of growing structural problems. These difficulties have forced Europe to accept a slow rate of recovery.
The Europeans remain divided on how to approach their economic problems. At one extreme is Britain, where fiscal austerity has brought the country a large rise in unemployment, sharply higher productivity and a steady decline in inflation. Developments in France
At the other extreme is France, where Francois Mitterrand, its Socialist President, recently completed his first year in office. Pressed by 8 1/2 percent unemployment, Mr. Mitterrand has moved ahead with stimulative policies, which have led to faster growth but which have also raised the threat of higher inflation.
That approach has been sharply criticized in private by Bonn officials. For one thing, West Germany has continued to pursue its traditional conservative economic policies, a more tempered form of austerity than Britain embraced three years ago.
Of greater concern to West Germany and other European countries is the future of the European Monetary System, the alliance of nine currencies. The participating countries have hoped to avoid the instability of sharp fluctuations in currency values on foreignexchange markets.
Concern about French economic policies has already led to sharp drops in the value of the French franc. From 5.5 francs to the dollar just before Mr. Mitterrand's election in 1981, the franc has weakened so that it now costs about 6.1 francs to buy a dollar. That has produced strain in the monetary system, which is meant to keep currencies within a narrow band. Currency Realignments
Last October the French franc and the Italian lira were devalued by 3 percent, while the West German mark was revalued upward by 5 1/2 percent. Now there is conjecture that another realignment will be necessary later this year. Meanwhile, Britain refuses to join the monetary system.
The possibility of some strengthening of the system was raised over the weekend, when France and the United States worked out a preliminary accord on intervening in currency markets to stabilize exchange rates.
Largely because of foreign-exchange difficulties, there are growing signs that France will have to modify its economic policy. Pierre Mauroy, France's Prime Minister, and Jacques Delors, its Finance Minister, have been hinting at a shift toward a more conservative economic policy.
''They recognize that they have made a mistake and they are ready to redress that mistake,'' said Yves Laulan, a prominent French economist. ''I don't think it will come through spectacular and dramatic measures but rather through a series of things that will amount to a shift.''
A problem more common to all European countries is the need for structural adjustment, partly to counter a mounting loss of price competitiveness in international markets. Comparison of Wage Demands
Unlike workers in the United States, who responded to the oil crises of 1973-74 and 1979-80 by accepting wage increases that were less than the rate of inflation, workers in most European countries continued until recently to demand wage increases beyond the rate of inflation. Partly as a result, investment has faltered in many European countries.
Belgium will not be attending the Versailles conference, but that country - with 16.3 percent unemployment - dramatically illustrates the structural problems. Almost since the Industrial Revolution, Belgium has been a major steel producer, but now global demand for steel has weakened. Belgium's efforts to reduce the size of its steel industry have run into protests from irate steel workers.
But such problems are not limited to Belgium. In Britain, the automotive industry has shed 150,000 of the 738,000 jobs that existed three years ago. This has let BL Ltd., for example, produce more cars with fewer workers.
In Italy, Fiat, the major automobile company, and Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, the state-owned energy group, are in the midst of major restructuring projects, both of which include large cuts in the work force. A Crisis in Employment
''The speed with which the jobs crisis has come has left a lot of people and governments running scared,'' said Ivor Richard, a commissioner of the European Economic Community. ''Even when economic activity picks up, you're just going to have to live with levels of unemployment in Europe the likes of which we've never had to live with at all.''
European officials acknowledge that problems such as these have little to do with American policies. At the same time, they believe that Washington's economic approach has made their situation more difficult.
High American interest rates have helped keep the dollar about 6 percent above its level of a year ago, despite a $40 billion United States trade deficit. That, in turn, has forced European countries to keep their interest rates up. Should lower American interest rates lead to a weakening dollar, European countries might then be able to reduce their rates without having their currencies decline, a process that would provide more economic growth and more jobs.
Despite all the talk, however, few European countries would be in a position to change policies radically. Restraint, Not Stimulus
Some of the so-called ''high inflation'' countries, such as France and Belgium, are moving toward restraint, not stimulus. In Italy, for example, the Government has moved to constrain credit and imports, seeking to reduce last year's 18.7 percent price increase to 16 percent in 1982.
''The high inflation countries are going to have to pursue tight policies in any event,'' said Sylvia Ostry, chief economist at the Paris headquarters of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
The ''low inflation'' countries, such as West Germany and the Netherlands, mostly began to lower their rates several months ago, a process that has become known as ''decoupling.'' In Germany, rates have been reduced by 2 1/2 percentage points over the last year. But Bonn officials say they would still welcome the flexibility that a decline in the dollar would give them, particularly considering their country's large balance-of-payments surplus. Comment by Lambsdorff
''We have worked our way to get room for maneuver by a tough antiinflation policy,'' said Otto Lambsdorff, West Germany's Economics Minister, in an interview. ''Our decline in interest rates has stopped for the time being. The Bundesbank has used the room for maneuver.''
The Europeans also have been placated about American interest rates as a result of the sharp drop in the rate of inflation in the United States, apparently resulting from its tight monetary policy. In April, consumer prices in the United States rose at an annual rate of just 3 percent.
European officials have also been soothed by senior American economic officials who have visited Europe recently. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan took pains to soften the Administration line on its refusal to intervene in foreign-exchange markets except during crises. Puzzled by U.S. Methods
Despite such efforts, however, European leaders remain uneasy about the apparent budget standoff in Washington. Many European experts also are perplexed by the close attention paid to weekly money supply statistics and the narrow range to which Federal Reserve officials try to hold monetary growth. The Europeans say this unnecessarily aggravates interest rate fluctuations.
''It's hard for the Europeans to understand why our interest rates jump around,'' said Abraham Katz, the United States representative at the O.E.C.D. in Paris.
At the root of much of the European concern appears to be a desire for the United States to resume growing and lead the world into a new period of economic expansion. Europeans also appear hungry for a demonstration of American commitment to international economic cooperation.
Carlo Tresoldi, a director of the Bank of Italy, said: ''We bankers have an old joke that says: 'To be in an economy with the dollar is like being in a sailboat with an elephant.' The high interest rates have not favored the level of domestic recovery in the U.S. thus far, and this affects the behavior of the elephant. International trade suffers from it.''

Full text: The Pentagon today announced a record $114.5 billion increase in the estimated cost of 44 major present and future weapons programs.
In its quarterly update, the Pentagon projected the total cost of the weapons systems being produced, developed and planned, including warplanes, submarines, missiles and other fighting gear, at $454.8 billion as of Dec. 31.
Obviously sensitive to the political tremors that may result from the report, military officials called a special briefing to explain the figures. They attributed the vast increase to three factors.
New Inflation Estimates
One of the officials, who declined to be identified, said the increase reflected ''a lot of extra capabilities and quantities'' of additional weapons to be produced. It also reflected what the officials called more realistic estimates of future cost inflation. In addition, the new figure includes some purchases as far ahead as 1995 and thus is not strictly comparable with previous projections. Typically, past reports would look eight years ahead.
The largest previous increase in quarterly cost projections for weapons programs was a $47.6 billion rise registered by the Carter Administration at the end of 1980.
The military officials said the updated cost estimates reflected the first complete planning and budgeting cycle under the Reagan Administration. That cycle culminated in the proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and the standard five-year program for weapons development and procurement.
Thus, an official said, the weapons cost increases do not signal increases in the Administration's budget estimate or in its projected deficits. Significantly More Arms
According to the Pentagon announcement, $96.6 billion of the increased cost estimates resulted from significantly increased numbers of weapons; most of the remaining $17.9 billion stemmed from higher inflation projections than were used last year.
The new total of $454.8 billion includes a revived B-1 bomber and two new huge nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Eight programs in particular reflected huge cost increases mostly because of bigger purchases planned by the Reagan administration. They were the following:
- Air Force F-16 fighter planes, more than doubled to a total of $40.9 billion because of the addition of 597 planes, engineering changes and more spare parts.
- Air Force F-15 fighter planes, also more than doubled to a total of $40.5 billion because of an increase of 360 planes, ground support equipment, spare parts and engineering changes.
- Navy F-14 fighter planes, nearly tripled to $35.8 billion with the addition of 336 planes, planned performance improvements and increased support requirements.
- Aegis air defense missile cruiser, up by $5.4 billion to a total of $27.6 billion with the addition of three ships, increased outfitting costs and new inflation estimates.
- Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered attack submarines, up by $9.7 billion to a total of $24.3 billion with the addition of 12 subs, the installation of a new cruise missile launching system and inflation changes.
- Perry-class guided-missile frigates, up by $3.9 billion to a total of $14.2 billion with an increase of nine ships and new inflation estimates.
- Tomahawk cruise missile, increased about fourfold to $12.6 billion principally because of an increase of 3,350 missiles in the purchase plan, engineering improvements and changes in the inflation estimates.
The other increased purchase was in the air-launched cruise missile, whose cost rose by $2 billion to a total of $8 billion, largely because of the addition of 930 more missiles, revised inflation estimates, increased support equipment development and more flight testing.

Abstract: ''This period will continue over the next couple of months and is basically a very aggressive attempt by businesses to eliminate inventories,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of forecasting at Georgia State University. ''Businesses can't afford to have any excess baggage because of high interest rates and they are willing to take losses on inventories to get them out the door.'' Sharpest Cut Since 1975 ''There has been a decline in the underlying inflation rate,'' Mr. [Lawrence G. Chimerine] said. The largest component in the core inflation rate is labor costs, and the economists believe that basic changes have occurred in the last year to start a cycle of downward pressure on these costs. ''Wage increases have moderated, and productivity increased a little bit in l981 and the underlying trend for productivity is better then in the past,'' Mr. Chimerine said. Change in Expectations ''We paid a lot for the lower inflation rate,'' Mr. [Barry Bosworth] said, adding that the country seemed ready to tolerate a higher unemployment rate. ''If you don't have much chance of losing your job then you think we have made a lot of progress, but if you are out of work then you think it is terrible,'' he remarked.

Full text: A broad range of economists predict that February's decline in producer prices - the first drop in six years - will be reflected in consumer prices during the next couple of months as businesses sell off their inventories.
''We might even see'' the Consumer Price Index fall, Lawrence G. Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics, said. A decline in the index, which measures the average of a range of consumer prices, would be the first in more than 16 years.
Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said yesterday that the United States would not face double-digit inflation so long as the Federal Reserve Board maintained its tight-money policy. He added that the recession was nearing an end and predicted that the nation's economy would begin to turn upward in the next three months. (Page D6.)
Flat for Next Two Months
The economists offered a projection in which inflation would remain nearly flat for the next two months, pick up once inventories were sold off, and then hold steady for a couple of years at an annual rate of 6 to 7 percent, about two-thirds the average rate since l979. The longer-term outlook on inflation depends on the country's ability to improve productivity and contain wage increases, the economists said.
At present, consumers are reaping the benefits of an inventory liquidation by paying lower prices for a variety of goods, including gasoline, automobiles and some grocery items.
''This period will continue over the next couple of months and is basically a very aggressive attempt by businesses to eliminate inventories,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of forecasting at Georgia State University. ''Businesses can't afford to have any excess baggage because of high interest rates and they are willing to take losses on inventories to get them out the door.'' Sharpest Cut Since 1975
The March economic survey published by the Morgan Guarnanty Trust Company predicted that total business inventories would probably be reduced at a ''real'' annual rate of ''3 percent or more in the current quarter - the sharpest reduction since the l975 recession.''
Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that the ''dumping of inventory stock'' was likely to produce a quick return to higher prices when the recovery begins. Copper prices, for example, have fallen to 80 cents a pound - well below the average production costs of 90 cents to $1 a pound.
''Once the economy expands these prices will snap right back up,'' he said. However, any rekindling of the ever higher inflation syndrome of the last three years is unlikely, the economists agreed.
''There has been a decline in the underlying inflation rate,'' Mr. Chimerine said. The largest component in the core inflation rate is labor costs, and the economists believe that basic changes have occurred in the last year to start a cycle of downward pressure on these costs. ''Wage increases have moderated, and productivity increased a little bit in l981 and the underlying trend for productivity is better then in the past,'' Mr. Chimerine said. Change in Expectations
High unemployment in basic industries such as steel and autos has had the effect of eliciting wage concessions that economists believe will filter down to other industries and businesses. ''There has been a major change in terms of people's expectations and I excpect wage growth to come down fairly evenly in l983 and l984,'' John B. Taylor, an economist at Princeton University, said.
So far, however, this downward pressure has been only slight, and progress on labor costs is expected to be slow. At present, labor costs still stand at 7.5 percent compared to the 6.8 percent level of the l974-75 recession, Mr. Ratajczak said.
''Right now the wage problem is in the nonunion sector,'' he added. ''A month ago I talked to a senior manager of a company that still had a 10 percent increase in wages budgeted for wage increases, which is far too high given the present rate of inflation.''
Another reason for optimism about inflation is the feeling among economists that the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor the money supply closely.
''We've had a couple of years of much tighter monetary policy and in the long run that has been very important to the outlook on inflation,'' said Richard Zecher, chief economist of Chase Manhattan. Like most of the economists interviewed, Mr. Zecher credited the Federal Reserve's tight control of the money supply as well as the oil surplus for breaking inflation's momentum. Between 5 and 7.5 Percent
The economists' forecasts of core inflation ranged between 5 and 7.5 percent. This compares with underlying inflation of 10 to 11 percent for the last three years. All agreed that, to shave more points off inflation, wage increases would have to continue to slow and productivity must increase.
In addition, several economists pointed out that, while the inflation rate had been brought under control, the price was clearly an 8.8 percent unemployment rate that is expected to remain high.
''We paid a lot for the lower inflation rate,'' Mr. Bosworth said, adding that the country seemed ready to tolerate a higher unemployment rate. ''If you don't have much chance of losing your job then you think we have made a lot of progress, but if you are out of work then you think it is terrible,'' he remarked.
Because of the Federal Reserve's continued diligence in controlling the money supply, the recovery is expected to be slow. George Keller, the chairman of the Standard Oil Company of California, said that, for businesses, the sign that inflation was under control would be lower interest rates. As long as interest rates remain high, he added, it was a signal to business executives that the banks and the Government did not really believe that inflation has been capped.
''I think, realistically, we are going to have to see a little longer period of controlled inflation before the psychology changes,'' he said. ''I will be convinced when someone offers me some long-term money at 10 or 11 percent.'' Competition for Capital Seen
He added that the large deficits projected by the Government had business convinced that, as soon as a recovery begins, inflation will be aggravated by business and the Government competing for a limited amount of capital.
Some of the skitishness of business may be calmed by the Federal Reserve taking ''a little more accommodating stand on the money supply,'' Mr. Zecher of Chase Manhattan said. While the Federal Reserve has set targets for the money supply, he added, the targets have to be appreciated as longer-term goals and that short-term fluctuations would be tolerated.
''The importance of monetary policy is the long-run phenomena, the year-over-year growth in the money supply,'' he emphasized.

Abstract: Interest rates, after more than a decade of rising inflation, contain sizable premiums to compensate lender s for the anticipated loss in value of future repayments of princip al. It is our estimate, however, that such premiums will decline over the course of 1982 and beyond. Such a decline would occur while ''real'' (inflation-adjusted) interest rates remain hi gh as a result of private and public sector credit demands even as private saving flowsincrease. In other words, the market rate of interest is likely to continue on a downward trend, even though sho rt-run fluctuations around the trend can be expected. Enactment of a statute or constitutional amendment requiring the monetary authorities to abide by a rule regarding monetary growth or inflation is another method that has been suggested for dealing with the problem of maintaining long-run price stability. Such a rule would free the Federal Reserve from having to interpret either the ''social welfare function'' of the country or, more practically, the objectives of current elected officials. The rule could be stated either in terms of an ultimate objective for inflation, as it is in some industrial countries, or in terms of a monetary growth target that would be consistent with the maintenance of price-level stability. Financing a budget deficit may draw on private saving and foreign capital inflows that otherwise would be available to the private sector. The Federal Government's demand for funds is insensitive to changes in interest rates - that is, the Treasury will raise the funds that it requires regardless of interest rates. Weak and marginal borrowers may be ''rationed'' out of the market by higher interest rates unless saving flows are adequate.

Full text: President Reagan transmitted his Economic Report to Congress today. The 357-page document, with explanatory tables, comprises the Economic Report of the President, signed by President Reagan, and the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers, signed by Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman, and the other two members, Jerry L. Jordan and William A. Niskanen. The following excerpts are from the council's Annual Report: A Summary of Economic Conditions General economic conditions during 1981 reflected the transitory effects of the necessary changes in Federal economic policies. The major elements of the Administration's economic policy are designed to increase long-term economic growth and to reduce inflation. Uniformly favorable near-term effects were not expected.
The primary redirection of economic policy that affected economic conditions during the year was the reduction in the growth of the money supply relative to the record high rate of growth in late 1980. This monetary restraint reduced inflation and short-term interest rates but also influenced the decline in economic activity in late 1981.
Beginning in late 1979, substantial variability in money growth rates was associated with unusually large swings in interest rates. By the end of 1980, as a result of an unprecedented degree of monetary stimulus, interest rates had risen to new peaks.
The rise gradually produced an ever-widening circle of weakness centering on the most interest-sensitive industries, notably home building and motor vehicles. Falling demand for housing and autos gradually affected an increasing number of other sectors, ranging from forest products to steel and rubber to appliances and home furnishings. The high interest rates also contributed to a squeeze on farm incomes - already under pressure from weaker farm prices - and weakness in industries and services closely tied to the farm sector.
Excessive monetary expansion in the latter half of 1980 helped to drive interest rates to record highs. Rates were kept at those levels for the next six months or so by a variety of factors, including the transitory impact of the shift to monetary restraint. Rates then fell because of the monetary restraint that characterized Federal Reserve policy during most of 1981. The high interest rates were an important factor in precipitating the downturn in the final quarter of 1981, when real output fell at an annual rate of 5.2 percent.
In short, the conflict between continued expectations of rising inflation, based on the history of the last 15 years, and the more recent monetary restraint explains many recent problems. Continued monetary restraint and a reduction of the within-year variability of money growth, however, are necessary both to reduce inflation and provide the basis for sustained economic growth. Prospects for Recovery
The series of tax cuts enacted in 1981 provides the foundation for increased employment, spending, saving and business investment. Inflation and short-term interest rates are now substantially lower than they were at the beginning of 1981. At the time this report was prepared, it appeared that the recession which started in August - as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research - will be over by the second quarter of 1982. This would make it about average in length for a post-World War II downturn. Output and employment are expected to increase slightly in the second quarter and at a brisk pace through the rest of the year, when growth in output is expected to be in excess of a 5 percent annual rate. Inflation is likely to continue to decline and to average about 7 percent for the year, with further reductions in 1983 and beyond.
The outlook for 1983 and subsequent years is based on continuation of the Administration's spending, tax, and regulatory policies, continued monetary restraint, and broader public recognition that the Administration is committed to each of these key elements of its program. Prospective budget deficits are a consequence of the difference in the timing of the spending and tax policy actions, and of the impact on nominal gross national product growth of continued monetary rest raint. Although the prospective deficits are undesirablyhigh, they ar e not expected to jeopardize the economic recovery program.
Concerns have been expressed that the Federal Reserve's targets for money growth are not compatible with the vigorous upturn in economic activity envisioned later in 1982. Any such upturn, it is feared, will lead to a renewed upswing in interest rates and thus choke off recovery. We believe that such fears, while understandable on the basis of recent history and policies, are unjustified in light of current policies and the Administration's determination to carry them through.
Interest rates, after more than a decade of rising inflation, contain sizable premiums to compensate lender s for the anticipated loss in value of future repayments of princip al. It is our estimate, however, that such premiums will decline over the course of 1982 and beyond. Such a decline would occur while ''real'' (inflation-adjusted) interest rates remain hi gh as a result of private and public sector credit demands even as private saving flowsincrease. In other words, the market rate of interest is likely to continue on a downward trend, even though sho rt-run fluctuations around the trend can be expected.
A critical element in this outlook is the assumption that inflationary expectations will, in fact, continue to recede. If they recede at a relatively fast rate, market rates of interest will decline significantly, wage demands will continue to moderate, and the pro-inflationary biases that have developed throughout the economy over the past decade will quickly disappear. Thus, the greater the degree of cooperation between the Administration, the Congress, and the Federal Reserve in continuing to support a consistent, credible anti-inflation policy, as embodied in the Administration's program, the more rapidly will real growth and employment increase. Gold Standard
It is useful to review at this point how gold standards actually performed in the past. The evidence does not suggest that it achieved greater stability in price levels or growth. The gold-standard period was very deflationary on the whole, with the price levels in the United States and the United Kingdom dropping by 44 percent. Second, price-level cycles were deep and protracted.
Again, the evidence is clear that the achievement of low (and often negative) rates of inflation over the long run during previous gold-standard periods came at the cost of a high variability in inflation rates.
In sum, the evidence presented indicates that previous goldstandard periods were characterized by: (1) lower average inflation and money supply growth; (2) greater fluctuations in inflation, money supply growth, and output growth; and (3) higher unemployment rates than in the period 1946 to 1979. Although comparisons across time periods are difficult to make because of the difficulty of controlling for differences, including the effects of wars, droughts, and other shocks to the economy, it is far from clear that gold standards produced better overall results than those produced during the post-World War II period. A Monetary Rule
Enactment of a statute or constitutional amendment requiring the monetary authorities to abide by a rule regarding monetary growth or inflation is another method that has been suggested for dealing with the problem of maintaining long-run price stability. Such a rule would free the Federal Reserve from having to interpret either the ''social welfare function'' of the country or, more practically, the objectives of current elected officials. The rule could be stated either in terms of an ultimate objective for inflation, as it is in some industrial countries, or in terms of a monetary growth target that would be consistent with the maintenance of price-level stability.
A rule fixing a final outcome for inflation would oblige the monetary authorities to maintain monetary conditions consistent with the stability of a broad index of commodity and service prices (for example, the Consumer Price Index).
The advantage of formulating a rule on the final outcome for inflation is that the monetary authorities would be free to devise the best monetary strategy to achieve the mandated outcome. The disadvantage would be the rule's potential inflexibility. Temporary changes in the price level can be caused by a variety of shocks for which the monetary authorities cannot be held accountable. One approach would be to state the final outcome in terms of the average rate of growth of the Consumer Price Index or nominal G.N.P. over a period of several years.
At this time it is not clear which rule, if any, would be optimal and likely to prove preferable over a long period. Hence, the Federal Reserve's current policy of gradually reducing the target growth rate of money over several years is providing a transition to a less inflationary environment. Defense
Real military spending is expected to grow 9 percent annually between 1981 and 1987. Over that period, military spending (including military retirement) will rise from 5.6 percent to 7.8 percent of G.N.P., and from 25 percent to 37 percent of total Federal spending. Although the military's shares of national output and Federal spending will not be as high as in the early 1960's, the buildup will be a sharp reversal of the trend of the last decade. As a result, some concern has been expressed about whether this increase could adversely affect the economy. Any economic effects, however, must be assessed in the context of the overriding need for maintaining the level of defense spending necessary for national security.
T he concern over the economic impact of def ense spending has probably been overstated. The United States e conomy as a whole shouldbe able to accommodate the projected expansio n in defense spending without experiencing an increase in the gener al inflation rate. Monetary and budget policies can offset the i mpact of a large increase in Government spending for national security, although unusual growth in any spending category, mili tary or civilian, makes the goal of overall restraint that much more difficult to achieve. Moreover, the economy currently has ample sla ck to accommodate the beginning of a major expansion in defense wor k.
As the economy emerges from the current recession, however, growth in the defense program will compete with expanding demands in the private sector. As the Administration's economic recovery program begins to take full effect, private demand for producer durables should rise significantly. Expenditures for defense also will be concentrated in the durables sector. Real purchases of defense durables (research and development and procurement of major weapon systems) will grow at an estimated rate of 16 percent annually between 1981 and 1987. This exceeds the 14 percent annual rate of increase that occurred during the three peak years of the Vietnam buildup. The current defense buildup thus will add to pressures on the durable manufacturing sector in these years.
Although it is difficult to predict which industrial markets will be especially affected, three results of the defense buildup can be anticipated. First, the substanial transfer of resources in the durables sector to defense production may increase relative prices in at least some of the affected industries. Both the Department of Defense and private purchasers may have to pay more for goods from these industries. Second. increased demand may produce delays in the delivery of military goods. Delivery timetables that seem realistic today may in some cases become obsolete as producers try to accommodate the defense buildup and vigorous expansion in civilian investment at the same time. A third effect may be some temporary crowding out of private investment. Defense procurement and associated production equipment use many of the same physical resources needed for private investment in civilian producer durables. Some private firms may turn to foreign sources for materials while others may cancel or postpone plans for expansion.
The Department of Defense is attempting to minimize the potentially adverse economic effects of the defense buildup through long-term planning, better management of defense contracts, and the development of more comprehensive cost estimates. This long-term planning will help defense industries increase their capacity in anticipation of new orders. The department's plans to place greater reliance on multiyear contracts will also help defense contractors operate more efficiently, especially by providing incentives to increase capacity and to plan optimal production rates. Why Deficits Matter
The Administration is strongly committed to reducing the projected deficits in the years ahead. A variety of economic reasons, as well as considerations of practical policymaking, make deficits a cause for continuing concern. In particular, the magnitude of the projected deficits demands attention to their current and prospective economic impacts.
Financing a budget deficit may draw on private saving and foreign capital inflows that otherwise would be available to the private sector. The Federal Government's demand for funds is insensitive to changes in interest rates - that is, the Treasury will raise the funds that it requires regardless of interest rates. Weak and marginal borrowers may be ''rationed'' out of the market by higher interest rates unless saving flows are adequate.
The impact of a specific deficit will vary, however, depending on the conditions that lead to it. For example, during a recession - as now exists -the borrowing requirements of business and consumers tend to be relatively small. At such a time a given deficit can be financed with less pressure on interest rates than during a period of growth, when business and consumer demands for credit are increasing. This is why it is important for the Government to reduce the budget deficit in fiscal 1983 and beyond, a period of anticipated rapid economic growth when private investment demands are expected to rise substantially. The impact of a deficit of a given size will also depend on the extent of pri vate saving in the economy. An economy with a higher saving rate c an absorb the demands of public sector borrowing more easily than o ne with lower saving and still accommodate the needs of private borro wers. Much of the Administration's tax program is designed to i ncrease the private saving of the nation. As a consequence, both public and private borrowing will be accommodated more easily.
A higher volume of Federal borrowing to finance deficits makes the task of the Federal Reserve System more difficult when it is following a policy of monetary restraint. However, maintenance of monetary restraint is a key part of the Administration's program and hence the potentially inflationary effects of monetizing the Federal deficit will not be realized. Continued budget deficits may generate unce rtainty about the ability of Government to control spending. An y increases in interest rates which reflect this uncertainty, in turn , will tend to increase further the size of the deficit. In contrast, the maintenance of a long-term policy to reduce the size of budget deficits - the policy of the Administration - will tend to counterb alance the pressures for further increases in Government spending. Prospects for 1982 and 1983
The current recession is expected to end early in 1982, followed by a resumption of growth by midyear. The moderating pattern of price increases which began last year should become more generalized and significant this year. With money growth expected to be moderate, the extent of the deceleration of inflation will become the critical factor in sustaining economic recovery beyond 1982. Apart from the very high rate of expected inflation reflected in current interest rates, the economy is generally free of impediments to expansion.
The key areas of rebound in the economy this year are expected to be consumer goods, housing, autos, and defense. The principal areas that are anticipated to lead the expansion next year are business investment, inventories (including a rising trend of defense work in progress), and a further acceleration in defense deliveries.
The decline in inflation, which has so far been most evident in the Consumer Price Index and in producer prices, will influence trends in wages as 1982 progresses. But the expected 1 to 1 1/2 percentage point slowdown of inflation in product prices will be only slightly less than the slowdown of labor costs. Therefore, the currently narrow margin of corporate profits is likely to recover only modestly during the year.
The unemployment rate is expected to reach the vicinity of 9 percent this spring until growth strengthens in the summer. Thereafter, the rapid pace of expansion should pull the unemployment rate down between one-quarter and one-half of a percentage point a quarter.
The decline in interest rates that began last fall, and improvements in household financial positions due to the reduced consumer debt burden and the first step of the personal tax cut, should lead to increased consumption early this year. The second step of the tax cut and the scheduled step-up in Social Security benefits will raise household disposable income roughly 2 percent this summer.
The recent improvement in early indicators of housing activity presages a rapid recovery that should be apparent by spring and proceed through the year. In 1980 the decline in housing early in the year was quickly reversed and the ensuing recovery was quite rapid. Though the second reversal in the housing industry in as many years has forced some builders out of business, a rapid expansion this year is still possible.
Business fixed investment has been maintained at a reasonably high level during the past year. The stimulus of the Accelerated Cost Recovery System depreciation package should make itself felt when recovery begins. Since businesses have not allowed inventories to build by large amounts, stepped-up sales this spring and summer will translate quite directly into rising output.
The Administration's program of strengthening United States defense capabilities will continue to be reflected in the overall economy as 1982 progresses.

Abstract: Now we come to misery's bottom line: the tens of millions who were impoverished and betrayed by inflation far outnumber the millions who have been slammed up against the wall by unemployment. If the sum of human misery is what we are trying to reduce, the battle against inflation must take priority over the battle against unemployment. The Reagan budget for next year assumes the continuance of that 6 percent inflation rate. That would restore soundness to the American economy and end the betrayal of the thrifty. To achieve this, Reaganomists foresee an unemployment rate of 8 percent (actually they see 9 percent, but they shave a point to show optimism). The unspoken decision is to suffer high unemployment to break inflation's back. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the size of the deficit does not ultimately determine interest rates. After years of negative interest rates (less than the inflation rate), we are now seeing unrealistic interest rates (8 percent over the inflation rate); when it becomes apparent that the President and the Fed will see this recession through, interest rates will settle to the normal 3 to 4 percent over inflation. With inflation under 6 percent, we will resume singledigit interest.

Full text: Hardly anybody has a good word for recession these days, and nobody at all expounds upon the blessings of unemployment. Whatsamatter, the sensitive reader will ask, is this man bonkers? Is he not aware of the widespread human misery reflected in 16 percent out of work in Michigan, the despair of a person who wants to work but is forced to go on the dole, the shattered dreams of entrepreneurs forced into bankruptcy?
Granted. The spasm of iconoclasm that follows does not remove me from the front ranks of the sympathetic, especially since I still h ave a job an d others unfairly bear the brunt of unemployment. But if we are abo ut to have a ring-a-ding recession, let us at least understand it s purpose and savor its benefits.
The greatest danger to our economy - to free enterprise, prosperity, personal freedom and the American Way - was and is inflation. For nearly a decade, unprecedented spurts upward in the cost of living have undermined our system, halted the traditional rise of our standard of living and reduced our ability to compete in the world.
Worse, t he seeming intractability of inflat ion has warped American values, mocking the thrifty and rewarding the profligate. Life on thedouble-digit merry-go-round has turned busine ssmen into crapshooters and workers into squirrels on a treadmill.
Worst of all, chronic inflation wiped out the value of life savings, inflicted cruel surprises on those dependent upon life insurance and turned the expected serenity of retirement into a rat race. Not even the indexation of Social Security could compensate the elderly for the ravages of inflation.
Now we come to misery's bottom line: the tens of millions who were impoverished and betrayed by inflation far outnumber the millions who have been slammed up against the wall by unemployment. If the sum of human misery is what we are trying to reduce, the battle against inflation must take priority over the battle against unemployment.
Hold on: no political figure would be willing to make that statement. On the contrary, politicians of every persuasion insist that no unemployment should be planned and that the trade-off between inflation and unemployment is outdated, unnecessary and brutal. Indeed, supply-side theory held out a painless way to re-duce inflation, baking expanded pies for the free-lunch counter.
The reality is that nobody knows how to slow inflation without inducing recession. Nobody knows how to reduce inflation without stimulating unemployment.
Inviting recession is what the Reagan Administration and the Federal Reserve have been doing, denying it all along. Opposition economists who permitted the growth of inflation are making loud protests at the only method capable of bringing it down, short of subverting economic freedom.
The anti-inflation campaign is working, thanks in large part to the unpleasant fact that a great many workers are not working. The availability of labor holds down costs and the fear of loss of employment improves productivity. Putting this into words may be a no-no, but the result of the recession is an inflation rate currently under 6 percent.
The Reagan budget for next year assumes the continuance of that 6 percent inflation rate. That would restore soundness to the American economy and end the betrayal of the thrifty. To achieve this, Reaganomists foresee an unemployment rate of 8 percent (actually they see 9 percent, but they shave a point to show optimism). The unspoken decision is to suffer high unemployment to break inflation's back.
What's the alternative? Controls and jawboning have proven useless. The liberal answer is to treat unemployment as the greater evil, to reflate and go off to the inflationary races again, condemning retirees to a new round of suffering. It's Hobson's choice - no choice at all.
That is why the recession strategy (don't call it that!) must be maintained. We may vilify Paul Volcker's villainy to our hearts' content, but we must not quit while we are winning.
The recession is doing its job. If ever there were a good time for hard times, now is that time. The real sacrifices being made by the unemployed must not be in vain.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, the size of the deficit does not ultimately determine interest rates. After years of negative interest rates (less than the inflation rate), we are now seeing unrealistic interest rates (8 percent over the inflation rate); when it becomes apparent that the President and the Fed will see this recession through, interest rates will settle to the normal 3 to 4 percent over inflation. With inflation under 6 percent, we will resume singledigit interest.
Then - and not as soon as Reagan budgeteers predict - we shall have an orderly resumption of growth. Then we shall look back on the recession of 1981-1983 as the harsh but necessary corrective.
We can all join the chorus that rails at recession and denounces unemployment, because that is the politic and compassionate thing to do. But in today's primitive state of the economic art, let us remember that there can be no slowing down without a slowdown, no solid recovery without a period of pain.

Abstract: If economists are increasingly bothered by the rising unemployment figures, the public seems less alarmed. ''There used to be an outcry when unemployment rose to 6 percent,'' Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based research organization, observed recently. ''Now with unemployment in the range of 8 1/2 percent, there may be some grumbling, but much less than 10 years ago.'' Economists say several factors explain this . One is the sharper rise in inflation, which led many to conclude that inflation, not unemployment, was the country's most serious economic problem. After extensive analysis, however, economists concede that these are incomplete answers. ''When you get down to it, we are left with a hole in explaining unemployment,'' said Mr. [John F. Cogan] of the Labor Department. But he added, ''That should@n't preclude us from action.'' Mr. Cogan defends the Administration's more general approach. ''If we had kept going the way we did in the 1970's, unemployment would have kept growing,'' he said. ''What we have to do is to put the economy back on its feet. All we can do is institute policies that make the economy a sound one and see if it works. We don't have the answers, but the worst thing we can do is to continue along the same path.''

Full text: Just as the burden of inflation has begun to ease, surging unemployment is posing a mounting threat to the security of many Americans.
The rising unemployment represents not only the declining situation of those who have long been out of the economic mainstream but also the shrinking opportunities for workers in America's basic industries such as automobiles and steel.
Economists say the current jobless rate is in a large part the legacy of Government efforts to fight inflation through restrictive monetary policies and high interest rates.
But even if the economy improves by midyear and unemployment declines again, as most economists expect, they are concerned that joblessness will remain higher than it was before the recession, continuing a decade of upward creep. Miscalculation Conceded
Already the specter of joblessness felt in the weed-grown lots of the South Bronx has spread through the idled industrial plants of Pittsburgh and Detroit and is reaching into the white-collar jobs of the middle class.
The Reagan Administration concedes it miscalculated the depth of the problem, and most economists agree that things will become worse. There is less consensus about what used to be basic economic premises: that high unemployment is a sure remedy for inflation and that reducing unemployment is a simple matter of Government spending.
To date, the unemployment rate has generated remarkably little furor. But that situation is likely to change, particularly in an election year that is likely to see unemployment statistics climb for at least several more months. Jobless Statistics Soar
Already the figures have soared. Unemployment, which was at 7 percent in July, reached 8.9 percent in December and is now threatening to break through the 9 percent postwar record set in May 1975. Some experts have estimated that unemployment hovered around 18 percent throughout much of the 1930's, and reached a high of 25 percent in 1933.
Almost 9.5 million people are now counted as unemployed, meaning they held jobs and were laid off, or they wanted to work and could not find a po sition they would take. For some segments of the population, s uch as adult males and blacks, unemployment is already at its highes t levels since World War II. Blacks, for example, show a17.4 percent unemployment rate, while adult males are at 8 percent.
As bad as those numbers sound, most economists predict that they will get worse. John F. Cogan, Assistant Secretary of Labor for policy evaluation and research, said, ''The general consensus is that unemployment will rise above 9 percent, but that it is unlikely that it will reach 10 percent.'' He predicted that unemployment would continue to increase for the first few months of 1982 and then start falling by May or June when the economy begins to pick up.
Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said recently that he expected unemployment to rise to about 9 percent before the recession is over. The council said in its midyear budget review last July that unemployment for the fourth quarter of 1981 would be 7.7 percent. But because of very high interest rates, the economy turned out to be significantly weaker than the council expected. 'A Long-Term Program'
At a convention of economists in December, Mr. Weidenbaum extolled the virtues of job creation in a strong economy. The Administration's approach to curing unemployment amounts to getting the economy moving again, which it believes will generate jobs. But Mr. Weidenbaum cautioned: ''I do anticipate that several more months of poor economic statistics are in front of us. The Administration has said, and I think accurately, that it is putting together a longterm program.''
Some experts, such as Rudy Oswald, chief economist at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, are more pessimistic.
''I would not be surprised if unemployment tops 10 percent, and it is possible that it will rise as high as 12 percent,'' Mr. Oswald said. ''In every other recession, the Government was willing to really try to turn the economy around with new jobs programs and other projects. I see this Administration trying to immobilize any such action because of the deficit.''
The unemployment figures are already setting off debate. Aside from the hardship that unemployment causes those out of work, it is also viewed by most authorities as a loss for the economy, since those without work constitute a resource going to waste. The controversy begins with the question whether this price is worth paying.
In the view of some economists and policymakers, if the economy is willing to endure a certain level of unemployment, inflation will be subdued. This theory says inflation results from an overheated economy, where too much demand pushes up wages and prices. A recession is said to remove some of this pressure. But with a slower economy, many companies reduce their production schedules and lay people off. The Debate Over Trade-Offs
''We are paying for some reduction in inflation with higher unemployment, even if the Government doesn't say so or admit that to itself,'' said William J. Baumol, past president of the American Economic Association, who is an economics professor at Princeton and New York universities.
Others argue, however, that the idea that high unemployment cures inflation was discredited long ago. For although unemployment has climbed to levels not experienced since the 1930's, inflation has also soared.
''There really is not a basic trade-off between the current inflation rate and unemployment, except over a very long term and with unemployment at very severe levels,'' Mr. Oswald of the A.F.L.- C.I.O. said. ''Most of the inflationary forces of recent years, such as energy, food and interest rates, were not particularly related to changes in employment and unemployment.
''And the cooling off of inflation over the last few months has not been brought about by unemployment either.'' Concern About Upward Creep
What troubles some economists most, however, is not so much the present bulge in unemployment but the longer-term upward creep in the figures. Where unemployment above 3 or 4 percent was considered unacceptable in the early 1960's, now 6 or 7 percent appears to be taken as ''normal.''
Economists are puzzled by what has happened recently: After each recession ends, unemployment falls, but does not drop to its previous low. What labor experts are beginning to conclude is that the causes of unemployment are more complex than they were thought to be a decade or two ago, and that reducing unemployment is more difficult as well.
It was once believed, for example, that simply by stimulating the economy, unemployment co uld easily be reduced to some relatively acceptable le vel. This idea of what the Government could and should do was reflec ted in the ''full employment acts'' Congress has passed since World W ar II.
Of course, even with unemployment creeping upward, the United States economy has proved remarkably fruitful in creating jobs. There are now nearly 107 million people in the civilian labor force, nearly two out of every three people over the age of 16. And at the same time that more people are seeking jobs, more people are also finding them. Roughly 97 million people are employed now, as against 57 million in 1947. Public Has Not Raised Outcry
But if economists are increasingly bothered by the rising unemployment figures, the public seems less alarmed. ''There used to be an outcry when unemployment rose to 6 percent,'' Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based research organization, observed recently. ''Now with unemployment in the range of 8 1/2 percent, there may be some grumbling, but much less than 10 years ago.'' Economists say several factors explain this . One is the sharper rise in inflation, which led many to conclude that inflation, not unemployment, was the country's most serious economic problem.
Another change is what many believe to be the blunting of the hardship of being unemployed. If one worker is laid off, many families have another source of income. Unemployment insurance and other social programs have also lessened the hardship. And changes in the financial system since the Depression have made it less likely that the temporarily unemployed will lose their homes and their possessions.
The unemployment figures, which have risen so sharply in the last couple of months, may not tell the whole story, either. Unemployment grew by 1.5 million from September to December. But as Mr. Cogan at the Department of Labor pointed out, only 1.1 million people of that total actually lost their jobs. The rest were people who were not in the labor force, but who actively looked for work. Employment of women actually grew in that period. 'I Don't Feel Comfortable'
But this is little consolation to economists. ''I regard unemployment as the number one issue in macroeconomics today,'' said Robert Hall, an economist at Stanford University and the Hoover Institute. ''I don't feel comfortable with what we have to say about it, either in terms of giving a good scientific diagnosis of the problem, or in terms of offering policy recommendations.''
For many years, the view of unemployment in the economics profession and in the population at large was colored by the Depression. Economists generally believed that if the economy ran at full capacity, unemployment would be minimal. If demand slackened, unemployment would rise.
There was thus a widespread belief that the high unemployment of the Depression could have been eliminated by Government spending policies that would have given people jobs and stimulated the economy.
''Looking at unemployment from this perspective, it was inconceivable that anyone could oppose the reduction in unemployment,'' Orley C. Ashenfelter, an economics professor at Princeton University, said. ''All the Government had to do was to spend money. But everyone would be paid back by an expanding economy. There was a free lunch; that was the fundamental idea of Keynesian economics.''
Slowly this view of unemployment eroded in the face of two important insights. Even with a healthy economy, and even with Government spending, not all unemployment went away. Furthermore, people began to recognize that there might be costs to holding unemployment down. Running the economy full blast to keep people employed seemed to push up inflation. The Phillips Chart
This apparent trade-off between unemployment and inflation was described graphically by A.W. Phillips of the London School of Economics, who plotted unemployment and rates of increase in wages for Britain from the 1860's to the 1950's. (Wage inflation is often regarded as a stand-in for a country's underlying inflation rate since wages account for two-thirds to three-quarters of the final cost of goods produced.) The Phillips chart showed that periods with high unemployment had relatively low inflation rates, while years with low unemployment had relatively high inflation rates.
The relationship seemed logical, and at first, economists generally accepted it. The only problem was that as years went by and economists tried to relate unemployment and inflation statistics to the Phillips curve, the figures never fitted very well.
Mr. Phillips had concluded, for example, that with an unemployment rate of 5 percent, wages could be expected to stabilize. He a lso saidthat if unemp loyment was held at 2 1/2 percent, the rate of increase in wages woul d be limited to the rate of increase in productivity.
Some economists began to have doubts about the Phillips model as early as the 1960's, and as both unemployment and inflation got significantly worse in the 1970's, the disillusion became widespread. By 1980, for example, wages were rising 10 percent a year, while unemployment had climbed to 7.1 percent.
The United States, along with many other industrial countries, seemed to be suffering both high unemployment and high inflation, instead of being able to choose one over the other.
As it became more difficult, particularly in the 1970's, for economists to cling to the concept of an uncomplicated trade-off between inflation and unemployment, some of them began to describe the theory as simplistic while others dismissed the idea of a tradeoff altogether. A Cure for Forever?
Many economists would probably agree with their colleagu e George Perry of the Brookings Institution, who said: ''I think that a sufficiently huge downturn in the economy wou ld cure inflation, but I'm not sure it would stay cured forever. Wha t we would get for a modest recession is not a great deal.''
What happened to move the United States away from the more predictable world set out by Mr. Phillips? Some economists say now that it never really applied to the American economy. But assuming that it was once an approximate match, economists do not have any simple answers.
As for the upward creep in unemployment, economists offer a host of explanations. Some say it has resulted from the changing composition of the work force: There are now more young people and women working, and both customarily have higher unemployment rates than adult males. Others cite the expansion of the unemployment insurance program, which has been shown to keep people out of work longer.
Yet another factor offered by some is the changing structure of the economy. Most economists dismiss the contention that automation results in any permanent loss of jobs. But Mr. Oswald of the A.F.L.- C.I.O. suggests that recent recessions together with foreign competition have taken such a toll on business. Answers Considered Incomplete
After extensive analysis, however, economists concede that these are incomplete answers. ''When you get down to it, we are left with a hole in explaining unemployment,'' said Mr. Cogan of the Labor Department. But he added, ''That should@n't preclude us from action.''
Indeed, the Reagan Administration policy toward unemployment, as explained by Mr. Cogan, is incorporated in its efforts to better the overall economy. This strategy sidesteps the confusion in the ranks of economists by not relying on any one theory of unemployment. Its drawback is that it is not a strategy that has been tried and found successful. Some labor economists, such as Daniel S. Hamermesh of Michigan State University and the National Bureau of Economic Research, call it a nonpolicy.
But Mr. Cogan defends the Administration's more general approach. ''If we had kept going the way we did in the 1970's, unemployment would have kept growing,'' he said. ''What we have to do is to put the economy back on its feet. All we can do is institute policies that make the economy a sound one and see if it works. We don't have the answers, but the worst thing we can do is to continue along the same path.''

Abstract: In the years ahead, Government policies will no longer be viewed one-dimensionally. Taxes, transfer payments, expenditures, deficits, regulations and the like will be reviewed not only for their immediate effects, but also for their implications for productivity, economic growth and inflation. Painfully, we have rediscovered the old economic lesson: ''There is no such thing as a free lunch.'' We now know that the competitiveness of United States industry is intimately linked to Government policies. Our labor force is becoming more experienced and productive. The 1970's saw millions of young people (the baby-boom generation) join the United States work force. Because of their inexperience, these young people were not very productive. But now they're older - in the 25- to 35-year-old range - and they are becoming increasingly skilled and productive. Indeed, with fewer young people coming into the labor force in the 1980's, business will have an added incentive to substitute capital for routine unskilled operations. That, too, will improve economic performance in the 1980's. There is never certainty about the future. Inflationary forces could gain renewed momentum. But let us recognize also that after the current economic storm, chances are good that the 1980's will enjoy higher productivity growth, more real economic growth, greater per capita spendable income and less inflation than in the 1970's. This improved economic climate will help create an environment in which relations between the Government and the private sector and between business and labor are likely to be better. The economic optimists may prove to be right after all. --------------------------------------------------------------------- William C.

Full text: T HE pessimists are having a field day. Supply-side economics will not be producing its promised miracles any time soon. Instead, the next few months will see more workers losing their jobs, business profits falling and the Federal deficit climbing - to a projected $100 billion this fiscal year and even more in fiscal 1983 and 1984.
Government forecasters were far too optimistic in predicting a quick upturn in economic growth that would bolster tax revenues. They correctly projected early reductions in Treasury revenues as a result of the tax cuts. Tax reductions depress revenues very quickly. Where the forecasters went wrong was in assuming that the package of tax cuts, slowed transfer payment growth, liberalized depreciation rules and eased Federal regulation would soon trigger a surge in economic growth and yield major revenue increases.
That expectation was naive. Changes in productivity trends are not easily brought about. It took years for harmful Federal policies to help drag our nation's annual productivity growth down from 3 to 2 to 1 percent per year, and finally pull it into negative numbers. Given this experience, one should not expect productivity growth to recover very quickly. Similarly, it took years for inflation to heat up to double-digit levels; obviously it will take time to bring it down to an acceptable level. In the face of disappointed expectations thus far, and the prospect of a not very lusty economic performance in 1982, the optimists have lost much of their credibility.
However, more important than what lies ahead over the next year is whether the economic climate will improve as the 1980's unfold. On that score there is reason for optimism. All forecasts and projections are uncertain. But I believe there is at least a betterthan-even chance that the next decade will be better than the last.
One of the most important reasons for optimism is the power of a new idea. For almost half a century - ever since the Great Depression - economic policy has been governed by the Keynesian prescription of maintaining high employment through Government spending and economic intervention, particularly through consumer demand stimulation. That theory may have been appropriate for the Great Depression, but in the inflationary climate of the 1970's, Keynesian policies proved counterproductive.
No wonder disillusionment with the thrust of economic policy grew and surfaced well before Ronald Reagan seized it as an election issue. In the late 1970's, both sides of the political aisle began talking of the need to encourage saving and investment to improve productivity and stimulate growth. The broad agreement on the subject is reflected in a series of unanimous reports of the Joint Economic Committee. And it was given tangible expression by the incorporation of sharpened investment incentives in the Tax Act of 1978.
There is always the chance that sound long-range economic policies will not survive immediate discontent. The political pendulum could swing back toward the discredited policies of the past. But a complete reversion to Keynesian policies and their stagflationary consequences is unlikely.
In the years ahead, Government policies will no longer be viewed one-dimensionally. Taxes, transfer payments, expenditures, deficits, regulations and the like will be reviewed not only for their immediate effects, but also for their implications for productivity, economic growth and inflation. Painfully, we have rediscovered the old economic lesson: ''There is no such thing as a free lunch.'' We now know that the competitiveness of United States industry is intimately linked to Government policies.
I N addition to Government policies more sensitive to economic performance, business managers themselves are becoming more aware of the need to actively pursue productivity growth. More attention is being given to R.& D. as the fountainhead of economic progress. Major scientific and technological advances lie ahead in genetic engineering, microprocessing, communications and robotics. Their movement from the laboratory to practical application holds promise for our economic future. It is encouraging, too, that our capital stock is gradually being replaced by more energy-efficient plants and equipment.
Executives are also looking for better ways to manage workers, our most important national resource. Programs to enhance the quality of work life and to involve workers in decisions affecting their work are beginning to pay off. Companies by the hundreds are setting up worker circles to allow employees at all levels of the company to work together in solving production problems, reducing grievances and improving product quality.
Our labor force is becoming more experienced and productive. The 1970's saw millions of young people (the baby-boom generation) join the United States work force. Because of their inexperience, these young people were not very productive. But now they're older - in the 25- to 35-year-old range - and they are becoming increasingly skilled and productive. Indeed, with fewer young people coming into the labor force in the 1980's, business will have an added incentive to substitute capital for routine unskilled operations. That, too, will improve economic performance in the 1980's.
But what about the $100 billion-plus Federal deficits projected for the next three fiscal years? Won't they upset the apple cart by crowding out private investments to satisfy the voracious Federal financial appetite?
During the current recession, with private financial demands depressed, little crowding out is likely. But there is an urgent need to reduce the Federal deficit, particularly once the recession ends. Chances are good, probably better than 50-50, that the danger of crowding out can be contained.
What is not well-known is that the large deficits projected for fiscal 1983 and 1984 are based on the assumption of a 5 percent rate of inflation. If that were to come about, inflation expectations would decline and interest rates would fall. Does anybody really think interest rates will be 20 percent with only 5 percent inflation?
Moreover, a low rate of inflation would encourage more savings domestically as well as a greater inflow of savings from abroad. If the assumed 5 percent rate of inflation is wrong, then the projected Federal deficit is too large. High incomes, even if inflation-induced, draw in larger tax revenues. At, say, 10 percent inflation, the deficits are likely to be considerably less than now projected.
There is never certainty about the future. Inflationary forces could gain renewed momentum. But let us recognize also that after the current economic storm, chances are good that the 1980's will enjoy higher productivity growth, more real economic growth, greater per capita spendable income and less inflation than in the 1970's. This improved economic climate will help create an environment in which relations between the Government and the private sector and between business and labor are likely to be better. The economic optimists may prove to be right after all. --------------------------------------------------------------------- William C.

Full text: The Consumer Price Index, pushed up by increases in food, transportation, interest rates and medical care costs, surged 1.2 percent in September. At an annual rate, this comes to more than 14 percent.
The September increase in the nation's most widely followed measure of inflation meant that consumer prices have been rising at a double-digit annual rate since July, when the index also jumped 1.2 percent. It rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in August.
In the New York-northeastern New Jersey area, consumer prices rose 1.5 percent last month. (Page 30.) The latest figures, reported by the Labor Department today, continued the sharp turnaround from the good news of the second quarter, when the Consumer Price Index slipped below an annual rate of 8 percent. 10.1% Rate for Year So Far
Despite this reversal, the index for the year through September is running at an annual rate of 10.1 percent, significantly lower than the 12.1 percent posted in the corresponding 1980 period.
Some economists inside and outside the Reagan Administration generally agreed today that the Consumer Price Index numbers for the past three months did not mean that inflation was on the upswing again. They argued that the current recession would help hold the inflation rate down for the rest of the year and in 1982.
''It's not as bad as the numbers look,'' said Robert Ortner, the chief economist for the Commerce Department. ''With a softening economy, it should not be anticipated that this will continue.''
''I think it is somewhat of a glitch,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, of Chase Econometrics in Pennsylvania. ''I think you'll see smaller numbers for the rest of the year but still in the 9 percent range.'' Bond Reaction Feared
Despite the overall slowdown for the year, September's jump in the Consumer Price Index could hurt the Administration's effort to convince the bond market that inflation is moderating enough for interest rates to fall.
''The bond market will probably make it look worse than it is,'' Mr. Ortner said. The rise in the index in September was partly the result of another jump in mortgage interest rates, which rose 2.5 percentage points and are now in the 16-to-17-percent range. If this jump were the main reason for the rise, both in September and for the past three months, the figures might have been dismissed because of the distorting effect of interest and housing costs on the index.
But because the rise resulted from increases across the board, some econo-mists saw it as a reminder of how hard it might be to bring inflation down.
''September's C.P.I. emphasizes that inflation continues to be a serious problem,'' said Murray L. Weidenbaum, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, in a statement.
''It's disappointing,'' said Allen Sinai of Data Resources Inc. of Massachusetts. ''The increase was too broad-based to dismiss out of hand as an aberration. It's in enough categories to raise a red flag of concern. It looks like there is a pause in the downward movement in inflation.''
Consumer food costs, which had been keeping the index down in the spring and early summer, rose 1.2 percent in September and were up at an annual rate of 12.4 percent in the third quarter, following a 2.5 percent decline in the second quarter. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables all contributed to the increase.
Medical care costs continued their surge, rising nine-tenths of 1 percent in September, following rises of 1.3 percent in both July and August. Medical care costs have been rising at high rates for nine months.
Transportation costs jumped 1.2 percent in the month, the largest rise since last February. Half of this increase was in the cost of used cars, which rose 4 percent in September. New-car prices, even after accounting for rebate programs, were up six-tenths of 1 percent for the month.
The rise in school tuition and the cost of books pushed up the index for the month. Tuition fees gained 9.8 percent. Entertainment costs rose eight-tenth of 1 percent, led by a 2.8 percent jump in prices for magazines, periodicals and books.
Although interest rates and the Consumer Price Index's housing index -which treats housing costs as if purchases were made every month - continue to distort the index, an alternative experimental measure used by the Labor Department shows the impact of other factors on the index.
Using this experimental measure, which tries to treat housing costs as if they were equivalent to rent, the Consumer Price Index for September was up eight-tenths of 1 percent, lower than the official figure but still near double-digit rates for the year.
The economists who argued that the index would not rise as sharply toward the end of the year said they expected food prices to moderate because of the small food price increases reflected at the wholesale and farmer level. They also said declining interest rates should help bring the index down.
Charles Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter Administration, agreed with other economists that the Consumer Price Index numbers for the last three months are overstating the rate of inflation.
''You shouldn't take the spring numbers as an indication of how low inflation is and, likewise, you shouldn't take higher numbers as an indication of what inflation is now,'' he said. ''The number is somewhere in between.''
Mr. Schultze and Mr. Sinai also agreed that it was not surprising that while the economy was going into a recession, the rate of inflation should pop up. ''Retail prices lag the downturn in the economy,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''There has to be significant downward pressure on wages before prices start coming down.''

Abstract: If the next recession strikes anytime soon, it will strike before inflation has been completely conquered. Unless the recession is short, a tug-of-war will develop between those policy advisers who favor continuing the fight on inflation at all costs, and those who want to stimulate a faster recovery by stimulating demand, even at the cost of a possible setback in the campaign against inflation. E VEN that would be opposed by a contingent of conservative economists of considerable stature who would quite literally welcome a severe recession. These people will counsel against any action to shorten the downturn or strengthen the recovery. They will advocate a do-nothing policy because they believe that suffering through a long period of high unemployment is the only way for the country to get free of the inflationary syndrome of the last 15 years. They would argue that the first two or three years of the President's term are an ideal time to put the economy through the wringer, setting the stage for the pre-election period as a happy era of recovery with price stability. Opposing them would be those who rate the human and economic losses caused by persistently high unemployment and low or negative profits as worse than the losses we might suffer if we relax the fight to get rid of inflation. Also opposing a do-nothing policy would be those who would worry that a really severe recession might develop if a mild one were not contained and those worried about political fallout.

Full text: W ITH the possibility of a recession seemingly on an increase, the President and his economic advisers need contingency plans. They may be faced with a situation in which nothing is growing in the economy except the deficit and the unemployment rate.
Recession is not, according to the main line forecasters, the most likely course for the economy in the near term. But even if recession is unlikely, serious thinking is needed now about what the best way would be for the monetary and fiscal authorities to respond to it, should it come.
The nature and size of the tax cut passed this year make a response to recession on the part of the Administration particularly problematic. Thus, it would be well to have some advance discussion of whether and when and how demand-side stimulus might be applied.
In the past, there was considerable agreement that appropriate responses to persistent recession included Federal tax cuts, rises in Federal spending, monetary policy allowing for very low interest rates, or some combination of those three. These remedies were believed to work on the demand side of the economy. At such times, it was obvious to almost everybody that demand was deficient, and could use some bolstering.
But those times are gone because the inflation problem persists. Inflation is widely interpreted as excessive demand somewhere in the economy. Even double-digit unemployment rates will no longer be universally accepted as a signal of deficient demand.
If the next recession strikes anytime soon, it will strike before inflation has been completely conquered. Unless the recession is short, a tug-of-war will develop between those policy advisers who favor continuing the fight on inflation at all costs, and those who want to stimulate a faster recovery by stimulating demand, even at the cost of a possible setback in the campaign against inflation.
A recession would, of course, increase the Federal deficit far beyond the present prospect of a deficit that could range from $40 billion to $65 billion. There would be a huge outflow of funds to finance unemployment insurance. The Social Security Trust Fund would have to pay for a great many early retirees, and the tax revenues that feed the Social Security funds would shrink as payrolls shrank. As private demand for credit ebbed, lower interest rates would reduce Treasury outflows to some degree, but this would probably not offset the tax and benefit effect completely.
One way to respond to the prospect of an increased deficit that recession would bring would be to try to cut government spending even further. The Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, seems to favor this type of response. The immediate effect would be to cut the demand for goods and services and make the recession deeper than it otherwise would be and the recovery slower.
It is hard to believe that the Administration's stomach will be strong enough for that severe and risky a policy, and David A. Stockman, the budget director, has signaled that he would not press in such a direction.
The practical choice will be between passively allowing the deficit to balloon or going even further and trying to apply a positive stimulus. If stimulus does seem the right course, the Administration is in something of a box.
Fiscal stimulus in the standard form of tax cuts for lower- and middle-income groups would seem to be precluded by the previously legislated tax cuts for business and upper-income groups. Yet tax cuts targeted toward the rich may turn out to provide only mild stimulus to consumer demand and, in a recession, even milder stimulus to the demand for fixed capital.
It is hard to see the Administration espousing new employmentgenerating spending programs. The only other option for the Administration would be to beseech the Fed to relax tight money so as to allow for a turnaround and to keep it relaxed so as to avoid aborting the subsequent recovery.
E VEN that would be opposed by a contingent of conservative economists of considerable stature who would quite literally welcome a severe recession. These people will counsel against any action to shorten the downturn or strengthen the recovery. They will advocate a do-nothing policy because they believe that suffering through a long period of high unemployment is the only way for the country to get free of the inflationary syndrome of the last 15 years. They would argue that the first two or three years of the President's term are an ideal time to put the economy through the wringer, setting the stage for the pre-election period as a happy era of recovery with price stability.
Opposing them would be those who rate the human and economic losses caused by persistently high unemployment and low or negative profits as worse than the losses we might suffer if we relax the fight to get rid of inflation. Also opposing a do-nothing policy would be those who would worry that a really severe recession might develop if a mild one were not contained and those worried about political fallout.
One piece of recent history that is pertinent to this issue is the resilience the economy displayed last year. There was a severe drop, but interest rates eased and the drop was short-lived. If the economy turned down again, that history of resilience would be brought forward as evidence that no stimulus was needed, because the economy could take care of itself. Stimulus would, in this view, only have the effect of making the recovery too energetic for purposes of the war on inflation.
However, the unemployment rate is already high by historical standards and it traditionally rises much faster than it falls. It has not yet recovered from the downturn in activity in 1980. Even a brief downturn in business activity starting now would guarantee a long period of unemployment rates above 8 percent, in the absence of demand-side stimulus.
It is not easy to be President in such times. Mr. Reagan might end up in the history books as the valiant slayer of the dragon of inflation, as a Margaret Thatcher look-alike, or even worse, as another Republican President who tolerated severe unemployment without action to fight it. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Barbara Bergmann is a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.

Abstract: Earlier, Secretary [Donald T. Regan] had muzzled an inside critic of the Fed, Under Secretary of the Treasury Beryl Sprinkel, the Administration's top monetarist. But that was when Mr. Sprinkel had been publicly scolding the Fed for not being tight enough. Is Mr. Regan, with the backing of the Presi dent's chief economic adviser and presumably the President himself, now scolding the Fed for being too tight? Or are Mr. Regan and Mr. [Murray L. Weidenbaum] really running interference for the Fed, trying to s mooth down the financialmarkets lest they make it impossible for the Fed to get out of a box and get the Administration out of a jam? It was not just the untrained observer who saw an effort by the Administration to push the Fed toward easier money. The professional monetarists (some of whom are within the Administration's own bosom) are starting to pounce. Allan T. Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie-Mellon University and a leader of the monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee, said there was ''fear'' that the Administration would put pressure on the Fed to loosen up, contending that ''a little inflation won't hurt now.'' In fact, Mr. Meltzer said, this pressure by the Administration had already begun.

Full text: THE Secretary of the Treasury, Donald T. Regan, and the chairman of the Council of Ecomomic Advisers, Murray L. Weidenbaum, have both begun to suggest in their public orations that the Fed might make the money supply grow a bit faster, even if Wall Street takes fright.
Mr. Regan, as a former chairman of Merrill Lynch, clearly feels that he possesses the hard-earned right to show proper disrespect for the wisdom of Wall Street. He is complaining that the Street is so nervous it turns all news into bad news. If the money supply increased, the Street grew sick with fear over inflation; if the money supply fell, it trembled over a coming money crunch.
Mr. Weidenbaum was specific on what the Administration would like the Fed to do. A staunch champion of the independence of the Fed, Mr. Weidenbaum nevertheless told the Fed, in his address to the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, that it really ought to step up the annual rate of growth of M-1B, the most closely watched measure of the money supply, to the lower half of its planned range for this year. That range was set at 3 1/2 to 6 percent.
M-1B has been below its band, although some other measures of the money supply, such as M-2, have been above theirs. No doubt Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Fed, would like to have all the money supply measures in their proper band waves, but the central bank seems not to have the remarkable skill of its outside critics in controlling the various measures of the money supply.
Earlier, Secretary Regan had muzzled an inside critic of the Fed, Under Secretary of the Treasury Beryl Sprinkel, the Administration's top monetarist. But that was when Mr. Sprinkel had been publicly scolding the Fed for not being tight enough. Is Mr. Regan, with the backing of the Presi dent's chief economic adviser and presumably the President himself, now scolding the Fed for being too tight? Or are Mr. Regan and Mr. Weidenbaum really running interference for the Fed, trying to s mooth down the financialmarkets lest they make it impossible for the Fed to get out of a box and get the Administration out of a jam?
Mr. Weidenbaum said that a resumption of growth to within the lower half of the range, that is, 3 1/2 to 4 3/4 percent, ''should not be viewed as alarming, even though individual month-to-month increases may appear at first blush to be excessive to the untrained observer.''
It was not just the untrained observer who saw an effort by the Administration to push the Fed toward easier money. The professional monetarists (some of whom are within the Administration's own bosom) are starting to pounce. Allan T. Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie-Mellon University and a leader of the monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee, said there was ''fear'' that the Administration would put pressure on the Fed to loosen up, contending that ''a little inflation won't hurt now.'' In fact, Mr. Meltzer said, this pressure by the Administration had already begun.
The pure monetarists want the Administration to hang tough, but the President and the pragamatists around him are not enthusiastic about a policy that is threatening them with serious losses in the 1982 Congressional elections - and threatening the economy with a steeper slump.
The worry of the pragmatists is that the Administration is caught, as its critics charge, between a fiscal policy that is too loose and a monetary policy that is too tight. The consequence has been the high interest rates that are not only depressing Wall Street but scaring the endangered thrift institutions, choking off housing, slowing the growth of the economy more than the Administration wants and threatening to produce greater imbalance in the budget for the fiscal year 1982 than the $42.5 billion deficit the President had forecast. It begins t o look impossible for the President to make that goal. His Secretary of Commerce, Malcolm Baldrige, has said that $50 billion would not be so bad. Even that goal will be impossible if thePresident sti cks to his two ''sacrosancts'' - the defense budget and the tax cuts.
The $2 billion defense budget cut for the fiscal year 1982 that was announced by the White House has been dismissed by most Wall Street analysts as minuscule. And Mr. Weidenbaum reacted with horror in his speech to the savings bankers to the suggestion of raising taxes again.
But unless a way is found to narrow the budget deficit - and economists outside the Administration are putting it at $60 billion to $80 billion in the fiscal year 1982 - the Government will increase its demands on the credit markets and interest rates would likely stay high.
That would create a vicious cycle for Mr. Reagan. High interest rates aggravate the budget deficit in two ways - directly by adding greatly to the public debt, and indirectly by slowing the economy, reducing incomes, and hence causing a shortfall of tax revenues.
The effort of Mr. Regan and Mr. Weidenbaum to encourage a modest easing of monetary restraints by the Fed in order to bring down interest rates cannot do much in the absence of progress on the budget - cuts in defense spending, nondefense spending or a giveback of some of the tax reduction.
The Administration wants the options limited to one - further cuts in social spending. But Congress seems about to mutiny against this conception. That holds not only for liberal Democrats but even for some conservative Republicans like Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.

Abstract: All four are economists of the monetarist school, who argue that statistical a nalysis shows no correlation between deficits and high interest rate s or between deficits and inflation. Private saving and investing mak e room for Federal deficits with little change in interest rate s or inflation, they say. ''The Wall Street analysts like Henry Ka ufman are mistakenly worried about the deficit,'' said adissenter who asked to remain anonymous. President [Ronald Reagan], who last week said he was ''upset'' that his program has declining support on Wall Street, evidently shares that view, partly on the advice of Secretary [Donald T. Regan], who came to Washington after a long career in Wall Street. What, then, is causing the present high rates of interest? ''It's difficult to weave out an explanation,'' says Mr. [Norman B. Ture]. As for inflation, the monetarists assert that it is caused not by deficits as such but by excessive expansion of the money supply (sometimes called ''monetization'' of the deficit) by the Federal Reserve system. The monetarists argue that a steady upward trend of prices and wages can occur only if the central bank is creating too much money. What may be bothering the money markets, say the dissenters - and here there is some agreement between them and the mainstream view - is a fear, as Mr. Ture put it, that ''the Fed will lose its courage,'' and that under the threat or fact of recession - possibly with prompting by a politically ap prehensive White House - it will start pumping out credit to cure the recessio n instead of ''staying the course'' of wringing out inflation.

Full text: For the second time in 18 months, sinking bond and stock markets have forced a President to order politically disruptive spending cuts in hopes of pulling the Federal budget into the black.
In 1980, Jimmy Carter tore up his 1981 budget just weeks after sending it to Congress. Now, Ronald Reagan is ordering his Cabinet to prepare still more nonmilitary - and for the first time, some military - spending cuts for 1982.
What is startling - to the public, Congress and even the White House - is that the Reagan move comes on the heels of stunning victories on the first round of budget retrenchment and the enactment of his tax bill. That completed the adoption of the Reagan fiscal policy. It also directed attention to the unlikelihood, as critics have contended for a year, that big increases in military spending and deep cuts in taxes could result nevertheless in the promised balanced budget in 1984.
Mr. Reagan is experiencing what his predecessors of both parties suffered through: The apparent tendency of the Federal budget to run toward larger deficits than the President planned and the subsequent reaction of the financial community.
Since midsummer, bond prices and stock prices have plummeted and interest rates have climbed to record or near-record highs. But while virtually all Administration economists believe that Mr. Reagan can't go wrong by insisting on still sharper contractions in the scope of Government to convince the markets that there is a will to end deficit financing, there is disagreement about whether it is the budget deficit that is troubling Wall Street.
The standard view is that it is. It starts with the basic fact that deficit spending is financed by borrowing. As Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, explained to the House Budget Committee last week, any increase in borrowing tends to push up interest rates, which are the price the borrower pays to the lender for temporary hire of the money. And since Uncle Sam is not just another borrower but the colossus that dwarfs others in its need for money, when Federal fiscal specialists in Wall Street predict that the deficit will be larger than advertised, that is a signal for interest rates to rise.
This essentially conventional view of the markets' malaise is held by David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and by President Reagan.
The Dissenters at Treasury
At the Treasury, there is a dissenting view -and irritation with Mr. Stockman and his chief economist, Lawrence A. Kudlow. Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan is understood to share the Stockman view. But some of his lieutenants do not, notably undersecretaries Norman B. Ture and Beryl W. Sprinkel, Assistant Secretary Paul Craig Roberts and his deputy, Stephen Entin.
All four are economists of the monetarist school, who argue that statistical a nalysis shows no correlation between deficits and high interest rate s or between deficits and inflation. Private saving and investing mak e room for Federal deficits with little change in interest rate s or inflation, they say. ''The Wall Street analysts like Henry Ka ufman are mistakenly worried about the deficit,'' said adissenter who asked to remain anonymous.
President Reagan, who last week said he was ''upset'' that his program has declining support on Wall Street, evidently shares that view, partly on the advice of Secretary Regan, who came to Washington after a long career in Wall Street. What, then, is causing the present high rates of interest? ''It's difficult to weave out an explanation,'' says Mr. Ture. As for inflation, the monetarists assert that it is caused not by deficits as such but by excessive expansion of the money supply (sometimes called ''monetization'' of the deficit) by the Federal Reserve system. The monetarists argue that a steady upward trend of prices and wages can occur only if the central bank is creating too much money.
What may be bothering the money markets, say the dissenters - and here there is some agreement between them and the mainstream view - is a fear, as Mr. Ture put it, that ''the Fed will lose its courage,'' and that under the threat or fact of recession - possibly with prompting by a politically ap prehensive White House - it will start pumping out credit to cure the recessio n instead of ''staying the course'' of wringing out inflation.
The monetarists are also economists of the supply-side school, who passionately urged upon candidate and President Reagan a commitment to three years of tax relief, arguing that lower tax rates were essential to revitalization of the private sector.
As a result, they have played down the economic significance of budget deficits. Indeed, the original sponsor of a three-year taxcut bill, Representative Jack F. Kemp, Republican of upstate New York, has been widely quoted on Capitol Hill as having said ''Republicans no longer worship at the shrine of a balanced budget,'' a heretical statement by traditional norms.
Two decades ago, budget deficits were also the subject of intense political dispute. Republicans condemned them - President Dwight D. Eisenhower said they would be a burden on future generations - while liberal Democrats argued that in times of economic slack, deficit spending could put idle workers and machines to work.
Some Democrats may still hold that Keynesian view. But it is not an argument that is heard in Congress any more. In opposing the Reagan tax cut, the Democrats tried to show they were the champions of a balanced budget.
With Mrs. Rivlin cautioning Congress that the 1982 deficit may exceed the President's $42.5 billion July estimate by $20 billion, each party is jockeying for position so that in October 1982, on the eve of the Congressional elections, it can blame the other for still another splash of Federal red ink.

SHOULD WE (AND COULD WE) RETURN TO THE GOLD STANDARD

Abstract: WASHINGTON KEYNES called it the ''barbarous relic.'' Lenin said it was fit only to adorn the latrines of the world. Ten years ago President Nixon, in effect, tore the world's currencies loose from it by pulling the dollar away from a gold peg. Still, gold has lost neither its romantic allure nor its practical attraction. I would foresee simply a sequence of events that follow from the kind of mechanism you've set in place. We're standing ready to sell gold at (a certain price) and we'll buy it at (that price). If there is a strong, private world demand for gold we'd lose gold. That will contract our money supply, work against inflation. But it might work much more strongly than we would want, and so we might then get very large unemployment and recession. We've all learned that we don't cut off our nose to spoil our face. If something is good for the United States, namely a monetary standard, a dollar and a price level that's stable, we don't worry too much about other countries who may get a minor benefit. Indeed, I would argue that South Africa and the Soviet Union have a stake in inflation, because they get a high price for gold when the United States inflates.

Full text: WASHINGTON KEYNES called it the ''barbarous relic.'' Lenin said it was fit only to adorn the latrines of the world. Ten years ago President Nixon, in effect, tore the world's currencies loose from it by pulling the dollar away from a gold peg. Still, gold has lost neither its romantic allure nor its practical attraction.
President Reagan recently appointed a commission of 17 experts, mostly Government officials, to review the issue again. Its specific task is to determine whether the metal should once more play a dominant role in the domestic and international monetary system.
The Week in Review asked two members of that commission, Henry C. Wallich and Lewis E. Lehrman to talk about the gold standard. Mr. Wallich, a former economic professor at Yale, has been a governor of the Federal Reserve Board since March 1974. Mr. Lehrman, chairman of the executive committee of the Rite Aid Corporation, a discount drug chain, was one of the inner core of supply-siders in the Reagan transition team.Excerpts of their separate interviews with Clyde H. Farnsworth, a reporter in The New York Times's Washington bureau, follow.
Question. Advocates say that returning to a gold standard would cure inflation and high interest rates without recession. Is there justice to the argument?
Answer. That was the si tuation in the dim past - the 19th century, then in a mod ified way after World War II. But to get from our present situa tion to that blessed condition will take much more than some mechanic al decision to implement a certain standard.
The transition to stability would be just as difficult as it would be without the gold standard. You have high inflation, you have expectations, you have wage contracts, you have interest rates that were high and built into the system, and to get away from all that will just require substantial adjustments no matter how you do it.
If you got back to stable conditions it would be more feasible to have a gold standard. But I still am very doubtful that a gold standard would allow us to maintain that stability.
Q. Some have argued that moving to the gold standard immediately would reduce the inflation rate.
A. Do you think that a wage contract to pay a 12 percent increase for three years running would automatically change? Do you think that a Treasury bond issued for 30 years at 13 percent would automatically change?
I would foresee simply a sequence of events that follow from the kind of mechanism you've set in place. We're standing ready to sell gold at (a certain price) and we'll buy it at (that price). If there is a strong, private world demand for gold we'd lose gold. That will contract our money supply, work against inflation. But it might work much more strongly than we would want, and so we might then get very large unemployment and recession.
Alternatively, that price might turn out to have been too high. Then other countries or private holders will unload the gold they have. Then we would have to buy all that gold. We would issue money against it. We would get a big inflation.
Q. What about the argument that the gold standard is the natural regulator of monetary growth that the monetarists seek and fail to find in the Federal Reserve?
A. I doubt that very much. Those who tell me we're going to slow down the growth of the money supply by half a percent a year as the Fed is doing - that says something to me about the rate of inflation t hat you can expect over time. It will go down. Eventually, hopefully, it'll go to zero.
But if you tell me that we're going to issue money or extinguish money depending on whether gold flows in or out, then I can't predict anything about inflation except that it will be totally unpredictable.
Q. How about the point that gold is a unique and stable standard of economic value?
A. We all know that you can say that gold is better than some other things. But it's certainly not a stable standard in the short run.You can show that because the supply of it increases only slowly, if you use that as money or as the base for money, prices can't vary very much.
But they can vary quite substantially nevertheless. We've seen that during the 19th century. You saw over the century prices didn't change much, but you had big waves of rising and falling prices.
Q. There is the argument that the return to the gold standard would be a major stimulus to savings?
A. It might be some stimulus to saving. However, today you can buy gold all you want to, and historically its price has increased. So if you fix the price of gold you certainly wouldn't want to increase your saving in order to buy gold and get no interest on it. So the only benefit to saving that I would see is that people would have more confidence in the currency and for that reason might save more. But I don't believe that in the days of the gold standard saving was higher than it is today.
Q. What do you think the role of gold today should be in the international system?
A. To serve as a kind of last-ditch sort of liquidity. Countries that lack foreign exchange or are not sure that they can also earn or borrow foreign exchange, if they have a gold supply would be able to borrow against it. Several countries did that during the 70's. Some countries sold off some of their gold, including the United States.
Q. Do you see some kind of standard, such as the special drawing right (S.D.R) of the International Monetary Fund or a combination of that with the dollar as becoming the major international standard, or do you see some kind of future role for gold in the standard?
A. Well, to me the evolution towards S.D.R.-systems, that is, a basket of currencies, seems plausible. Q. Do you think there is enough public confidence behind the S.D.R. to warrant its move to the forefront?
A. That really depends on the confidence that exists in the five currencies th at constitute the S.D.R. You know the S.D.R. is simply a composite o f dollars, and Deutches-mark and yen and francs and pounds. If th ere's confidence in those, then the average of them presumably wi ll be stabler than any one of them. That is the philosophy of the S.D.R.
Question. Is the gold standard, as some advocates argue, a cure-all or is it a patent medicine?
Answer. My argument has always been that the gold standard is an imperfect institution. All institutions are imperfect. But it's the least imperfect institution that's been tested in a laboratory of history to yield reasonable price stability and to provide for a stable dollar.
The dollar would have a permanent fixed value. Think of it the following way. The dollar is the monetary standard, and the monetary standard is defined permanently as a weight unit of gold.
Q. But there can be gold strikes, or shortages.
A. Well, with respect, the truth about the production of gold is very different from some of the mythology. The rate of gain in gold stocks has averaged around 2 percent, particularly since the industrial revolution.
Q. The severe shortages and booms of the late 19th century had great economic consequences.
A. The consequences were all very beneficial. From 1875 until about 1912, the average rate of variation of the price level never exceeded 2 percent. Compare that to the last 10 years of the manipulated paper currency system, where the price level has varied as much as 13 percent above the previous year several times.
Q. How would going on a gold standard affect wage increases locked into contracts?
A. We all want to see the rate of gain in wages be approximately equal to the rate of gain in productivity. The gold standard gives people today confidence in the future purchasing power of the dollar. As a result, working men believing in an honest dollar begin to ask for reasonable wage increases, proportional, that is, to the gain in the productivity in t heir own labor.
It's almost as if the gold standard were an insurance policy, an actuarial reminder to all who participate in the market that the dollar in 10 years instead of being 50 percent of what it is worth today would be approximately equal in purchasing power as it is today.
Q. If you're going to establish a gold standard, you have to set a price. What happens if the price is too high? All the gold would come to the United States. If it's too low, the United States would lose gold, or go into some kind of economic contraction.
A. Under the gold standard there is no price for gold. The dollar is the monetary standard, set by law equal to a weight of gold. The price of gold does not exist. As a matter of fact, you may even look at the gold standard as the end to the speculation in gold in terms of paper dollars.
Q. But in the real world, you would be using paper dollars and you could turn them in to the Treasury for so much gold. So the gold does have a dollar value.
A. And I live in the real world. I'm a businessman and I'm very concerned about just the character of our monetary standard. Under the gold standard, the paper dollar is a promissory note. It is a claim to a real article of wealth defined by law as the standard.
Let us say, for example, that in January 1982, we would announce that two years hence the monetary standard of the United States would be established as a dollar equal to a weight of gold. About 90 days before the period in which the price, as you call it, would be fixed, the gold markets would be tending to stabilize because they would know that the President and the Congress, under statute, would be about to fix (the dollar) equal to a weight of gold.
Q. In other words, that's the market price and that would be the fair price for gold.
A. The market price would be the lead indicator. On the other hand, other indicators are important - the assignment of the experts assembled around the President in writing a statute. There's no substitute for judgment...
Q. Wouldn't we be mortgaging our future by founding our whole monetary system on the amount of gold coming out of, say, South Africa?
A. Generally that criticism is made by people who have never bothered to study the statistics of gold production. South Africa and the Soviet Union first of all would act in their own self interest because in order to obtain foreign exchange to buy Western technology and Western grain they would want to sell the gold in an orderly manner. On the other hand, if they chose not to sell their gold for foreign exchange they do not produce enough to disrupt the market, of which they ar e less than one percent.
Q. But why should we guarantee the price of the chief source of foreign exchange for them?
A. We are not guaranteeing a price for them. We are establishing a monetary standard for us.
We've all learned that we don't cut off our nose to spoil our face. If something is good for the United States, namely a monetary standard, a dollar and a price level that's stable, we don't worry too much about other countries who may get a minor benefit. Indeed, I would argue that South Africa and the Soviet Union have a stake in inflation, because they get a high price for gold when the United States inflates.
Q. Why is dependence on 'the barbarous relic' better than the rational creation of reserves by rational men?
A. Your phrase - quote, the rational creation of reserves, unquote - is precisely the technique that the Federal Reserve and central banks all over the world during the last 10 years have been using. Not only have they succeeded in destroying almost all currencies; they have succeeded in disrupting the trade patterns based upon a stable exchange rate.
Q. So you don't trust the Fed or the politicians?
A. Well, not that. I do trust them. I do not believe they have the proven techniques to rationally provide for reserves by manipulating the money supply.
In the abstract, especially in the classrooms of Yale where I went to school, it was always easy for professors to draw on a blackboard equations which showed why bank reserves could be provided rationally to the market. As a businessman I have learned that under the gold standard these reserves were provided much more rationally by virtue of the operations of markets.

Abstract: ''The Social Democrats support it because they feel you can't cut spending, particularly for welfare, without doing something for jobs,'' Mr. [Karl Otto Pohl] said. ''I'm of the opinion that a surtax and spending program would be completely counterproductive. What we need are improved exports and a reduction in the current account deficit. Reducing the deficit will improve the job market over the long term.'' The Export Remedy ''The policy of the Bundesbank is not the decisive point,'' Mr. Pohl said, explaining his cautious optimism that the mark would regain some of its former strength soon. ''What is decisive is exchange rate expectations,'' he added. ''If the markets are convinced the mark will climb again, that will be, in a sense, selffulfilling. A bull market breeds a bull market.'' ''We Germans might not suffer that much,'' he added, ''but weaker currencies within the system would do so.''

Full text: Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, has urged the Bonn Government to spend less time criticizing high United States interest rates, and more time putting its ''own house in order.''
He advised Bonn's economic planners that such an emphasis was necessary to bring an early end to West Germany's recession and meaningful improvement in the current-account deficit.
Mr. Pohl, in an interview Friday, one day after the Bonn Government disclosed a program of sharp spending cuts in its 1982 budget, said falling interest rates in the United States would not necessarily bring about lower rates in West Germany, ''if, at the same time, America's inflation dropped, and the country's economic revival program'' took effect. Praise for Spending Cuts
Mr. Pohl praised the program of sharp spending cuts announced last week by the Bonn Government for its 1982 budget but warned that a Government economic recovery plan financed by increased taxes - a plan that is still under discussion in Bonn - would be counterproductive.
Mr. Pohl cautioned that Europe would be unable to insulate itself from the effects of United States inflation, with the recessionary effects it would bring, if Mr. Reagan's policies failed.
In Ottawa at the economic summit meeting, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt blamed high United States rates for the level of lending rates in Europe that he said is stifling investment and prolonging Europe's recession.
His Economics Minister, Count Otto Lambsdorff, added that Washington overemphasized monetary policy, relying too heavily on money-supply control and neglecting fiscal policies, such as spending cuts and a reduction of the deficit, to control inflation.
But Mr. Pohl said that regardless of the direction taken by United States interest rates and the value of the dollar, countries such as Germany had to take independent steps to decrease pressure on their own capital markets. If President Reagan's programs fail, he said, causing inflation, then United States rates will stay high, exerting pressure on Europe. If inflation in America drops, the dollar will remain strong, regardless of inflation rate movements.
''For that reason, falling United States interest rates are no guarantee of a drop in rates here,'' Mr. Pohl said. Mr. Pohl said that he strongly favored such supply-side tactics as tax cuts, investment incentives for businesses, and conservative monetary policy, and warned that Bonn's ambitious program to cut Government spending and reduce the deficit would be effec-tive only if the temptation were resisted to raise taxes to finance a Government pump-priming program.
The program announced last Thursday involves spending cuts of roughly 1 percent of Germany's gross national product. It also anticipates reduced Government borrowing, giving relief to capital markets and removing pressure from interest rates, It also envisions hiring restraints and increased taxes for some luxuries, such as tobacco, coupled with tax breaks for businesses in the form of improved write-offs.
Chancellor Schmidt last week blamed American monetary policy for the spending cuts, saying they were necessary to cut German Government borrowing and relieve capital markets already under pressure from high United States interest rates.
But at the same time the program was announced, members of Mr. Schmidt's Social Democratic Party, with labor union support, were pushing for an income tax and a witholding surtax to finance a Government spending program to stem unemployment. The idea divided the Bonn Cabinet, because of strong opposition from the Free Democrats, the junior partners in the coalition Government, and Mr. Schmidt agreed to postpone a decision until September. Tax Factor Crucial
The spending cuts, Mr. Pohl said, stand a chance of succeeding if the Government resists the temptation to raise taxes.
''I'm very critical of the tax idea, and I told the Cabinet so,'' he said. Mr. Pohl, a former official of the Schmidt Government, has shown considerable independence since becoming head of the central bank in 1979 and has often differed with Government policy.
''The Social Democrats support it because they feel you can't cut spending, particularly for welfare, without doing something for jobs,'' Mr. Pohl said. ''I'm of the opinion that a surtax and spending program would be completely counterproductive. What we need are improved exports and a reduction in the current account deficit. Reducing the deficit will improve the job market over the long term.'' The Export Remedy
Germany's remedy, he said, is to raise exports and attract capital, to reduce the current account deficit. There are indications of a reversal of the capital outflow that has depressed the mark in recent months, as exchange rate expectations grow.
''The policy of the Bundesbank is not the decisive point,'' Mr. Pohl said, explaining his cautious optimism that the mark would regain some of its former strength soon. ''What is decisive is exchange rate expectations,'' he added. ''If the markets are convinced the mark will climb again, that will be, in a sense, selffulfilling. A bull market breeds a bull market.''
Mr. Pohl said he had little faith in the suggestion of some European finance officials that by strengthening the European Monetary System, Europe could insulate its currencies from the dollar's movements sufficiently to bring about lower interest rates independently of the United States.
Mr. Pohl said that he had warned colleagues at Europe's central banks that their currency reserves would ''melt like butter in the sun'' if they attempted such a tactic.
''We Germans might not suffer that much,'' he added, ''but weaker currencies within the system would do so.''

Abstract: Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany is likely to hear plenty of discontent on this score during his visit to the United States next week. Both the [Carter] and [Ronald Reagan] foreign policy advisers accuse the Europeans of putting their own economic advantages, linked to detente and increased East-West trade, ahead of the need to counter Soviet military threats in trouble spots stretching from the Baltic Sea to Afghanistan. The Americans are accusing the Europeans of becoming victims of ''Finlandization'' or ''Euro-neutralism.'' As the urgency of American appeals increased, Professor [Karl Kaiser] says, ''so did European discontent about the unilateral nature of actions aimed at forcing America's allies to act in compliance with American wishes.'' He maintains that Americans made the shocking discovery that part of European public opinion regards the Soviet Union and the United States in much the same light - ''as superpowers who were endangering world peace because of their lack of selfcontrol.'' Economics has become a crucial aspect of the national security issue. Professor Kaiser says: ''The West's economic security today has just as high a priority as its military security. In the event of war, the threat to the West's economy would probably be greater than the strictly military threat.''

Full text: A STORM is brewing between the incoming Reagan administration and European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over military spending. President-elect Ronald Reagan, stressing the need to counter the Soviet military buildup, has made proposals that would increase military expenditures by an estimated 7 to 9 percent a year in real terms - that is, after allowing for inflation. This represents a sizable increase over President Carter's proposed real increase of 4 1/2 to 5 percent.
Senator John G. Tower, who will become chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has been working with the Reagan transition team to draft a supplemental military budget. The Texas Republican declared this week: ''I don't think we put balancing the budget as the No. 1 priority. We put national security as our No. 1 priority.''
But several European countries - including West Germany, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands - are dropping below their earlier pledges to increase defense outlays by 3 percent a year.
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany is likely to hear plenty of discontent on this score during his visit to the United States next week. Both the Carter and Reagan foreign policy advisers accuse the Europeans of putting their own economic advantages, linked to detente and increased East-West trade, ahead of the need to counter Soviet military threats in trouble spots stretching from the Baltic Sea to Afghanistan. The Americans are accusing the Europeans of becoming victims of ''Finlandization'' or ''Euro-neutralism.''
The Europeans contend, however, that the Americans, in trying to coerce them into a military buildup, not only are threatening to damage the Western economy but also are increasing the danger of war.
In a recent article in the German weekly Die Zeit, Prof. Karl Kaiser, head of the German Foreign Policy Association, warns of rising anti-Americanism in Europe. Faced with erratic American policy in Afghanistan and Iran, he says, the Europeans found that the wisest course was to ignore American calls for immediate action, let time pass and wait for Washington to cool down.
But as the urgency of American appeals increased, Professor Kaiser says, ''so did European discontent about the unilateral nature of actions aimed at forcing America's allies to act in compliance with American wishes.'' He maintains that Americans made the shocking discovery that part of European public opinion regards the Soviet Union and the United States in much the same light - ''as superpowers who were endangering world peace because of their lack of selfcontrol.''
Some European observers are worried that a wedge is being driven between the Americans and their European allies - which has long been a goal of Soviet policy. Rolf Pauls, the just-retired West German envoy to NATO, recently warned his fellow Europeans, ''Let us take good care not to become the Kremlin's youthful idiots by virtue of our anti-Americanism.''
Mr. Reagan's foreign policy advisers are determined to press ahead, despite European misgivings, with a big defense buildup. They contend that this will be not so much a burden to the economy as a means of strengthening America's economic, as well as political, status in the world. They argue that the European countries and Japan will be less likely to follow the American lead in demanding reliable access to supplies of energy and raw materials from Middle Eastern and other third-world countries unless the credibility of the United States as an ally is increased. Lacking belief in American political resolution and power, the Reagan advisers maintain, the European allies and Japan have been and will continue to be reluctant to share the cost of collective defense and to regulate economic relations with the Soviet bloc or with third-world countries on a common basis with the United States.
But efforts by the Reagan administration to strengthen United States and Western pressures on Communist, oil-producing and thirdworld countries could worsen relations between the United States and Western Europe and Japan unless handled intelligently and skillfully.
America's allies regard United States foreign policy today as an overreaction to what they regard as Soviet defensive moves. And they fear that too rapid a defense buildup would not only damage their economic relations with Moscow but also would intensify inflation and other strains on the worldwide economy.
Economics has become a crucial aspect of the national security issue. Professor Kaiser says: ''The West's economic security today has just as high a priority as its military security. In the event of war, the threat to the West's economy would probably be greater than the strictly military threat.''
Countering the economic threat lies outside the capabilities of the defense establishments. Responding to economic dangers will require cooperation between partners with different foreign policies, different perceptions and different interests. The stability and growth of national economies will also play a crucial part in preserving the peace. This nation's next secretary of state ought to be a person who understands economics as well as diplomacy and national security.

Abstract: The failure to understand and manage that interdependence, Mr. [Robert S. McNamara] warned, could lead to a global economic disaster. ''We've got this tremendous financial disequilibrium,'' he said, ''that has come about because of the increases in oil prices.'' In his view, the present oil glut and small price decline is likely to be short-lived. For the rest of the century, he expects the rise in oil prices to outrun the rate of inflation by an average of 3 percent a year. While he does not regard economic advance as assuring political stability, Mr. McNamara believes that a lack of economic and social advance in the third world is contributing to political instability, which is imposing increasingly heavy strategic costs on the United States. ''Surely,'' he says, ''we must realize that in relation to the problems we are facing in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and Africa.'' Americans traditionally regard national security as a function of military armaments and manpower. Thirteen years after his service as Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War, Mr. McNamara sees national security as the function of a broader set of economic, social and political as well as military factors. ''At the margin,'' he says, ''the United States gains more security through a dollar applied to development assistance than it does to apply that same dollar to military expenditures.''

Full text: AT the Ottawa conference of the leaders of the major Western industrial nations next month, President Reagan is likely to face heavy criticism for the impact of high United States interest rates on other countries. Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, President Francois Mitterrand of France and other leaders have already voiced their fears that the Reagan Administration's stringent monetarist strategy could worsen unemployment and cause a breakdown of economic cooperation in the West.
Only Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, pursuing her own monetarist attack on inflation, is likely to provide strong support for Mr. Reagan's position. But with British joblessness above 10 percent, highest since the Depression, Mrs. Thatcher's praise may do Mr. Reagan more harm than good.
Mr. Reagan almost certainly will argue that tight money and a stronger dollar serve not just this country's best interests but that of all, by bringing down inflation and by strengthening the world monetary system. Strict control of the money supply, his advisers insist, is not the cause of high interest rates but the cure. For in stopping inflation, they argue, tight money will bring down interest rates.
Administration spokesmen have been asking what the United States must do to satisfy foreign critics, who complained bitterly when American inflation was climbing and the dollar falling, and now complain even more bitterly when the dollar is climbing. As the old political line had it, they are against inflation; they are against deflation; they are in favor of flation.
But the real issue raised by Mr. Reagan's critics (at home as well as abroad; on Wall Street as well as in the building industry) is not whether the Administration should fight inflation, but how.
That was also the issue stressed by Robert S. McNamara, who leaves as president of the World Bank at the end of this month, in an interview last week. Mr. McNamara argues that American economic policy has been distorted by three basic misconceptions: (1) a failure to distinguish between activities appropriate for the private sector vis-a-vis the public sector; (2) a failure to recognize that a major aim ought to be how to increase the effectiveness of government, and (3) a tendency to believe that all expenditure reductions (other than defense expenditures) are good.
Those three errors, he said, have led ''to an excessive reliance on monetarism, inadequate attention to fiscal constraints, inadequaate attention to an incomes policy, and inadequate attention to the structural rigidities of our society - subsidies for the middle class, agricultural subsidies, excessive rigidities in linkages between Social Security and inflation, wage contracts and price levels, and a host of other matters.''
All this, he maintained, goes to an even deeper problem - a failure of the American people to recognize the tremendous change that has taken place: the growing interdependence of the United States and other nations, including the poor countries of the third world with their heavy dependence on imported food and fuel.
The failure to understand and manage that interdependence, Mr. McNamara warned, could lead to a global economic disaster. ''We've got this tremendous financial disequilibrium,'' he said, ''that has come about because of the increases in oil prices.'' In his view, the present oil glut and small price decline is likely to be short-lived. For the rest of the century, he expects the rise in oil prices to outrun the rate of inflation by an average of 3 percent a year.
That forecast leads him to expect a continuing financial disequilibrium between the poor countries, the oil exporting countries and the industrial countries, endangering both rich and poor.
While he does not regard economic advance as assuring political stability, Mr. McNamara believes that a lack of economic and social advance in the third world is contributing to political instability, which is imposing increasingly heavy strategic costs on the United States. ''Surely,'' he says, ''we must realize that in relation to the problems we are facing in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and Africa.''
Americans traditionally regard national security as a function of military armaments and manpower. Thirteen years after his service as Secretary of Defense during the Vietnam War, Mr. McNamara sees national security as the function of a broader set of economic, social and political as well as military factors. ''At the margin,'' he says, ''the United States gains more security through a dollar applied to development assistance than it does to apply that same dollar to military expenditures.''
Mr. Reagan may well encounter similar arguments at the Ottawa summit meeting. However, while the Europeans and the Japanese are loath to respond to American pressures to increase their defense spending, they appear more disposed to invest marginal financial resources in their own economic development than in aid to the oilpoor developing countries.
But, if Mr. McNamara is right, the economic and political instability issuing from the poor countries of the third world is likely to be a major threat to the world economy and to world peace for the rest of the century.

Abstract: Another record winter wheat crop was predicted by the Agriculture Department. Production is expected to be 2.01 billion bushels, 6 percent above last year's record crop but 3 percent below last month's estimate. The forecast follows by a day a United States offer to resume grain sales to the Soviet Union. (Page D1.) President Reagan, at the request of Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., rejected an Agriculture Department recommendation that surplus United States butter be sold on the open market, where it might be bought by the Soviet Union. (D16.) President Reagan's block grant proposal was dismantled by the actions of two Congressional committees. A Republican-controlled Senate committee and a Democratic-controlled House committee acted independently to thwart the plan to transfer control of social programs from Washington to the states. Major programs would be exempted under the Senate committee's action, while the House committee rejected the transfer entirely. (A1.) France's new Socialist Cabinet decided to impose extra taxes on the very rich. A supplementary budget, which requires Parliamentary approval, also included a corporate tax on expense-account entertaining, higher taxes on luxury yachts and hotels and a ''windfall profits'' tax on banks and oil companies. Revenue will go toward a $1.2 billion package of expansionary economic measures. (D1.)

TEXT OF HAIG'S SPEECH ON AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY

Abstract: Imaginative remedies might have prevented the current danger. Unfortunately, as these ominous developments gathered strength over the last decade, America's confidence in itself was shaken and American leadership faltered. The United States seemed unable or unwilling to act when our strategic interests were threatened. We earned a reputation for ''strategic passivity'' that still weighs heavily upon us and cannot be wished away by rhetoric. What we once took for granted abroad - confidence in the United States - must be re-established through a steady accumulation of prudent and successful actions. Perhaps the most useful concept to govern these critical relationships is ''consultation.'' Consultation should mean more than the formal act of soliciting opinions. It suggets what alliances really mean: shared interests, reliable performance and sensitivity to each other's concerns. In reviewing the causes of the Second World War and prospects for peace in the future, Winston Churchill concluded: ''How absolute is the need of a broad path of international action pursued by many states in common across the years, irrespective of the ebb and flow of national politics.''

Full text: Following is the text of a speech today by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. to the American Society of Newspaper Editors:
Some hundred days have elapsed since President Reagan's inauguration. In the field of foreign affairs, the first controversial steps have been taken. To paraphrase Mark Twain, these actions have pleased more than a few and astonished the rest. Although we have not remade the world, I do believe a new direction is evident.
We are acting to restore confidence in American leadership through a more robust defense of U.S. ideals and interests, and a more realistic approach to the dangers and opportunities of the international situation. It is my purpose today to outline briefly the philosophy behind the new direction - this Administration's view of the realities of the world and the tasks before us.
A French statesman once remarked that the true business of government was to foresee problems and to administer appropriate remedies while time remained. In our approach to foreign affairs, we have sought to distinguish between the symptom of the problem and the problem itself, the crisis and its cause, the ebb and flow of daily events and the underlying trend.
The Fundamental Disorders
The problems that beset us are clearly symptomatic of deeper disorders and it is to these fundamental movements of international politics that we must direct our remedies:
- Worldwide inflation, caused in part by astounding increases in the cost of oil, interrupts balanced economic growth, essential to the aspirations of both developing and developed countries.
- Limited resources and political disturbance impede the eradication of hunger, poverty, disease and other important humanitarian goals.
- Disruption from abroad threatens a more vulnerable West as we draw energy and raw materials from regions in which the throes of rapid change and conflict prevail.
- Soviet military power grows relentlessly as Moscow shows an increasing readiness to use it both directly and by proxy and obstructs the achievement of a more just international order. Danger of Current Trends
We must understand that these conditions are interrelated - they play upon each other - and the danger is therefore all the greater. If present trends are not arrested, the convergence of rising international disorder, greater Western vulnerability and growing Soviet military power will undo the international codes of conduct that foster the peaceful resolution of disputes between nations. The symptoms of this breakdown - terrorism, subversion and conquest - are already apparent. The ideals and safety of democratic societies are under assault.
Imaginative remedies might have prevented the current danger. Unfortunately, as these ominous developments gathered strength over the last decade, America's confidence in itself was shaken and American leadership faltered. The United States seemed unable or unwilling to act when our strategic interests were threatened. We earned a reputation for ''strategic passivity'' that still weighs heavily upon us and cannot be wished away by rhetoric. What we once took for granted abroad - confidence in the United States - must be re-established through a steady accumulation of prudent and successful actions.
Starting With Pride
Before others can repose confidence in us, we must ourselves be confident. The Reagan foreign policy therefore begins with a justifiable pride in our country, its ideals and its achievements.
Government by the people and a society under law are great principles to defend. Regard for individual liberty at home translates into concern for human rights abroad.
Moreover, we are fully conscious of our historic role in the defense of freedom wherever it may be. Together with our allies, we have shared peace and prosperity. The United States continues to be the natural anchor for the free societies of the Atlantic and Pacific. Our objective remains simple and compelling: a world hospitable to our society and our ideals.
Confidence in ourselves - the crucial physchological element in any foreign policy - is evident throughout President Reagan's program to restore confidence in American leadership abroad. 3 Projects of Administration
Our actions are directed toward three projects: First, to enlarge our capacity to influence events and to make more effective use of the full range of our moral, political, scientific, economic and military resources in the pursuit of our interests.
Second, to convince our allies, friends and adversaries - above all the Soviet Union - that America will act in a manner befitting our responsibilities as a trustee of freedom and peace.
Third, to offer hope and aid to the developing countries in their aspirations for a peaceful and prosperous future. The President has established clear priorities in the pursuit of these projects. Understanding that American economic weakness would cripple our efforts abroad, he has proposed a revolutionary program to restore inflation-free economic growth. This program recognizes that America's strength is measured not only in arms but also in the spirit of individual enterprise, the soundness of the dollar and the proper role of government in a free society. Defects in Military Posture
Fundamental to this approach is also the belief that economic recovery must be accompanied by a prompt correction of defects in our military posture. For too long we have ignored this fact: The military strength required by the United States can be achieved only through sacrifice and consistent purpose. We have proposed a heavy investment in our armed forces to assure safety for ourselves and the generations to come.
Our economic and military programs have not lessened the need for balanced economic and security assistance abroad. This helps allies and friends to join us in contributing to the general security. It also adds to the flexible instruments of influence required for a succesful foreign policy.
These efforts to strengthen America's economic and military capabilities provide the foundation for an American diplomacy that includes the following aims: restraining the Soviet Union; reinvigoration of our alliances; strengthening our friends, and a more effective approach to the developing countries.
Danger of the Soviet Union
A major focus of American policy must be the Soviet Union, not because of ideological preoccupation but simply because Moscow is the greatest source of international insecurity today. Let us be plain about it: Soviet promotion of violence as the instrument of change constitutes the greatest danger to the world.
The differences between the United States and the Soviet Union concern the very principles of international action. We believe in peaceful change, not the status quo. The peoples of the world seek peace, prosperity and social justice. This is as desirable as it is inevitable. The United States could no more stand against such a quest than we could repudiate our own Revolution. We were the first to proclaim that individual liberty, democracy and the rule of law provided the best framework for the improvement of the human condition. And we have led the attempt since the Second World War to maintain two principles of international action: the peaceful resolution of disputes and the proscription of outside intervention in the affairs of sovereign nations. Principles of Soviet Action
In contrast, Soviet policy seeks to exploit aspirations for change in order to create conflict justifying the use of force and even invasion. Moscow continues to support terrorism and war by proxy.
There is an additional dimension to the danger. In regions sensitive to Western interests, in the littorals of the critical sea passages, in areas that hardly affect Soviet security, you will find Moscow taking a keen interest in conflict. Thus, Western strategic needs and interests as well as the hopes for a more just international order are at stake.
Our objective must be to restore the prospects for peaceful resolution of conflict. We can do this by demonstrating to the Soviet Union that aggressive and violent behavior will threaten Moscow's own interests. We can do this by demonstrating, as we are doing in El Salvador, that a government bent on making necessary reforms will not be overthrown by armed intervention supported by Moscow or its surrogates. And we can do this by never accepting the Soviet occupation of other countries, such as Afghanistan. Reason for U.S. Role
Only the U.S. has the pivotal strength to convince the Soviets - and their proxies - that violence will not advance their cause. Only the United States has the power to persuade the Soviet leaders that improved relations with us serve Soviet as well as American interests. We have a right, indeed a duty, to insist that the Soviets support a peaceful international order, that they abide by treaties and that they respect reciprocity. A more constructive Soviet behavior in these areas will provide the basis for a more productive East-West dialogue.
Another essential element in the restoration of our leadership is the strengthening of our alliances. From the outset of this Administration, we have placed a high priority on repairing the damage done to them in recent years. Rebuilding alliance solidarity is a precondition for redressing the East-West military imbalance and for constraining Soviet international behavior.
Perhaps the most useful concept to govern these critical relationships is ''consultation.'' Consultation should mean more than the formal act of soliciting opinions. It suggets what alliances really mean: shared interests, reliable performance and sensitivity to each other's concerns.
We have acted to restore consultation as a useful instrument of alliance communication and solidarity. President Reagan's numerous meeting with heads of state and foreign ministers, as well as my own, have been marked by refreshing exchanges of views. A warm welcome awaits a United States willing to listen before it acts.
Common Steps by Allies
We are moving already beyond exchanges of views toward common strategic perceptions and concrete acts. We and our allies are taking common steps to restrain Soviet aggression and to restore our strength.
On Poland, we have collectively sent a firm signal to the Soviet Union. The Soviets are now well aware that intervention would bring severe and lasting consequences. Indeed, the restraint we have seen offers some evidence of the benefits of alliance cohesion and resolve. Simultaneously, the West is working together to help the Polish people economically so they can deal with their own problems.
On theater nuclear forces, we and our allies have reaffirmed our commitment to modernization of NATO's theater nuclear capabilities based on NATO's two-track decision of 1979. We will also make a serious effort to pursue European theater nuclear arms control with the Soviets.
In critical regions such as the Middle East and Southwest Asia, we have launched a new, intensive effort aimed at achieving common approaches to protect our vital interests and to help assure peace. At a meeting of allies interested in southern Africa earlier this week in London, we began to reach consensus on a realistic and fair approach to the important problem of Namibia. Belief in Free Trade
On economic challenges, we are all experiencing slower growth and high inflation. Here again we understand that international cooperation is essential to solve each of our national problems. For example, we have reaffirmed our belief in free trade as we consult with Japan to alleviate the plight of the auto industry in the United States.
Looking toward the NATO ministerial meeting early next month and the Ottawa economic summit in July, the most advanced nations in the world are coming together to meet the challenge from Soviet expansionism, regional instability and economic interdependence.
The reinvigoration of our alliances must be accompanied by the strengthening of our friends. This is particularly important in the Middle East and Southwest Asia, a region where violent action by the Soviet Union and its surrogates demands a more effective Western response. Wisdom of Our Friends
The President's purpose in sending me recently to the area was to seek the wisdom of our friends on the issues of peace and security. But he also sent a message. The United States is fully cognizant of regional complexities and the necessity to proceed with the peace process. At the same time we are determined to strengthen our friends and to work with them against the threat posed by the Soviet Union and its surrogates. These great projects must go forward together if we are to shake off our reputation for strategic passivity in the area and safeguard Western interests.
Restraint of the Soviets, the reinvigoration of our alliances and the strengthening of our friends are crucial aspects of the Reagan foreign policy. But the underlying tensions of international affairs go beyond the themes of allies and adversaries. A fresh American approach to the developing countries is essential if we are to treat the roots of international disorder. Key to the Third World's Future
The developing countries, sometimes grouped together as the third world, are a vastly varied multitude of states, most of them beset by severe economic and political problems. What once united them - the memory of colonialism - is fading. The new emphasis is the future, not the past.
The West in general and the United States in particular hold the key to that future. It is we who demonstrate by our own history how to combine freedom and development, political stability and economic progress. Two guidelines should govern our actions:
- We must show that friends of the United States benefit from that friendship, even in the face of Soviet-supported intervention.
- We must offer hope that the United States and its allies are not some form of closed club, hostile to the problems and frustrations attending development.
Our record on the issues of increasing concern to the future of the developing countries offers a sharp contrast to that of the East. We support economic development; the East does not. We assist the refugees; the East refuses relief. We offer the peaceful mediation of dispute; the East offers only arms of conflict. The developing countries are beginning to recognize where their best hopes lie, and it is in both the interests of humanity and our national security that we promote such a trend. The Long-Term Path
In reviewing the causes of the Second World War and prospects for peace in the future, Winston Churchill concluded: ''How absolute is the need of a broad path of international action pursued by many states in common across the years, irrespective of the ebb and flow of national politics.''
As we enter the final decades of the 20th century, it is the task of the United States to lead the pursuit of this broad path, beckoning toward a more peaceful and prosperous international order. Knowledge of the obstacles before us will protect us against false optimism. Knowledge of ourselves will protect us against despair. Our difficulties will not disappear overnight. Yet we should not dwell too much on the troubles of the moment. The free nations of the Atlantic and the Pacific represent the greatest concentration of talent and wealth in the world. We are a community of peoples devoted to human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
Our prospects are bright. Only constancy of purpose is required to preserve successfully the liberty that is the treasure of our civilization.

Some of our more conservative critics say that we are too pessimistic on our expectation of bringing down the inflation in the out years. They think once this program gets going, by '83, '84, you'd see much more progress on bringing down the inflation, and hence that the velocity would be lower than we show. Obviously that's a consummation devoutly to be wished.

Full text: WITH most members of Congress home for recess until April 27, hearing their constituents' views on the Administration's proposed spending and tax cuts, the White House spent the week gearing up to give them an earful, too.
It started off on House Budget Committee chairman James R. Jones's intimations last weekend that President Reagan might accept a oneyear tax cut instead of the three-year cut he wants. Though pressure for a one-year cut has been building on Capitol Hill, a ''concerned, agitated - irritated'' Mr. Reagan ordered repudiation. Then, Vice President Bush and Donald T. Regan, Secretary of the Treasury, issued nearly identically worded threats of veto. And on Friday, for the first time since he was wounded in an assassination attempt March 30, Mr. Reagan himself took the field, calling Congressional leaders to enlist their support and meeting with his speech writers to begin drafting messages to Congress.
Last week, The Week in Review asked Leonard Silk, economic columnist for The New York Times, to talk with Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and George L. Perry, of the Brookings Institution, about the economy and the Adminstration's program to fix it. Excerpts of their discussion follow.
The Economy's Strengths
Mr. Silk. Mr. Weidenbaum, is the economy doing better, worse or about what you expected? Mr. Weidenbaum. About what we would expect, in terms of working off the economic legacy we inherited -the soft economy, the doubledigit inflation, slow growth, the high unemployment.
Mr. Silk. Is the pattern going to continue?
Mr. Weidenbaum. If public policy stays unchanged, the short answer is yes.
Mr. Silk. Mr. Perry, do you think there will be a pickup by the end of the year? Or maybe you don't need much of one. The economy in some ways looks as if it's been stronger than expected.
Mr. Perry. The first quarter looks stronger. But to be fair about it, this Administration really deserves neither blame nor credit for anything in the first quarter.
One thing that's interesting is that so far the financial markets have not been terribly enthusiastic. Mr. Weidenbaum. I think that's basically right. The markets are waiting for a strong signal, not brilliant eloquence on our part but action on the part of Congress ratifying those budget cuts.
Mr. Silk. Wouldn't you score that as a bit of a disappointment? In the Economic Dunkirk paper there was an urging of a program that would immediately impress the country as spelling the beginning of the end of inflation. Do you see any such expectational effect?
Mr. Weidenbaum. We've said from our first week in office that 1981 is going to be a year of a soggy economy. If the markets respond to that, I think they are very sensible. We've talked about positive results, assuming the enactment of our program, in 1982 and beyond.
Mr. Perry. The bond market ought to be taking a long view. (It) hasn't bought the idea that anything on the horizon is going to make inflation go away.
Mr. Weidenbaum. How do you explain the strength of the dollar overseas since Nov. 20?Mr. Perry. Well, I think you owe that one to your predecessor. Interest rates are very high in this country. Mr. Silk. Isn't one factor in the markets' thinking the Administration's program on defense? Very large and very rapid increases - isn't that inflationary?
Mr. Weidenbaum. Not necessarily. We've also budgeted a far greater reduction in nondefense spending, which will more than offset the defense buildup.
Mr. Silk. The President did campaign against waste. Shouldn't waste be searched out in defense? Mr. Weidenbaum. Exactly. Which is why we have large and growing targeted reductions in the base of the defense budget; we issued a long tabulation of defense activities which are being phased down or phased out.
Mr. Perry. I don't know what the housekeeping is going to look like. But whatever we feel our strategic needs are, pouring it on has almost got to be wasteful, even if you ran a tight ship. We're talking about increases of 150 percent in procurement. You just can't do that much without expecting to drive up prices.
Mr. Weidenbaum. Look at the growth rates of the defense sector in the early part of the Vietnam War. That was much more of a frontloaded expansion. You'll see the major expansion coming a few years out here, which specifically will provide opportunities for the defense industrial base to expand to meet the increased demand.
Mr. Silk. You said these military expenditures were more than offset by cuts in social programs. Mr. Weidenbaum. Civilian programs.
Mr. Silk. Civilian programs. How do you respond to the charge that some of these things were done so fast as to even be perverse? Take the cuts in welfare to the so-called working poor: There will be virtually no advantage to some of them to work. And will that not increase welfare outpayments, run counter to the Administration policy of providing incentives to work?
Mr. Weidenbaum. Invariably, there are some incentive effects, and there's a tradeoff. But in good measure we think our proposal would promote equity. I found, very frankly to my surprise as an afficionado of budget detail, that many of us of not only middle- but perhaps upper-middle income - at least prior to joining the Administration - were enjoying a lot of these subsidies.
We're not set in concrete. If someone has some better suggestions we'll seriously consider them. Mr. Perry. I thought that the excuse for the budget changes was that equity should not be a consideration, not that equity was being served.
Nonetheless, you didn't really speak to the question of incentives. A University of Chicago study did show that the difference between working and not working had been reduced to a very small number.
Mr. Weidenbaum. Not having seen the Chicago study, I would be concerned, having participated in earlier exercises on welfare program changes, whether the existing inequities are ignored in any alleged shortcomings in our alternatives.
Mr. Perry. You've got to believe that it makes it worse, when the difference between working and not working for the very low-income individual shrinks from a few hundred dollars to $20 or $30 a month.
Mr. Weidenbaum. I'll tell you our philosophy. We really saw the budget cuts as part of an overall program designed to do two things the American public says are the highest priority: bring down inflation and bring down unemployment. Certainly bringing down unemployment will directly benefit low-income unemployed people.
Mr. Perry. It's hard to see that these alterations in a nondefense budget have very much to do with that. What's surprising to outsiders is retirement programs, where expenditures had risen much more than had been intended originally by law and which were overindexed. That's where all the bucks were, too. And yet the Administration avoided doing anything about them, for the obvious reason there's a lot of votes out there.
Mr. Silk. What did the last Administration do?
Mr. Perry. Well, on its deathbed it did put out an important analysis of the topic and proposed ways in which it could be straightened out. But I'm here to defend truth, not the last Administration.
Mr. Weidenbaum. I'm glad you make the distinction.
Mr. Silk. On the other side of this fairness line: How come the President is so assiduous in trying to get rid of milk price supports and not so assiduous on tobacco?
Mr. Weidenbaum. Oh, very simple. We start with the biggest farm subsidy first. Mr. Silk. You don't deny, though, that there is big money in Social Security? Mr. Weidenbaum. Quite clearly. You've seen the first two installments of our budget-restraint effort. I expect you will see over the years many additional proposals to slow the growth of Government spending.
Mr. Silk. Another objective of the Administration is to spur savings and investment. How did the tax cuts get transmogrified from a Keynesian demand cut into a Lafferian supply-side cut? What is the logic behind expecting a huge effect in increasing savings and investment, rather than in consumption?
Mr. Weidenbaum. Rather than addressing either of those alternatives, I'd rather talk about the Reagan tax program, in context with the Reagan economic program.
We expect to see a major expansion in the savings rate, for a variety of reasons. One, of course, is the expectation, borne out in the past, that cutting individual and family income tax rates across the board will generate a more than proportionate increase in savings. Technically, I'm referring to the permanent income hypothesis.
What will make that shift more durable is a shift in inflationary expectations. The major reason that the savings rate is so depressed is the average citizen's belief, quite properly, that in recent years it hasn't paid to save because of inflation. Our total program - looking at the monetary policy, the fiscal policy, the regulatory policy - pushes toward a diminished rate of inflation. Savings and Investment
Mr. Silk. The permanent income hypothesis, that won a Nobel Prize for Professor Milton Friedman, is, in brief, that increases in permanent income increase people's consumption, while a change in nonpermanent income tends to be largely saved. It seems to me that the hypothesis argues more strongly in terms of the same proportion of spending and savings as out of other permanent income. How will you get the dramatic changes that have been talked about?
Mr. Weidenbaum. All we're talking about is restoring a savings rate to 7 percent. We've had savings rates of 8 percent for a number of recent years. I cite the permanent income hypothesis (because) initially we'll get to kick to savings from that. Temporary shifts to more savings will become more durable as inflationary expecations shift.
Mr. Perry. Forecasting the saving rate a few years out is just hazardous. And I think it's beside the point. But if we can review the whole program, there are inconsistencies. One is between the gross national product that's being projected, and on the basis of which the budget and deficit are being projected, and the monetary policy, which (the Administration) endorses and which the Federal Reserve is committed to. Those two don't hang together by any historical relationship.
Problem two: If we got the G.N.P. increase, then no model predicts the sustained reduction in inflation that's in the Administration's forecast. We would have a normal expansion to high employment, and as we approach the out years we would see inflationary pressures.
Third, the argument that this particular tax package is desirable because it's going to do this thing for saving misses the fact that it's not going to do particularly good things for total saving. If we need a lot of investment in this country, the old-fashioned and I think still correct prescription is to have a large total of national saving, which means a large surplus in the budget.
This program even as advertised is not providing a large surplus. If we make some realistic adjustments, it is promising very large deficits for as far ahead as you can see. That's not a program to stimulate investment. And that is perhaps the main reason that there is now so much reluctance in the Congress - and so much skepticism in financial markets - about committing to the full three years of tax reduction that are called for here.
Mr. Weidenbaum. Let's take the growth in G.N.P. a step at a time. In 1981, you'll find that we are within a decimal point, a tenth or two, of the standard forecast. If you look at 1982, you'll find the variation between our expected increase in nominal G.N.P. and again, the standard private forecast is very modest.
Mr. Silk. Nominal G.N.P. is G.N.P. not adjusted for inflation. The Administration expects it to increase by 12.8 percent in 1982. But you are projecting a 4.2 percent increase in real G.N.P., or G.N.P. adjusted for inflation, and an increase in inflation of 8.3 percent.
Mr. Weidenbaum. Yes. Which is the second question.
Now when you get to 1983 and beyond, quite clearly, we're expecting that this program would begin to alter the structure of the economy. That's the whole idea. And I must admit that I do expect that factors such as velocity will alter - as they have in the past.
Mr. Perry. The inconsistency is really much stronger than those remarks imply. The ratio of M-2 (a comprehensive measure of something called money, including checking accounts and currency, time and savings deposits and money market funds) to nominal G.N.P. is what is called velocity. And the world's record for increases in velocity over a four-year period has been 1.2 percent a year. (The Administration) assumes 5.2 percent a year.
Furthermore, if you imagine that innovations in the financial area led to a break in the record, so that you could get a lot more G.N.P. with less money growth than history tells you you can get, then you have to ask: Will the Fed permit that? Will it give up tight money in order to remain monetarist? I don't think it would. Money and Inflation
Mr. Weidenbaum. I find it fascinating that we've been getting some criticism from - if you'll pardon me -the right as well as the left. Some of our more conservative critics say that we are too pessimistic on our expectation of bringing down the inflation in the out years. They think once this program gets going, by '83, '84, you'd see much more progress on bringing down the inflation, and hence that the velocity would be lower than we show. Obviously that's a consummation devoutly to be wished.
By the way, there's no unique measure in our projections. So your estimates, of course, are just that - yours. Mr. Perry. These are implied by stated quantitative estimates of nominal G.N.P. that you've made, and stated nominal targets for money that the Fed has made and that you've endorsed. It's true, I did the subtraction.
Mr. Silk. It seems to me that the argument is about whether it is possible to speed up the growth of the economy and at the same time reduce the rate of inflation. Now the Administration feels that reducing the rate of growth of the money supply will bring down the rate of inflation. But frequently, when the Fed has reduced the rate of money growth a great deal, the economy has gone into recession. Now you say it's not going to go into recession, it's going to rise. And what will then cover the difference will be an increase in velocity.
Mr. Perry defined velocity in technical terms, the relationship between M-2 and G.N.P. In ordinary terms, it's the rate at which money turns over. If people spend their money faster, or if institutions change so the same amount of money will be used more frequently and turn over faster, then you can cover the difference.
The heart of the question is really what makes inflation slow down. Is there some mysterious relationship between the growth of the money supply, apart from velocity, or is there something that most people are not getting about what causes inflation to slow down when demand is growing quite rapidly?
Mr. Weidenbaum. You've put your finger on the essence of the supply-side oriented strategy. If, putting it in the old colloquial expression, inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods, we want to increase the supply of goods and services. Our objective is achieved not by pumping up demands but by increasing supply, by reducing unemployment and inflation simultaneously.
Very frankly, I'm not prepared to stake serious, fundamental economic policy dealing with inflation, unemployment, economic growth and so forth so squarely on interpretations of monetary turnover.
Mr. Perry. That is quite reasonable. But that is not my reading of what the Administration has done. The Under Secretary of the Treasury just got very critical of the Federal Reserve for not being monetarist enough on a week by week basis. I think he was complaining that they were not keeping the money supply moving on schedule.
Mr. Weidenbaum. He said, in more detail, the same thing that I said in my Senate Banking testimony, the same thing we said in the White Paper of Feb. 18., in describing the entire Reagan economic program: That a major factor in the success of our program is a monetary policy concentrating on the monetary aggregates, and one in which that growth rate reduces steadily.
Incidentally, I've noticed over the years that the Federal Reserve - I think very properly - has not been shy in providing fiscal policy advice to the Congress, to the executive branch. I've said on a number of occasions that the flow of advice should be a two-way street.
Mr. Perry. I really don't disagree with the Administration voicing an opinion about monetary policy. The question I was raising wasn't that it had no role, but that it was intimately embracing a very monetarist strategy. That, historically, is inconsistent.
Mr. Silk. In the last week, we've had a certain amount of confusion over whether or not the Administration would accept compromises in its tax program. What if Congress only passes a oneyear program?
Mr. Weidenbaum. First of all, the President has made clear it's his policy not to say in advance of the time a bill reaches his desk whether he's going to sign it. Surely I will follow the boss's wishes.
Now, we really believe that our program is far superior to the partial substitutes that have been mentioned in Congress. We will continue to try to convince - educate, if you will - members of Congress. It's my expectation that what comes out of conference and goes to the President will bear a far closer resemblance to the President's proposal than some of the alternative suggestions.
Mr. Silk. Some of the opposition came not from the Democrats but from conservative Republicans concerned about the implicit size of deficits in the future. Is it your view that these fellows should get back in line?
Mr. Weidenbaum. It's mainly a question of updating what we used to call the old-time religion - balancing the budget by solely focusing on expenditure restraint.
Where so much of the increase in the budget comes from the entitlement programs, the demand for which originates essentially in the economy - a soft economy generates more demands for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid - an important part of the balancing of the budget is not just to restrain controllable spending. It is to reduce demands for those uncontrollable entitlements by an expansion in economic activity. This is where those multi-year tax cuts serve a vital function.
Mr. Perry. Well, it is a budget which would be a good budget for expansion back to a prosperous high-employment economy - leaving aside questions of equity.
The trouble is that (the program) does not address the question that it claims to, which is: How are we going get rid of inflation in the meantime? How are we going to make room for a lot of investment in the meantime?
It is really not so much a terribly innovative program. Rather, it's too conventional. If you're serious about inflation, there are two main avenues. One is to get serious about an incomes policy: Try to do something to negotiate down wage and price increases that are totally habituated into the economy. Or two, to take the traditional conservative cure: Run a slack economy, put so much pain in that you start disinflating. The Federal Reserve is pursuing the latter. No one is pursuing the former, and it's certainly an open question whether it would succeed. But at least it seems to address the question.
And if investment is part of your anti-inflation strategy, then you have to ask: Have you designed a fiscal and monetary policy that will permit investment? The ingredients in the economy are there. But I don't think that the budget really is designed to accommodate that. You get bare balance where you maybe need a large surplus by 1984 to make room for all that investment. Regulatory Reform
Mr. Weidenbaum. I welcome the zeal of the newly converted no matter how late in life. Mr. Perry. I don't think I'm newly converted to that proposition. Mr. Weidenbaum. To a balanced budget?
Mr. Perry. To the idea that you need a big surplus if you're going to get a lot of investment.
Mr. Weidenbaum. Essentially there are two departures. One that I would call an opening to the left: incomes policy or, to put it more bluntly, the hair of the dog that bit you - let's have some more Government intervention. We in the Reagan Administration want to go the other way. That is, an opening to the right, to reduce that whole array of Government programs that are obstacles to a more efficient, more competitive, economy.
A real sleeper in the entire Administration's economic program is regulatory reform. And the reason it's a sleeper is the progress to date has not depended on Congressional action but by use of the existing administrative power of the President.
Our estimates now show that in real terms for the first time in at least a decade, in fiscal 1981 (which began Oct. 1) there would be no growth in the total budgets of the regulatory agencies. In fiscal '82 there would be the first real decline - a 4 percent reduction.
We really are determined to reduce the burden of government regulations - mindful of the very real social concerns that motivated the establishment of these programs in the first place. Look at the automobile regulatory relief, which is our largest regulatory reform to date. We've focused on such things as changing the bumper standard, which doesn't involve a human life but fender denting. We view regulatory compliance costs as a hidden sales tax on the consumer. Here we're putting into effect right away a supply-side oriented tax cut.

Abstract: It is commonly accepted that America's oil bill has been a drain on the economy, but, according to Geoffrey H. Moore, that drain has been even more severe than is generally recognized. Mr. Moore, an economist and a leading student of business cycles, suggests that our practice of looking at economic activity in ''real'' terms - that is, after the effect of inflation has been factored out - has in this instance provided a misleading and overly optimistic impression. Relying on a different technique of adjusting for inflation, Mr. Moore concludes that paying the import bill has reduced America's real purchasing power substantially more than official figures show. A. If we look at gross national product both in terms of current dollars and in terms of ''deflated'' dollars - that is, after the effect of inflation is removed - we see that for nearly every component, the deflated numbers naturally don't go up as fast as the undeflated numbers. In simple terms, we don't deflate imports and exports by the same yardstick. The way we handle it is that first we deflate exports and then we deflate imports by their respective prices. The net balance - which is what we call the trade surplus or deficit - is simply the difference between the deflated numbers. Since OPEC, however, import prices, including oil, have gone up much faster than export prices. That produces a balance, adjusted for inflation, that goes up a lot faster than the current dollar balance. This means that in ''real'' terms, the net drain on the economy appears to be smaller, rather than larger.

Full text: It is commonly accepted that America's oil bill has been a drain on the economy, but, according to Geoffrey H. Moore, that drain has been even more severe than is generally recognized. Mr. Moore, an economist and a leading student of business cycles, suggests that our practice of looking at economic activity in ''real'' terms - that is, after the effect of inflation has been factored out - has in this instance provided a misleading and overly optimistic impression. Relying on a different technique of adjusting for inflation, Mr. Moore concludes that paying the import bill has reduced America's real purchasing power substantially more than official figures show.
Mr. Moore is director of the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Rutgers University. A one-time Commissioner of Labor Statistics, he is also former director of business cycle studies at the National Bureau of Economic Research, the research organization widely relied on to ''keep score'' on the cycles of recession and recovery.
Q. Why do you think that the rise in oil prices was even more of a drag on the economy than we realize?
A. Import prices have gone up a lot faster than export prices. As the trade balance is now measured, after it is deflated for price increases, no account is taken of that difference in rates. It means, however, that we need more dollars to pay for imports, and thus that we lose some real purchasing power. That loss of purchasing power isn't reflected in gross national product figures at all. In short, the way the trade balance is now measured has tended to reduce the inflation rate - it makes inflation appear lower, and real growth appear greater, than the way I'm suggesting.
Q. But why wouldn't the more expensive oil and its impact on the economy already be taken into account in our measures of trade and G.N.P.?
A. If we look at gross national product both in terms of current dollars and in terms of ''deflated'' dollars - that is, after the effect of inflation is removed - we see that for nearly every component, the deflated numbers naturally don't go up as fast as the undeflated numbers.
But when it comes to the trade surplus, just the opposite occurs. It turns out that since OPEC came on board, the increase in the trade surplus has been much larger in deflated dollars than it has been in current dollars.
In simple terms, we don't deflate imports and exports by the same yardstick. The way we handle it is that first we deflate exports and then we deflate imports by their respective prices. The net balance - which is what we call the trade surplus or deficit - is simply the difference between the deflated numbers. Since OPEC, however, import prices, including oil, have gone up much faster than export prices. That produces a balance, adjusted for inflation, that goes up a lot faster than the current dollar balance. This means that in ''real'' terms, the net drain on the economy appears to be smaller, rather than larger.
Q. What would you do differently? How do you avoid using different yardsticks?
A. One possibility is to deflate exports and imports by the same measure, an index based on other prices in the economy. That is, take the G.N.P. deflator and calculate it for everything except the trade balance. Then you have a general price deflator that covers 90 or almost 100 percent of the economy. If you use that to deflate the trade balance, it makes a very substantial difference in G.N.P. - real G.N.P. - and even the way price indexes behave.
Particularly in 1979, if you use this method of deflation, there is virtually no increase in real G.N.P. the whole year. Up until the first quarter of 1980, economic activity is just about flat. That would indicate that we had much more of a slowdown than we thought we experienced in that period.
Q. So your point is that, in this light, the economy in truth was more stagnant than we have been led to believe?
A. Exactly. By taking account of the fact that we have to export a lot more dollars' worth of commodities to pay for imports from OPEC, real G.N.P. is lower.
Q. What about after the first quarter of 1980? A. We've had a pretty brisk recovery since the summer of last year. If that continues, and doesn't get seriously interrupted with a downturn, then I would say the trough of the business cycle was probably reached in August. My own view is that a downturn is not going to happen. We may have a dip or a slower increase in the real economy, but it is not likely to bring us down to where we were last summer.
Q. If we are in the midst of an economic expansion, shouldn't we be seeing increases in productivity rather than declines?
A. Yes. Indeed that is one of the depressing factors in the economy. But no one really seems to have a good idea as to what the cause of the slowdown in productivity is or why it is so drastic.

Abstract: PRESIDENT REAGAN will lay out his economic plan for stopping inflation and revitalizing the American economy tonight. The American people, according to the White House press secretary, James S. Brady, will be told they have ''no choice'' but to support ''our plan.'' - Cuts in business and personal income taxes. The President has been trimming his tax-cut proposals to avoid worsening future budget deficits. He will delay the start of the first year's installment of three annual 10 percent tax cuts until July 1 and shave proposed tax cuts for upper-income taxpayers. But he has apparently decided to make depreciation write-offs for business investment more generous, substituting a modified version of the 10-5-3 plan for the Senate Finance Committee plan that would have shortened the ''useful lives'' of plant and equipment by about 40 percent. Under the new Reagan plan, in which write-offs would be phased in over five years retroactive to Jan. 1, 1981, plants, warehouses and other nonresidential buildings could be written off in 10 years and residential properties in 15 to 18 years; new machinery could be written off in five years and vehicles in three years. The President seems to have bought the arguments of those who wanted the tax-cut package weighted more heavily toward productivity-increasing investments. Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says that ''the standard Keynesian model will not get the results on economic growth or bringing down the rate of inflation that we are showing'' by using ''a supply-side model.''

Full text: PRESIDENT REAGAN will lay out his economic plan for stopping inflation and revitalizing the American economy tonight. The American people, according to the White House press secretary, James S. Brady, will be told they have ''no choice'' but to support ''our plan.''
The White House has mounted the biggest public relations campaign in memory to sell an economic program - replete with briefing sessions for influential legislators, businessmen and news media representatives, television appearances by Cabinet officers and economic aides and masses of data to augment the President's own message.
Indeed, so huge is the publicity blitz that Mr. Brady has begun to worry about overkill. ''We don't want to turn this into a MEGO - My Eyes Glaze Over,'' he said.
But boredom would appear to be the last thing the Administration has to worry about. Virtually everyone is opposed to some specific aspects of the President's program - including the leaders of organized labor; dairy farmers; the medical profession; urban mayors; blacks; people on welfare; champions of the arts, the humanities, the sciences and social sciences; environmentalists; the Pentagon; the poor and the near-poor who are afraid of losing their food stamps or jobs or unemployment compensation, and the rich and near-rich who have been hoping for bigger and prompter tax cuts on their earned or unearned income.
The plan has four major elements, much of which has already leaked:
- Reductions in Federal spending. President Reagan will propose budget cuts of $13.5 billion in the current fiscal year, chops as high as $53 billion in the fiscal year 1982, about $80 billion in the fiscal 1983 and an average of $130 billion in the fiscal years 1984 through 1986. These cuts are even larger than Mr. Reagan proposed during the election campaign. Some observers attribute the depth of the proposed cuts to the zealotry of David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget. Others believe that the President wanted to confront the nation with the biggest possible shopping list of budget cuts, which could be used for bargaining with Congress. The huge proposed spending cuts will also enable the President to look more fiscally responsible as he moves slowly toward a balanced budget.
- Cuts in business and personal income taxes. The President has been trimming his tax-cut proposals to avoid worsening future budget deficits. He will delay the start of the first year's installment of three annual 10 percent tax cuts until July 1 and shave proposed tax cuts for upper-income taxpayers. But he has apparently decided to make depreciation write-offs for business investment more generous, substituting a modified version of the 10-5-3 plan for the Senate Finance Committee plan that would have shortened the ''useful lives'' of plant and equipment by about 40 percent. Under the new Reagan plan, in which write-offs would be phased in over five years retroactive to Jan. 1, 1981, plants, warehouses and other nonresidential buildings could be written off in 10 years and residential properties in 15 to 18 years; new machinery could be written off in five years and vehicles in three years. The President seems to have bought the arguments of those who wanted the tax-cut package weighted more heavily toward productivity-increasing investments.
- Deregulation and regulatory reform. The President has already started down this path with the decontrol of oil and gasoline prices ahead of former President Jimmy Carter's schedule. The jump in gasoline prices, despite reports of gluts in supply, has exceeded the Administration's expectations and may, paradoxically, help build support for his anti-inflation budget cuts. Some of the effort to cut regulation will take the form of chopping funds and personnel of the regulatory agencies.
- Stabilization of the country's monetary system. The cutting edge of the Administration's anti-inflation program still appears to be the monetary restraints administered by the Federal Reserve. High interest rates seem likely to persist despite widespread howls of anguish.
Reaganomics is emerging as a blend of supply-side radicalism and demand-side conservatism; the danger is that the economy will garner neither the dynamic expansion promised by the supply-siders nor the anti-inflationary impact promised by the old-line conservatives, budget balancers and monetarists.
Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, says that ''the standard Keynesian model will not get the results on economic growth or bringing down the rate of inflation that we are showing'' by using ''a supply-side model.''
Whether the public, business, the stock market or the economics fraternity will accept the new supply-side model or reject it remains to be seen. Certainly, the big battles over the ultimate shape of President Reagan's anti-inflation and revitalization program lie ahead, in Congress and in the nation.

Abstract: Although some of the simpler notions that associate inflation with real income loss are wrong, high and rising rates of inflation do indeed weaken the nation's macroeconomic performance. Inflation can contribute to slower growth in productivity by discouraging investment in two ways. First, some evidence suggests that when inflation increases, not only do people's expectations of future inflation rise, but their expectations tend to become much more uncertain. Innovative investments and other higher-risk economic activities, the seedbeds of future productivity growth, seem even riskier and are less likely to be undertaken. Meanwhile, businesses and households devote increasing effort to shielding themselves from the effects of inflation, often by speculating in nonproductive assets. Second, the interaction between inflation and the tax system can indirectly discourage business investment decisions and result in a less productive capital stock. One of the major lessons that emerges repeatedly is the need for understanding, by the public generally and the financial community in particular, of the complxities of monetary policy. Monetary targeting provides an invaluable tool to increase monetary discipline, to communicate Federal Reserve intentions, and to evaluate performance. But the advantages of a semiautomatic rule to guide the monetary authorities are not absolute. In a world where economic and financial markets are subject to major and unpredictable changes, deviations from the Federal Reserve's announced intention to reduce steadily the annual target ranges may sometimes be necessary. Targets, once set, may occasinally have to be modified. And allowing short-run deviations of actual from targeted money growth may be called for if care is taken not to let them persist. But if the public interprets occasional necessary changes in the longer-run monetary target ranges, or short-run deviations of actual money growth from those targets, as evidence that the Federal Reserve has lessened its determination to fight inflation, the monetary authorities will be put in an untenable position. If they fail to make the adjustment in the monetary targets that is called for by a major change in economic circumstances, or if they attempt to avoid all short-run deviations of actual from targeted money growth, monetary policy may produce unwanted results. If, on the other hand, they do change the targets or allow temporary deviations, their actions may be misunderstood by the public and their credibility consequently impaired. The monetary authorities will face this problem once again in 1981. Incomes Policies Even if they are followed with persistence and acquire a credibility that favorably affects expectations, monetary and fiscal restraints are likely to reduce inflation only slowly and at signifcant cost in lost output and employment. Incomes policies attempt to lower these costs. By directly influencing the setting of wages and prices, incomes policies seek to decrease the inflation and increase the growth of output and employment that result from any given degree of demand restraint. A tight monetary target, for example, is compatible either with a small reduction in inflation and zero economic growth or a larger reduction in inflation and positive economic growth. By persuading workers and employers to accept lower pay and price increases, an incomes policy tries to make the second combination possible.

Full text: Following are excerpts from Chapter 1 of the Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers, released today: In the 1980's, the United States will confront a variety of stubborn problems that have developed during the past 15 years. Chief among these problems is one that is shared by most other industrial countries - the persistence of large wage and price increases, even in the face of high unemployment and slack production. This problem poses the single most important challenge to U.S. economic policy - reducing inflation while maintaining a reasonably prosperous and growing economy.
While the magnitude of these economic challenges is cause for serious concern, it does not warrant pessimism. During the 1970's the U.S. economy performed quite well in many important respects. Over that decade our country outperformed most other major countries in providing jobs for its people. Employment grew almost 25 percent as the American economy created jobs not only for millions of youths entering the labor market for the first time but also for millions of women, who found job opportunities in growing numbers. This performance continued through the last years of the decade at an increased pace. While the growth in the number of employed persons was temporarily interrupted by the recession of 1980, the basic performance was virtually unparalleled.
Inflation
The nation has for some time now experienced inflation that would have been unimaginable in earlier days. Although people's lives and the course of business may not, at first glance, appear radically different from what they were in 1960 before the recent inflation began, inflation has taken a very real toll. The uncertainty it has brought with it cannot be measured, but the consequent anxiety has torn at the fabric of our society.
Rising prices, it should be remembered, are not in the aggregate synonymous with a reduction in real income. When prices rise, someone receives the additional revenues. And for the economy as a whole, rising prices have gone together with rising money incomes. But a wage or salary increase comes infrequently and in a large lump, while prices tend to increase all the time. Furthermore, a pay increase may be viewed as uncertain and as a reward for effort, but price increases seem entirely beyond a consumer's control. As a result, a recent wage increase may be forgotten when the grocery bill rises. Thus rising prices are often treated as something that directly lower real incomes, even when in fact for the nation as a whole they do not. Of course, the resulting anxiety is no less real.
But when the country pays sharply higher prices to foreign oil producers, that does indeed lower its real income. We are poorer because we receive less oil than we did previously for the same amount of money. That would be true whether or not general inflation followed increases in the price of oil. The induced inflation, in the form of generally higher wages, salaries and prices, is not the cause of the real income decline - the nation's higher oil bill is.
A similar phenomenon occurs when growth in productivity slows. Slower productivity growth leads to a slower rise in real incomes. A decline in productivity growth may be accompanied by an unchanged pace of wage and salary increases, in which case inflation will rise. But a slackening of productivity growth may also result in lower wage increases and an unchanged inflation rate. In either case the same slowdown in the growth of real income would have occurred. It was not caused by inflation.
Although some of the simpler notions that associate inflation with real income loss are wrong, high and rising rates of inflation do indeed weaken the nation's macroeconomic performance. Inflation can contribute to slower growth in productivity by discouraging investment in two ways. First, some evidence suggests that when inflation increases, not only do people's expectations of future inflation rise, but their expectations tend to become much more uncertain. Innovative investments and other higher-risk economic activities, the seedbeds of future productivity growth, seem even riskier and are less likely to be undertaken. Meanwhile, businesses and households devote increasing effort to shielding themselves from the effects of inflation, often by speculating in nonproductive assets. Second, the interaction between inflation and the tax system can indirectly discourage business investment decisions and result in a less productive capital stock.
In a market economy, the structure of relative prices and costs, and the yardstick of business profits, provide signals to businesses about what to produce, what inputs to buy, and when to buy them. The system responds to changes in those signals. But in a period of high inflation, with a consequent increase in uncertainty, it is much more difficult to distinguish signals from random events. As a consequence, it is easier to make wrong decisions. Inefficiencies grow, and productivity falls.
The uncertainty created by inflation also obstructs the conduct of economic policy. To the extent that high and rising inflation unhinges expectations from reality, the connection between economic policies and their results is attenuated, and the difficulties of policy-making are increased.
Uncertainty is in large part to blame for the damage done by inflation. In addition to causing serious worry among individuals planning their economic futures, uncertainty interferes with the efficient operation of markets and thereby lowers the productive potential of the economy. Monetary Policy
One of the major lessons that emerges repeatedly is the need for understanding, by the public generally and the financial community in particular, of the complxities of monetary policy. Monetary targeting provides an invaluable tool to increase monetary discipline, to communicate Federal Reserve intentions, and to evaluate performance. But the advantages of a semiautomatic rule to guide the monetary authorities are not absolute. In a world where economic and financial markets are subject to major and unpredictable changes, deviations from the Federal Reserve's announced intention to reduce steadily the annual target ranges may sometimes be necessary. Targets, once set, may occasinally have to be modified. And allowing short-run deviations of actual from targeted money growth may be called for if care is taken not to let them persist. But if the public interprets occasional necessary changes in the longer-run monetary target ranges, or short-run deviations of actual money growth from those targets, as evidence that the Federal Reserve has lessened its determination to fight inflation, the monetary authorities will be put in an untenable position. If they fail to make the adjustment in the monetary targets that is called for by a major change in economic circumstances, or if they attempt to avoid all short-run deviations of actual from targeted money growth, monetary policy may produce unwanted results. If, on the other hand, they do change the targets or allow temporary deviations, their actions may be misunderstood by the public and their credibility consequently impaired. The monetary authorities will face this problem once again in 1981. Incomes Policies
Even if they are followed with persistence and acquire a credibility that favorably affects expectations, monetary and fiscal restraints are likely to reduce inflation only slowly and at signifcant cost in lost output and employment. Incomes policies attempt to lower these costs. By directly influencing the setting of wages and prices, incomes policies seek to decrease the inflation and increase the growth of output and employment that result from any given degree of demand restraint. A tight monetary target, for example, is compatible either with a small reduction in inflation and zero economic growth or a larger reduction in inflation and positive economic growth. By persuading workers and employers to accept lower pay and price increases, an incomes policy tries to make the second combination possible.
Incomes policies range from the informal pressure on a few large corporations and unions exerted by the Kennedy Administration to the formal review of price and wage increases by the Council on Wage and Price Stability to even more formal schemes based on the tax system.
An effective incomes policy encourages various groups in society to accept lower wages and prices for the goods and services they supply in the expectation that the wages and prices they pay will also be lower.
To have a lasting influence on inflation, an incomes policy must do more than lower the current rate of increase in wages and prices. It must also lower expectations about the future rate of inflation. Workers must believe that they can achieve their real wage demands with lower nominal wage gains, and firms must believe that large nominal wage gains or other cost increases will be hard to pass on into prices.
Even more important, an incomes policy will have no hope of a lasting effect unless it is accompanied by monetary and fiscal restraint.
This Administration has judged the benefits of a relatively flexible and voluntary incomes policy to be significantly greater than its costs.
For the past two years the Administration's incomes policy has centered on the voluntary pay and price standards. Although the standards were voluntary and were in place during the difficult period of the 1979 OPEC oil price explosion, they appear to have played a role in moderating inflation. Studies by the Council on Wage and Price Stability and the Council of Economic Advisers have estimated that annual wage increases were 1 to 1 1/2 percentage points lower during 1979 than they would have been without the standards. The consequent reductions in labor costs also appear to have been passed on to consumers through lower price increases. A more recent evaluation of the pay and price standards by the Council on Wage and Price Stability suggests that the program continued to have a moderating effect in the second year.
After two years of operation there seems to be general agreement that the current pay and price standards could not continue to be effective if simply extended in their present form. Workers and firms no longer appear to be willing to moderate wage and price rises in the expectation that the standards will restrain inflation. Tax-Based Incomes Policies
One way of strengthening a voluntary standards program would be to supplement it with a tax-based incomes policy, or a TIP. Such a policy would use the tax system to provide tangible incentives to firms and workers to slow the rate of inflation.
The most effective kind of TIP would be one that rewarded employees of firms whose rate of wage increase was below the standard. Such a program would significantly reinforce the spirit of cooperation used in other voluntary forms of incomes policies without creating as many distortions as a mandatory program. Firms and workers that agreed to moderate their price and wage increases would be making less of a sacrifice under a TIP than under other voluntary programs. And in sectors of the economy in which relative prices and wages were too low, a TIP would allow adjustments. The most serious distortions in relative prices and wages that develop under mandatory controls would be avoided under a TIP. Taxes
An analysis of the macroeconomic effects of Federal tax reductions suggests several conclusions for the development of fiscal policy: First, specific investment-oriented tax reductions for business are likely to increase saving investment, and productivity by a much more significant degree than cuts in personal income taxes.
Second, productivity-oriented tax reductions will yield improvements in the inflation rate that are helpful and significant, but still relatively modest in the context of a 10 percent underlying inflation rate.
Third, the supply response, while a critically important feature of any tax reduction, will be substantially less than the demand response, particularly in the short run.
Fourth, since reductions in both business and personal taxes will increase demand faster than supply, they must be designed and carried out in ways that are consistent with the demand restraint needed to reduce inflation.
It is sometimes alleged that the potentially inflationary effects of a large tax cut can be avoided if the Federal Reserve steadfastly pursues its goal of keeping the growth of the monetary aggregates within tight targets. But if taxes ar reduced while the Federal Reserve pursues an unchanged monetary policy, aggregate demand will nevertheless increase, especially in the short run. The increase in demand would lead to a rise in interest rates that would dampen the increase in aggregate demand but not eliminte it. Additional inflationary pressure would then result.
A very large tax cut unaccompanied by the necessary spending cuts would lead to both an increase in inflation and a sharp rise in interest rates. Some, and perhaps all, of the stimulus to investment from tax reductions would be undone by the higher interest rates and the greater uncertainty engendered by a new round of inflation.
Monetary restraint is an absolutely essential element of inflation control and reduction. Tax measures focused on increasing supply can make a significant contribution. But there will be a continuing need for careful and prudent fiscal policies to restrain demand. In recent years the nation has come to appreciate the potential value of supply-oriented tax policies. In the process of learning some needed lessons about supply-side economics, however, the nation cannot afford to forget its hard-learned lessons about the need for demandside restraint.

Abstract: ''Although the situation in Poland has shown signs of stabilizing recently,'' he wrote, ''Soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness, and they could move into Poland on short notice.'' He added that Moscow had been advised that such a move would have ''severe and prolonged consequences for East-West detente, and for United States-Soviet relations in particular.'' In a preamble to the message, Mr. [Carter] declared that the State of the Union was sound. ''Our economy is recovering from a recession,'' he wrote, ''a national energy plan is in place and our dependence on foreign oil is decreasing. We have been at peace for four uninterrupted years.'' The nation, Mr. Carter contended, is ''stronger, wealthier, more compassionate and freer than it was four years ago.'' But he noted, ''There are trouble spots throughout the world and 53 American hostages are being held in Iran against international law and against every precept of human affairs.'' The reference to 53, instead of 52 hostages, was apparently a slip of the tongue.

Full text: President Carter, in a final State of the Union Message to Congress, warned today that the United States confronted ''serious problems,'' including unemployment and inflation rates that are ''unacceptably high'' and an increasingly tight world oil market.
In a 76-page written message summarizing the achievements of his Administration and the policies it would have pursued in a second term, Mr. Carter drew Excerpts from message, page 10. attention to what he sees as a continuing Soviet threat to the integrity of Poland.
''Although the situation in Poland has shown signs of stabilizing recently,'' he wrote, ''Soviet forces remain in a high state of readiness, and they could move into Poland on short notice.'' He added that Moscow had been advised that such a move would have ''severe and prolonged consequences for East-West detente, and for United States-Soviet relations in particular.''
Administration officials have said privately that they were convinced the Soviet Union was about to intervene in Poland in early December and was deterred at the last minute by concerted warnings from the Atlantic Alliance. Nonetheless, they still believe an invasion by Soviet forces remains a high probability.
In normal years, the State of the Union Message is a major occasion. The President usually presents his summary in person before a joint session of Congress. This year, however, with President Carter in his last days in office and President-elect Ronald Reagan already in Washington in anticipation of his inauguration next Tuesday, it was a much-diminished event.
The text of the message was released by the White House late today after Mr. Carter left for his final weekend as President at Camp David, Md. Its release was accompanied by a desultory briefing about its contents by Stuart E. Eizenstat, the domestic affairs adviser, and David L. Aaron, deputy assistant for national security affairs.
In a preamble to the message, Mr. Carter declared that the State of the Union was sound. ''Our economy is recovering from a recession,'' he wrote, ''a national energy plan is in place and our dependence on foreign oil is decreasing. We have been at peace for four uninterrupted years.''
The nation, Mr. Carter contended, is ''stronger, wealthier, more compassionate and freer than it was four years ago.'' But he noted, ''There are trouble spots throughout the world and 53 American hostages are being held in Iran against international law and against every precept of human affairs.'' The reference to 53, instead of 52 hostages, was apparently a slip of the tongue.
Shortly before the message was released, Jody Powell, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the Administration was hopeful about the chances of resolving the hostage crisis as early as this weekend.
Turning to Latin America, Mr. Carter observed that the future of Nicaragua after its recent revolution was unclear. ''Recent tensions, the restrictions on the press and political activity, an inordinate Cuban presence cause us considerable concern,'' he wrote. Nonetheless, Mr. Carter called for continuing support for democratic elements in both Nicaragua and El Salvador.
On nuclear arms control, Mr. Carter said he remained convinced that the strategic arms limitation agreement his Administration negotiated with the Soviet Union was in the best interests of the nation and should be ratified.
In the domestic field, Mr. Carter ticked off a long list of accomplishments, from energy legislation to Civil Service reform. Nine million new jobs have been created in the last four years, he said, and the growth of small and minority-owned businesses strengthened.
In his section on the economy, Mr. Carter conceded that his efforts to curb inflation had been inadequate despite the recession in 1980. As a result, he said he was asking Congress to postpone until Jan. 1, 1982, the personal tax reductions he had proposed to take effect on Jan. 1 of this year.

COMMENT; GOLD AT $10,000; by Robert A. Mundell

Abstract: This disastrous inflation will provoke a reaction in Washington: controls, strong-armed government and perhaps dictatorship. As usual, the government will confuse symptom with cause, and probably forget that inflation's origin lies in the breakdown of the gold standard and the lack of constraints on money creation by the Federal Reserve System, the greatest engine of inflation ever created by man. The stability of prices under the gold standard rested upon control of the global quantity of money. Under a pure gold standard, a central bank would sell gold for old currency when its balance of payments was in deficit and its currency was weak on the exchanges, thus contracting the supply of currency. Similarly, when its balance of payments was in surplus and its currency was strong, it bought gold with new currency, thus expanding the supply of national currency and preventing undue appreciation on the exchanges. When Europe began to fear a dollar devaluation and asked for gold, Mr. [Richard M. Nixon] was provided the excuse for suspending convertibility. In short, in the 1970's, money became an elastic and accommodating factor, no longer held in check by an impersonal, neutral force. Thus when oil prices quadrupled in 1973-74, the result was inflationary finance in the Eurodollar market and by the Federal Reserve.

Full text: Ronald Reagan, early in his Presidential campaign, called for a return to the gold standard. While he since has cooled in his support, many close to him have not. Robert A. Mundell, a professor of economics at Columbia University and an adviser to the Reagan camp, argues for the standard.
A T current rates of inflation, the dollar price of an ounce of gold will push into the $5,000 to $10,000 range within a generation and consumer prices generally will double every five to 10 years in the United States.
This disastrous inflation will provoke a reaction in Washington: controls, strong-armed government and perhaps dictatorship. As usual, the government will confuse symptom with cause, and probably forget that inflation's origin lies in the breakdown of the gold standard and the lack of constraints on money creation by the Federal Reserve System, the greatest engine of inflation ever created by man.
Since Roman times, at least one currency had been linked to gold, and there had always been a link between the supply of money and the price of commodities. But on Aug. 15, 1971, Richard M. Nixon suspended gold convertibility. Monetary restraint then rested only on the limits self-imposed by central bankers and their political bosses, a flimsy reed on which to base monetary stability.
The stability of prices under the gold standard rested upon control of the global quantity of money. Under a pure gold standard, a central bank would sell gold for old currency when its balance of payments was in deficit and its currency was weak on the exchanges, thus contracting the supply of currency. Similarly, when its balance of payments was in surplus and its currency was strong, it bought gold with new currency, thus expanding the supply of national currency and preventing undue appreciation on the exchanges.
When several countries were on the gold standard, the contractions and expansions balanced out. There would be no significant change in global spending and therefore no systematic tendency for deflation or inflation in the world as a whole.
This is not to say that fluctuations in the world price level could not occur. They could and did. The Californian and Australian gold discoveries in the middle of the 19th century, for example, expanded supplies and led to two decades of mild inflation. Conversely, a general movement of rich countries onto the gold standard after 1870, expanding demand, led to deflation.
But the drifts in the gold price level were mild, and since they offset one another, there was long-run stability. The most important monetary event of the 20th century was the creation of a United States central bank, the Federal Reserve System, at the outbreak of World War I. This system enabled Washington to engage in deficit finance on an unprecedented scale, and because the United States was rapidly becoming the superpower replacing Britain, it had global ramifications.
Meanwhile, the gold exchange standard was developed, under which foreign exchange, notably the British pound, was widely used in lieu of gold in the national reserves of major countries. This was risky, as was shown when Britain went off gold and the pound fell in 1931. Pressure then shifted to the dollar and the United States, instead of devaluing, accepted deflation, unemployment and the Depression. Economists blamed the gold standard.
A solution, in hindsight, would have been for all countries to lower the gold parities of their currencies; i.e., raise the price of gold. But that remedy was outside the intellectual framework of the time. But as more countries went off the gold standard, the market accomplished what no statesman contemplated. The United States resumed convertibility in 1934 at a price of $35 an ounce, up from the pre-war $20.67.
But now World War II created a new credit inflation, and with the great devaluations in 1949, followed by the Korean War dollar inflation, gold again became scarce at $35.
In 1954, the London gold market opened, unifying the official and private market gold prices. In 1968, the unified price was abandoned, and the free market headed up again, slowly at first but with increasing momentum with money expansion in the United States and overseas, via the mushrooming Eurodollar market.
The undervalued gold held by central banks ceased to be traded systematically in balance of payments settlements and effective global monetary reserves were thus cut by this amount.
For a time other central banks were willing to replace their immobilized gold with dollars, which were being generously supplied via United States payments deficits. But an overhang developed during the 1970-71 recession when, despite low interest rates and capital flooding abroad, the Federal Reserve gunned the money supply.
When Europe began to fear a dollar devaluation and asked for gold, Mr. Nixon was provided the excuse for suspending convertibility. In short, in the 1970's, money became an elastic and accommodating factor, no longer held in check by an impersonal, neutral force. Thus when oil prices quadrupled in 1973-74, the result was inflationary finance in the Eurodollar market and by the Federal Reserve.
The international gold standard has acted in the past as a catalyst for peace and order and can do so again. Whatever Administration comes to power after the November elections should make a return to it the major task of the 1980's. Democracy will not survive galloping inflation.
