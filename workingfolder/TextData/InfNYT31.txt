Full text:   MITT ROMNEY, moderate. That earnestly sought post-debate public image contrasts starkly with Mr. Romney's actual positions on many issues, especially the future trajectory of government spending.
Clinging tightly to a studied vagueness when pressed for unpopular specifics, Mr. Romney has put forward a budget framework that would not eviscerate Medicare and Social Security, as is commonly believed, but would slash everything else that's not defense.
President Obama should use Tuesday night's debate to press Mr. Romney to defend -- or even just explain -- these proposed cuts, which would be far more draconian than those advanced by his running mate, Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Ryan is widely viewed as the real fiscal hawk, but in key areas, his views on spending levels are actually closer to Mr. Obama's than to Mr. Romney's.
All in all, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney do see the future similarly -- over the next decade, they want government spending reduced to about 20 percent of the United States' gross domestic product, below the historic average of around 21 percent. (Recognizing that an aging society costs more, Mr. Obama proposes to hold spending at its current level, 23 percent.)
These differences may not sound like much, but by 2023, each percentage point of G.D.P. could represent about $250 billion in federal spending.
Though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. brought it up repeatedly in his debate with Mr. Ryan on Thursday, Social Security -- the single biggest government expenditure -- is not on the battlefield. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have each backed away from threats to privatize or cut it and now propose to spend the same amount on it as Mr. Obama would in the coming decade.
That's not the case with Medicare. Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan have each endorsed similar packages of about $950 billion of savings over 10 years, while Mr. Romney has opposed any reduction, making it virtually impossible for him to achieve his overall spending limit.
To be sure, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan agree -- and differ with Mr. Obama -- on many matters, like how to contain the growth in Medicare spending and whether to raise the eligibility age.
And they part company from Mr. Obama when it comes to the Affordable Care Act (the Republicans demand its repeal, claiming it would save about $1.6 trillion) and Medicaid (Messrs. Romney and Ryan want it turned over to the states and want to cut nearly 20 percent from Mr. Obama's planned levels).
But with respect to nearly half the budget, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan widely diverge from each other.
Mr. Romney is calling for a huge increase in defense spending -- roughly $2 trillion more over the next decade than Mr. Ryan wants to spend, which is only $400 billion above Mr. Obama's budget -- even though the military is not asking for such an increase. Such an increase would force giant reductions, about 40 percent, in everything that's left.
"Everything else" isn't some catchall of small items, like feeding Big Bird. We're talking about a vast array of programs including civilian and military pensions, food stamps, unemployment and disability compensation, the earned income and child tax credits, family support and nutrition, K-12 education, transportation, public safety and disaster relief. And on and on.
All told, Mr. Romney would allocate $6.9 trillion for these items, compared with the $9.3 trillion proposed by his own running mate (and Mr. Obama's $12 trillion, which itself represents a 9 percent reduction from current levels, after adjusting for inflation).
No doubt some of what is buried within "other mandatory and nondefense discretionary spending" can be eliminated. Perhaps Americans won't miss a few national parks or the space program.
But also nestled within this category are critical outlays for investments in infrastructure and research.
Eating the seed corn is never advisable, yet that's what Washington is already doing. The share of spending on infrastructure (roads, airports, dams and the like) fell from 2 percent of G.D.P. in 1971 to 1 percent in 2010.
More -- not less -- government money needs to be invested in these kinds of growth-generating projects (not to mention education and training).
I recognize that in the real world, cuts on the scale envisioned by Mr. Romney will prove politically untenable, which would force a President Romney to rethink his agenda.
But as a statement of intent, it's Mr. Romney -- not Mr. Ryan -- who has produced the budget that would more dramatically reduce the services offered by government, and in ways that would shock and outrage most Americans. We can only hope that Mr. Obama will draw those contrasts clearly in the debate.

Full text:   AUDI says the introduction of a new Allroad wagon for the American market, after an eight-year absence, signifies the "return of the icon."
When the original model was withdrawn from the United States after the 2005 model year, it seemed less like an icon than a sales disappointment -- some 26,000 were sold over four years, well below initial estimates. But Audi now considers the first Allroad "quite the success, for its day, for not being an S.U.V.," a company spokesman, Mark Dahncke, said last week.
Audi wagons are quite popular in Europe, and the Allroad continued to sell well there even after it became an orphan over here. Surviving Allroads still have a devoted following in the United States, selling even now at five-figure prices.
The original car's $40,000 sticker price seemed steep in the early 2000s, and that is surely one reason it didn't sell better. The handsome new Allroad is still around $40,000 -- $39,600 and a $875 delivery fee, to be exact. At a glance, given the inflation in German luxury cars of late, such a price seems more palatable than it did a decade ago. But unlike its predecessor, which came pretty well equipped in basic trim, the new Allroad's window sticker can easily zoom higher. The top-line Prestige trim package adds $9,200 by itself, and Audi offers many, many more options.
But one deal-making feature is not available, even as an option: a height-adjustable pneumatic suspension that raised the original model 2.6 inches for additional ground clearance when off-roading or storming through snow drifts. The air suspension is one of the features that made the Allroad more than a station wagon.
So the new Allroad's ground clearance is a rather modest 7.1 inches, just 1.5 inches more than the A4 Avant wagon it replaces. For comparison's sake, a Subaru Outback offers 8.7 inches. The Allroad does have a stainless steel skid plate, ostensibly to protect the underside from rocks, underbrush and other debris, but it seems more ornamental than utilitarian.
Most measurements are either the same, or about a half-inch greater, than the A4 Avant's. The dimensions are also similar to the 2001-5 Allroad, even though that wagon was based on the A6 of the time. Put simply, the A4 has a larger footprint now, as does the A6.
The Allroad offers the same 50 cubic feet of cargo capacity, with the rear seat folded, as the outgoing A4 Avant, but Audi says the space is more usable. The interior is thoroughly updated and quite plush; standard leather seating is an advantage over rivals like the Volvo XC70 or the BMW 328i xDrive Sports Wagon.
The Allroad shares the A4 Avant's 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder engine, which makes 211 horsepower and 256 pound-feet of peak torque. Mileage is rated 20 m.p.g. in the city and 27 on the highway on premium fuel (compared with 21/29 for the outgoing Avant). Audi says the Allroad will accelerate from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a sprightly 6.6 seconds.
On the road, the Allroad's ride height, extra weight and big 18-inch wheels and tires make it handle more like an S.U.V. and less like an Audi sedan. And while the ride is as butter-smooth as the Avant's, the Allroad can tackle a broader spectrum of light-duty driving challenges.
Still, it's no off-roader.
Most disappointingly, despite the capable quattro all-wheel-drive system, the Allroad is no longer equipped to scramble up rocky hillsides or bound through deeply rutted trails, or pull itself out of mud-bog gumbo like the original model. Audi does not even list performance measures like the towing capacity or the approach and departure angles -- matters of interest to off-roaders -- for the Allroad.
For more diabolical on- and off-road conditions, the far less expensive Outback may be a more capable choice.
When merely crunching numbers, there is a temptation to dismiss the Allroad as little more than an A4 Avant with skid plates, plastic cladding on the wheel arches and a $3,000 price bump.
But beyond the specifications, on a purely subjective basis, the well-proportioned, generally pleasing Allroad falls somewhere between the Avant station wagon and Audi's quite capable, less expensive Q5 sport utility. In that regard, it fills a niche in the lineup rather handsomely.

Full text:   Andrew F. Brimmer, a Louisiana sharecropper's son who was the first black member of the Federal Reserve Board and who led efforts to to reverse the country's balance-of-payments deficit, died on Sunday in Washington. He was 86.
His death, after a long illness, was confirmed by his daughter, Esther Brimmer.
Dr. Brimmer, an economist, held a number of high-ranking posts in Washington and taught at Harvard, but the economic conditions of poor, powerless, uneducated blacks was an abiding concern. He spoke about what he called the "schism" between blacks who were educated and had marketable skills and those who did not. In later years he spoke frequently about how government policies no longer supported programs to help blacks enter the economic mainstream.
Dr. Brimmer was the assistant secretary of commerce for economic affairs when President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to the Fed board in 1966.
At the time, the Federal Reserve was bitterly divided over monetary policy. The chairman, William McChesney Martin Jr., threatened to resign if Mr. Johnson appointed a liberal who would vote in favor of lower interest rates.
At Dr. Brimmer's swearing-in ceremony, the president said he did not expect Dr. Brimmer to be "an easy money man or a tight money man." Rather, Mr. Johnson said, "I expect him to be a right money man."
The Wall Street Journal expressed skepticism, with a front-page article headlined "Desire to Aid Negroes Could Make New 'Fed' Member More Liberal." It quoted an anonymous source saying that the appointment was yet another example of Mr. Johnson's political foxiness. "The president has Martin in a box," the source told The Journal. "If Martin resigned now, it would look like it was because he didn't want a Negro on the board."
Early in his tenure, Dr. Brimmer followed the lead of Mr. Martin and other "tight money" board members by supporting a gradual increase in interest rates to fight inflation. But when Congress raised taxes in 1968 and cut spending to cut inflation, he was one of the first Fed governors to call for lowering rates.
At the Commerce Department, Dr. Brimmer's primary responsibility was to reverse the country's balance-of-payments deficit. He spent a good deal of time persuading American businesses to voluntarily slow their use of dollars in foreign investments. He also encouraged foreign companies to use their own currency to make investments in the United States.
In a speech in December 1965, he reported that his efforts had resulted in a drop in direct American investments overseas, to $515 million in the third quarter of that year from $1.12 billion in the first quarter.
That work built on his interest in foreign affairs, which started when he went to India with the Fulbright Program and wrote papers on the Indian economy.
As a staff economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the late 1950s, he was part of a team that visited Sudan to explore the feasibility of a central bank there. He later wrote an article on banking and finance in Sudan for The South African Journal of Economics. He became known as the international monetary policy expert on the Federal Reserve Board.
Dr. Brimmer served a little more than eight years of his 14-year term, leaving the board in 1974 to join the faculty of the Harvard Business School and start a consulting firm, Brimmer & Company. His academic career also included study in India at the Delhi School of Economics and the University of Bombay.
In 1995, he was chosen to head a five-member financial control board to help the District of Columbia deal with a financial crisis. He stepped down after a contentious three years in the job.
Andrew Felton Brimmer Jr. was born on Sept. 13, 1926, in Newellton, La. After graduating from high school he went to Washington State, where one of his sisters lived. He joined the Army near the end of World War II and attained the rank of staff sergeant, remaining in the United States.
Besides his daughter, who is the assistant secretary for international organization affairs at the State Department, he is survived by his wife, Doris Scott Brimmer.
Dr. Brimmer attended the University of Washington in Seattle on the G.I. Bill of Rights, earning an undergraduate degree in economics in 1950 and a master's degree the next year.
He then went to India before attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, where he earned a doctorate. In 1965, Dr. Brimmer was part of a federal delegation sent to Los Angeles after rioting in the Watts neighborhood left 34 people dead and tens of millions of dollars in property damage. He commissioned a Census Bureau study that found that the purchasing power of the average family in Watts had declined by $400 in the five years before the riots while incomes had risen in the rest of America.
"I do feel that the economic plight of blacks is a serious matter," he told The New York Times in 1973. "So I bring the same economist's tool kit to that subject as other economists bring to examine other national economic problems."

West Is Foolish to Celebrate Iran's Currency Crisis, Ayatollah Says

Full text:   Iran's supreme leader spoke out publicly for the first time on Wednesday about the country's foreign-exchange problems, describing the mass protest in Tehran last week over the plummeting Iranian currency as an anomaly that the West had gleefully but foolishly misinterpreted as a harbinger of crisis.
In a speech reported by Iranian news services, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also exhorted Iranians not to fear the intensifying regimen of Western sanctions over Iran's disputed nuclear program. Many outside economists have said the sanctions -- which have targeted Iran's oil and banking sectors -- have played an important role in weakening the rial, the national currency.
The rial has lost roughly 40 percent of its value against the dollar this month and is down 80 percent against the dollar for the year.
"The issue of sanctions is not a new issue and has existed since the victory of the Islamic Revolution," the ayatollah said in his speech in North Khorasan Province. "But the enemies are making efforts to blow the issue of sanctions out of proportion, and, unfortunately, certain people inside are assisting them."
The remarks by Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final word on affairs of state, appeared to reinforce his policy of absolute defiance in the face of Western pressure, and offered a hint that some officials in Iran are ambivalent about that strategy.
The ayatollah has long insisted that sanctions would never force Iran into suspending its uranium enrichment program, which Western nations suspect is a guise for developing nuclear weapons capacity. Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates contend that Iran is enriching uranium to produce energy and for medical purposes, and that sanctions are a form of economic warfare.
But it was not until Wednesday that he expressed an opinion about the Oct. 3 confrontation in Tehran between the police and Iranians trying to sell rials to black-market money traders for dollars and other foreign currencies. The panicky selling had been one of the most visible signs of worsening inflation and a lack of economic confidence.
The ensuing violence was said to lead to at least two dozen arrests and galvanized thousands to march to the capital's politically influential Grand Bazaar. Many of the merchants there closed for the day to express their anger over the rial's plummeting value.
The protest over the rial crisis was widely interpreted in the United States and Europe as signaling a profound new problem for the Iranian leadership, which has since cracked down on foreign-exchange speculators but does not appear to have a longer-term solution.
Ayatollah Khamenei said the protest was nothing more than a pretext to disturb the peace. "For about two or three hours, a number of people set some garbage cans on fire on two Tehran streets, and immediately officials of certain countries flouted diplomatic protocol and childishly expressed delight," he said.
Addressing Western countries, he said, "Your problems are much more complicated than Iran's problems because your economy has stagnated."
He dismissed Western leaders' suggestion that the sanctions would be eased if Iran agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment. "Now they claim that if the Iranian nation ignores its nuclear energy, the sanctions will be lifted," he said. "They are telling a lie. They make decisions against the Iranian nation due to their long-cherished hostility."

Full text:   Iran sought on Tuesday to rebut assertions that Western sanctions had paralyzed the Iranian economy and severely weakened the currency, pointing to new data from the International Monetary Fund forecasting an economic rebound and lower inflation in 2013.
The new data in the monetary fund's twice-yearly World Economic Outlook report came during a virtual news blackout in Iran about trading in its currency, the rial. This month, the rial plunged against the dollar in a wave of foreign-exchange selling by many Iranians who were worried that the value of their savings in rials was shriveling.
The Iranian authorities, which have called the currency plunge part of an economic war against the country by the United States and other Western powers, have since cracked down on black-market trading in the rial and have limited currency transactions to authorized dealers at artificially fixed rates.
The monetary fund report, released on Monday, projects that Iran's gross domestic product will shrink 0.9 percent this year but grow 0.8 percent next year. The data also project that Iran's inflation rate will fall to 21.8 percent next year from 25.2 percent this year.
Iran's official Press TV news Web site and semiofficial Fars News Agency seized on the data, saying they showed that the country was not only coping with the economic sanctions imposed on its oil and financial operations but was growing despite those obstacles. A Press TV headline said, "Iran will win battle against West sanctions: IMF."
A monetary fund spokeswoman, Wafa Amr, said it had calculated the Iran data before the Iranian currency plunged in value this month.
But even when accounting for that change, private economists said the monetary fund's report appeared to rely at least partly on what the Iran government considers the rial's valid exchange rate and the inflation rate in the country.
"I don't know what they're looking at, but they're not looking at the right things," said Steve H. Hanke, an economics professor and currency expert at Johns Hopkins University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, who has been following the rial's weakening against the dollar in black-market trading over the past few years as the Western sanctions have intensified.
"Things were getting worse, worse, worse, and the I.M.F. should have known," Mr. Hanke said.
By his calculations, Iran's inflation rate has skyrocketed to 196 percent because of the rial's diminished value, which has sharply increased the price of imports and other goods in Iran.
Other signs of increased economic isolation have emerged in recent days because of the sanctions, imposed to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. Iran says the program is for peaceful purposes, but Western nations suspect it is a guise to achieve nuclear weapons capability.
Denmark's Maersk Line, the world's largest shipping container company, said Tuesday that it was ending all port calls to Iran, having already suspended them for the most part. "This is a pragmatic decision based on an assessment of balancing the benefits of doing limited business in Iran against the risk of damaging business opportunities elsewhere, particularly the U.S.," Reuters quoted a Maersk spokeswoman as saying.

Full text:   In Thursday night's debate, Vice President Joe Biden will almost certainly go after Representative Paul Ryan's Medicare plan. And why shouldn't he? It's unpopular. But I'd like to make a case for that plan. It's the best thing the Romney-Ryan campaign has going for it.
First, let's define the problem. Today, Medicare costs about $550 billion. By 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, it will cost more than $1 trillion, sucking money away from every other government program.
According to the Urban Institute, the average couple in 2010 had paid $109,000 in Medicare taxes during their working years but would be able to receive about $343,000 in benefits. A chunk of that $234,000 gap will be paid for by their grandkids. That should weigh on the conscience of every American over 55. You're supposed to help your grandkids, not take from them.
Basically, there are two ways to reduce Medicare inflation, through the political system or through a market system. Obamacare tries the former. The current budget projections are so bad because almost no one outside the employ of the president believes this approach will reduce Medicare costs. Obama's primary cost-control instrument is an independent board of experts that Mitt Romney mentioned often in last week's debate. It's supposed to lower payment levels.
There are problems. It's hard for a few people in Washington to centrally rejigger something that complex. Second, the board is not really out of political control. Congress has already restricted its power and has devised gimmicky ways to overrule an unpopular decision. (All decisions to restrict benefits are unpopular.)
The history of Medicare is strewed with efforts to control costs by controlling prices. The results are terrible. Providers just increase the number of services, redefine the classification of services or find other ways to get their money back. A study by the Congressional Budget Office found that, between 1997 and 2005, Medicare payments for individual treatments fell by 5 percent, but the total spent on these services skyrocketed by 35 percent. Doctors made up in volume what they lost in reimbursement levels.
The second approach is to replace the fee-for-service system with more normal market incentives. Give recipients a choice among insurance options and have providers compete to offer comprehensive coverage like today's Medicare.
This idea has been floating around for a while, and it used to be popular in parts of the Democratic Party until the party swung left. Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, co-led a commission that promoted this idea in 1997. Bill Clinton floated a "managed competition" plan for Medicare late in his presidency. Democrat Alice Rivlin and Republican Pete Domenici have co-authored a premium support plan for the Bipartisan Policy Center.
Paul Ryan wrote his own version a few years ago and has come up with a more moderate version with Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat. Whenever you hear a Democrat say that Romney and Ryan would end Medicare or cost seniors $6,000, that is a misleading reference to the original Ryan plan, not anything on offer today. Today's Romney plan would not shift costs to seniors.
Would a market-based approach reduce costs? There are some reasons to think so. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that if Ryan-Wyden had been in place between 2006 and 2009, costs might have come down by around 9 percent with no reduction in benefits. Under a demonstration project in Denver in the 1990s, private plans bid 25 percent to 38 percent less than government-determined payment rates.
The Medicare drug benefit began in 2006 with a voucher approach. Costs have been about 30 percent below early estimates. A RAND Corporation study of consumer-directed high deductible plans found that when families had an incentive to monitor costs, they spent about 14 percent less.
Do these and other studies prove that market-based approaches would work? Absolutely not. In each case, the situation is complicated. Voucher plans may save money, but perhaps by shedding the sickest customers.
There are serious health economists who scoff at market-based strategies. Others just don't know. The leader of the Congressional Budget Office, Doug Elmendorf, candidly admitted at a Congressional hearing that his agency doesn't know how behavior would change under this sort of competition.
My bottom line is this: The status quo is cataclysmic. The national debt problem is a Medicare problem. The Democrats' price-control approach has little chance of working.
The Romney-Ryan approach might work. If it doesn't, the federal budget would suffer but seniors wouldn't. Today's seniors would be left untouched anyway, and tomorrow's would have the option of private plans or traditional Medicare. At worst, if the market approach flopped, we'd be back to where we started.
If we don't get Medicare right, there's no money for anything else. On this particular policy issue, the Republicans have the edge.

Full text:   CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Hugo Chávez followed his least convincing election victory -- a still powerful 55 percent of the vote -- with a phone call to his challenger on Monday and an appeal for national unity. But there appeared to be little prospect of concessions to the opposition, despite its relatively strong showing.
With 97 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Chávez won with 8 million votes, compared with 6.4 million votes and 44 percent for his rival, Henrique Capriles Radonski, the closest race since Mr. Chávez took office in 1999. In the last election, in 2006, Mr. Chávez won by 26 percent.
Both Mr. Chávez and Mr. Capriles mentioned the call in Twitter posts, referring to unity and mutual respect. That was something of a change, particularly for Mr. Chávez, who spent much of the campaign calling his opponent "good for nothing" or "little Yankee." In a news conference on Monday, Mr. Capriles' campaign manager, Armando Briquet, related that Mr. Capriles said of the call that Mr. Chávez had, for the first time, called him by his proper name.
But there was little indication of a warmer tone on display at a news conference held by the National Assembly president, Diosdado Cabello, a leader in Mr. Chávez's party, who called the vote for Mr. Chávez "a resounding majority."
"You hear some people now, the opposition, saying, you've got to recognize the six million-and-some who voted against the government," Mr. Cabello said. "Oh please! Don't forget about the eight million who voted for Chávez."
Mr. Chávez will start his new six-year term in January, after 14 years in power. But there is uncertainty about at least some of his direction.
On Sunday night, he said he planned to take the country farther down the road to his version of "21st century socialism" -- but he has yet to make clear what that means.
Analysts said it could include steps to extend state control further over portions of the economy, possibly through a new wave of expropriations of privately owned companies.
He is likely to increase emphasis on a system of thousands of so-called communes, community councils that are meant to encourage grass-roots democracy like the creation of communally run businesses. But Mr. Chávez may be hindered in the short term by a looming economic reckoning, which economists said could include a sharp cut in government spending, a devaluation of the currency, and an increase in inflation.
The government used a huge spending increase to boost the economy and consolidate support before the election, according to Ricardo Hausmann, the director of the Center for International Development at Harvard University. At the same time it used price controls and cheap imports to tamp down inflation.
"They engineered an electoral year boomlet that is now going to fizzle," said Mr. Hausmann, who supported Mr. Capriles. He predicted a recession that could bring political consequences. "I think there's going to be disappointment with Chávez fairly soon," he said.
Mr. Chávez's health is a major question. He has been fighting cancer, and his illness forced him to maintain a reduced schedule during the campaign. But he has refused to provide details about the cancer, including the type and where it was found. That has led to speculation that he may become too ill to govern and may eventually have to step down.
Mr. Chávez has built a highly centralized and personalized administration in which he makes most important decisions, and he commands near savior status among some supporters. That combination is unmatchable by anyone in his circle, complicating succession.
If a president dies or leaves office in the first four years of his term, the Constitution calls for a new election. In the event that Mr. Chávez's health deteriorated, that provision could offer the opposition another shot at the presidency.
Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, speculated that Mr. Chávez might propose changing the succession rules so that the vice president, who is selected by the president, serves out the remainder of a vacated presidency. If the opposition weakens from its defeat, the change might win the necessary popular approval.
"He can catch the opposition in a state of disarray and get that passed without much trouble and then he would control the succession issue," Mr. Rodríguez said.
At a news conference on Monday, Ramón Guillermo Aveledo, a leader of the opposition coalition that backed Mr. Capriles, called Sunday's election clean but not fair because, he said, Mr. Chávez had used vast state resources to promote his campaign.
Mr. Aveledo said the coalition looked forward to state governor elections in December. "The only risk for the opposition is to not keep going," he said.
What seems unlikely to change is Mr. Chávez's list of international detractors and supporters. Venezuela is a major oil supplier to the United States, but political relations are tense. Mr. Chávez criticizes the United States as an imperialist power bent on having its way in Latin America and elsewhere. On Monday, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, acknowledged "differences with President Chávez," but congratulated "the Venezuelan people" on a peaceful election.
Cuba offered a message of support for Mr. Chávez, who helps prop up the Cuban economy with cheap oil. President Raúl Castro congratulated Mr. Chávez in a message published in Granma, Cuba's state newspaper, saying his re-election showed the strength of his revolution "and its unquestionable popular support."

Full text:   After a summer in which the polling in the presidential race was exceptionally stable - withPresident Obama generally holding a lead of about two percentage points in national surveys - the numbers since the party conventions have been a wild ride.
Mr. Obama got a bounce coming out of Charlotte, and it had some staying power - with his national lead appearing to peak at about five or six percentage points. But polling released immediately after the debate seemed to suggest that Mr. Romney had drawn into a rough national tie.
By the weekend, however - after the release of a favorable jobs report last Friday - Mr. Romney's bounce seemed to be receding some. Tracking polls released on Monday by Gallup and Rasmussen Reports actually showed a shift back toward Mr. Obama, although another poll by Pew Research showed Mr. Romney with a four-point lead among likely voters.
Polling data is often very noisy, and not all polls use equally rigorous methodology. But the polls, as a whole, remain consistent with the idea that they may end up settling where they were before the conventions, with Mr. Obama ahead by about two points. Such an outcome would be in line with what history and the fundamentals of the economy would lead you to expect.
Because economic data can be as noisy as the polls, the FiveThirtyEight forecast model uses seven different economic statistics to calibrate its predictions. Some of these make a more favorable case for Mr. Obama than others. The stock market has shown very strong growth over the course of his term, especially in the past six months. Inflation has been low, although gas prices have sometimes been an exception. And the manufacturing sector of the economy has been reasonably sound.
G.D.P. growth, however, has been sluggish - and growth in take-home income has been worse, barely keeping up with population growth. Although consumer spending on some products like cars is up, a broader-based measure called personal consumption expenditures shows that Americans aren't spending all that much.
The one measure that has been closest to the consensus of the data, however, is jobs growth, as measured by the increase in nonfarm payrolls. (This should be distinguished from the unemployment rate, which is calculated through a separate survey and which is subject to a higher degree of statistical error.)
The economy has added an average of 146,000 jobs per month so far this year, according to the government's latest figures. That is slightly higher than the average gain in past election years. Since 1956, monthly job growth has averaged 135,000 in January through September.
However, because the population and the labor force are now larger than they once were, the economy needs to add more jobs to keep pace with it. As measured on a percentage basis, jobs have grown by 1.0 percentage points since December, slightly below the election-year average of 1.4 percent.
There are four election years - 1956, 1960, 2000 and 2004 - when jobs growth was broadly similar to the trend this year. The 1956 election serves as a reminder that the economy isn't everything:Dwight D. Eisenhower won in a landslide. But the 1960 and 2000 elections were virtual ties, whileGeorge W. Bush won by 2.5 percentage points in 2004.
A more systematic way to analyze the data is to chart the rate of jobs growth against the margin of victory or defeat for the incumbent party. If past trends hold, that analysis predicts a very narrow victory for Mr. Obama - by 2.1 percentage points over Mr. Romney, similar to Mr. Bush's margin of victory in 2004.
But the exact math is probably not as important as the broader conclusion: that the economy is line with Mr. Obama being a very modest favorite.
Had Mr. Obama been on track to win by five or six percentage points, then we could say that Mr. Romney was underperforming the fundamentals.
In Denver, however, Mr. Romney presented himself as an acceptable and competent alternative. Challengers also generally profit from the first debate: in 8 of the 10 election cycles since 1976, the polls moved against the incumbent, and a net gain of two or three percentage points for the challenger is a reasonably typical figure.
At the same time, incumbent presidents just aren't that easy to defeat. Mr. Obama's approval ratings are now hovering around 50 percent and don't seem to have been negatively affected by his performance in Denver. Although Mr. Obama's approval ratings may be slightly lower among those most likely to vote - meaning that Mr. Romney could win with a strong turnout - historically that number has been just good enough to re-elect an incumbent. (Mr. Bush's approval ratings were in the same range late in 2004.)
In some ways, then, the election might not be quite so unpredictable as it appears. There was reason to believe that Mr. Obama's numbers would fade some after his convention - and the first debate has quite often been a time when the challenger drew the race closer.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Iran Places New Curbs On Trading Of Currency

Abstract: The sanctions, which have constricted Iran's ability to sell oil and conduct international financial transactions, have sharply increased the price of imports and contributed to the loss of confidence in the rial, which in turn has fueled inflation.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Iranian police officers moved to arrest unlicensed currency dealers and increase patrols in the center of the capital on Monday to prevent unofficial trading from disrupting new government-imposed rates of exchange for the national currency, the rial.
Over the past days, Iran's leaders have sought to stabilize the value of their currency after a market panic last week when the rial fell by about 40 percent against the United States dollar and other foreign currencies.
Now, only those traders licensed by Iran's Central Bank may buy and sell the rial for foreign currency, and at rates that value the rial at 25,500 to the dollar -- substantially more than last week, when it took as many as 37,500 rials to buy one dollar.
But the new restriction on unofficial trading also had an adverse effect, causing lines of customers who wanted to sell their rials at the better rate in anticipation that it would eventually weaken again. Several authorized money traders refused to sell foreign currency in large quantities, and some hired private security companies to regulate the flow of customers.
In another measure to help ensure that the state's foreign currency would be used only to buy the most important imports, a Parliament member said all luxury imports had been forbidden.
The politician, Gholamreza Mesbahi-Moghaddam, also said that Parliament had been preparing to discuss the suspension of the second phase of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's subsidy reform plan, Iran's English-language state television channel Press TV reported. The lawmaker stressed that people would continue to receive a monthly cash payment, which the government is due to deliver in a week.
The monthly payment -- about 450,000 rials a person to nearly 60 million people -- is viewed by some economists as a contributor to inflation by raising the number of rials in circulation.
Iranian leaders have called the currency crisis a plot by Iran's enemies to subvert the economy, which has faced acute problems that many economists in Iran and abroad attribute to government mismanagement and the effects of the sanctions imposed by the West over the disputed Iranian uranium enrichment program.
The sanctions, which have constricted Iran's ability to sell oil and conduct international financial transactions, have sharply increased the price of imports and contributed to the loss of confidence in the rial, which in turn has fueled inflation. Though the Central Bank of Iran has said the annual inflation rate is about 25 percent, by some outside measures it is much higher. Steve H. Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a conservative research group in Washington, said he calculated that the rate was now as high as 196 percent.
Members of Parliament have garnered enough votes to call Mr. Ahmadinejad in for questioning over the currency crisis, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported, but it was not clear when or if this would happen.
All shops that had closed in Tehran's grand bazaar, the scene of an angry demonstration against the falling currency on Wednesday by shopkeepers and passers-by, had reopened by Monday, but there were many fewer shoppers than normal. Many businessmen said they did not know what to charge for their products because of uncertainty over the foreign exchange rates.
"How can we sell enough to pay our debts?" asked Saeed Jalilian, a garment seller. "I have no customers. I will go broke."
Still, in other Tehran shopping centers people could be seen having lunch and buying products, but most whispers of conversations were about the falling rial.
Experts agreed the government had to do something to stop the fall of the rial, but said they were worried that in the long term the downward pressure would be difficult to counteract.
"It is clear that these new rates are only sustainable if the Central Bank continues to feed foreign exchange into the market," said Mousa Ghaninejad, an economy professor at Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University. He said that lack of confidence in the rial, after inflation and sanctions, was not going away.
"My heart wishes for the fall of the rial to stop," Mr. Ghaninejad said, "but economic rationale tells me otherwise."

Abstract: "If you take any major information technology company today, from Google to Intel to Qualcomm to Apple to Microsoft and beyond, you can trace the core technologies to the rich synergy between federally funded universities and industry research and development," says Peter Lee, a corporate vice president of Microsoft Research. [...]the Advancement of Science report says, government spending on research and development has declined by 10 percent since 2010, when adjusted for inflation.

Full text:   LUIS VON AHN, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, sold one Internet start-up to Google in 2009, and is now on to another. With the new company, Duolingo, he hopes to tap the millions of people learning languages online to create a crowdsourced engine of translation. "We want to translate the whole Web into every major language," Mr. von Ahn says.
Ambitious, sure, but Duolingo recently attracted $15 million of venture capital. The investors are betting on Mr. von Ahn, his idea and his growing team of 18 engineers, language experts and Web designers.
Mr. von Ahn, 33, personifies some of the essential ingredients of America's innovation culture, when it works well. An immigrant from Guatemala, he has intelligence and entrepreneurial energy to spare. And he has received a helping hand from the federal government. Duolingo began as a university research project financed by the National Science Foundation.
That pattern has been repeated countless times over the years. Government support plays a vital role in incubating new ideas that are harvested by the private sector, sometimes many years later, creating companies and jobs. A report published this year by the National Research Council, a government advisory group, looked at eight computing technologies, including digital communications, databases, computer architectures and artificial intelligence, tracing government-financed research to commercialization. It calculated the portion of revenue at 30 well-known corporations that could be traced back to the seed research backed by government agencies. The total was nearly $500 billion a year.
"If you take any major information technology company today, from Google to Intel to Qualcomm to Apple to Microsoft and beyond, you can trace the core technologies to the rich synergy between federally funded universities and industry research and development," says Peter Lee, a corporate vice president of Microsoft Research. Dr. Lee headed the National Research Council committee that produced the report, titled "Continuing Innovation in Information Technology."
The long-term importance of government-supported research may loom small in the current debate over how to reduce the federal deficit. But it is an economic issue worth keeping in mind, and one that points to the kinds of tough choices and trade-offs facing policy makers.
The Budget Control Act, which is scheduled to take effect next January unless Congress shifts course, calls for across-the-board cuts in discretionary spending -- for programs other than entitlements like Social Security and Medicare. A new study by the American Association for the Advancement of Science estimates that federal spending on research and development would be trimmed by more than $12 billion in 2013. The National Science Foundation, which finances most government-supported computer science research at universities, would have its budget cut by more than $450 million.
Last week, Senate leaders were trying to negotiate a deficit-reduction deal that would avoid the automatic cuts, but programs like those that finance research are likely to receive rigorous scrutiny from budget-cutters for years into the future. Already, the Advancement of Science report says, government spending on research and development has declined by 10 percent since 2010, when adjusted for inflation.
YET why should government support for scientific research and technology development be spared from the belt-tightening? Unless society benefits inordinately from such spending, there is no case for special treatment. In a new book, "Innovation Economics: The Race for Global Advantage" (Yale University Press), Robert D. Atkinson and Stephen J. Ezell forcefully present the argument for the exceptional role that science and technology play in the economy.
Cutting funding for research and development, Mr. Atkinson said in an interview, is "completely shortsighted." Spending on science and technology, he said, is an investment that produces a larger economy in the future -- generating wealth, jobs and tax revenue. Besides, he said, the bill is not very high in the United States. America ranks 22nd among 30 nations in university funding and research and development funding as a share of the economy's gross domestic product.
In their book, Mr. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit policy research group, and Mr. Ezell, a senior analyst at the foundation, define innovation as not only the generation of new ideas but also as their adoption in new products, processes, services and organizational models. In their view, the goal of policy should be to invest in and nurture the development of the innovation pipeline, from basic science to commercialization.
That would call for a more hands-on role for government than is embraced by the mainstream of economic thought, certainly in the United States. The consensus of most economists is that basic science is a "public good," with the benefits widely shared by society, and thus a worthwhile recipient of government financing. But technology -- the application of science to real-world problems -- is regarded as a "private good," with its development best left to the marketplace.
Mr. Atkinson, whose Ph.D. is in city and regional planning, says he is presenting the case for loosening the grip of "neoclassical economists" on policy. He has held economic and technology policy jobs in Rhode Island and for Congress, and has served in advisory groups in the administrations of President Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Mr. Atkinson's nonprofit policy research organization receives financial support from groups including the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, and from corporations including Intel and I.B.M.
A linchpin of innovation policy, according to Mr. Atkinson, is collaboration between government and industry. As a prime example, he points to Germany and its network of 60 Fraunhofer Institutes, financed 70 percent by business and 30 percent by federal and state government. The institutes, he says, perform applied research intended to translate promising technologies, from polymer research to nanotechnology, into products. These tech-transfer clusters, Mr. Atkinson says, are an important reason for the strength of Germany's manufacturing sector, even though wages for its factory workers are 40 percent higher than those for American workers.
Taking a page from the German model, the Obama administration announced this year plans for up to 15 manufacturing innovation institutes, public-private collaborations called the National Network of Manufacturing Innovation. The first will be in Youngstown, Ohio, specializing in custom manufacturing using 3-D printing technology. Mr. Atkinson says that while this is a good step, what is needed is a long-term commitment. He noted that Germany's Fraunhofer initiative began nearly four decades ago, and has grown steadily.
Mr. Atkinson's focus on research investment, and on the pathways that bring ideas into the marketplace, is gaining increasing attention in economics, according to David B. Audretsch, an economist at Indiana University. "Research and development unequivocally pays off economically," Mr. Audretsch says. "But the biggest payoff is in ecosystems that take the innovative inputs and make them commercial outputs -- products."
MR. VON AHN'S start-up is a new addition to the growing technology cluster around Pittsburgh, with Carnegie Mellon, a major research university, as its hub. Duolingo combines crowdsourcing and computing, language learning and online translation. People learn a language at no cost, while their lessons feed into Duolingo's fast-expanding translation database, which is sorted and scored for accuracy with smart software.
The crowdsourcing principle is similar to that used by Mr. von Ahn's previous company, reCaptcha. Its service employs the widely used Web security feature in which users identify and type words, scanned from old books and newpapers, to gain access to a site or service -- in the process helping to accurately digitize those old texts.
But Duolingo is far more ambitious and complex. The exploratory research was supported by a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation, about $120,000 a year, used mostly to pay the tuition and living expenses for a graduate student. Two years later, Mr. von Ahn and his small team had made enough progress to have a working prototype, start the company and attract private investors.
"The grants are really helpful when you're working on something that is scientifically complex," Mr. von Ahn says, "when you're in the early year, or two or more, when you have no idea if it will work."
Mr. von Ahn, joining other scientists, has made a few trips to Washington to speak to members of Congress and their staffs. His message is this: "Don't eat your seed corn. It may seem like an easy thing to cut now. But years later, you will regret that you did not invest a tiny portion of your federal budget in research, in the future."

Full text:   AFTER a loss in which his Green Bay Packers played horrifically, Coach Vince Lombardi, according to legend, announced to the team that it would be returning to fundamentals.
"Gentlemen," he said, holding up a pigskin, "this is a football."
You may be reminded of that story as you read "The Debt-Free Spending Plan," by JoAnneh Nagler (Amacom, $16). It's as basic as basic can be and is clearly written for anyone who has ever said: "It's impossible for me to save or invest. I can't even pay my bills."
Ms. Nagler understands. Having once owed $90,000 on her credit cards, and having learned the hard way the lessons she imparts here, she says, she knows that "debt is a killer."
"It's a drag on our hearts and minds," she writes, "an energy hog and a full-time guilt-making machine."
The first step in turning your financial life around, she says, is to stop making your situation worse. You need to start spending less than you make -- immediately.
For people with money troubles, that's far more difficult than it may sound, because people in serious debt "have no idea how much we're able to live on and what 'wants' and 'needs' we can afford," Ms. Nagler writes.
To correct that, she recommends that you write down every bit of money coming in and going out. If you find that you are spending more than you're making, you must figure out how to get those numbers into alignment.
She leaves it mostly up to you to determine how, but she does offer suggestions. For example, do you really need to spend $200 a month on television programming? And it is apparently a rule that if you write a personal-finance book, you must suggest, as Ms. Nagler does, that people don't need to buy $3 coffees on the way to work.
When your budget is balanced, you have to ensure that it stays that way -- and the author advises that you do so one item at a time. Say you budgeted $250 a month for gas. Each time you make a purchase, deduct it from the budget. Did you fill the tank for $40 on the 6th? You have $210 left for the month. If you are going to go over that limit, you need to cut somewhere else, in real time. No exceptions. Saying "I'll catch up next month" simply won't do.
To make sure you stay on track, Ms. Nagler suggests breaking your expenses into their smallest parts. For example, quarterly bills make planning harder than it has to be, so have everyone bill you monthly. Want to have $1,000 to spend at Christmas? Put away $83.33 a month starting in January.
I told you this was basic. That's the book's appeal: nothing is left to chance.
But the book is flawed in several small ways, and one big one.
You can get past the nits. If Ms. Nagler wrote one more variation on "don't shop at the 'whole paycheck' grocery stores," clearly referring to Whole Foods and its kin by using the term that some people slap on the chain, I was going to scream. And her demand that you always stay within your budget, if taken literally, will force you to forgo special sales when your supermarket cuts the price of steak in half, for example, or offers a "buy one, get one free" promotion on staple items.
But it's the book's advice about credit card repayment that is most troubling. If, in the early days of getting your financial life in order, you feel that you can't afford the minimum payments on your credit card, then don't make them, it says. Just tell the credit card companies you can't right now and will send what you can.
That's not likely to go over well. While it is sometimes possible to work out repayment plans that waive interest or let you pay reduced minimums, it rarely occurs after one short phone call. It usually takes a lot of negotiation.
STILL, at some point after getting your financial life in order, you may well have money to invest. Where should you put it, especially when worldwide markets are in flux? Ben Emons, a senior vice president at Pimco, the investment company that runs the world's largest bond fund, addresses that question in "The Financial Domino Effect" (McGraw-Hill, $35).
While its subtitle is "How to Profit Now in the Volatile Global Economy," the book doesn't spend enough time discussing where to invest money. Rather, most of it is devoted to explaining what the author sees as the three main financial "dominoes," or trends that cause extended ripples, like falling dominoes, in world markets. The dominoes are these:
Sociopolitical. A political or social movement, like the protests in the Middle East and North Africa, that inspires other movements.
Economic. An event like the United States housing crisis.
Financial. An event like the near-failure of Long-Term Capital Management or the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
When the dominoes start to fall, what's an investor to do? The book's conclusion is not surprising: be extremely conservative.
In situations of sociopolitical unrest, the places to be are Treasury bills, Treasury inflation-protected securities, cash and commodities -- because, during such times, some people like to invest in the tangible. Has a financial domino set off uncertainty? Gold and selected equities are where you should invest, although the book offers no specific recommendations when it comes to stocks. And if it's an economic domino, choose Treasuries and high-quality corporate bonds.
Let's see. Spend less than you earn, and invest conservatively in times of uncertainty. The advice doesn't get any more basic, or beneficial, than that.

Abstract: JUST before the Fed announced its fresh round of quantitative easing, often described as QE3, the European Central Bank made an open-ended pledge to buy government bonds of any euro zone country that requested a rescue.

Full text:   THE ups and downs that have unnerved investors for at least two years produced another course correction for the stock market in the third quarter. A spring decline gave way to a summer rally that took popular indexes to their highest levels in at least five years.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index stood at 1,440.67 as the quarter ended, giving it a gain of 5.8 percent for the period and 14.6 percent since 2012 began. The catalyst was another dose of radical therapy from central bankers, in the form of pledges to pump enormous -- in some cases, unlimited -- amounts of money into economies around the world.
That may have eased investors' pain, but after earlier treatments seemed to be of little lasting benefit to economic growth or stock returns, some advisers view the latest moves less as a cure than as a successful trip to the emergency room. They contend that neither the economy nor the stock market is out of the woods.
Henry J. Herrmann, chief executive of the fund management firm Waddell & Reed, questioned whether investors would "want to be jumping into the equity market at this juncture."
"There's a growing feeling that things aren't going to be quite as disastrous as was presumed earlier," Mr. Herrmann said, "but I think that the market is going to be faced with additional issues, and that probably will hold down much more upside."
His concerns are widely shared, and are heightened by the fact that the latest promises of monetary stimulus, including the third round of quantitative easing announced by the Federal Reserve in September, are impossible to quantify. The Fed indicated that it would buy $40 billion of mortgage debt a month for as long as it took to get the economy to tick along on its own.
The bounce in share prices suggests that many investors would answer "yes" to Mr. Herrmann's question. But some, like Joshua Silva, senior portfolio strategist at Attalus Capital, are also keeping a close eye on inflation indicators to alert them when it's time to jump back out.
"Equities are going to have a great finish to the year," Mr. Silva predicted. "I think people should be long equities and long risk." But he added a cautionary note: "The world has gone and created a giant printing press. That's going to come back to bite us in the next 6 to 24 months."
JUST before the Fed announced its fresh round of quantitative easing, often described as QE3, the European Central Bank made an open-ended pledge to buy government bonds of any euro zone country that requested a rescue. But there was a catch: the bank committed to sterilizing the bond purchases, meaning that for every 100 euros of Italian or Spanish or whatever debt it bought, it would sell the same amount of bonds on its books from more creditworthy nations like Germany, Finland or the Netherlands.
As with QE3, the European Central Bank's plan is good news for the markets today and potentially awful news down the road, said Dennis Stattman, co-manager of the BlackRock Global Allocation fund.
"There's no compelling evidence that what the E.C.B. has done has fixed the fundamentals in Europe," Mr. Stattman said. "Reducing financial costs temporarily doesn't make the problem go away. It simply reduces the level of fear in the markets." In his view, the region suffers from "widely dispersed competitiveness, fiscal policies and political situations under the umbrella of one currency."
Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, is not impressed, either.
"The fact that they have announced an unlimited amount of bond buying has caused Mediterranean countries' yields to go down," Mr. Sri-Kumar said. But if the central bankers follow through with sterilized purchases, he added, "they could run out of German paper. If yields refuse to come down sufficiently, then what is the E.C.B. going to sell?"
Investment advisers say other potential problems have also been pushed down Wall Street's list of pressing concerns. They include the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the approaching "fiscal cliff," in which scheduled spending cuts and tax rate increases in the United States -- unless Congress takes action -- could cut growth by up to four percentage points. But for now, so far, so good, for stock markets around the world and the funds that invest in them.
The average domestic general stock fund in Morningstar's database rose 5.6 percent in the three months through September. Funds that specialize in European stocks were up 8.4 percent, and the gains for Asian and emerging-market funds were 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.
After reaching a record low of 1.43 percent in July, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose steadily through the rest of the quarter, depressing prices on high-grade bonds. That left long-term government bond funds with the barest gain, 0.1 percent, for the quarter, but strength in high-yield and foreign bonds helped produce a 2.9 percent return for the average bond fund over all.
Apart from faith in central bankers' ability to rescue the global economy, the healthy performance for stocks and stock funds could be attributable to continued strength in corporate fundamentals. Business may not be easy in this economy, but it is good by many yardsticks.
"We've got microscopic interest rates, reasonable valuations and generous dividend yields, corporations are financially healthy and profits are near an all-time high," said John Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management.
"A lot of investors have been hiding out" in sectors like utilities and telecommunications that have reputations for paying big dividends, and that has created valuations close to multiyear highs, Mr. Buckingham said.
He prefers big technology stocks like Cisco Systems and Microsoft, each of which yields about 3 percent, and Intel, with a yield of about 4 percent, as well as resources companies including Newmont Mining and Diamond Offshore Drilling. He also finds companies as diverse as Norfolk Southern, Hasbro and Royal Caribbean to be extremely attractive, in part for the dividends they pay.
Funds that specialize in communication stocks were up 9.3 percent in the quarter, the Morningstar results show, while utility funds experienced a more modest rise of 3.7 percent. Other sectors with strong gains included natural resources, up 9.8 percent; energy, 8.5 percent, and financials, 7.2 percent.
Mr. Silva also considers it too late to chase the usual suspects to which investors turn for high yields.
"Equities with high dividends were a fantastic trade earlier in the year, but they're becoming a scary trade," he remarked. "Everyone's going to run for the door at the same time."
His favorite sectors in the market are technology and basic materials, and he would keep "nothing in Treasury bonds, absolutely not."
Mr. Sri-Kumar absolutely would keep money in Treasury bonds. Once the relief over the central banks' latest moves wears off, yields could fall to 1.25 percent, he predicted.
He also recommends speculating on a fresh decline in the euro, something that investors can do through exchange-traded funds. And he has a much higher opinion than Mr. Silva does of stocks with high dividend yields.
"If there's a crisis, they're going to become even more favored by investors," Mr. Sri-Kumar said.
Mr. Stattman sees few compelling buys in the markets.
"Fixed income is just not attractively priced," he said. "Long-term investors should be somewhere between underweight and very underweight. I'm confident that stocks are attractively priced relative to fixed income, but I'm less confident that they're attractively priced in absolute terms. It's probably a good idea to assume that profit margins will contract at some point."
He finds the best opportunities, or perhaps the least bad ones, in shorter-term, high-quality debt, and in stocks in Japan and emerging markets.
THERE is widespread concern that another crisis may be brewing, with the main question being whether investors should flinch now or later. But Mr. Buckingham argues that a crisis could be what the stock market needs to continue to rally.
"People are sitting on their hands, waiting for whatever shoes are going to drop to drop," he said, highlighting surveys that show a broad disdain for stocks among small investors. "What we need is some certainty," he added, "even if it's bad."

Full text:   CASH is trash. Junk is gold.
Or so investors seem to think.
About $79 billion in sub-investment-grade corporate bonds were issued in the quarter that just ended, Dealogic reported this week. That was the largest amount issued in any quarter since the firm began collecting the numbers in the mid-1990s.
That came as the Federal Reserve embarked on its latest effort to keep rates -- both short and long term -- as low as possible in an effort to stimulate the economy.
"Investors are starved for yields," said Martin Fridson, the chief executive of FridsonVision, a research firm. "Some people say the Fed is pushing people into more risky investments."
Sub-investment-grade bonds are traditionally known as junk bonds to their detractors and as high-yield bonds to their buyers. Neither term may be that accurate these days. The bonds have been excellent investments over the last year, but as prices have risen, the yields have fallen to record lows.
One widely followed index of the bonds, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master Index II, ended September with an average effective yield of 6.6 percent. That is the lowest yield in its history, as can be seen in the accompanying charts.
Of course, 6.6 percent does not look that bad today when contrasted with rates on high-quality bonds. Ten-year Treasuries offer yields of 1.6 percent, a little less than the current inflation rate. If you buy an inflation-linked 10-year Treasury -- one that will protect you if inflation gets out of hand -- you will lock in a real return of negative 0.86 percent. Buy a corporate bond rated Single A -- a good but not great credit rating -- and you can lock in a yield of around 2.4 percent.
Such low rates have proved attractive to issuers. Sales of new investment-grade corporate bonds reached $177 billion in the quarter, Dealogic reported. That was just a little lower than the figure for the first three months of this year, although it is well below the record of $271 billion issued in the first quarter of 2009.
Such heavy issuance of corporate bonds might appear to be an indication that companies are borrowing money to invest in new plants and equipment. But many of the loans are being taken out to refinance bonds issued in earlier years at higher interest rates. Such an exchange benefits the company at the expense of investors, who may end up trading in one bond for another with a lower yield.
The public demand for junk bonds appears to be high as well. EPFR Global estimated that investors put $19.3 billion into high-yield mutual funds during the third quarter. That was the second-highest amount it had calculated, trailing only the first three months of this year.
High-yield bonds can be risky as well. Their prices plunged during the recession when there were fears that many of the companies issuing such bonds would go broke. That sent yields soaring above 20 percent for a brief period.
The current strength of high-yield bonds -- investors in such bonds earned a total return of about 19 percent over the last 12 months -- appears to reflect a general belief that such an economic downturn is highly unlikely anytime soon.

Abstract: Despite the recent price increases, the agency's overall food price index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of goods including cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, remains below the levels it reached in 2011, when high food prices led to unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Global prices for meats, dairy products and cereals resumed rising last month, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported Thursday, adding to concerns that developing countries may face food shortages.
The agency said that on average, prices rose 1.4 percent in September, after remaining steady in July and August. Scorching heat and drought in the United States, Russia and Europe constricted agricultural production and pushed up prices of corn and soybeans to record highs, the report said.
The largest increases were for dairy products, which rose 7 percent in September, their sharpest climb since January 2011. Higher feed costs were a major factor in the increase, and also helped to drive meat prices up 2.1 percent, especially in the "grain intensive" pork and poultry industries, the report said.
Cereal prices rose 1 percent, and the food agency forecast a decline in global cereal production this year.
Despite the recent price increases, the agency's overall food price index, which measures monthly price changes for a basket of goods including cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, remains below the levels it reached in 2011, when high food prices led to unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa. But, adjusted for inflation, the index is now only 13 percent below its levels of 2008, when food costs set off riots in several countries.
After the release of the food agency's report, Oxfam, a nonprofit international aid group, called on governments to tackle the root causes of food price volatility.
The price index "shows that food prices remain at extremely high levels," the group's spokesman, Colin Roche, said in a statement. "The fact they are relatively steady is no cause for celebration. Governments must ensure that these high prices do not tip more vulnerable people into hunger. We cannot afford to sleepwalk into the next food crisis."
Oxfam also released a report on Thursday, saying that rising food prices have helped drive a global land rush that is undermining the rights and livelihoods of the poor and the most vulnerable people.
The Oxfam report said that foreign investors have invested heavily in recent years to acquire agricultural land in developing countries with serious hunger problems, but that most of the investors plan to use the land to grow exclusively for export, not for domestic sale.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Policy makers at the Federal Reserve were nearly united last month in their belief that the economic recovery needed additional help and that the central bank had the ability to provide it, according to the official account of the meeting released on Thursday.
"All members but one agreed that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for additional monetary accommodation," said the minutes of the September meeting, and participants were particularly concerned about the high unemployment rate.
The minutes, which summarize the discussions at the Fed's top policy making meeting, are routinely released three weeks after the meeting's end.
At the last meeting, held Sept. 12-13, the Fed announced a major round of asset purchases aimed at stimulating the economy and pulling down the stubbornly high unemployment rate, which has ranged from 8.1 to 8.3 percent this year.
In their discussions leading up to the decision, many at the meeting noted the uncertainty surrounding the economy, given the risks posed by the continuing debt crisis in Western Europe and the major tax increases and spending cuts that may hit next year in the United States. And "a number of participants" expressed uncertainty about the impact the new Fed program might have and how it might complicate monetary policy in the future.
Thus, the Fed minutes said the committee adopted a "flexible approach" that would allow the Fed "to tailor its policy response over time."
Many Federal Reserve officials indicated that they would also support providing more explicit guidance on interest rate policies. The Fed currently intends to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until mid-2015.
But the minutes said that "many" officials suggested tying the guidance to economic benchmarks, like the unemployment rate, rather than to the calendar.
"A change in the calendar date might be interpreted pessimistically as a downgrade of the committee's economic outlook rather than as conveying the committee's determination to support the economic recovery," some participants noted according to the minutes.
Moreover, using economic data rather than a specific date might allow financial markets to adjust their expectations of Federal Reserve policy more fluidly.
Still, Fed officials indicated that choosing an economic benchmark might be difficult, implying that the policy change would not be an imminent one.
Some expressed concern "that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process or could be incorrectly interpreted as triggers prompting an automatic policy response," the minutes said.
But on another major round of bond buying, the members of the policy making committee were broadly in agreement.
The economy grew at an annual pace of 1.3 percent in the second quarter of the year -- not nearly enough to bring down the unemployment rate, and just above stall speed.
The jobs market is "a grave concern," Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at a news conference after the September meeting. "While the economy appears to be on a path of moderate recovery, it isn't growing fast enough to make significant progress reducing the unemployment rate."
So the Fed announced it would buy large quantities of mortgage bonds until it was satisfied that the jobs market had "substantially" improved.
The Fed effort involves purchasing mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion a month. The central bank said that it would continue the asset purchases until it was satisfied the program had worked, but it did not designate a time frame or a specific economic benchmark for when it would stop.
"We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment," Mr. Bernanke said last month after the Fed's announcement.
In the meeting, some members "were reluctant to specify explicit numerical thresholds out of concern that such thresholds would necessarily be too simple to fully capture the complexities of the economy and the policy process or could be incorrectly interpreted as triggers prompting an automatic policy response," the minutes of the meeting said.
The new Fed program is also intended to support the nascent housing recovery, where sales volumes and purchase prices are starting to track back upward six years after the housing bubble started to collapse.
The effort will "provide further support for the housing sector by encouraging home purchases and refinancing," Mr. Bernanke said after the announcement.
Markets have mostly cheered the new Fed program. But it has provoked criticism from politicians.
"After four years of stagnant growth, falling incomes, rising costs and persistently high unemployment, the American economy doesn't need more artificial and ineffective measures," Mitt Romney's campaign said in a statement. "We should be creating wealth, not printing dollars."
Others have charged that the Fed's aggressive easing of monetary policy has reduced pressure on Washington to tackle the country's debt.
Mr. Bernanke gave a strong response to that criticism at a speech in Indianapolis this week. "I find this argument unpersuasive," Mr. Bernanke said. "The responsibility for fiscal policy lies squarely with the administration and the Congress."
Given the pervasive weakness in the economy, Mr. Bernanke has repeatedly called on other Washington policy makers to do more to support the recovery, and to avoid the "fiscal cliff" -- the nickname he coined for the enormous tax increases and spending cuts that will happen at year-end, if Congress does not act.
"Business contacts in many parts of the country were reported to be highly uncertain about the outlook for the economy and for fiscal and regulatory policies," the minutes said. "Although firms' balance sheets were generally strong, these uncertainties had led them to be particularly cautious and to remain reluctant to hire or expand capacity."
The next meeting of the Fed's open market committee will be Oct. 23-24.

Full text:   Companies in the United States added more jobs than expected last month while activity in the vast services sector picked up, suggesting the economy remained on track for modest growth.
The ADP National Employment Report showed private employers added 162,000 jobs in September. While the gain topped economists' expectations, it was still fewer than the 189,000 new hires seen in August.
Separate data showed the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index for the service sector rose to its highest level since March at 55.1 from 53.7 as new orders accelerated.
"It looks more like things are heading in the right direction. It is this new reality. We don't have robust growth; we just have very moderate growth," said William Larkin, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass.
The ADP report comes ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive employment report on Friday, which will include both public and private sector employment. That report is expected to show job growth improved slightly, with employers adding 113,000 jobs. Private sector payrolls are seen rising by 130,000.
"While the economy isn't plunging into recession, it still isn't creating enough jobs to drive the unemployment rate lower either," Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, wrote.
Small businesses, firms with fewer than 50 workers, added half of the jobs in September, according to ADP, with 81,000 new workers. Large companies with 500 or more workers added 17,000 jobs, while companies in the middle created 64,000 jobs.
The increase in private payrolls in August was revised down to 189,000 from the previously reported 201,000. July's rise was also revised down, to 156,000 from 173,000.
Last month the Federal Reserve introduced an aggressive new plan to bolster the economy, saying it would buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities a month until the outlook for the job market substantially improved and as long as inflation remained under control.
The I.S.M.'s forward-looking new-orders index jumped to 57.7 from 53.7, but growth in employment eased to 51.1 from 53.8.
Exports also waned, to 50.5 from 52.
Services firms, which range from agriculture to real estate companies, avoided the contraction that hit their manufacturing counterparts over the summer.

Full text:   TEHRAN -- Iran's president admitted Tuesday that the American-led economic sanctions on the country were partly to blame for a breathtaking 40 percent fall in value of the Iranian currency, the rial, over the past week. He pleaded with Iranians not to exchange their money for dollars and other foreign currencies.
Speaking during a news conference broadcast live by several domestic and international Iranian news channels, the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Iran was facing a "psychological war" waged by the United States and aided by what he described as internal enemies.
He said the currency's fall was caused in part by the sanctions imposed by the West over Iran's disputed nuclear program, which have prevented it from selling oil and transferring money. He also blamed a domestic band of "22 people in three separate circles" who with "one phone call" could manipulate foreign exchange trades in Iran.
One Web site, Mashregh News, reported Tuesday that Mr. Ahmadinejad had ordered the arrests of those "disturbing the currency market."
The fall in the currency's value has presented Iran with enormous economic risks, including the possibility of starting a severe bout of inflation, which is already high. A rising sense of economic crisis in Iran could also pose political challenges for the country's leaders.
Mr. Ahmadinejad's address was aimed at the teachers, bus drivers, businessmen and others who have been frantically converting their savings into dollars and euros at the dozens of unofficial currency-exchange shops in the center of Tehran.
"I ask you, dear people, do not change your money into foreign currency," Mr. Ahmadinejad said, emphasizing that such moves would only help the "enemy."
But a fresh day of currency fluctuations played out on Tuesday, with the rial falling, then strengthening before sinking again, to settle around its Monday record low of roughly 37,000 to the dollar. The rate had been 24,600 rials per dollar as of last Monday.
Addressing the mixed emotions expressed by many Iranians, who are confused over whether to blame economic mismanagement by the government or the Western sanctions, Mr. Ahmadinejad accused the United States and "internal enemies."
He described the United States government as plotting to make Iranians miserable, emphasizing that the sanctions were hurting normal people instead of Iran's leaders. "They are telling you lies, their pressures are on the people, not on the government," he said.
Foreign exchange supplies in the country are sufficient to quench demand, he said, and he lauded the central bank, which he said had managed to "find ways" around the obstacles.
"The enemies are trying to blame the economic problems on the government. No. Never. There is no economic reason for these erratic ups and downs," Mr. Ahmadinejad said. "I have no doubt that we will return to normal conditions."
But he did not offer any specific solution to the crisis, and the rial's value weakened after he spoke. The reaction prompted one person who exchanges currency to predict that the rial would continue to lose value against the dollar and other currencies.
Mr. Ahmadinejad said the economic pressures on Iran caused by the sanctions would never force it to compromise on the country's uranium enrichment program, which Iranian leaders say is purely peaceful but the West suspects is a cloak for developing nuclear weapons capability. But the president repeated an earlier Iranian offer to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, if world powers would be willing to provide Iran with that grade of nuclear fuel.
"We have announced that if they give us the fuel, we will stop production," Mr. Ahmadinejad said. "But so far no one is prepared to do so."
Also on Tuesday an Iranian lawmaker threatened that Iran would enrich uranium to 60 percent purity -- much closer to bomb-grade material, if talks with world powers failed.
The lawmaker, Mansour Haghighatpour, deputy head of the foreign policy and national security committee in Parliament, said Iran needed the higher enriched fuel for still-to-be-designed nuclear submarines and ships, according to Press TV, Iran state television's English language news channel.

Health Care As Income For the Poor

Author: Porter, Eduardo

Abstract: Without it, the recipients could not afford an essential, lifesaving service. [...]the budget office considers Social Security benefits as income. The gains from the new calculations are enough to vault a family of two parents and two children over the Census Bureau's official poverty line of $21,756 and to almost breach the supplemental measure's threshold of $23,854. Because two-thirds of Medicare funds and 83 percent of Medicaid funds are spent on the poorest 40 percent of the population, the shift also narrows the nation's income gap.

Full text:   As a nation, we devote almost one-sixth of our spending to health care, twice the share of 30 years ago. Medical bills for the elderly are climbing, threatening to blow up the budget in a few decades. Politicians from both parties are consumed by how to pay for it all. Yet we cannot quite agree on how valuable government health care benefits are to Americans.
In July, the Congressional Budget Office -- the nonpartisan arbiter of the costs and consequences of government spending -- decided that we had not been valuing these benefits enough. In a report on how income and taxes are distributed across the population, it decided, for the first time, to value health benefits provided by the government at every penny they cost.
The decision stoked a long-simmering debate about how much health care is really worth to poor families who may not have enough to eat. The reclassification of health benefits added $4,600 a year to households in the bottom fifth of income. It shrank the nation's yawning income gap and muted the increase of inequality over the last three decades. And it changed the picture of what the government does for Americans.
The reasoning behind the budget office's action seems to make lots of sense: the government spends almost $8,000 on the average Medicaid beneficiary and more than $12,000 for each person on Medicare. Why shouldn't that count as income? Without it, the recipients could not afford an essential, lifesaving service. Moreover, the budget office considers Social Security benefits as income. And that's the way it treats the health insurance provided by employers to their workers.
But not everyone thinks health care is worth that much. In particular, the Census Bureau does not include health care and other noncash benefits when computing the official poverty rate. Even its Supplemental Poverty Measure -- which was created to capture noncash sources of income, as well as all the costs faced by the poor -- sets the value of Medicare and Medicaid at zero.
That approach is not unreasonable, either. To paraphrase Timothy Smeeding, the director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: you can't eat health care. Medicaid benefits are enough to lift many people out of poverty statistically even if they don't have enough money to afford housing, utilities and food.
And the addition of those benefits could alter how we view our progress. From 2000 to 2010, government spending for each Medicare recipient rose by two-thirds after inflation. But those increases probably didn't make seniors feel wealthier, especially since their out-of-pocket expenses for medical care rose, too.
For years, the Congressional Budget Office followed the general approach of the Census Bureau: health benefits were worth only the amount that a family otherwise would have spent on doctors and other medical services -- that is, money that could be used on something else. So Medicare, Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program benefits to a family that didn't have enough money to satisfy necessities like food, shelter and utilities were valued at zero, because without the government benefits the family wouldn't spend on medical care at all.
The change in approach alters the calculation of who is living in poverty. Including these health benefits at face value raises by 25 percent the income of households in the poorest fifth of the population, to $23,300 in 2009 from $18,900 under the previous calculation. This is more than three times the average income of the poorest fifth of households before federal taxes and government benefits kick in, which in 2009 was $7,600. The gains from the new calculations are enough to vault a family of two parents and two children over the Census Bureau's official poverty line of $21,756 and to almost breach the supplemental measure's threshold of $23,854.
Because two-thirds of Medicare funds and 83 percent of Medicaid funds are spent on the poorest 40 percent of the population, the shift also narrows the nation's income gap. Under the budget office's old method, the richest fifth of American households made more than nine times the incomes of the poorest fifth, after taxes and government benefits. Under the new method, the rich take home less than 7.5 times what the poor do.
The new definition of income removes many seniors from the poorest group of Americans, as they are big consumers of Medicare. And it pushes more working families to the bottom of the income scale.
Accounting for health care this way also changes the view of what government actually accomplishes. Social scientists have noted with some dismay that taxes and government transfer payments have become less effective over the last 30 years at narrowing the income gap in American society. But including health benefits changes the outcome significantly because health care is becoming a much bigger part of government spending.
Under the budget office's old methods, taxes and government spending in 2007 narrowed the income gap by 17 percent, as measured by the Gini index, which ranges from 0 when everybody has the same income to 1 when one plutocrat hoards it all. Including all government health spending as income, the government reduced inequality by 21 percent.
The budget office's change will not settle the debate about how to value health care. Mr. Smeeding, for instance, advised against the change. He argues that the new measure "makes the poor look better off than they really are and their improvement over time better than it was." The National Academy of Sciences panel that advised the Census Bureau on its new poverty measures agreed that health benefits distorted the picture of poverty.
But if you ask Jonathan Gruber, the M.I.T. economist who advised the White House on health care reform, government health benefits are being undervalued even when reported at full cost. "I think it is likely that this is too low because folks have utility value from being insured, which goes above and beyond the cash cost of insurance," he wrote in an e-mail. Not counting it at all, he added, is a "major shortcoming."
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, advised the Congressional Budget Office to go ahead with the change. "Our entire system of redistribution is tilted in the favor of giving the poor medical care, but we're not going to count that?" he asked. "That's ridiculous!"
Richard Burkhauser of Cornell University, another economist who advised the budget office to change its definition, argues that it is particularly important after the passage of President Obama's health plan, which will increase the government's footprint in health care.
Mr. Burkhauser suggests that the poverty threshold should be raised so that health benefits don't vault the poor over the line. More of the nation's income is being devoted to health care, he says, and that needs to be counted to help us decide the best way to spend our resources. We may ask why we are "spending so much to give poor people 'Cadillac health care' and nothing else," he says.
The political debate about health care could change if more people in Washington adopted this view. By Mr. Burkhauser's rough calculations, provisions in the Affordable Care Act championed by President Obama would add about $750 a year to the income of people in the bottom 60 percent. Under this light, Obamacare might appear a more powerful tool to improve Americans' well-being than we thought.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Americans of working age are going to the doctor less frequently than they were 10 years ago, according to a new report by the Census Bureau.
In 2010, people age 18 to 64 made an average of 3.9 visits to doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, down from 4.8 visits in 2001, said the report, which was released on Monday.
The precise reasons for the decline were unclear, said Brett O'Hara, an official at the Census Bureau and a co-author of the report. But the changing demographics of the American population most likely had something to do with it.
As baby boomers retire, for example, they leave a working-age population that is on average younger and that tends to use less health care. Still, that is likely to be only a small part of the explanation, as the baby boomers began to move into retirement only at the end of the report's period, about two years ago.
Another possible reason for the decline in doctor visits, Mr. O'Hara said, is that the share of uninsured working-age people has expanded over the past decade. People without insurance are less likely to visit a doctor, said the report, which was based on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, a long-running survey of more than 80,000 households. The share of working-age Americans without health insurance was 21.8 percent in 2010, according to the Census Bureau, up from 17 percent in 2001.
The report measures the years before 2010, when a provision in the Affordable Care Act began allowing young adults to stay on their parents insurance policies until age 26. That change has helped stem the rise in the uninsured.
People lacking insurance were far less likely to go to doctors. Just 24 percent of the uninsured went to a doctor at least once in 2010, compared with 72 percent of the general population of working age adults, the report found.
The share of doctors visits by uninsured adults was low, Mr. O'Hara said, despite the safety net that is supposed to help them get medical care, like as federally financed community health centers and hospitals with charity care.
But even for those with insurance, costs have increased, with deductibles and premiums rising far faster than inflation, and many have cut back on doctor visits, said Kathleen Stoll, director of health policy at Families USA, a nonprofit health care research and advocacy group.
"Many are thinking twice before going to a physician," she said.
Still, about two-thirds of Americans reported being in good or excellent health, the report said, compared with about one-third that reported being in fair or poor health. The report also showed the sharp difference in medical usage by income. Nearly 40 percent of people in poverty did not visit a doctor in 2010, compared with 19 percent of people from higher income levels.
Hispanics were the least likely to seek medical care, with 42 percent reporting not having visited a doctor at all in 2010. Among whites, the share was 23 percent and among blacks it was 30 percent.

Full text:   Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to use the opening minutes of this debate a little differently. I'd like to say that I wish everybody could have known my father, George Romney. He was a great public servant and I've always tried to live up to his example. The problem is that you get caught up in the competitiveness of a campaign and all the consultants want to make you something you're not.
I've allowed that to happen to me. I'm a nonideological guy running in an ideological age, and I've been pretending to be more of an ideologue than I really am. I'm a sophisticated guy running in a populist moment. I've ended up dumbing myself down.
It hasn't even worked. I'm behind. So I've decided to run the last month of this campaign as myself.
The next president is going to face some wicked problems. The first is the "fiscal cliff." The next president is going to have to forge a grand compromise on the budget. President Obama has tried and failed to do this over the past four years. There's no reason to think he'd do any better over the next four.
He's failed, first, because he's just not a very good negotiator. You don't have to believe me. Read Bob Woodward's book, "The Price of Politics." Obama spent the last campaign promising to be postpartisan and then in his first weeks in office, in the fullness of his victory, he shut down all cooperation with Republicans and killed any hope of bipartisan cooperation.
Furthermore, he's too insular. As Woodward reports, he's constantly leaving people in the dark -- his negotiating partners and people in his own party. They're perpetually being blindsided and confused by his amorphous positions. There's no trust. If I were in business, there's no way I would do a deal with this guy.
The second reason there's been no budget compromise is that Republicans have been too rigid, refusing to put revenue on the table. I've been part of the problem. But, globally, the nations that successfully trim debt have raised $1 in new revenue for every $3 in spending cuts. I will bring Republicans around to that position. There's no way President Obama can do that.
The second wicked problem the next president will face is sluggish growth. I assume you know that everything President Obama and I have been saying on this subject has been total garbage. Presidents and governors don't "create jobs." We don't have the ability to "grow the economy." There's no magic lever.
Instead, an administration makes a thousand small decisions, each of which subtly adds to or detracts from a positive growth environment. The Obama administration, which is either hostile to or aloof from business, has made a thousand tax, regulatory and spending decisions that are biased away from growth and biased toward other priorities. American competitiveness has fallen in each of the past four years, according to the World Economic Forum. Medical device makers, for example, are being chased overseas. The economy in 2012 is worse than the economy in 2011. That's inexcusable.
My administration will be a little more biased toward growth. It'll treat businesses with more respect. There will be no magic recovery, but gradually the animal spirits will revive.
The third big problem is Medicare and rising health care costs, which are bankrupting this country. Let me tell you the brutal truth. Nobody knows how to reduce health care inflation. There are two basic approaches, and we probably have to try both simultaneously.
The first, included in Obamacare, is to have an Independent Payment Advisory Board find efficiencies and impose price controls. The problem is that that leaves the painful cost-cutting decisions in Washington, where Congress rules. Congress wrote provisions in the health care law that have already gutted the power of the advisory board. The current law allows Congress to make "cuts" on paper and then undo them with subsequent legislation. That's what Congress always does.
The second approach, favored by me, is to scrap the perverse fee-for-service incentives and use a more market-based approach. I think there's ample evidence that this could work, but, to be honest, some serious health economists disagree.
I'm willing to pursue any experiment, from any political direction, that lowers costs and saves Medicare. Democrats are campaigning as the party that will fight to the death to preserve the Medicare status quo. If they win, the lesson will be: Never Touch Medicare. No Democrat or Republican will dare reform the system, and we will go bankrupt.
At last, I've tried to be on the level with you. This president was audacious in 2008, but, as you can see from his negligible agenda, he's now exhausted. I'm not an inspiring conviction politician, but I'll try anything to help us succeed. You make the choice.

Payroll Tax Rise For 160 Million Is Likely In 2013

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Regardless of who wins the presidential election in November or what compromises Congress strikes in the lame-duck session to keep the economy from automatic tax increases and spending cuts, 160 million American wage earners will probably see their tax bills jump after Jan. 1.
That is when the temporary payroll tax holiday ends. Its expiration means less income in families' pocketbooks -- the tax increase would be about $95 billion in 2013 alone -- at a time when the economy is little better than it was when the White House reached a deal on the tax break last year.
Independent analysts say that the expiration of the tax cut could shave as much as a percentage point off economic output in 2013, and cost the economy as many as one million jobs. That is because the typical American family had $1,000 in additional income from the lower tax.
But there is still little desire to make an extension part of the negotiations that are under way to avert the huge tax increases and across-the-board spending cuts, known as the fiscal cliff, that will start in January without a deal. For example, without any action, the Bush-era tax cuts will expire and the military and other domestic spending programs will be reduced.
"This has to be a temporary tax cut," said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee this year and voicing the view of many in the White House and on Capitol Hill. "I don't see any reason to consider supporting its extension."
The White House has not pushed for an extension. "We'll evaluate the question of whether we need to extend it at the end of the year when we're looking at a whole range of issues," Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters last month.
The original point of the payroll tax holiday was to stimulate consumer spending and aid middle-income households. But now Congress needs the money as it struggles with vast deficits and believes the economy can withstand the expiration.
Many Republicans vehemently opposed its passage last year, as it would divert money from the Social Security program. Many Democrats fervently supported it last year but show no such enthusiasm now. Nancy Pelosi of California, the top House Democrat, has told reporters she thinks it should expire.
Support is lacking for two main reasons. First, both Democrats and Republicans would rather focus on the broader political and economic issue of the fate of the Bush-era income tax cuts. These cuts, too, were initially meant to be temporary, but are now deeply entrenched in the tax code and central to the budget battle.
Second, though the economy has not become significantly stronger over the past year and the tax increases in addition to spending cuts coming next year could push the country into a recession, independent economists say that the economy could shoulder the payroll tax increase without undue harm.
Moody's Analytics, for instance, estimates that expiration of the payroll tax holiday would shave 0.6 percentage point off economic growth, adjusted for inflation, in 2013 -- and that the economy could safely stomach government spending cuts and tax increases totaling up to 1.5 percentage points of economic output.
Still, expiration of the payroll tax cut will increase the taxes of millions of middle-class families.
The fragile state of the recovery and the frustratingly slow growth of the economy have heightened the stakes for the end-of-year negotiations. Economists estimate that if Congress fails to forestall or unwind the spending cuts and tax increases due to take effect next year, the hit could send country back into a recession.
The Federal Reserve currently estimates that the economy will grow 2.5 to 3 percent next year, and that the unemployment rate will be 7.6 to 7.9 percent, still painfully high.
The uncertainty in the United States is "currently a threat," said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, pressing Congress last week to avoid the cliff. "It's not a threat just for the United States of America. It's a threat for the global economy."
Some economists have pushed for an extension of the payroll tax holiday to help support the recovery -- or for its replacement with other measures to help the millions of low-income working families whose taxes will rise when it expires.
The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington-based research group, for instance, has said that the payroll tax cut has a stronger stimulative effect on the economy than many other tax cuts because the working households that receive it tend to spend the money rather than save it. Thus, it estimates that the tax cut's expiration could erase 0.9 percent of economic output and put up to a million jobs at risk.
It recommends replacing the payroll tax cut with infrastructure spending or fiscal aid to states, as a form of support for the recovery in the short term that would not have harmful long-term budget effects.
Some conservative economists have pressed for its extension as well, arguing that no Americans should have their taxes go up next year.
"Obama and Congress both need to hear this alarm clock, wake up, and get busy avoiding a payroll tax hike insult to the middle class's injuries of stagnant wages and high unemployment," wrote J. D. Foster, a fiscal specialist at the right-of-center Heritage Foundation.
The payroll tax holiday this year has reduced workers' tax on wages up to $110,100 to 4.2 percent from 6.2 percent. In 2012 that translated into a $700 tax cut for a person making $35,000 a year and a $2,202 tax cut for workers making $110,100 and up.
Last winter, the White House pushed a resistant Congress hard for an extension, arguing it was needed to support the flagging recovery. The White House set up a campaign for Americans to send in stories about what they would do with the extra $40 in their paychecks, and denounced Republicans as not wanting to aid the middle class.
"For the typical American family, it is a big deal. It means $40 extra in their paycheck. And that $40 helps to pay the rent, the groceries, the rising cost of gas," President Obama said, standing with some of the families who had sent in stories.
The other provisions at stake in the fiscal cliff negotiations overshadow the payroll tax cut.
The Congressional Budget Office has calculated that according to current law, the federal deficit would fall by more than half a trillion dollars from the 2012 fiscal year to the 2013 fiscal year. The expiration of the Bush tax cuts and other provisions would reduce the deficit by $221 billion.

Full text:   Republicans came into this campaign believing that it would be a referendum on President Obama, and that still-high unemployment would hand them victory on a silver platter. But given the usual caveats -- a month can be a long time in politics, it's not over until the votes are actually counted, and so on -- it doesn't seem to be turning out that way.
Yet there is a sense in which the election is indeed a referendum, but of a different kind. Voters are, in effect, being asked to deliver a verdict on the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society, on Social Security, Medicare and, yes, Obamacare, which represents an extension of that legacy. Will they vote for politicians who want to replace Medicare with Vouchercare, who denounce Social Security as "collectivist" (as Paul Ryan once did), who dismiss those who turn to social insurance programs as people unwilling to take responsibility for their lives?
If the polls are any indication, the result of that referendum will be a clear reassertion of support for the safety net, and a clear rejection of politicians who want to return us to the Gilded Age. But here's the question: Will that election result be honored?
I ask that question because we already know what Mr. Obama will face if re-elected: a clamor from Beltway insiders demanding that he immediately return to his failed political strategy of 2011, in which he made a Grand Bargain over the budget deficit his overriding priority. Now is the time, he'll be told, to fix America's entitlement problem once and for all. There will be calls -- as there were at the time of the Democratic National Convention -- for him to officially endorse Simpson-Bowles, the budget proposal issued by the co-chairmen of his deficit commission (although never accepted by the commission as a whole).
And Mr. Obama should just say no, for three reasons.
First, despite years of dire warnings from people like, well, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, we are not facing any kind of fiscal crisis. Indeed, U.S. borrowing costs are at historic lows, with investors actually willing to pay the government for the privilege of owning inflation-protected bonds. So reducing the budget deficit just isn't the top priority for America at the moment; creating jobs is. For now, the administration's political capital should be devoted to passing something like last year's American Jobs Act and providing effective mortgage debt relief.
Second, contrary to Beltway conventional wisdom, America does not have an "entitlements problem." Mainly, it has a health cost problem, private as well as public, which must be addressed (and which the Affordable Care Act at least starts to address). It's true that there's also, even aside from health care, a gap between the services we're promising and the taxes we're collecting -- but to call that gap an "entitlements" issue is already to accept the very right-wing frame that voters appear to be in the process of rejecting.
Finally, despite the bizarre reverence it inspires in Beltway insiders -- the same people, by the way, who assured us that Paul Ryan was a brave truth-teller -- the fact is that Simpson-Bowles is a really bad plan, one that would undermine some key pieces of our safety net. And if a re-elected president were to endorse it, he would be betraying the trust of the voters who returned him to office.
Consider, in particular, the proposal to raise the Social Security retirement age, supposedly to reflect rising life expectancy. This is an idea Washington loves -- but it's also totally at odds with the reality of an America in which rising inequality is reflected not just in the quality of life but in its duration. For while average life expectancy has indeed risen, that increase is confined to the relatively well-off and well-educated -- the very people who need Social Security least. Meanwhile, life expectancy is actually falling for a substantial part of the nation.
Now, there's no mystery about why Simpson-Bowles looks the way it does. It was put together in a political environment in which progressives, and even supporters of the safety net as we know it, were very much on the defensive -- an environment in which conservatives were presumed to be in the ascendant, and in which bipartisanship was effectively defined as the effort to broker deals between the center-right and the hard right.
Barring an upset, however, that environment will come to an end on Nov. 6. This election is, as I said, shaping up as a referendum on our social insurance system, and it looks as if Mr. Obama will emerge with a clear mandate for preserving and extending that system. It would be a terrible mistake, both politically and for the nation's future, for him to let himself be talked into snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

Full text:   EVERYONE knows that America's tax code is a mess, yet despite considerable talk when elections come around, we've done nothing substantial to fix it. What is odd is that there is broad agreement on what should be done. We should strive to get the "lowest possible tax rates on the broadest base," as five well-known conservative economists put it recently.
In a nutshell, the fewer deductions and other "tax expenditures" we have, the lower the rates can be. That part is simple.
The problem is that cutting rates is more popular than closing loopholes, especially those like the mortgage-interest deduction that are used by millions of taxpayers. But there is a possible solution.
I call it the modified Reagan 28 plan, or just the "28 plan" for short. It is a simple framework for thinking about tax policy. Though I've named it in honor of Ronald Reagan, it is similar in many ways to the ideas proposed by the Bowles-Simpson commission, which is a good starting point for any serious discussion of tax reform.
My first premise is that we should devise tax policy from the top down. As everyone now knows, nearly half of American households do not pay any income tax, though they do pay Social Security taxes, sales taxes and so forth. And many households that earn enough to start paying some income tax are essentially on a flat-tax system, because few itemize their deductions. That means they mostly just pay a percentage of their income above the threshold where taxes kick in. So let's think about how to tax the rich, then work our way down the income ladder.
For this discussion, let's define a household as rich if its income exceeds $1 million a year. In fact, my plan applies only to the income such households earn above that threshold. And I can state my idea in just one sentence: All income above $1 million a year for a household will be taxed at 28 percent. There are no deductions, and all income, including capital gains and dividends, is included. President Reagan favored something like this approach. His 1986 tax plan also taxed dividends and capital gains at the same 28 percent rate, as would the Bowles-Simpson proposal.
While we're at it, let's make the corporate tax rate 28 percent, too, because our current rate is high by international standards. Oh, and the estate tax exemption? On amounts above $3.5 million for individuals, the rate would be, of course, 28 percent.
What would this plan accomplish? First, by establishing the same marginal rate on all income sources, the incentives disappear for shifting from one source of income to another. Although there is much discussion about how taxes affect people's willingness to work, most people don't have much flexibility about how many hours they're employed. For the rich, however, it can be relatively easy to switch income from a highly taxed category to one that is taxed at a lower rate. One reason that Mitt Romney's taxes have been so low -- he paid an effective federal income tax rate of only 14 percent in the two years for which he has disclosed his returns -- is that venture capitalists have figured out a legal way for the incentive fees they receive to be treated as capital gains income, currently taxed at a rate of only 15 percent. If we tax all income at the same rate, these games will end.
But what about the argument that taxing capital gains and dividends at the same rate as ordinary income will discourage investment? I don't find this claim convincing. People are willing to buy bonds issued by corporations even though the interest is taxed as ordinary income, and I don't see why investors need a special tax break to induce them to put money in the stock market, which has historically paid high returns. One bonus from adopting this plan would be a short-term windfall to the Treasury from investors realizing their capital gains now, in order to pay the current, lower rate. (Also, I do think that capital gains taxes should be adjusted for inflation.)
Wouldn't nonprofit organizations suffer if we eliminated the charitable deduction for the wealthy? There might be some effect, but notice that by reducing the marginal rate to 28 percent, the tax incentive to donate would already be quite a bit lower than at current rates of 35 percent or more. And if this political season has taught us anything, it's that rich people don't need a tax deduction to contribute to causes they believe in. (Political contributions are not deductible.)
We could pay for the reduction in the corporation income tax by broadening that base as well. There are many special deals -- like subsidies to oil companies -- that could be eliminated.
OF course, I haven't said what would happen to the households in the middle, or what the taxes would be on the first $1 million for the rich, but the Bowles-Simpson commission offers a comprehensive plan that is in the spirit of my suggestion. One possibility is to scale back deductions smoothly, starting at household incomes above $250,000, and completely eliminate them for incomes above $1 million. That would leave the popular deductions fully in place for those earning less than $250,000. A more radical plan, curtailing deductions for this large group, is probably politically infeasible, at least for now.
And what if the resulting revenue falls a bit short of what we need to start trimming the deficit? I suggest that we get our gasoline tax more in line with those of the rest of the world. Gradually raising it to something like $1 a gallon would both bring in revenue and help reduce emissions. In the long term, we could set the rate as a percentage of the price at the pump. Maybe 28 percent?

Abstract: Mr. Zandi and other economists predict that it will be significantly higher for the third quarter ending this month thanks to this summer's stock market rally and recent strong gains in housing prices. According to a Gallup poll this year, 54 percent of Americans said they owned stock either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and retirement plans.

Full text:   "This president cannot tell us that you are better off today than when he took office," Mitt Romney said as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination. Since then, "Are you better off?" has become a central theme of the campaign, and is likely to surface next week at the first presidential debate.
Are Americans better off? By one important measure, that depends on who you are. Unfortunately for Mr. Romney, the group most likely to answer with a resounding "no" -- those who should be most receptive to his message -- appear to be the least likely to vote for him.
In raising the issue to such prominence, Mr. Romney is echoing Ronald Reagan's famous closing during his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter, which is widely credited with swinging the election in Mr. Reagan's favor. Exactly what he and other politicians have meant by the phrase "better off" is vague, but many commentators have looked to the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, household income and inflation rate as relevant statistics for comparison.
By these measures, the answer is mixed. The unemployment rate in August was 8.1 percent, down from 10 percent in October 2009 but higher than the 7.8 percent in January when President Obama took office.
Gross domestic product increased at an estimated 2 percent rate in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second. While slow, that was a substantial improvement from the 3.8 percent contraction reported in January 2009, which was the worst drop in 27 years. Inflation was 1.7 percent in August, well within the Federal Reserve's target range and much better than the modest but worrisome deflation of early 2009.
Median household income for 2011 was an estimated $50,054, compared with $52,546 in 2008, according to the Census Bureau. About the best the Obama administration has been able to say is that trends show slow but steady improvement.
This ambiguity shows up in the latest polls. In a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS poll released this week, likely voters in Florida split 40 percent to 43 percent on the question of whether the United States is better off today than it was four years ago, with 40 percent saying the country is better off. In Ohio, it was tied at 39 percent, and in Pennsylvania it was 35 percent to 41 percent. Remaining voters thought the country was about the same or were undecided. But disaffection with the economy didn't translate into support for Mr. Romney, who trailed Mr. Obama by widening margins in all three states.
There's another measure that may help explain why Mr. Romney seems to be getting so little traction from the "are you better off" issue. It's the wealth effect, which occurs when rising asset prices make people feel more secure. And in that respect, the answer is clear. As Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics, told me this week, "From the perspective of the aggregate household balance sheet, we're unambiguously better off than four years ago and are almost all the way back" to the peak before the financial crisis.
That's because of a combination of rising asset prices, especially American stocks and real estate, and lower household debt. Total household net worth, which is assets minus liabilities, was $50.4 trillion in the first quarter of 2009 when Mr. Obama took office. It was $62.7 trillion in the second quarter 2012, which ended June 30. Mr. Zandi and other economists predict that it will be significantly higher for the third quarter ending this month thanks to this summer's stock market rally and recent strong gains in housing prices. It might soon hit the peak of $67.4 trillion reached in the third quarter of 2007.
A healthy household balance sheet is a crucial measure of financial security, and it affects a majority of the population. According to a Gallup poll this year, 54 percent of Americans said they owned stock either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and retirement plans. In that regard, they are much better off now than when Mr. Obama took office.
From January 2009 until this week, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had gained over 55 percent. The Nasdaq composite index has surpassed levels last reached in 2007. There has been a stream of headlines and news reports about stocks hitting new highs.
Even more Americans own real estate. Sixty-two percent reported owning homes in April, according to Gallup. Housing prices are still far below their 2006 peak, but most of the collapse took place before Mr. Obama took office. The Case-Shiller index of 20 cities stood at 146.34 in January 2009 and hit a low of 134.10 in March of this year, according to Standard & Poor's, which compiles the index. This week it was 144.61, a steep 1.6 percent monthly rise from August. Even the hardest-hit low end of the market showed strong gains, and many commentators predicted housing prices had bottomed and begun a sustained rise.
The luxury housing market, especially in cities like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami, has fared even better, with many properties selling at headline-grabbing record prices. At the extreme upper end, several Manhattan condos have recently sold at prices close to $100 million.
For voters with short-term memories, these trends have been even more pronounced in the last year. Stock prices are up about 14 percent so far in 2012, and much of the gain in housing prices has come in recent months.
And a wide array of assets typically owned by the wealthy have surged in value, from jewelry to wine, antiques and art.
The combination of rising stock prices and a rebound in the real estate market may be a reason consumer confidence rose sharply this week to its highest level in seven months. The survey shows that the confidence is even stronger among people with higher income levels.
The wealth effect may also help explain why the rhetorical question was so successful for Mr. Reagan. The S.& P. 500 gained 27 percent during the Carter presidency, but those gains were more than eroded by inflation, which was near 14 percent when Mr. Carter left office. Median home prices went from $45,500 in January 1977 to $67,600 in January 1981, close to a 50 percent rise. But those otherwise impressive gains were similarly undercut by inflation, not to mention widespread anxiety about whether it could be contained. Inflation has been negligible during the Obama presidency.
Of course, the wealth effect benefits only those who own assets that are appreciating in value. "It's a higher-end story," said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who has written extensively about the wealth effect. "For most people, their wealth is their house. But I think housing and stock prices are having an effect. People are reading that the stock market is hitting new highs and that housing prices are rising. That affects future expectations. Look at consumer confidence, which is way up. It doesn't mean they'll go out and buy big-ticket items, but it does affect how they feel."
Mr. Baker added, "The irony is that the Obama administration has done very well for the top 10 percent of households and certainly for the top 1 percent." Mr. Romney himself surely falls into that category, given his high exposure to equity markets and the millions in capital gains he reported in 2010 and 2011.
By contrast, "For low-income households, their balance sheets are still under pressure," Mr. Zandi said. "Many have been through foreclosure. They may have student loans, and they're still struggling with credit card debt and auto loans."
This is the group most likely to feel they aren't better off, and thus be more inclined to vote for Mr. Romney. But they also tend to be among the 47 percent of the population with no exposure to rising stock prices. Although Mr. Romney has said he wants to be a president for all Americans, that's the same percentage of the population he seemed to write off when he said "my job is not to worry about these people" at a Florida fund-raiser.
Conversely, people who are unambiguously better off would seem likely to vote for Mr. Obama. But wealthy people aren't flocking to the president. "It's much more complex," Mr. Zandi said. Household net worth, no matter how much it's improved, "isn't what really drives people's thinking. Many wealthy people prefer Romney's tax policies, and believe they'd be even better off with him as president."
Still, the wealth effect seems to be blunting the impact of the question, despite widespread public dissatisfaction with the economy. "If you look at the upper end of the scale, maybe the top third, their balance sheets are as good as they've ever been," Mr. Zandi said. "They've got a mortgage at 4 percent and they're refinancing lower. It's basically free money. Their stock portfolios are back up and housing is kicking in. They're feeling good."

Full text:   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans increased their spending in August even though their incomes barely grew. Much of the spending increase went to pay higher gas prices, which may have forced consumers to cut back elsewhere.
The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August from July. It was the biggest jump since February.
Gas prices rose nearly 50 cents a gallon in July and August, but have since leveled off. Excluding the impact of higher gas prices and other price gains, spending ticked up only 0.1 percent last month.
Income grew only 0.1 percent, too. But after accounting for inflation and deducting taxes, income actually fell 0.3 percent -- the poorest performance since November.
The increase in prices and slower growth in pay forced people to save less.
"The U.S. personal income and spending data for August are worse than the headline figures suggest and indicate that subdued jobs growth is hitting incomes," said Paul Dales, senior United States economist with Capital Economics. The increase "was largely due to extra spending caused by the surge in gasoline prices."
"American household spending and income remain weak, indicating continued subpar growth," said Sal Gautieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The combination of weak income growth and a big jump in spending meant that households saved less. The saving rate dropped to 3.7 percent of after-tax income in August, down from 4.1 percent in July.
A price gauge tied to consumer spending jumped 0.4 percent, reflecting the rise in energy prices. It was the biggest one-month jump since March 2011. Excluding food and energy, prices barely changed. Over the last year, prices excluding food and energy rose only 1.6 percent, well below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent inflation target.
Consumers spent 0.9 percent more at retail businesses in August from July. The retail sales report showed Americans cut back on clothing, electronics and at general merchandise outlets.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment, released Friday, rose this month to its second-highest level in nearly five years. A separate survey from the Conference Board said consumer confidence jumped in September to its highest level since February.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- A president struggling simultaneously to cope with anti-American tumult in the Middle East and fix stubborn economic trouble at home: Is President Obama replaying the one-term presidency of Jimmy Carter?
So Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan have repeatedly suggested, trying to use the glum precedent of the Carter presidency to taint Mr. Obama's record and produce the same electoral result 32 years later.
The Republican candidates and their supporters have played the Carter card not nearly as often as the Obama team has brought up George W. Bush, who lurks near Mr. Carter in the lower ranks on historians' ratings of American presidents. But they have pressed the Carter parallels all the harder since militants assaulted an American diplomatic mission in Libya and killed four Americans, saying it recalled the Iranian hostage crisis that dominated the news as Ronald Reagan ran his successful campaign against Mr. Carter.
"I mean, turn on the TV and it reminds you of 1979 Tehran, but they are burning our flags in capitals all around the world, they are storming our embassies," said Mr. Ryan, the Republican nominee for vice president, on a visit to Ohio on Monday. "We've lost four of our diplomats, and what is the signal that our government is sending the rest of the world?"
In a campaign stop in Virginia in May, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama was overseeing "the most anti-small business administration I've seen probably since Carter," one of several campaign statements linking the current economic doldrums to the infamous "stagflation" of the late 1970s.
Historians say the broad parallels between Mr. Carter's term and Mr. Obama's make for legitimate comparisons. But many of the details differ, and some tilt decisively in Mr. Obama's favor, both factually and politically.
And even some Republicans say that Mr. Obama's greater personal popularity may mean the Carter label will not stick. Mr. Obama's latest Gallup approval rating was near 50 percent; Mr. Carter's was 37 percent in roughly the same period.
"The big difference is personality," said Frank J. Donatelli, a veteran Republican operative who helped run Mr. Reagan's 1980 campaign against Mr. Carter and later served as political director in the Reagan White House.
"Carter was dour, inward-looking, suspicious by nature," he said. "Obama's not. Despite presiding over a terrible economy, Obama has remained pretty popular personally."
Mr. Donatelli said he did see "weak foreign policy and economic mismanagement" as a valid criticism of both presidents.
"What defeated Carter," he said, "was the public's sense that he couldn't handle the job. That's the point Romney and Ryan and are trying to make about Obama -- that however nice a guy he may be, he's in over his head."
Gerald M. Rafshoon, who served as communications director in the Carter White House, said Mr. Carter's experience showed the hazards of a volatile world for an incumbent president.
"All the advertising in the world can be rendered irrelevant because as an incumbent, you're at the mercy of events," he said. "The taking of an embassy was a symbol to Americans: 'Why are we being pushed around by this third-rate power?' "
On the surface, at least, the recent anti-American protests across the Muslim world do bear resemblance to those in Iran after 1979. Both came in the chaotic jostling for power that followed the overthrow of authoritarian leaders.
But "America Held Hostage," as ABC News called it in daily reports, dominated the news for more than a year. The standoff came to symbolize American helplessness and frustration.
By contrast, the deaths of American diplomats in Libya are not a continuing crisis. In fact, they prompted thousands of Libyans to demonstrate in protest against the violence, especially the killing of the widely admired American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens. Mr. Obama has responded, in part, with tough talk, vowing at the United Nations on Tuesday to be "relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice."
Or consider the risky covert missions that will always define the two presidencies, and the undeniable role of luck in shaping a president's image. Mr. Carter gave the orders for a daring mission in April 1980 to dispatch eight helicopters to rescue the American hostages; a sandstorm, mechanical problems and a fiery collision resulted in disastrous failure, with eight servicemen dead and no hostages freed.
Mr. Obama, of course, approved his own covert helicopter operation -- and its risks were underscored when one helicopter crashed. But the operation ended in triumph, with Osama bin Laden dead and all members of the SEAL team safe.
Mr. Obama began his presidency by reaching out to Iran and gave a tempered response when the pro-democracy Green Movement protests broke out there in 2009 -- a position the Romney campaign has seized on to accuse the president of "projecting weakness."
But the case for weakness runs up against Mr. Obama's record when it comes to the targeted killing of terrorism suspects, with hundreds of drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. On Iran, administration officials point to tough sanctions and the president's vow not to permit the country to obtain a nuclear weapon.
David Patrick Houghton, a political scientist at the University of Central Florida and author of a book on the Iran hostage crisis, said the Carter comparisons were "mostly unfair" -- both to Mr. Carter and Mr. Obama. He singled out as "utterly false" Mr. Romney's claim that Mr. Reagan's tough reputation caused Iran to release the American hostages just as he became president; in fact, the Carter administration had negotiated their release.
"This campaign has become a kind of opportunity to fling around bogus history," he said.
David Farber, a Temple University historian, said Mr. Obama appeared to have learned from Mr. Carter's mistakes
Notably, the president has avoided any echo of Mr. Carter's famous 1979 speech about a "crisis of confidence" that he said had struck "at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will." While well received initially, it became a political millstone for Mr. Carter, who was accused of blaming the public for the country's troubles.
"Rhetorically, Obama hasn't fallen into that trap," Mr. Farber said.
Mr. Farber said the economy was getting worse in 1980, with the complication of inflation on top of high unemployment. However slowly, it appears to be improving today, making it less devastating to Mr. Obama's campaign.
But Mr. Farber pointed to image as the bottom line. Both men were "outsiders" when they reached the White House, he said. "But Obama turned that outsider quality into a kind of steely leadership," he said. "For all his gifts, Carter was never able to do that."

Full text:   PARIS -- President François Hollande, a Socialist who was elected this year on a pro-growth platform, presented a budget on Friday that would produce the biggest cut in the public deficit in 30 years while raising the top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers to 75 percent from the current 41 percent.
The budget, which will be presented to Parliament next month, is intended to bring France's annual deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, down from 4.5 percent this year, in line with promises both to Brussels and to the markets. It places heavy emphasis on austerity measures, raising new revenues through increased corporate and personal taxes, and freezing total government spending.
Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault on Friday called it "a combat budget for the recovery of the country." But he insisted that the burden would fall mainly on corporations, already anxious about worsening French competitiveness, and on the relatively well-off. He said that "90 percent of the French who pay income tax, with unchanged incomes, will not be taxed more."
Mr. Hollande made a point during his campaign that policies of undiluted "austerity" should be modified by a push for economic growth. He demanded the renegotiation of a European Union agreement to enshrine debt limits into the law and to punish governments that break mandated limits on annual budget deficits and cumulative debt.
In the end, he had to be satisfied with another parallel and more modest agreement on growth. And in this budget, Mr. Hollande and his finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, are making it clear that France will stick to its promises of debt reduction, even with lower growth estimates, in order to keep the trust of the market that buys French bonds.
They are doing so by raising taxes on corporations, the rich and the middle class and freezing public spending, though not cutting it. Spain and Italy have been under pressure from the markets, being forced to pay interest rates approaching 6 percent, but France has been treated as an exception, paying rates that are closer to Germany's 1 percent to 2 percent than to Italy's.
The Hollande government, though internally divided about how to do it, intends to keep it that way, since the lower rates have meant a significant budget savings. Every 0.1 percent rise in French yields, Mr. Moscovici has said, costs France about $260 million annually, with a total debt projected to rise nonetheless to 91.3 percent of gross domestic product.
Mr. Hollande has further promised to balance the budget by the end of his five-year term, but according to figures released today, he will not make it.
After raising about $9 billion in new taxes and modest cuts this year, with France's growth flat, Mr. Hollande had to find an additional $39 billion in this 2013 budget to hit the 3 percent goal. The total could go up if France's growth, estimated at 0.8 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, continues to slip and unemployment, which has risen for 16 straight months and is now around 10 percent, continues to climb. Most analysts forecast a lower growth rate of 0.5 percent or even 0.3 percent, which will mean that the government would miss the 3 percent target.
Business and consumer confidence is down, and there is no indication that the crisis has peaked. The economy has had three consecutive quarters of zero growth, which will not be helped by the higher taxes Mr. Hollande is proposing. And Mr. Hollande's personal popularity is down sharply in the four months since he narrowly beat Nicolas Sarkozy to become the first French Socialist president since François Mitterrand.
Mr. Hollande's problem is that in the middle of the euro crisis and flat growth, with pressure from Brussels and the markets, it is hard to live up to the hopes of his voters for the traditionally Socialist cure of higher public spending.
Mr. Hollande's budget finds the extra $39 billion by raising French taxes still further, upsetting businessmen and the middle class. About $13 billion will come from new taxes on corporations and an additional $10 billion from new income taxes, including a new higher rate of 45 percent on incomes over $193,000 and a controversial, largely symbolic and supposedly temporary wealth tax of 75 percent on earnings of over $1.3 million. Those higher taxes, too, have been criticized by business leaders as a large disincentive for talented people to work in France, criticisms echoed by the opposition center-right parties.
Under the new budget, normal tax brackets will not rise with inflation. Capital gains will be taxed like ordinary income and various tax breaks will be removed, including a limit on the wealth tax.
Another $13 billion is to come from a freeze in public spending, with ministries required to make some cuts to keep the overall state budget the same, adjusting for inflation.
By this method, Mr. Hollande has argued, France is avoiding austerity and its impact on ordinary people, instead putting the burden on corporations and those who can best afford it. But critics like the economist Nicolas Baverez have argued that the Socialist government is simply putting off a day of reckoning with a bloated public sector that still accounts for 56 percent of gross domestic product.
"I don't want a policy of austerity, hitting salaries, weakening the state and turning it into a pauper," said Mr. Moscovici, the finance minister. He has said that more spending cuts will need to come in future years, especially to meet the goal of a balanced budget by 2017. But the government is counting on renewed growth to help shrink the deficit, presuming 2 percent growth in 2014, 2015 and 2016, which may be overly optimistic.
Mr. Hollande campaigned on a budget savings to come half from new taxes and half from spending cuts. He is clearly front-loading the taxes, which may give him more leeway when and if growth picks up again.
The 3 percent goal is important, since Spain, even after the tough budget it announced Thursday, foresees a deficit of 4.5 percent in 2012. The United States and Britain, by contrast, with their own central banks, will have projected deficits of 6.3 and 6.6 percent respectively.

Full text:   KAMPALA, Uganda -- The presidents of Sudan and South Sudan signed a long-awaited cooperation agreement on Thursday, paving the way for the resumption of oil exports and casting their ailing economies a desperately needed lifeline. But several analysts said the deal came up far short.
The status of Abyei, a contested border area, was not settled. Nor was that of several other disputed territories, differences that have driven the countries' two leaders, historic enemies, nearly to all-out war.
"The seeds of further conflict are firmly planted in this partial deal," John Prendergast, a founder of the Enough Project, an antigenocide organization that watches the two Sudans closely, said by e-mail.
Last year, amid great jubilation, South Sudan split off from Sudan after decades of guerrilla struggle. But the divorce was messy. Forces from the two countries have battled intensely over the past year amid confusion over disputed areas and contested oil fields.
South Sudan has billions of barrels of oil, but the pipeline to export it runs through the north. The south shut down production last winter, which deeply wounded the economies on both sides of the border, leading to skyrocketing inflation, protests and rising discontent.
Since then, negotiations have gone around and around, with increasing pressure by the United States, the African Union and the United Nations to come to an agreement. Since Sunday, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, and Salva Kiir, South Sudan's leader, had been holed up together in negotiating rooms in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, trying to hammer out a compromise. For years, the two men fought each other on the battlefield, and it seems that the history of bitterness has been extremely difficult to overcome.
On Thursday, Mr. Bashir and Mr. Kiir emerged to announce that they would demilitarize the border -- a step that had been agreed to in principle last year but was almost instantly violated when Sudan began a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in the Nuba Mountains, near the border. The two sides also committed to resuming cross-border trade and allowing citizens from each side to move freely.
And they agreed to resume oil production -- again, an issue that had been previously covered, with a deal reached in August, but had not yet taken effect because of mutual mistrust. "This basically kicks the can down the road," said EJ Hogendoorn, the Horn of Africa director for the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization.
"Oil production will give both governments some breathing room, since their economies were collapsing, but unless there is a resolution to Abyei" and other conflict-ridden parts of Sudan, he said in an e-mail, "enormous frictions remain."
One person close to the talks tried to put a positive gloss on them, saying the negotiating session was a "crunch summit" and the border deal was "serious progress."
But most analysts disagree.
"Of course, there will be a tremendous amount of overselling whatever agreement is signed," Eric Reeves, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and a prolific blogger on the Sudans, wrote in an e-mail. "This is a survivalist regime in Khartoum," the capital of Sudan, "and the agreement signed is precisely what one would expect from survivalists. This fundamental feature won't change."

Abstract: Mr. Ryan's original plan called for giving future beneficiaries fixed amounts of money to buy private insurance -- and it limited the growth of those payments to the rate of inflation.

Full text:   The Obama campaign has run advertisements charging that Mitt Romney's Medicare plan "could raise seniors' costs up to $6,400 a year" and that his tax proposal "would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle-class families by up to $2,000 a year."
In making such assertions, the Obama campaign is taking advantage of the many unknown details of Mr. Romney's policy proposals by filling in the blanks in the least flattering light, often relying on the findings of research organizations. In doing so, the campaign has leveled some charges that are more specific than the known facts warrant and others that are most likely wrong -- though Mr. Romney's decision not to provide more detailed explanations of his Medicare and tax proposals have made it difficult to provide a fuller evaluation of some of the competing assertions.
The outdated charge that future Medicare beneficiaries could face $6,400 in higher costs comes from an analysis of an old proposal by Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, that has since been revised, a point that President Obama himself acknowledged in a speech last week. And the assertion that Mr. Romney would raise taxes on the middle class -- contrary to his oft-repeated pledge not to -- is based on an independent analysis of his tax plan that found it was "not mathematically possible" for his plan to achieve all of its goals without raising taxes on the middle class.
Now, as both campaigns prepare for the first Obama-Romney debate next week, Republicans have been signaling that they plan to more aggressively question the accuracy of the Obama campaign's assertions. The Obama campaign has run ads distorting Mr. Romney's abortion position; Republicans and some independent groups have questioned the president's decision to count the savings the come from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan toward deficit reduction; and Mr. Obama recently said incorrectly that Operation Fast and Furious, a botched gun trafficking case, began during George W. Bush's administration. (A similar program was started under Mr. Bush, but Operation Fast and Furious began in October 2009.)
In an interview this month with ABC News, Mr. Romney -- whose own campaign has been criticized for making misleading claims -- suggested that he would be more aggressive in questioning Mr. Obama's accuracy. "I think the challenge that I'll have in the debate is that the president tends to, how shall I say it, to say things that aren't true," he said. And Karl Rove, who was Mr. Bush's political strategist and who founded a political action committee that opposes Mr. Obama, wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that Mr. Romney should make the case that "Mr. Obama doesn't shoot straight because he can't defend his record."
How both sides talk about Medicare and taxes is likely to come under increasing scrutiny.
The Obama administration's charge that beneficiaries could see their Medicare payments rise by $6,400 under Mr. Romney is based on an out-of-date analysis. Mr. Ryan's original plan called for giving future beneficiaries fixed amounts of money to buy private insurance -- and it limited the growth of those payments to the rate of inflation. Since health care costs rise faster than inflation, such a plan would leave beneficiaries to face higher costs.
Mr. Ryan then revised his plan, and Mr. Romney has further altered it. The Romney campaign's policy director, Lanhee Chen, wrote last month that while older people with higher incomes may be asked to pay more, "all seniors will be guaranteed sufficient support because the support is actually set based on what plans will cost."
But the campaign has not detailed how the plan would work. A question-and-answer section of the campaign's Web site puts it this way: "How high will the premium support be? How quickly will it grow? Mitt continues to work on refining the details of his plan, and he is exploring different options for ensuring that future seniors receive the premium support they need while also ensuring that competitive pressures encourage providers to improve quality and control cost."
Mr. Romney has in the past suggested limiting the growth of the subsidies. He told The Washington Examiner last December that allowing the subsidies to grow at the rate of medical inflation "would have no particular impact on reining in the excessive cost of our entitlement program." So if his campaign's theory that increased competition among private plans will slow health care costs proves wrong, future beneficiaries could face higher costs. And Mr. Romney's pledge to repeal Mr. Obama's health care law would cost them more, since part of the law helps beneficiaries pay for prescription drugs. But without knowing the size of the subsidies or how fast they would grow, it is impossible to assign a dollar value to the cost, as the Obama campaign has tried to do.
The Obama campaign's television ad charging that Mr. Romney would raise taxes on the middle class was found to be accurate by several fact-checking organizations, even though it runs directly counter to Mr. Romney's pledge that he will not do so.
The ad is based on an analysis of Mr. Romney's vague proposals by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group, which found that it was impossible for his plan to achieve all of its stated goals. Mr. Romney wants to cut income tax rates by 20 percent while continuing to collect the same amount of revenue by eliminative tax breaks -- all without raising taxes on the middle class.
The center projected that the tax cuts alone would reduce revenues by $456 billion in 2015. But the center's director, Donald Marron, later wrote that he did not read the analysis as "evidence that Governor Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class in order to cut taxes for the rich" but rather as "showing that his plan can't accomplish all his stated objectives."
Mr. Romney has declined to say which tax breaks he would reduce.
An adviser to the Romney campaign, Kevin A. Hassett, suggested this week at a panel discussion that Mr. Romney might scale back his cuts to the tax rates if he failed to eliminate enough tax breaks to make up for the lost revenue. Mr. Hassett said that Mr. Romney would not raise taxes on the middle class. The Romney campaign later posted a statement on its Web site reiterating the outline of its tax plan, including the call to cut rates by 20 percent without losing revenue.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- At the dawn of the civilian nuclear age in the 1950s, one of the pressing questions was how to find enough fuel for reactors and bombs. The government and the private sector seized on a man-made substitute for natural uranium, producing about 3,400 pounds of an exotic and expensive material called uranium 233.
Today, the problem is how to safely get rid of it.
"We do consider this to be waste," said David G. Huizenga, the senior administrator for environmental management at the Energy Department. "There's no further need for it."
Uranium 233 looked attractive because it could be made in a reactor from thorium, a cheap and abundant radioactive metal, and, almost magically, the reactor would produce more fuel than it consumed. Utilities manufactured some of it at the Indian Point I reactor in Westchester County, N.Y., which is now retired, and at reactors in Colorado, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
But in the end, ordinary uranium was cheaper, and 233 was not needed.
"Nuclear physicists weren't geologists and didn't understand the supply of uranium," said Frank N. Von Hippel, a physicist and public policy specialist at Princeton. "It turned out there was more uranium than people thought and less nuclear power than people thought there would be."
Ordinary uranium also proved to be much easier to work with than 233. But the government assembled a few bombs with the 233 version, and a research reactor in Tennessee briefly switched to it as fuel in 1968. But very little was used, so the material sat for decades in government laboratories and weapons plants.
Now, wary of the security risks posed by the stockpiles, the Energy Department is making plans to dispose of them at a cost estimated at $473 million. The department faces other disposal challenges, including how to handle tens of thousands of tons of spent fuel from civilian reactors, but uranium 233 is different, given that in the proper form it could easily be used to make a bomb.
Robert Alvarez, a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies who was an Energy Department adviser during the Clinton administration, estimates that the government spent at least $5.5 billion, accounting for inflation, to produce the uranium 233. He contends that the government is poised to compound its original error in making the material by disposing of it in a way that is not secure.
The department's plan is to take the uranium made at Indian Point, now stored in 403 stainless steel tubes at a plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and bury the containers at a low-level waste dump that consists of trenches that are up to 40 feet deep at the Nevada National Security Site, where nuclear weapons were tested until 1992.
Workers will dig narrow "slit trenches" at the bottom of the standard ones, descending another 8 to 10 feet.
The locations would not be disclosed, and anyone bent on retrieving the material would not know where the slits were within the trenches. The uranium 233 is in a ceramic form that binds to the metal of the tubes, which are welded shut, providing an extra level of protection, the department says.
Energy Department officials said that restoring 233 to a form that could be used in weapons was beyond the industrial capacity of most countries and that retrieving it would require heavy equipment. Still, the hardest part of making a uranium bomb has already been accomplished -- separating the isotopes that split, and thus are bomb fuel, from the isotopes that do not.
Because the uranium 233 is mixed in with dangerously radioactive materials, it is "self-protecting" to an extent, said Charles D. Ferguson, the president of the Federation of American Scientists and an expert on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. Over time, he said, the radiation will diminish, and some of it has died away because the uranium 233 is 50 to 60 years old.
Yet Mr. Alvarez maintains that the disposal plan is insufficient. Shallow land burial "sets a bad precedent in terms of international safeguards," he said.
In a recent research paper, he also argued that the material should be made useless for making bombs by diluting it with a plentiful form of uranium that will not sustain a nuclear reaction.
It is not clear what that would cost, but the Energy Department has rejected the additional expense as unnecessary.

Full text:   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian autoworkers at Ford have voted to accept the contract that their union leadership negotiated last week, their union said Sunday.
The Canadian Auto Workers union said 82 percent of its Ford members had accepted the new four-year deal. The union did not indicate how many of its 4,500 workers at Ford cast ballots.
The union leadership reached an agreement with General Motors last week. G.M. workers are set to vote on the tentative agreement on Wednesday and Thursday. Talks are continuing with Chrysler. The union wants Chrysler to match the deals reached with Ford and G.M.
The Ford and G.M. contracts cut wages for new hires and freeze pay for current workers. But they also give workers lump-sum payments to cover inflation and for ratifying the deals.
Under the deals, the companies will pay new workers 60 percent of the current top wage of $33.89 Canadian dollars ($34.74) an hour, according to the union. That would mean new workers would be paid around $20.33 Canadian dollars ($20.84). They can move up the wage scale and reach the top wage in 10 years.
Workers at the Detroit automakers in the United States approved a similar two-tier wage agreement five years ago, but under those agreements, workers do not automatically get the top wage after 10 years.
Ford said significant cost savings would be realized through the wage structure for new employees. Ford also said the deal would create more than 600 jobs in Canada over the contract's life.
The auto companies had said Canada was the most expensive place in the world to make cars and trucks, and indicated they could move production south if the union did not cut costs.
Canada's advantages in the past -- a weak Canadian dollar and government health care -- have all but vanished compared with the United States. In addition, the United Automobile Workers union in the United States has agreed to steeper concessions than the Canadian union, making United States labor costs cheaper.

Abstract: Consider highway congestion. Because drivers can generally enter a congested highway without charge, they often do so -- thus adding to the crowding. A modest congestion fee, administered with E-ZPass-style technology, would raise needed revenue and provide an incentive to use crowded roads only when the benefits outweigh the social costs.

Full text:   REFERRING to the host of painful economic choices the nation is said to confront, President Obama recently said, "I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy." The Romney-Ryan ticket has also repeatedly stressed that it won't duck the tough issues.
Well and good, except for one thing: The nation doesn't actually face difficult economic choices. Many problems will be expensive to solve, yet we can solve them without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone.
Disrupting the status quo won't appeal to many lobbyists and some ideologues. But bear with me. These remedies rest on solid evidence and common sense.
Let's begin with unemployment. Millions of Americans remain out of work only because employers can already produce more than enough to meet depressed demand. The obvious remedy is to increase total spending. Although economic stimulus has become a controversial topic in the abstract, a few simple observations should persuade every sensible legislator -- perhaps even a majority! -- to support a specific type of higher spending: accelerated refurbishment of our crumbling infrastructure.
Some in Congress have consistently opposed the president's infrastructure proposals, citing the huge national debt. But that's an incoherent objection. If repairs to the Capitol dome or a tattered stretch of interstate highway are postponed, they will just become more costly. Many job seekers have the skills for this work. If we wait, we'll have to bid them away from other tasks. The required materials are cheaper now than they will ever be. And interest rates are at record lows.
Of course, the debt is an important long-run problem, but deferring infrastructure repairs will only worsen it. Relative to current policy, then, such projects would address multiple pressing problems without distress.
Even after the economy is back at full employment, we can free additional resources by taking steps to curb the waste that plagues our current system. The ripest opportunities are in tax policy, an area distorted by decades of lobbying.
A tax on any activity generates revenue and discourages people from pursuing that activity. Perversely, much of our current revenue comes from taxing useful activities.The payroll tax, for example, discourages job creation, and the income tax discourages saving and investment. By shifting taxes toward activities having harmful side effects, we can raise substantial revenue while expanding the economic pie.
Consider highway congestion. Because drivers can generally enter a congested highway without charge, they often do so -- thus adding to the crowding. But many drivers would willingly pay a fee for using that road if it resulted in fewer delays. A modest congestion fee, administered with E-ZPass-style technology, would raise needed revenue and provide an incentive to use crowded roads only when the benefits outweigh the social costs.
Critics object that such fees would harm low-income households. But because the gains far exceed their price, we can redistribute them so that everyone comes out ahead. Some of the new revenue, for example, could support tax relief for low-income households.
So, here again, we can easily free resources for solving an important problem.
Similar spillover effects pervade the economy. People have little incentive to consider the danger of carbon emissions, for example, or the risks that the heavy vehicles they drive are posing to others. Taxing carbon emissions and taxing vehicles by weight would expand the economic pie by curtailing activities that do more harm than good. And because some of the resulting revenue could help low-income families, these taxes, too, needn't be painful.
BY far our largest source of economic waste, however, is the changing context of our spending. The average American wedding, for instance, now costs almost $28,000, up from just $15,000 in 1990, after adjusting for inflation. But spending on a more lavish wedding doesn't make a couple happier; mainly, it just raises the bar that defines special occasions.
The bad news, then, is that much of our extra consumption in recent decades has been social wheel-spinning. But the good news is that it would be relatively simple to redirect such spending toward more pressing purposes. As I described in an earlier column, this could be accomplished by replacing the current income tax with a more steeply progressive consumption tax, making big-ticket spending much more expensive. It's a step that both liberals and conservatives have advocated.
None of these taxes should be levied, however, while the economy is still struggling. But approving them now and scheduling them for phase-in only after the economy rebounds would serve two objectives. First, anxious credit markets would be reassured about the nation's capacity to pay down government debt. And second, the delayed new taxes would speed the recovery by encouraging immediate increases in private spending.
With a carbon tax on the horizon, businesses would rush to develop technologies for adapting to higher energy prices. And consumers would accelerate major purchases to escape the looming consumption tax. The economy would get just the infusion of spending it needs -- without the government's having to spend a penny.
The endless hand-wringing about painful economic choices is misguided. With a few simple policy changes, we could restore full employment, rebuild crumbling infrastructure and pay down the national debt without requiring real sacrifices from anyone.

Full text:   "DON'T fight the Fed," the saying goes. In the current circumstances, with the Federal Reserve using monetary policy to try to spur economic growth, the adage implies that investors should go with the flow by betting on stocks.
Yet it's not entirely clear which stocks they should bet on.
When the Fed started its first round of so-called quantitative easing in late 2008, the move -- wherein the central bank bought up Treasury bonds and other assets to keep interest rates low and promote growth -- eventually led to a period of rising stock prices. And the most economically sensitive groups, like technology shares, were the market's best performers.
In the second round of this strategy, known as QE2, the broad market rose much less, and "the information technology sector did the worst," observed John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist for Oppenheimer Asset Management.
This time around, days after Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, announced yet another round of bond-buying, market strategists and money managers say it's important to look to history as well as to Mr. Bernanke's intent to determine which areas of the market stand to benefit.
For starters, the central bankers assured investors that they would maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy "for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens." In fact, Fed officials said short-term interest rates would remain at extremely low levels through at least mid-2015.
In such an income-starved environment, this means that dividend-paying stocks -- many of which yield more than 10-year Treasury notes -- should do particularly well, market watchers say.
But not just any dividend-paying stock. Because the Fed is making a concerted effort to bolster employment and growth, Mr. Stoltzfus argues that economically cyclical dividend payers stand to benefit the most. This group includes the technology sector, which used to distribute few dividends but has recently become the second-largest source of such income, in dollar terms, among all sectors in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Chris J. Retzler, co-manager of the Needham Growth fund, said the Fed "is trying to push investors into higher-risk assets." As a result, investors should also look at technology companies within the small-company universe, which is generally regarded as a riskier bet than blue chips but offers potentially greater long-term rewards.
Since investors began to anticipate QE3 last month, small-company stocks in general have outpaced the S.& P. 500 index. And small-cap tech stocks have posted market-leading total returns of 11 percent, versus 9.3 percent for tech shares in the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Retzler said that low interest rates could help increase consumer spending, and that one company that could benefit is MaxLinear, whose equipment helps transmit broadband video to cable boxes and mobile phones, he said.
Another higher-risk area that investors shouldn't overlook is the financial sector, Mr. Retzler said, especially because it is directly affected by the Fed's efforts to keep interest rates low and drive asset prices higher.
He favors investment management companies, which generate fees based on the value of total assets under management. One of the top holdings in his fund is Financial Engines, an advisory firm that uses technology to offer portfolio management and advice to 401(k) investors.
"When the markets are doing well, companies like this tend to do well, too," he said.
Ron Muhlenkamp, manager of the Muhlenkamp Fund, said investors should also consider some direct investments in banks. He noted that commercial and industrial loan demand was rising. What's more, as troubled European banks continue to repair their balance sheets, American banks like JPMorgan Chase could start to pick up some global market share.
He also likes regional banks, direct beneficiaries of the improving housing market. Since the start of this month, financial stocks have led the S.& P. 500, posting gains of 5 percent. Yet regional bank shares have done even better, returning nearly 7 percent.
WHERE else could investors look? In each of the first two rounds of quantitative easing, the dollar weakened in value against a basket of foreign currencies. That makes sense, because the Fed is artificially lowering the interest that investors can earn by parking their money in dollar-denominated securities.
True to form, the dollar has lost around 6 percent of its value from summer highs. Yet because crude oil is priced in dollars, the weakening currency has played a part in the recent jump in oil prices. "Elevated oil prices should bode well for the energy sector," said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
Finally, the Fed's ultimate goal may be to reinflate the economy, said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer for Harris Private Bank. One way to profit from inflation down the road is to bet on housing-related assets, like real estate investment trusts. Another, he said, is to invest in companies that can maintain pricing power no matter what happens to costs. This group, he said, includes health care companies, as well as consumer staples companies that make products like soap and toothpaste that households need, regardless of price.

Abstract: The Japanese central bank moved to ease monetary policy Wednesday, saying it would buy more government bonds and other assets, following the United States Federal Reserve in a show of resolve to shore up a shaky economic recovery. Fears of an economic slowdown appear to have overridden worries at the central bank that too loose a monetary policy would lead to runaway inflation.

Full text:   TOKYO -- The Japanese central bank moved to ease monetary policy Wednesday, saying it would buy more government bonds and other assets, following the United States Federal Reserve in a show of resolve to shore up a shaky economic recovery.
The central bank, the Bank of Japan, will expand its asset purchase and loan program by 10 trillion yen, or $126 billion, to 80 trillion yen, the bank announced after a two-day board meeting that ended Wednesday. The purchase program was also extended six months, to the end of 2013.
The program aims to stimulate economic growth by adding to bank reserves and driving down the cost of lending, prompting more money to flow through the economy.
The Bank of Japan downgraded its assessment of the country's export-driven economy, citing slower global demand and fresh uncertainties caused by anti-Japan protests this week in China, a big trading partner.
As expected, the bank kept its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent.
Markets climbed after the bank's announcement, with the Nikkei 225-share index rising 1.19 percent. The yen slipped to a one-month low of 79.20 to the dollar, offering relief to Japanese exporters, who benefit from a weaker home currency.
Finance Minister Jun Azumi praised the central bank's move. "The measures taken were bolder than I had expected," he said. "The government welcomes this decision to more drastically ease monetary policy."
But some analysts said the move fell short of what was needed to head off a slowdown in the world's third-largest economy, after the United States and China. "The basic point remains with this easing as we have seen before -- too little, too late," ING analysts said in a note to clients. They still detected "a lack of conviction" at the bank that its monetary tools would work, which they said would reduce the effect of the bank's action.
The Bank of Japan has come under intense pressure from government officials to maintain its support of the fragile Japanese economy. The bank set an inflation target of 1 percent in February and increased asset purchases in April. Masaaki Shirakawa, the central bank governor, has refrained from further easing since then as economic growth has appeared to gain momentum, buoyed by reconstruction demand since the tsunami disasters last year.
But the outlook has worsened in recent weeks, with sluggish exports causing an unexpected dip in industrial production. Gross domestic product for the April-through-June quarter grew at an annual rate of 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, according to government data released this month, far slower than initially estimated.
And Japan continues to be mired in deflation, with its core price index having fallen 0.3 percent in July from a year earlier. Government figures released Wednesday showed that commercial and residential land prices in Japan dropped in the 12 months that ended July 1, the 21st consecutive year in which they fell, though at a slower pace.
"The pickup in economic activity has come to a pause," the Bank of Japan said in a statement. "There remains a high degree of uncertainty about the global economy," including continued debt problems in Europe and lackluster growth in the United States, it said.
At a news conference, Mr. Shirakawa said that he expected softening exports to delay the Japanese economic recovery by about six months and that the new round of monetary easing was aimed at keeping Japan on the path to sustainable growth and price stability. "Japan achieved high growth in the first half of this year, but we have to be cautious about whether this growth will continue," he said.
The impact of the protests in China on the Japanese economy was uncertain, he added. Set off by competing claims to a group of islands in the East China Sea, angry mobs vandalized Japanese businesses and forced some Japanese manufacturers to close their factories to protect their workers.
The central bank governor's concerns echoed those expressed by economists in recent weeks.
"Incoming data suggest that the Japanese economy is now losing steam much more rapidly and sharply than we expected," Masamichi Adachi, an economist at JPMorgan Securities in Tokyo, said in a note to clients before the bank announced its move. "The possibility of recession cannot be ruled out, especially if recovery of global demand in the coming quarters fails to materialize."
Fears of an economic slowdown appear to have overridden worries at the central bank that too loose a monetary policy would lead to runaway inflation. Takuji Aida, an economist for UBS in Japan, said it would probably be "a few years" before the bank's 1 percent goal could be reached. He said that any recovery in overseas demand would depend on the United States economy.
Japan also faces political uncertainty. The governing Democratic Party, which has had defections amid plunging ratings, is under pressure from the main opposition party to call nationwide elections. A standoff in Parliament has blocked the government from issuing deficit-financing bonds, forcing the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to postpone scheduled public spending -- the first time in decades a prime minister has done so.

Abstract: The number of people who think government spending promotes social mobility has fallen. There's no way the country will trust the Republican Party to reform the welfare state if that party doesn't have a basic commitment to provide a safety net for those who suffer for no fault of their own.

Full text:   In 1980, about 30 percent of Americans received some form of government benefits. Today, as Nicholas Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute has pointed out, about 49 percent do.
In 1960, government transfers to individuals totaled $24 billion. By 2010, that total was 100 times as large. Even after adjusting for inflation, entitlement transfers to individuals have grown by more than 700 percent over the last 50 years. This spending surge, Eberstadt notes, has increased faster under Republican administrations than Democratic ones.
There are sensible conclusions to be drawn from these facts. You could say that the entitlement state is growing at an unsustainable rate and will bankrupt the country. You could also say that America is spending way too much on health care for the elderly and way too little on young families and investments in the future.
But these are not the sensible arguments that Mitt Romney made at a fund-raiser earlier this year. Romney, who criticizes President Obama for dividing the nation, divided the nation into two groups: the makers and the moochers. Forty-seven percent of the country, he said, are people "who are dependent upon government, who believe they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to take care of them, who believe they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it."
This comment suggests a few things. First, it suggests that he really doesn't know much about the country he inhabits. Who are these freeloaders? Is it the Iraq war veteran who goes to the V.A.? Is it the student getting a loan to go to college? Is it the retiree on Social Security or Medicare?
It suggests that Romney doesn't know much about the culture of America. Yes, the entitlement state has expanded, but America remains one of the hardest-working nations on earth. Americans work longer hours than just about anyone else. Americans believe in work more than almost any other people. Ninety-two percent say that hard work is the key to success, according to a 2009 Pew Research Survey.
It says that Romney doesn't know much about the political culture. Americans haven't become childlike worshipers of big government. On the contrary, trust in government has declined. The number of people who think government spending promotes social mobility has fallen.
The people who receive the disproportionate share of government spending are not big-government lovers. They are Republicans. They are senior citizens. They are white men with high school degrees. As Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution has noted, the people who have benefited from the entitlements explosion are middle-class workers, more so than the dependent poor.
Romney's comments also reveal that he has lost any sense of the social compact. In 1987, during Ronald Reagan's second term, 62 percent of Republicans believed that the government has a responsibility to help those who can't help themselves. Now, according to the Pew Research Center, only 40 percent of Republicans believe that.
The Republican Party, and apparently Mitt Romney, too, has shifted over toward a much more hyperindividualistic and atomistic social view -- from the Reaganesque language of common citizenship to the libertarian language of makers and takers. There's no way the country will trust the Republican Party to reform the welfare state if that party doesn't have a basic commitment to provide a safety net for those who suffer for no fault of their own.
The final thing the comment suggests is that Romney knows nothing about ambition and motivation. The formula he sketches is this: People who are forced to make it on their own have drive. People who receive benefits have dependency.
But, of course, no middle-class parent acts as if this is true. Middle-class parents don't deprive their children of benefits so they can learn to struggle on their own. They shower benefits on their children to give them more opportunities -- so they can play travel sports, go on foreign trips and develop more skills.
People are motivated when they feel competent. They are motivated when they have more opportunities. Ambition is fired by possibility, not by deprivation, as a tour through the world's poorest regions makes clear.
Sure, there are some government programs that cultivate patterns of dependency in some people. I'd put federal disability payments and unemployment insurance in this category. But, as a description of America today, Romney's comment is a country-club fantasy. It's what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other. It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney.
Personally, I think he's a kind, decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not -- some sort of cartoonish government-hater. But it scarcely matters. He's running a depressingly inept presidential campaign. Mr. Romney, your entitlement reform ideas are essential, but when will the incompetence stop?

Full text:   OTTAWA -- The Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative contract deal with the Ford Motor Company of Canada on Monday just hours before a midnight strike deadline.
And Monday night, after reaching the accord, Ken Lewenza, the president of the union, said the union had extended contract negotiations with General Motors of Canada and Chrysler Canada. He warned, however, that the two automakers would face a strike unless they agreed to the same key terms as Ford.
"The gap is still miles apart because we have a tremendous amount of work," Mr. Lewenza said. "There's so many issues on the table it would impossible for General Motors and Chrysler's to respond."
The extension followed the arrival at the negotiations in downtown Toronto of two senior executives from Detroit: Al Iacobelli, the vice president for employee relations at Chrysler, and Cathy Clegg, General Motors' vice president for labor relations.
Mr. Lewenza said the extension was intended to give the companies time to study the tentative agreement reached with Ford. If the union believes they are procrastinating, he said, it will give two automakers 24 hours notice of a strike.
"Our patience and anxieties in the workplace only have so much time," Mr. Lewenza said.
While the union gave concessions to Ford on wages and pensions, it said it was still able to uphold its major negotiating principles. Ford agreed to gradually rehire about 600 union members who were laid off from its plants, and it committed to produce a new line of vehicles at its assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario.
It is a good deal in these economic times, Mr. Lewenza told a news conference. "It's far from a carry-over agreement."
Mr. Lewenza emphasized that the union would not budge on its traditional approach of requiring all three Detroit-based companies to accept the same key contract terms, a system known as pattern bargaining.
"Pattern bargaining is a concept to make sure that one company isn't disadvantaged," Mr. Lewenza said, adding that he would rather avoid a strike.
"Our job is to manufacture cars and build components," he said. "Our job isn't to go on strike."
Accepting the Ford deal may be particularly difficult for Chrysler. In a statement over the weekend, the company indicated that Ford might not be a suitable model for Chrysler, the smallest employer of the Detroit Three in Canada.
Sergio Marchionne, the Chrysler Group's chief executive, has also repeatedly demanded that the Canadian union adopt a pay system for new hires used in the United States, something not found in the agreement with Ford, or risk having Chrysler leave the country.
Chrysler said in a statement on Monday night that it was studying the tentative agreement with Ford. G.M. Canada said it "looks forward to continuing with the constructive dialogue."
.Because the vast majority of Canadian auto production is shipped to the United States, any factory closings would be disruptive for the two automakers at a time of brisk auto sales.
Chrysler builds all of its minivans, as well as the Volkswagen Routan, in Windsor, Ontario. Its large rear-wheel-drive cars -- the Chrysler 300, the Dodge Charger and the Challenger -- come exclusively from a factory outside of Toronto in Brampton, Ontario.
G.M.'s plants in Oshawa, Ontario, make the Chevrolet Camaro, the new Cadillac XTS, the Chevrolet Impala and the Buick Regal. Some production of the Chevrolet Equinox, a popular small sport utility model, also comes from Oshawa.
Stacey Allerton, the vice president for human resources of Ford Motor Company of Canada, which is based in Oakville, said the four-year agreement, which is subject to ratification by Ford workers, provided a "unique to Canada solution that will improve the competitiveness of the Canadian operations while providing employees the opportunity to earn a good living."
The rise of the Canadian dollar to parity with the United States dollar has eliminated the cost advantage once enjoyed by Canadian plants and made labor costs higher in Canada. General Motors has said that Canada now has the highest costs in the world to assemble cars and trucks.
The automakers, and Chrysler in particular, want the Canadian union to adopt a system long established at American plants under which new employees work at a lower wage rate. In Canada, workers start at a lower rate, but gradually move up to the same scale as established employees.
Ford agreed to continue with that system after some compromises from the union. New employees will now have to wait 10 years, rather than six, to move to full wages and they will start at 60 percent of the full rate rather than 70 percent as was the case in the last contract.
The sides found a similar compromise on the issue of pensions. Like many companies in Canada and in the United States, the automakers had sought to replace the defined-benefit pensions with defined-contribution plans. Defined-benefit pensions guarantee a set payment, while defined-contribution plans guarantee the employer's payments, leaving the benefits subject to investment decisions and the investment environment.
In the tentative agreement with Ford, the union agreed to a hybrid pension that would be a combination of the two systems. That will create some uncertainty about benefits for its members and also increase the amount of pension payments they make. The union's members started making pension contributions only after signing their last contract in 2009.
To make Ford's costs more predictable, the union has agreed to a series of predetermined, lump-sum payments in place of wage increases based on the rate of inflation. There are no wage increases at all in the contract.
Ford will rehire 230 workers shortly by introducing what Mr. Lewenza called a "partial third shift" in Oakville. When a new model arrives in 2014, the company plans to increase employment by about 300 jobs. The remainder of the job recalls will be created by ending outsourcing of some tasks and partial vehicle assemblies.

Full text:   Last week Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, announced a change in his institution's recession-fighting strategies. In so doing he seemed to be responding to the arguments of critics who have said the Fed can and should be doing more. And Republicans went wild.
Now, many people on the right have long been obsessed with the notion that we'll be facing runaway inflation any day now. The surprise was how readily Mitt Romney joined in the craziness.
So what did Mr. Bernanke announce, and why?
The Fed normally responds to a weak economy by buying short-term U.S. government debt from banks. This adds to bank reserves; the banks go out and lend more; and the economy perks up.
Unfortunately, the scale of the financial crisis, which left behind a huge overhang of consumer debt, depressed the economy so severely that the usual channels of monetary policy don't work. The Fed can bulk up bank reserves, but the banks have little incentive to lend the money out, because short-term interest rates are near zero. So the reserves just sit there.
The Fed's response to this problem has been "quantitative easing," a confusing term for buying assets other than Treasury bills, such as long-term U.S. debt. The hope has been that such purchases will drive down the cost of borrowing, and boost the economy even though conventional monetary policy has reached its limit.
Sure enough, last week's Fed announcement included another round of quantitative easing, this time involving mortgage-backed securities. The big news, however, was the Fed's declaration that "a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens." In plain English, the Fed is more or less promising that it won't start raising interest rates as soon as the economy looks better, that it will hold off until the economy is actually booming and (perhaps) until inflation has gone significantly higher.
The idea here is that by indicating its willingness to let the economy rip for a while, the Fed can encourage more private-sector spending right away. Potential home buyers will be encouraged by the prospect of moderately higher inflation that will make their debt easier to repay; corporations will be encouraged by the prospect of higher future sales; stocks will rise, increasing wealth, and the dollar will fall, making U.S. exports more competitive.
This is very much the kind of action Fed critics have advocated -- and that Mr. Bernanke himself used to advocate before he became Fed chairman. True, it's a lot less explicit than the critics would have liked. But it's still a welcome move, although far from being a panacea for the economy's troubles (a point Mr. Bernanke himself emphasized).
And Republicans, as I said, have gone wild, with Mr. Romney joining in the craziness. His campaign issued a news release denouncing the Fed's move as giving the economy an "artificial" boost -- he later described it as a "sugar high" -- and declaring that "we should be creating wealth, not printing dollars."
Mr. Romney's language echoed that of the "liquidationists" of the 1930s, who argued against doing anything to mitigate the Great Depression. Until recently, the verdict on liquidationism seemed clear: it has been rejected and ridiculed not just by liberals and Keynesians but by conservatives too, including none other than Milton Friedman. "Aggressive monetary policy can reduce the depth of a recession," declared the George W. Bush administration in its 2004 Economic Report of the President. And the author of that report, Harvard's N. Gregory Mankiw, has actually advocated a much more aggressive Fed policy than the one announced last week.
Now Mr. Mankiw is allegedly a Romney adviser -- but the candidate's position on economic policy is evidently being dictated by extremists who warn that any effort to fight this slump will turn us into Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe I tell you.
Oh, and what about Mr. Romney's ideas for "creating wealth"? The Romney economic "plan" offers no specifics about what he would actually do. The thrust of it, however, is that what America needs is less environmental protection and lower taxes on the wealthy. Surprise!
Indeed, as Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute points out, the Romney plan of 2012 is almost identical -- and with the same turns of phrase -- to John McCain's plan in 2008, not to mention the plans laid out by George W. Bush in 2004 and 2006. The situation changes, but the song remains the same.
So last week we learned that Ben Bernanke is willing to listen to sensible critics and change course. But we also learned that on economic policy, as on foreign policy, Mitt Romney has abandoned any pose of moderation and taken up residence in the right's intellectual fever swamps.

Full text:   THESPIAN friends perform "The Seagull" in their garden. Only minutes into the first act, a lovely young woman named Masha, sick of hearing the lovesick schoolteacher Medvedenko whine about his penury, blurts out, "All you ever do is talk and talk about money." That's when it dawns on me: I'm sick of the subject, too. For the rest of Act I, I find myself ruminating about the glut of financial data that daily clogs the news: Libor and MF Global Holdings; HSBC's money-laundering of Mexican drug-cartel money; "the London Whale" whose huge trades cost J.P. Morgan Chase billions; leveraged buyouts and mortgage-backed securities and derivatives and stimulus packages, Bain Capital and the tottering euro and the Greek bailout. Saul Bellow referred to this quotidian fretting about world affairs as "crisis chatter." Today's crises are all about what is euphemistically called "the financial services industry" -- that is to say, they're all about money.
Call it Wall Street porn. Not only do we know more than most of us wish to know about how the rich live -- we even know, thanks to the deep-digging efforts of the business reporters over at Bloomberg, how much they have. But there is such a thing as knowing too much: Did Larry Ellison buy a Hawaiian island for $600 million? And did that include the hotels? Is George Soros's net worth $18 billion? $20 billion? (Anyway, why begrudge him? He's probably given half of it away.) And when we talk about the 99 percent who aren't rich, shouldn't that leave just 1 percent who are? Then why are we always hearing about the 0.1 percent and the .01 percent? Valiant fact-checkers are off the hook on this one: my point is that the exact numbers don't matter.
We're all aware of the vast and still growing gap between the very rich and everyone else, we all know the global economy is a mess. But do we have to hear about it every waking minute of every day? We're in trouble when the earnestly liberal NPR begins its morning broadcast with a program called "Planet Money."
I can't even go for a bike ride without being reminded that we all share it now. My admirable neighbor Nathan, who makes a living doing odd jobs and is a militant nonparticipant in the global economy, has staked a cardboard poster on his lawn that reads, in blue letters, We are the 99 percent.
Why is it that the richer the rich get, the more their doings preoccupy the rest of us? What happened to the tacit social prohibition against talking about money? In part, it's the fault of the media (as usual). "Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out": King Lear's shrewd assessment of the human tendency to keep score is especially suited to our own historical moment, when everything is done in public. I didn't ask for a peek at Warren Buffett's portfolio: in order not to know how much preferred stock he acquired in Goldman Sachs I would have to confine my periodical reading to National Geographic.
The problem is: I need to know about money. Like most everyone else in the middle class, I'm scared. Reverberations from the largely bank-induced financial debacle of 2008 still ripple outward, lapping at our retirement plans and hard-earned savings. It never occurred to me that I would have to learn about I-bonds and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) at an age when I would have thought I was finally safe from the tortures of high school math -- worse, would have to learn higher math just to avoid getting swallowed by the London Whale and his pod. I would love to catch up on the first four seasons of "Breaking Bad"; instead I sit up late at night with a calculator trying to figure out if I have enough for retirement.
In his ominously titled book, "Are We Rome?" Cullen Murphy noted that the senatorial aristocracy of the ancient world -- "by one estimate two thousandths of one percent of the population" -- was fine with a lopsided household income. "The very tiny Roman elite accepted the chasm between themselves and everyone else as the divinely ordained natural order and an affirmation of their own virtue." I suspect that few in our own tiny elite feel that way. "Most Americans don't want our society to be like this, and we remain at heart a middle-class nation," Mr. Murphy suggests.
So why don't we do something about it -- close a few tax loopholes, regulate the banks -- instead of gazing at the glossy real estate brochures that come in the mail? Is it possible that our fascination with the rich reflects some flaw in the nation's value structure that cuts across class lines? Does subscribing to Architectural Digest make us unwittingly collusive in the perpetuation of wealth inequity? Is the middle class enabling the upper class?
None of this has been lost on the great Keynes biographer Robert Skidelsky, whose new book, "How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life," co-written with his son Edward, identifies an "ethic of acquisitiveness" in the air. To explain this trend, the Skidelskys invoke the phenomenon of what sociologists refer to as "bandwagon goods" -- "goods that are desired because others already have them." This insatiable, competition-fueled appetite for stuff we don't need shackles us to "continuous, objectless wealth-creation -- something that did not exist in earlier times, and that remains, in some sense, peculiar to capitalism."
As I read their book, I was reminded of "The Gift," Lewis Hyde's classic study of exchange systems in so-called "primitive" cultures. Published in 1983, this haunting anthropological elegy to lost civilizations was prescient. Mr. Hyde made the case that advanced capitalist nations, blinded by "market triumphalism," had lost any sense of the rituals and beliefs that once defined us as a society, the institutions that bound us together: "We've witnessed the steady conversion into private property of the art and ideas that earlier generations thought belonged to their cultural commons, and we've seen the commodification of things that a few years ago would have seemed beyond the reach of any market." We now inhabited a world in which everything was for sale.
Nearly three decades later, Michael Sandel, a professor of government at Harvard, has confirmed Mr. Hyde's premonitions in his new book, "What Money Can't Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets." Mr. Sandel's argument is that in our zeal for growth we have "monetized" goods and services -- education, medical care, access to national parks, clean air, even the right to immigrate -- once available free. We've made the country itself a corporation. (In a recent speech, Mitt Romney, apparently referring to the United States, promised "to make sure this company deals with its challenges.")
"The most fateful change that unfolded during the past three decades was not an increase in greed," Mr. Sandel observes. "It was the expansion of markets, and of market values, into spheres of life where they don't belong." Gone is the time when art was appreciated as art, not as an investment; when a nest egg was for security, not to be shown off like a Fabergé; when politics was about issues, not war chests. The idea of producing something for fun or pleasure or the creation of beauty has become obsolete.
In a society in which money is the measure of all things, it becomes hard to assess your achievements in other terms. The breakdown of community -- of church and neighborhood and work that provides a firm identify -- has forced us to find alternative ways of determining our place in the social order. It makes no more sense to ask the derivatives salesman to monitor himself, to pull back from the pursuit of maximum profit, than to ask A-Rod to go easy on the home runs. It's their job; it's what they do.
The same week that I saw "The Seagull," I attended a performance of "The Magic Flute" in a small, 19th-century town hall that seated 90 (and, I'm glad to say, was filled to capacity). Tickets were $30. I've seen Mozart's joyous opera many times, and this was the best by far. The singers were superb; the mini-orchestra played with gusto; the makeshift costumes were touchingly inventive. How did the cast members get paid? Or did they? The production was instructive: there was a soprano from a local conservatory, an itinerant freelance tenor, a baritone working toward his M.A. in musicology. Some of the staff worked pro bono (as did the actors in our local production of "The Seagull," who donated two weeks of their summer vacation in return for free meals and a sojourn in the country). It was an exhilarating event. You couldn't monetize it; you couldn't commodify it; you couldn't load it up on your bandwagon of goods. You could only experience it.
Money is a kind of poetry, declared Wallace Stevens, who worked for a Hartford insurance company and knew what he was talking about. But isn't it also true that poetry is a kind of money?

Full text:   MIAMI
IN early August, Jorge Sanchez, a broker with Douglas Elliman, flew to Buenos Aires to sell some Miami real estate. He returned to Florida a few days later with four signed contracts from Argentines for apartments in a 60-story tower in downtown Miami.
The fact that the buyers signed the contracts without ever flying to Miami to see the building -- Opera Tower -- speaks volumes about how eager, and desperate, Argentines have been to direct their money out of their country and into real estate in Miami and New York.
In the past few months, Argentines have quietly passed Brazilians to become the most active group from Latin America buying Miami real estate, according to Millie Sanchez, executive vice president of development marketing for Douglas Elliman Florida.
Brazil's demotion from the top spot likely has something to do with the weakening of its currency, the real, versus the dollar in recent months. But in Argentina, a weakening peso and 25 percent inflation, economists say, have spurred many affluent Argentines to move their money into American real estate by expensive and sometimes illegal means.
Economic and political uncertainty around the globe are benefitting real estate in the United States, especially in Miami and New York, the two "safe haven" American cities foreign investors usually look to first. South Florida's real estate market is certainly no stranger to capital flight from Latin America. But the velocity at which some Argentines are investing in Miami real estate has shocked some brokers here.
"The desperation of the Argentine people has taken over and they are actually market leaders here now," Ms. Sanchez said. "Any project today in Miami is probably being sold 50 percent to the Argentines."
The government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina's president, has been trying to stop the capital outflow, which nearly doubled to $21.5 billion last year from $11.4 billion in 2010, with increasingly severe methods.
Argentines now have to submit requests to tax authorities to convert pesos into dollars for overseas trips, and are rarely approved for much. Overseas credit card purchases are heavily taxed at home. And specially trained dogs working for tax authorities are sniffing for dollars at ports, airports and border crossings.
The government began restricting access to dollars last November, days after Ms. Kirchner won a second four-year term.
What's driving all this? Argentina has struggled to preserve its hard-currency reserves in the Central Bank and sustain a trade surplus. The country has had limited access to international credit markets, owing to its inability to win back the confidence of global investors after its $100 billion default in 2001.
The government has refused to take on more debt, to rapidly devalue the peso, or to reduce spending, which it needs to sustain programs for the poor and working class that make up its voter base. Instead, Ms. Kirchner's government has chosen to clamp down on capital flight by whatever means possible.
Banks in Argentina are lending at rates some 10 percent under the inflation rate, economists say. There are few profitable investments left in the country, said Eduardo Blasco, a financial consultant in Buenos Aires.
Argentines are buying foreign properties not only to park their savings but also to make extra income through rentals. "Argentines don't want any more Argentine risk," Mr. Blasco said.
So they are willing to risk their savings on Miami real estate instead. At Opera Tower, at 1750 North Bayshore Drive, half of the 30 apartments sold in the past month were bought by Argentines, Ms. Sanchez said. Most were all-cash purchases, even though the developer, Florida East Coast Realty, has offered to finance up to 65 percent of the purchases.
After selling about a third of the building's 635 apartments before 2008, the developer turned the building into rentals after the housing crisis. Six months ago, Opera Tower began selling condos again. Since then some 90 apartments of the remaining 394 have gone into contract, said Luis Espinosa, the director of marketing for Florida East Coast Realty.
The building has become almost a pure investment play. Owners are occupying less than 5 percent of the apartments, which are selling for $250,000 to $650,000 for studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms, said Ana Tajes, Opera Tower's sales director.
Opera Tower is popular with Argentines because the developer is offering to lease back the apartments from the buyers, pay their monthly maintenance charges and give them an annual net rent equal to 6 percent of the purchase price for three years.
Argentines have also been scooping up apartments in Manhattan. Maria Velazquez, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, met a group of Argentines in Miami earlier this month and accompanied them to New York. She said she has sold six apartments totaling $8 million to Argentines since last November, including four apartments at One Museum Mile, located at 1280 Fifth Avenue.
In December, Ms. Velazquez represented a group of Argentines that bid $10.35 million for eight apartments at 400 Fifth Avenue. They were later outbid, she said.
"They wanted to act fast and get their money out" of Argentina, Ms. Velazquez said. "Whoever buys in New York already has four or five apartments in Miami."
While her Argentine sales have been strong, Ms. Velazquez lately has been selling even more in New York to another skittish group from Latin America: Venezuelans.
Concerns about the Oct. 7 election in Venezuela, in which the 13-year incumbent, President Hugo Chavez, faces perhaps his stiffest challenge from Henrique Capriles, have led to a new exodus of cash from the country that is finding its way into New York real estate.
In the past year Ms. Velazquez said she has sold $35 million worth of Manhattan real estate to Venezuelans, including nine apartments at the Aldyn (60 Riverside Boulevard), three of which were $7 million penthouses of about 3,096 square feet each.
In contrast to about four years ago, when many Venezuelans struggled to wire large sums of money out of the country because of government restrictions, this time around they are using funds from accounts in Switzerland and the Virgin Islands, she said.
Some Argentines are using money that was already waiting in American bank accounts. Others have been willing to pay a black-market premium of up to 40 percent to convert their money into dollars at home, and a commission of up to 7 percent to transfer funds abroad through a currency exchange house, an illegal transaction, economists said.
The dollar restrictions have caused Argentina's own real estate market, which has traditionally been transacted in dollars, to flatten, as Argentines sit on their properties, said Marina Dal Poggetto, an economist in Buenos Aires.
"Those that have properties don't want to sell in pesos, only in dollars," she said. "But buyers don't have dollars."
The government controls are having a profound effect. Capital flight from Argentina plunged 69 percent to $3.57 billion in the first half of 2012, from $11.7 billion in the second half of 2011.
Deserving part of the credit is Argentina's national tax agency, which has used a team of 50 specially trained dogs -- most of which are golden retrievers and Labradors -- to sniff out the dye in dollars and other foreign currencies.
The Kirchner government has boasted about the dogs' exploits.
In February, the government said, Tiza found $110,000 in a car crossing into Uruguay. In July, Isidoro and Bruno, two other dogs, found $20,000 in a car trying to cross the border with Paraguay. Then last month, Catalina, which appeared to be a black Labrador, found 187,000 reals ($92,493) in the airbag of a Toyota Hilux at a border crossing with Brazil.
The busts pass for black humor in Argentina these days. But a good chunk of the money that is managing to slip out by determined Argentines is finding its way into Florida and New York real estate, and for brokers here that is no laughing matter.

Full text:   An increase in the cost of gasoline pushed consumer prices up in August at the fastest pace in more than three years and squeezed spending on other items, threatening to further slow the already sluggish United States economy.
At the same time, production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities dropped by 1.2 percent, the biggest decline since March 2009, other data on Friday showed.
The sour mix of numbers was tempered by an unexpected increase in consumer sentiment in early September and signs that underlying inflation pressures remained contained.
With gasoline costs increasing, service stations chalked up healthy receipts. A second report from the Commerce Department showed sales at gasoline stations shot up 5.5 percent last month, helping to push overall retail sales up 0.9 percent, the biggest gain in retail sales since February.
Economists said the reports helped justify the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday to introduce a third round of bond purchases to try to lower borrowing costs and spur growth.
"It's very clear the economy is soft and it doesn't look like there is any real underlying inflation pressures the Fed needs to worry about, so they are going to keep their foot on the gas for a long time," said Jeremy Lawson, a senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
The Consumer Price Index increased 0.6 percent last month, the first increase in five months and the biggest gain since June 2009, the Labor Department said. Gasoline prices, which also rose the most since June 2009, accounted for about 80 percent of the rise.
Sales of automobiles and building and garden equipment were also strong, but sales elsewhere were weak. A gauge that tracks the consumer spending component of the government's gross domestic product actually fell 0.1 percent.
That and the strong C.P.I. number left most economists anticipating modest gains in growth of the G.D.P. in the third quarter after output increased at an annual pace of 1.7 percent in the April-to-June period, well below the 2.5 percent rate that is needed to keep unemployment steady.
"For overall G.D.P. in third quarter, we now see some modest downside risk to our current call for a 1.5 percent growth rate," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
While the Consumer Price Index rose sharply, the so-called core index, which strips out volatile and food and energy costs, edged up just 0.1 percent for a second consecutive month.
In the 12 months through August, overall consumer prices increased 1.7 percent, staying below the Fed's 2 percent target, but advancing from July's 1.4 percent rise.
Food costs rose only marginally in August, but they were expected to rise significantly later this year as the impact of a severe drought, which caused a spike in corn and soybean prices, worked its way through to the supermarket.
Also Friday, data on business inventories showed stocks of unsold vehicles piling up in July.
A plunge in auto production contributed to the drop in industrial output in August, although Hurricane Isaac, which disrupted oil refineries in the Gulf Coast, was also a factor.
"Even though an unwinding of these special factors will likely buoy industrial production in September, we do not look for much improvement in underlying manufacturing production trends at this point," said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Abstract: Under the leadership of Mr. Bernanke -- with considerable prodding and support from a board almost entirely appointed by President Obama -- the central bank has gradually concluded that it has a responsibility to act more forcefully, and, equally important, that it has the ability to spur job creation directly. Many monetary economists take the view that central banks should focus exclusively on controlling inflation, which creates an environment conducive to economic growth and job creation.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- When the Federal Reserve's vice chairman said in a 1994 speech that the central bank "had a role in reducing unemployment," colleagues were publicly dismissive. The very word "employment" did not appear in a policy statement until 2008. The Fed was focused on inflation, officials said time and again.
That era is over. The signs have been there for some time, but they are now unmistakable. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, made clear on Thursday that job creation is its primary concern for the foreseeable future.
The remarkable transformation of the Fed's priorities is partly a response to the grim reality that more than 20 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs. It is made easier by the fact that the Fed has been so successful in stabilizing inflation right around the 2 percent annual pace that officials consider most healthy.
But as circumstances have changed, so has the Fed itself. Under the leadership of Mr. Bernanke -- with considerable prodding and support from a board almost entirely appointed by President Obama -- the central bank has gradually concluded that it has a responsibility to act more forcefully, and, equally important, that it has the ability to spur job creation directly.
These conclusions remain deeply controversial. Many monetary economists take the view that central banks should focus exclusively on controlling inflation, which creates an environment conducive to economic growth and job creation. Some argue that the Fed's efforts to spur job growth by decreasing long-term borrowing costs will inevitably result in higher inflation, eventually reducing growth and employment.
And it is clear that many economic problems are beyond the reach of monetary policy. The Fed cannot force Congress to budget. It cannot repair consumer credit nor change Europe into something more sensible. Even the most optimistic analysts do not think its efforts will return unemployment to its precrisis level.
Mr. Bernanke's predecessor, Alan Greenspan, once told his board that he did not want to mention job creation as a policy objective because the Fed would be making a promise that it lacked the power to keep. Mr. Bernanke, by contrast, has decided to make the promise and try to deliver on it -- not just because he thinks that it is within the Fed's power, but at least in part because he thinks it is important to try.
"Up until now the Fed has been very cautious in interpreting the dual mandate," said Stephen D. Oliner, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who worked as a staff economist at the Federal Reserve for more than 25 years. "They have not really aggressively pursued a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. And what they're now doing is they're saying we're kind of rebalancing to put greater weight on unemployment."
The evolution of the Fed's thinking has been visible in its public statements. It made no direct reference to the labor market in its policy statements until December 2008, according to a review by Daniel L. Thornton, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In January, the Fed for the first time cited the unemployment rate as a primary reason for a new policy.
When the Fed started its last major round of asset purchases, officials said they were primarily concerned about the risk of deflation -- the possibility that prices would actually begin to fall, with chaotic consequences.
On Thursday, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was acting because of its "grave concern" about unemployment, including the long-term consequences for the many people and families that have now spent years without jobs.
In an important departure from past policy, the Fed also indicated that it was willing to tolerate somewhat higher inflation as the economy began to recover, although it remained determined to keep inflation around the 2 percent rate.
Some economists argue that Mr. Bernanke's actions are consistent with the Fed's longstanding approach, which has always struck a balance between inflation and economic growth.
"The actions are very different because of a very different situation," said Frederic S. Mishkin, a former Fed governor and economics professor at Columbia University. "All of this I see as being completely consistent with what the Fed's mandate has been and what the Fed has viewed that mandate to be."
It is clear, moreover, that Mr. Bernanke continues to consider low, stable inflation as the single most important contribution that monetary policy can make to long-term prosperity. The Fed is addressing unemployment in the same spirit that people use little buckets to fight fires: water is better than nothing.
Nor has the Fed changed its longstanding view that trying to minimize unemployment tends to produce inflation -- officials are confident that the economy has a lot of room to grow.
But other economists still see the focus on unemployment as an important rebalancing of the Fed's approach to monetary policy -- an attempt by Mr. Bernanke to combine the best practices of the last 30 years with a commitment to broader priorities.
The Fed's focus on inflation began in the late 1970s with the appointment of Paul A. Volcker as chairman. The nation was plagued by galloping inflation, caused in part by the Fed's previous focus on unemployment, and as Mr. Volcker succeeded in driving down inflation, and the nation prospered, his successors took away a simple lesson: Control inflation and jobs will follow.
Unemployment had faded from the Fed's vocabulary by 1994, when the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, told a disapproving audience at a policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that job creation deserved the central bank's attention, too.
"There was an overweening concern about inflation compared to unemployment," Professor Blinder, who left the board in 1996 and returned to work as an economist at Princeton University, said in a recent interview. "For many years, while the Fed had a dual mandate, it essentially never spoke about the unemployment part of it."
He said he was glad to see that was finally changing.

Full text:   Washington
DESPITE high unemployment, there is one bright spot in the economy: while nearly all other sectors shrank during the recession, jobs in health care increased by more than 1.2 million, with most paying salaries of over $60,000. And demand for those workers will keep improving: the Affordable Care Act will add 32 million people to insurance rolls over the next several years, while the aging of America will drive the need for health care for decades to come.
But for American health workers, this is hardly good news. Despite a labor shortage, our crowded medical professional schools are turning away hundreds of thousands of qualified applicants; to fill the gap, we are importing tens of thousands of foreign workers. Today about 12 percent of the health work force is foreign-born and trained, including a quarter of all physicians.
That's bad for American workers, but even worse for the foreign workers' home countries, including some of the world's poorest and sickest, which could use these professionals at home.
The blame lies primarily with the woeful state of schools in the health professions. Despite increased demand for their graduates, they have done little to expand their output.
Even worse, although the cost of higher education increased faster than inflation for the past two decades, the per graduate cost of health professional education has increased even faster: over the past 20 years, public medical school tuitions have increased 312 percent.
State regulators also artificially limit the number of health professionals we can train by effectively requiring that students be trained almost exclusively in teaching hospitals, even though most go on to work in clinics or community hospitals. Not only does this limit the number of people who can be educated, but the resulting increases in tuition and length of training reduce the number of students from poor and underserved communities who apply to health professional schools in the first place.
Then there's the phenomenon of credential creep: in fields like audiology, physical therapy and optometry, a therapist who once needed a master's degree must now have a doctorate to get a license, which means more years of school, higher attrition rates, higher debt, higher wage demands and fewer workers from underserved and low-income areas. The same licensing system actually favors foreign-trained health workers, who, for various reasons, do not have to meet these degree requirements.
It's no surprise, then, that the response to this self-made labor shortage has been to recruit inexpensive workers from abroad, including the 57 poor countries defined by the World Health Organization as having significant shortages of their own. Among them is India, America's largest source of foreign-trained doctors. A special visa program has made hiring these workers even easier.
A Gates Foundation study recently showed that immigration, with the United States as the most common destination, was siphoning off the largest number of African medical professionals.
The Global Health Workforce Alliance estimates that a billion people alive today will die without ever seeing a health care worker. Meanwhile, the W.H.O. estimates that below a threshold of 2.3 doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 people, countries are unable to provide even the most basic health services.
Multiple studies, even when controlled for poverty, show that access to health workers is directly related to mortality and health outcomes. A meta-analysis of 13 studies of developing countries showed that newborns who live more than three miles from a staffed health facility are almost twice as likely to die than infants who live closer to one. Health workers in developing countries don't just provide clinical care -- they also manage their countries' health and disaster response systems, as well as nutrition and sanitation programs, all of which crumble in their absence.
There are other casualties, closer to home. Every study that has examined how to incentivize health workers to move to underserved areas has shown that training people from these communities is the most cost-effective approach. But because we've essentially given up on recruiting from underserved places in the United States, we've made their chronic lack of health workers much worse. Some 54 million people live in the 5,700 parts of the country defined as "health professional shortage areas," the communities with the worst health statistics and the worst unemployment.
In response, schools should be required to pay attention to cost effectiveness and train more workers with their existing budgets. Federal money could go toward helping these schools expand.
Meanwhile, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services, which essentially let the health professions regulate their schools, could mandate that all new licensing requirements be justified with cost-effectiveness data; they could also require schools to communicate with employers to gauge the numbers and skills of workers needed.
It is irrational and immoral to recruit health workers from countries where one in five children die before their fifth birthday when we could be recruiting and training workers domestically. Doing so would help our economy, global public health and the 314 million Americans who rely on our medical system to provide high-quality, affordable care.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve opened a new chapter Thursday in its efforts to stimulate the economy, saying that it intends to buy large quantities of mortgage bonds, and potentially other assets, until the job market improves substantially.
This is the first time that the Fed has tied the duration of an aid program to its economic objectives. And, in announcing the change, the central bank made clear that its primary reason was not a deterioration in its economic outlook, but a determination to respond more forcefully -- in effect, an acknowledgment that its incremental approach until now had been flawed.
The concern about unemployment also reflects a significant shift in the priorities of the nation's central bank, which has long focused on inflation. Inflation is now running below the Fed's 2 percent annual target. But with the unemployment rate above 8 percent, the Fed's policy-making committee suggested Thursday that it might tolerate a period of somewhat higher inflation, promising to maintain stimulus efforts "for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens."
"The weak job market should concern every American," the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said at a news conference. The goal of the new policies, he added, "is to quicken the recovery, to help the economy begin to grow quickly enough to generate new jobs."
The need for new stimulus reflects the disappointing condition of the American economy, which continues to struggle between crisis and prosperity three years after the official end of the recession. More than 20 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs. Median household income has declined. The housing market remains depressed.
The Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, issued a statement describing the Fed's announcement as "further confirmation that President Obama's policies have not worked."
Mr. Romney added that he did not think the Fed's efforts would work, either.
Democrats, in turn, laid the blame on Republicans in Congress. "The Fed is fulfilling its obligation to take action to address unemployment. Now Congressional Republicans need to fulfill theirs," Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a statement.
Delighted investors responded by piling into the stock market, instantly gratifying one of the Fed's primary objectives for its program -- to push money into riskier investments. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 1.63 percent; shares in home builders rose on the news.
"There weren't many more accommodative options the Fed could have gone with," said Dan Greenhaus, the chief global strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage firm.
The Fed said it would add $23 billion of mortgage bonds to its portfolio by the end of September, a pace of $40 billion in purchases a month. It will then announce a new target at the end of this month, and every subsequent month, until the labor market outlook improves "substantially," as long as inflation remains in check. It did not further explain either standard.
Mr. Bernanke said the committee had decided to announce a "qualitative" standard because no single number sufficiently represented the health of the labor market.
"We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment," he said.
Some analysts cautioned, however, that the lack of a specific standard could limit the impact.
"These moves indicate the accommodation switch has been turned on," Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients after the announcement on Thursday.
"On the other hand, boldness has been traded for more uncertainty, as the overall amount and duration of Fed purchases will be dependent on evolving economic conditions."
The committee's statement provided a measure of guidance, in the form of an outer limit on the Fed's intentions. It said that the Fed now intended to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least through the middle of 2015, roughly half-a-year longer than its previous statement. And the projections of senior Fed officials showed that all but one committee member expected to start raising rates by the end of 2015.
Perhaps more important than that timeline was the committee's insistence, echoed by Mr. Bernanke, that the 2015 horizon was not an estimate of when the recovery would begin, but rather an indication of the Fed's determination to keep its foot on the gas well past that point.
"We're not going to rush to begin to tighten policy," Mr. Bernanke said. "We're going to give it some time to make sure that the recovery is well established."
Eleven members of the committee voted in favor of the statement. The only dissent came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.
The scale of the new effort is smaller than the Fed's previous asset purchases. The first round, starting in 2008, averaged more than $100 billion a month. The second, beginning in 2010, averaged $75 billion a month. The current round will begin at a pace of $40 billion a month, although the volume remains subject to adjustment.
The Fed said it would also continue to purchase Treasury securities under an existing program that runs through the end of the year, taking the total volume to roughly $85 billion a month through the rest of the year.
There is broad disagreement among economists about the effects of the Fed's actions. The Fed's own research shows it may have raised economic output by 3 percent and created more than two million jobs. Most independent analyses have reached more modest conclusions, and some experts argue that there is little evidence of any meaningful economic impact.
The first round of purchases, known as QE1, aimed to arrest the financial crisis, in part by clearing room on bank balance sheets. The second round, called QE2, was started amid concerns that prices were increasing too slowly, raising the specter of deflation. This round, by contrast, is aimed squarely at the huge and persistent unemployment crisis.
The decision to focus on mortgage bonds reflects the Fed's conviction that the housing market still needs help, and that lower rates on mortgage loans will produce broad economic benefits. Buying bonds drives down rates by increasing competition for the remaining bonds, forcing investors to accept a lower rate of return or move their money into other, riskier assets.
Joel Naroff, principal of Naroff Economic Advisors, described the decision as "housing or nothing."
"The Fed is admitting that its best bet to improve growth is by continuing to help this sector," he wrote. "By keeping mortgage rates down, the members are betting that housing starts will accelerate, creating more jobs and income. Otherwise, there is little reason to ease further."
Fed officials expressed confidence that the effort would help.
The Fed's senior officials -- the 17 members of its policy-making committee -- expect the economy to expand from 1.7 to 2 percent this year, down from their June estimate of growth of 1.9 to 2.4 percent, according to projections also released Thursday. They continued to predict the unemployment rate would not fall below 8 percent.
However, they predicted growth would be somewhat faster in coming years, and unemployment would decline somewhat more quickly, presumably reflecting the steps announced Thursday.
And some outside economists agreed. "The Fed's actions may not on their own result in a sudden change in the economy," wrote Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. "However, more accommodative financial conditions can only add to growth over time."
Other economists, however, said the benefits would be small at best. They argue that interest rates already are near record lows, and that the primary constraints to new borrowing are that many borrowers cannot qualify for new loans and many homeowners cannot sell or refinance because they owe more than the current value of their homes.
No one predicted that the Fed's new program would return unemployment to normal levels in the foreseeable future, or increase growth enough to eliminate the huge and growing shortfall in economic output since the onset of the financial crisis.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- To the European Central Bank's existing duties -- bulwark against inflation, lender of last resort, ultimate guardian of the euro -- add another task: top cop for the euro zone's banking system.
If the European Parliament and euro zone member states approve a plan presented on Wednesday by the European Commission, at the beginning of next year the central bank will become chief regulator of all banks in the euro zone, with the power to impose fines, remove top executives and even revoke banking licenses.
The central bank would supersede national regulators, which have been accused of being overly protective of the banks they oversee and reluctant to require the lenders to grapple with their problems.
But before the central bank can begin to tackle the task of regulating the more than 6,000 credit institutions in the euro zone, new staff members must be hired, money must be allocated and a clear structure must be developed to coordinate its work with the national regulators that will continue to handle most of the day-to-day tasks. No one yet has even rough estimates of how many people or how much money the central bank will need to perform the new role.
Even though the European Commission's proposal for a banking union is a big leap, it does not grant the central bank powers on a par with those of United States banking authorities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Under the current plan, the central bank would not have the resources needed to prevent bank runs or the authority to arrange a decent burial for a terminally ill institution.
The plan for a banking union is a work in progress, assembled in the midst of a fast-moving crisis. It is doubtful whether the central bank's supervision of banks will do much to ease tension in the euro zone, though it might help in the future.
"They need to develop their specific operational expertise," said Jörg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin. "I think of this as a long-term project that can prevent the next crisis from happening, to break this nexus between banks and states."
The plan outlined by the European Commission would, if ratified, give the central bank new supervisory powers on Jan. 1. But it is likely to take six months from that date for the central bank to build up the capacity to regulate just the biggest, cross-border banks in the euro zone. It could be a year before it is able to supervise all the banks.
In practice, it may take even longer for the central bank to assume its new role.
"The timetable sounds optimistic," said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research firm in Brussels.
Even so, if euro zone governments manage to quickly approve the proposal, it could bolster confidence that political leaders are addressing flaws in the structure of the euro zone.
"It shows the Europeans are actually able to do something together," Mr. Véron said. "That is heartening."
Handing supervisory authority to the central bank would also fulfill a condition necessary for the euro zone's rescue fund, to take a more active role in bank bailouts. The fund, the European Stability Mechanism, would be able to directly supply banks with fresh capital and take stakes in them in return, without having to go through governments that have sometimes dawdled.
It is unclear when the mechanism might be able to take on expanded powers to aid banks, but it could be within months. The mechanism moved a big step forward Wednesday after Germany's highest court declined to block the country from participating.
Still, Berlin continues to oppose giving power over all of its banks to the central bank. Germany has 1,900 credit institutions, more than double that of any other euro zone country. Many of them are small savings banks, often owned by municipalities that use them to funnel credit to local enterprises -- and in some cases as a vehicle for political patronage.
German landesbanks, which are larger than the savings banks but also have close ties to state and local governments, have been particularly vocal in opposing centralized bank supervision.
In a statement Wednesday, the Association of German Public Banks, which represents landesbanks, said the European Commission's proposal was "unfocused, not oriented toward the risks of individual banks, and hardly affordable." Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, expressed similar objections.
Such opposition raises the danger that the central bank will have trouble winning the cooperation of national authorities. Though it will be able to impose levies on banks to finance its regulatory work, the central bank will still be dependent on national regulators for the everyday work of keeping an eye on banks.
Because of opposition from Germany and others, the European Commission did not put forward a plan Wednesday to create a common deposit insurance program, which is considered essential to preventing bank runs. Euro zone countries have their own deposit insurance programs, but they have been depleted in Greece and Spain.
In addition, the commission did not propose that the central bank be given the power to force a troubled bank to shut down in an orderly way that avoided damage to the larger financial system.
Mr. Rocholl of the European School of Management and Technology said it would not be wise to give the central bank so much responsibility all at once, and the creation of a European F.D.I.C. is not yet politically feasible anyway. But others fear the central bank will not have all the tools it needs to deal with troubled banks and prevent banking crises.
The central bank said Wednesday that it welcomed the new responsibility. In a statement, it said it was "an important step towards laying the foundations of a financial market union with the view to ensuring financial stability in the euro area and the European Union."
One argument for handing supervisory powers to the central bank is that it already has intimate knowledge of euro zone banks. One of its fundamental tasks is to serve as lender of last resort for banks that have trouble raising money on the open market. As a result, the central bank knows which ones are hurting.
But there is also a potential for conflicts between monetary policy and banking regulation. The central bank is supposed to be independent from political influence, but supervising banks is, in Europe as elsewhere, often tinged with politics.
Responsibility for bank regulation "makes the E.C.B. tremendously powerful," said Sony Kapoor, managing director of Re-Define, a research organization with offices in Belgium and other countries that advises policy makers. "This is taking the E.C.B. deeply into political territory without adequate accountability."
The central bank would keep its regulatory functions separate from other functions like setting official interest rates. But ultimate authority rests with Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, and its Governing Council. In addition, some members of the council would serve on the supervisory board of the new regulator.
Mr. Kapoor argued that the top central bankers already had too much to do and would not be able to effectively manage bank supervision as well.
"If I am on the executive board of the E.C.B., and I'm already working 18 hours a day, it's really going to stretch the capacity at the top," Mr. Kapoor said. "That's where the bottleneck is going to be."

Abstract: The Census Bureau reported that a standard measure of income inequality, the Gini index, registered the first year-on-year increase since 1993, a surprise for economists who say the measure, which has been rising for some time, usually changes so slowly that a statistically significant rise over the course of one calendar year is rare.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The income gap between the wealthiest 20 percent of American households and the rest of the country grew sharply in 2011, the Census Bureau reported, as an overwhelming majority of Americans saw no gains from a weak economic recovery in its second full year.
Income for the top fifth of American households rose by 1.6 percent last year, driven by even larger increases for the top 5 percent of households, said David Johnson, the Census Bureau official who presented the findings. All households in the middle of the scale saw declines, while those at the very bottom stagnated.
"You're really struck by the unevenness of the recovery," said Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard. "The top end took a whack in the recession, but they've gotten back on their feet. Everyone else is still down for the count."
The numbers helped drive an overall decline in income for the typical American family. Median household income after inflation fell to $50,054, a level that was 8 percent lower than in 2007, the year before the recession took hold.
That drop poses a political challenge for President Obama as he presents himself as a champion of the middle class and defends his economic stewardship in a tightly fought presidential race. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, is likely to seize on the decline as evidence of the president's failure to fix an ailing economy. Mr. Obama, for his part, has emphasized the potentially damaging effects of Republican policies on the middle class.
Obama administration officials said Wednesday that more recent data on job growth, unemployment and wages indicated that median income, adjusted for inflation, was growing this year. They pointed to the rise in income inequality as proof that their policy priorities are even more urgent. Rebecca M. Blank, the acting United States commerce secretary, said in a statement that the rise "underscores the fact we must enact policies that help rebuild our economy not from the top down, but from the middle out."
It is an argument that conservatives, who contend that income inequality is not inherently harmful, largely reject.
"Over the long run, the disappearing middle class has moved up, not down," said Douglas J. Besharov, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland. "Too much redistribution will kill the goose that laid the golden egg."
The Census Bureau reported that a standard measure of income inequality, the Gini index, registered the first year-on-year increase since 1993, a surprise for economists who say the measure, which has been rising for some time, usually changes so slowly that a statistically significant rise over the course of one calendar year is rare.
Two other of the report's findings were promoted by the administration as achievements. The share of Americans without health insurance declined, driven by a 2.2 percent drop in the portion of uninsured 19- to 25-year-olds, strong evidence of an impact from a provision in Mr. Obama's Affordable Care Act that allowed children to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26. The uninsured rate for the nation fell to 15.7 percent from 16.3 percent. And the percentage of Americans in poverty remained unchanged for the first time in four years, though economists had expected the rate to rise for a fifth straight year.
"If you have to guess what's going on, 2011 was the year that we started making real gains in employment," said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan.
Mr. Johnson, the census official, said the movement of people from part-time work to full-time work was most likely a major reason the poverty rate did not worsen. The number of people in poverty declined in the South and the suburbs, and among people who were not United States citizens.
"Looks like there's a big shift from part time to full time, and the largest percent increase in full-time work was in the lowest quintile," he said, referring to the bottom fifth of the income spectrum.
There were 46.2 million people in poverty in the United States last year, little changed from 2010. That figure represents 15 percent of the population, compared with 15.1 percent in 2010, census officials said, a change that was not statistically significant.
But the data still reflects the bleak state of the American labor market. Inflation-adjusted median household income fell by 1.5 percent in 2011. During the recovery, about 3 in 5 of the new jobs created have been low-skill and low-wage -- taking people off the unemployment rolls and pulling some families out of poverty, but not providing a clear route to the middle class.
That trend helps explain how the poverty rate could stay flat while the median income went down. Middle-income earners, for instance manufacturing workers and middle managers, have fared worse in this economy than both lower-income workers and higher-income workers, a phenomenon economists refer to as the polarization of the labor market, Professor Katz said. As a result, income at the middle point of the spectrum went down, while remaining flat at the bottom, something that happened from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, he said.

Full text:   The number of Americans who lack health insurance declined last year, the first drop since 2007. This is, in large part, the result of the health care reform law and better coverage under public programs like Medicaid. This also shows why repealing the health care law or revamping and shrinking Medicaid, as many Republicans want to do, would be disastrous moves.
The Census Bureau reported on Wednesday that the number of people without health coverage fell to 48.6 million in 2011, or 15.7 percent of the population, down from 49.9 million, or 16.3 percent of the population, in 2010. Health experts attributed a big chunk of the drop to a provision in the health care reform law that allows children to remain on their parents' policies until age 26. Some three million young adults took advantage of that provision, other surveys show.
The bureau also reported that the percentage of people covered by private insurance stayed flat at 63.9 percent, the first time in a decade it has not fallen. The percentage of Americans covered by government programs, like Medicare, Medicaid, a related children's health program, and military plans, increased for the fifth consecutive year to reach 32.2 percent in 2011. That is a testament to the importance of government programs in troubled economic times.
In other good news, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust showed that average premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance for family coverage rose 4 percent from last year and individual coverage rose 3 percent -- well below the double-digit increases in the past decade. The recession accounts for some of this moderation in costs. The spread of high deductible health plans may also have reduced spending, and some experts think the health care reforms, which don't fully kick in until 2014, are already pushing health care providers and insurers to lower their costs.
The Census Bureau also reported that median household income, adjusted for inflation, declined last year to $50,054, a level not seen since the mid-1990s, and that income inequality grew significantly worse, as incomes rose for the top earners. Still, the percentage of Americans living in poverty declined slightly after rising in the previous three years, largely because more people shifted from part-time to full-time work. The census data underscore the importance of retaining the health care reforms, which will increasingly make insurance more affordable for middle-class families.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The American medical system squanders 30 cents of every dollar spent on health care, according to new calculations by the respected Institute of Medicine. But in all that waste and misuse, policy experts and economists see a significant opportunity -- a way to curb runaway health spending, to improve medical outcomes and even to put the economy on sounder footing.
"Everybody from Paul Krugman to Paul Ryan agrees it is essential to restrain costs," said Dr. Mark D. Smith, the president of the California HealthCare Foundation and the chairman of the committee that wrote the report, referring to the liberal economist and Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, and the conservative Wisconsin congressman who is Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate. "The health care industry agrees, too."
The Institute of Medicine report -- its research led by 18 best-of-class clinicians, policy experts and business leaders -- details how the American medical system wastes an estimated $750 billion a year while failing to deliver reliable, top-notch care. That is roughly equivalent to the annual cost of health coverage for 150 million workers, or the budget of the Defense Department, or the 2008 bank bailout.
The institute's analysis of 2009 data shows $210 billion spent on unnecessary services, like repeated tests, and $130 billion spent on inefficiently delivered services, like a scan performed in a hospital rather than an outpatient center.
It also shows the health care system wasting $75 billion a year on fraud, $55 billion on missed prevention opportunities and a whopping $190 billion on paperwork and unnecessary administrative costs. The Institute of Medicine is an independent adviser to the government and the public, and part of the National Academy of Sciences.
The report depicts a system that saves lives in miraculous fashion, but is also expensive and outmoded and in some cases downright Kafkaesque.
"If banking were like health care, automated teller machine transactions would take not seconds but perhaps days or longer as a result of unavailable or misplaced records," the report said. "If home building were like health care, carpenters, electricians and plumbers each would work with different blueprints, with very little coordination."
Along with the squandered money there is a human toll, the report said, as medical errors and inefficiencies mean that doctors fail to deliver the best and most timely care to patients.
"If the care in every state were of the quality delivered by the highest-performing state, an estimated 75,000 fewer deaths would have occurred across the country in 2005," the report said.
But the report -- and independent health care experts and economists analyzing it -- identified an opportunity in that $750 billion of wasted health spending. If hospitals, doctors and insurers could wring even a fraction of that money out, it would help to bend the so-called cost curve of runaway health inflation while improving patient outcomes.
The point of the report is that "Americans should expect to get and should demand to get better value for their health care dollar," Dr. Smith said.
"That money is not only not buying anything," said David Cutler, the Harvard health economist. "It is actually a sign of poor care. A lot of cost reductions, if we do them the right way, would mean improved health, not worse health."
Professor Cutler gave as an example rules to make sure that doctors do not perform inductions for otherwise healthy pregnant women before 39 weeks of gestation. It would both save money and improve health outcomes by reducing the rate of Caesarean sections, he said.
The report gives recommendations intended to reduce spending and improve care: ensuring doctors work in teams and share information; making prices and costs transparent to consumers; rewarding doctors for outcomes, not procedures; ensuring all doctors use the best-tested practices, and identifying and correcting errors among them.
The report also detailed instances of health care providers offering such smarter care: hospitals preventing re-hospitalizations, upgrading their records systems and cutting out ineffective therapies, for example.
Some health economists and policy experts believe that political changes and financial pressure have already spurred insurers and health care providers to start squeezing out costs, contributing to the slowdown in health spending growth seen in the past few years.
"We're starting to see some very early results," said Wendy Everett, the president of NEHI, a health care research group based in Cambridge, Mass.
She said she expected to see more and more adoption of best practices in the next few years, spurred by President Obama's Affordable Care Act, other changes to Medicare and Medicaid and a recognition among doctors and insurers that the current trajectory of health care spending is unsustainable.
"This train's coming much faster than we thought," Ms. Everett said. She guessed that within a decade providers being paid for the quality, not quantity, of care would be "the norm."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- In September 1992, the Federal Reserve culminated a long-running effort to stimulate the sluggish economy by cutting its benchmark interest rate to 3 percent, the lowest level it had reached in almost three decades.
The cut was avidly sought by the administration of President George H. W. Bush, but it was not enough to change the course of the presidential election. Years later, Mr. Bush told an interviewer that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, had cost him a second term by failing to act more quickly and more forcefully.
"I reappointed him and he disappointed me," Mr. Bush said.
On Thursday, the Federal Reserve is poised to announce that it will once again seek to stimulate the economy in the middle of a presidential election season.
Fed officials insist that they do not consider politics in setting policy. But the imminence of the election makes it inevitable that the decisions reached by the Fed's policy-making committee will be judged through a political lens.
Republicans have warned the Fed against taking action, and are seeking to impose new limits on its management of monetary policy. Some Democrats now echo Mr. Bush's lament that new actions are too little, too late.
Experts say Fed officials are sensitive to the danger of a political reaction. But Randall S. Kroszner, a Fed governor from 2006 to 2009, said the Fed's current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has concluded that the best defense of the Fed's independence is to demonstrate its value by reaching decisions on the economic merits, then offering clear explanations to politicians and the public. "Any decision the Fed will make will make someone unhappy, but what you want out of an independent agency is a careful deliberative process," said Mr. Kroszner, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
"Providing as much substantive economic explanation as possible for the actions that the Fed is taking, that's the best way to maintain the Fed's independence," he added.
Mr. Bernanke and other officials have argued in recent weeks that the economy needs help, and that the Fed still has the means to stimulate growth. Officials also are concerned about the combination of federal tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect next year.
In a reminder of the government's fiscal problems, Moody's Investors Service reiterated Tuesday that it could downgrade federal debt if Congress did not reach a debt reduction deal. Interest rates on federal debt remain near record lows despite a downgrade last year by Standard & Poor's, but a second downgrade could force some investors to reduce their holdings of Treasury securities.
Mr. Bernanke outlined the actions that the Fed was most likely to take in a speech last month at a conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo. The central bank could announce a new round of asset purchases, expanding its balance sheet for the third time since 2008. It also could announce its intent to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero beyond late 2014. Both are methods of reducing long-term interest rates, and encourage borrowing and riskier investments.
While some analysts have argued that the Fed is less likely to act in an election year, history offers evidence to the contrary.
The Fed has announced policy changes in September or October during 10 of the last 15 presidential election years, dating back to 1952. During the last presidential election, the Fed slashed interest rates repeatedly as it responded to the financial crisis. In 2004, the Fed raised rates in June, August and September.
"There is plenty of precedent for Fed action ahead of a presidential election," Credit Suisse said in a research note reviewing that history.
The decisions have always been subject to political pressure. The central bank's independence was never intended to be complete. The Fed's governors are appointed by the president. Its chairman has lunch regularly with the Treasury secretary and meets occasionally with the president. Congress dictates the Fed's mission and requires it to report regularly on its actions.
The Fed, then-chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. told Congress in 1957, "should be independent -- not independent of government, but independent within the structure of government." That meant, he said, having the freedom necessary to decide how best to meet the goals of national economic policy.
It has won that much autonomy only gradually. When Arthur Burns became Fed chairman in January 1970, President Richard Nixon said at the swearing-in ceremony, "I respect his independence. However, I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed."
He was not joking. Two years later, Mr. Nixon pressured Mr. Burns to help the economy by printing vast amounts of money, contributing to an era of crippling inflation.
Beginning in the 1980s, Paul A. Volcker and his successor, Mr. Greenspan, successfully established the benefits of independent monetary policy in reducing the rate of inflation, giving the Fed more leverage to resist White House pressure.
During that same period, presidents and their advisers gradually stopped talking in public about monetary policy, concluding that it was counterproductive because the Fed was then forced to respond by demonstrating its independence.
The victory remained partial. When Leon Panetta, then White House chief of staff, said publicly in 1995 that the Fed should cooperate with efforts to revive the economy, his comments were quickly disavowed. But the Clinton administration privately pushed Mr. Greenspan to stimulate growth ahead of the 1996 election and rewarded those efforts by nominating Mr. Greenspan for a new term.
The current White House says that it does not comment on monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke met only three times with President Obama last year, and most recently met with the president at the end of May, although he continues to meet regularly with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Even Congressional Democrats have generally avoided public calls for the central bank to take new action.
Republicans have been openly critical. Mitt Romney, the Republican Party's presidential nominee, has pledged to replace Mr. Bernanke. But in recent weeks Mr. Romney also has seemed to take a more measured tone in his remarks. He told Fox News last week that he doubted the benefits of any new Fed policies.
"I don't think there's any action that they are going to take that will have an immediate impact on the economy," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Bernanke has simply repeated the Fed's long-standing mantra that it does not listen to politicians nor think about politics.
"Our job is to do the right thing for the economy irrespective of politics," Mr. Bernanke said earlier this year. "We're not paying any attention to election calendars or political debates. We're looking at the economy."

Abstract: "By forcing them to lend at low interest rates, China's central bank is taxing banks at high rates," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. [...]Chinese families have been investing their growing incomes in real estate, which has led to a huge real estate bubble in some Chinese cities.\n

Full text:   A consumer complaint is ricocheting around the world: low interest rates are eating away at savings.
Bill Taren, a retiree near Orlando, Fla., discovered in August that his credit union would pay only 0.4 percent annual interest on his saving account, even though inflation averaged 2.8 percent over the last year. So he and his wife decided to just stuff their money in the mattress, he says, because at least there "we can see the cash when we want."
Jeanne and André Bussière, in Annecy, France, have a stable pension and a bank account that pays 2 percent interest -- "almost nothing," they say -- even though the consumer price index rose an average of 2.5 percent over the last year.
Jiang Rong, an information technology professional in Xiamen, China, decided to dive back into the speculative real estate market rather than watch his savings wither at the bank. In China, too, the cost of living is outrunning savings, as local restaurants nearly double their prices.
The fact that interest yields are so low in so many parts of the world is no coincidence. Rates are determined not only by markets, but also by government policy. And right now many governments say they have good reason to keep their own borrowing costs as low as they possibly can. Just last week, the government's report on job growth in the United States showed continued weakness, and an international forecasting group warned that the European economic powerhouse, Germany, will fall into recession later this year.
Though bad for people trying to live off their savings, low interest rates happen to be quite good for anyone borrowing money, like governments themselves. Over time, interest rates below the inflation rate allow governments to refinance, erode or liquidate their debt, making it easier to live within their budgets without having to resort to more unpalatable spending cuts or tax increases.
Along with keeping rates low, governments are using a variety of tactics to encourage captive audiences, like pension funds and banks, to buy their debt. Consumers, in other words, are subtly subsidizing governments without even knowing it. Economists have compared this phenomenon to a hidden tax on people's wealth.
"If you ask a central banker is that what you're doing, and why you're doing it, they'll say 'No, we're just trying to get the economy going by making it easier for the private sector to borrow,' " said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse. "But I have a syllogism for you: The government makes the rules. The government needs the money. So why should it surprise if the rules encourage you to lend the government money?"
This is not the first time governments have benefited by depressing interest rates, something economists refer to by the ominous name of "financial repression."
In the three and a half decades after World War II, interest rates in the developed world were on average below zero after adjusting for inflation, according to Carmen M. Reinhart, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. This helped Europe, the United States and Japan slowly whittle away much of their war debt as their economies grew faster than their debt burden.
"The difference is that the postwar period was one of strong growth, when rebuilding and capital investment was going on across the Continent, and there were strong demographics," said Stefan Hofrichter, the chief economist at Allianz Global Investors. "But these elements are not necessarily in place today."
For that reason, economists are less certain that the success of the strategy will be repeated.
Many major economies are already slowing down, if not outright contracting. And the actions taken by governments to keep interest rates low can restrain how much savers have to spend and force fragile banks and pension funds to take on more risk. Ultimately, it could crowd out private borrowing.
Governments have different mechanisms to keep their borrowing costs artificially low.
The Chinese government can just make a call to banks and dictate how much they will lend and at what interest rate.
"By forcing them to lend at low interest rates, China's central bank is taxing banks at high rates," said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. "They make it up to the banks by dictating that banks pay depositors even lower rates, so consumers are getting taxed too."
Inflation-adjusted interest rates on one-year deposits have been below zero since late 2003, he said. China tightly controls how much money can leave the country, so individuals cannot seek higher yields elsewhere. As a result, Chinese families have been investing their growing incomes in real estate, which has led to a huge real estate bubble in some Chinese cities.
Democracies use more roundabout techniques.
"They have to work with their captive audiences -- the pension funds, domestic insurance policies, banks, any domestic buyers they can find -- to force-feed sovereign debt, sometimes under the euphemism of 'macroprudential regulation,' " said Professor Reinhart.
Ireland and France, for example, have required or "encouraged" pension funds to invest in more government debt.
In Spain, fragile banks have been arm-twisted into lending to the government, which forces down the interest rates that the banks can pay to depositors. The Spanish government also capped the amount of cash that could be withdrawn from bank accounts, which prevented people from seeking higher yields elsewhere.
And in the United States, the Federal Reserve is buying up government debt to keep interest rates even lower than what markets would otherwise pay (and rates were low to begin with because investors from all over the world are buying up American debt because it seems relatively safe).
In the nearly four years that the Fed set its benchmark interest rate at zero, the government has saved trillions of dollars in interest payments. If interest rates today were what they were in 2007, the Treasury would be paying about twice as much to service its debt.
Inflation in the United States is very low by historical standards, but interest rates are so paltry that savers are losing money anyway.
"I got hit a couple of years ago pretty badly in the stock market, so now my savings are weighted mostly toward bonds," said Dorothy L. Brooks, 65, who lives in Garland, Tex., and retired about a decade ago. She recently decided to go back to work as an assistant at a local school. "Now both investments are terrible. And I can't put my money in a money-market account because that's crazy. That just pays nothing."
Of course, any economic policy will produce winners and losers, and it seems unlikely that policy makers are deliberately sacrificing retirees either to stimulate the economy or to grind down government debt. More likely, older Americans and other savers are just unintended casualties of policies aimed at other economic targets, particularly the policy making it easier for consumers and companies to borrow.
"If you care about the distribution effects of these policies, and being fairer to the elderly or other people, that seems to argue for carefully designed fiscal stimulus," said Robert J. Shiller, an economics professor at Yale. "With fiscal stimulus you have more control over who gets taxed at what rate and so on. At least it's more transparent anyhow."
But, he added, "the whole reason we like using monetary policy is that it avoids those very political discussions of who gets taxed."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWITH a torrent of money flowing into the United States from China, some savvy real estate brokers are trying to jump in farther upstream to better position themselves to win new clients.
When the New York market dried up at the end of 2008, Sotheby's International Realty turned its focus to Asia. The company dispatched one of its prominent brokers, Nikki Field, to travel to Asia to develop relationships with potential clients. She and her real estate partner, Kevin Brown, began making about four trips a year there, with a growing focus on mainland China.
"We wanted to get out ahead of the world's investment flow," Ms. Field said.
And with good reason. The explosion of wealth in China has created myriad new billionaires eager to diversify their holdings with real estate investments in the United States. Often, they are looking to give their children a plush crash pad for boarding school or college, or a place to live in when they start careers and families. Many wealthy Chinese are also looking for places to invest where they can preserve their wealth and avoid the rising inflation in major Chinese cities like Shanghai and Beijing.
No city in the United States has been a bigger beneficiary of the Chinese buying wave than New York.
So to some brokers, it has made sense to more aggressively seek out Chinese buyers on their own turf.
Since 2008, Ms. Field said, she has been on an at times exasperating journey to understand China. She started taking Mandarin classes about two years ago. More recently she and Mr. Brown have been attending classes in Mandarin and business culture at the State University of New York's Confucius Institute for Business, a program that began in early 2011 and that is seeing a lot of interest from real estate brokers eager to sell to the Chinese.
While other major foreign buying groups in New York -- the Brazilians, the Russians and other Europeans -- all require some cultural understanding for brokers to be successful, no group has posed more of a challenge than the Chinese, brokers say.
The old way of doing business is no longer enough, Ms. Field said. "We as Americans always expected anyone to adapt to our business style, and they did," she said. "That is no longer true with the Chinese. There are too many of them, they have too much power. We truly must adapt to their style of business in order to do deals."
Not all brokers agree that regular trips to China and classes in Chinese business protocol are necessary to win deals in Manhattan.
Janet Wang, a broker at the Corcoran Group, who along with her colleague Carrie Chiang, make up one of the more successful real estate teams doing deals with the Chinese in New York, said that they have politely declined invitations by banks and organizations to travel to China to talk about American real estate.
"I have yet to see how successful those cold approaches and road shows are," Ms. Wang said. "Chinese, especially on the high end, rely heavily on the circle of their trusted friends and family members and people they have done business with in the past."
Dolly Lenz, the vice chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that classes in Mandarin and Chinese culture aren't necessarily the answer.
"In my opinion, that won't be what will work in the end, but it can't hurt," Ms. Lenz said. "What matters to them is trust. And they expect you to be on the ball and know everything."
Ms. Lenz hasn't made a trip to Asia in six years. She said she continues to rely on the web of contacts she made during an eight-year span when she made some 25 trips to Asia.
Still, she is benefiting from the Chinese buying wave. Half of her clients now come from Asia, many of them from China. That is twice as many as she had two years ago, she said.
Chinese billionaires continue to buy high-end properties in buildings like the Time Warner Center, 15 Central Park West and the newest, One57. But in May and June she saw something different: an "almost overwhelming volume" of calls and sales driven largely by interest in apartments ranging from $3 million to $6 million -- what Ms. Lenz calls the "middle market" in Manhattan.
Chinese buyers are also no longer paying all cash as they were a few years ago. In recent months, several Chinese buyers have financed their purchases, some with United States-based loans, Ms. Lenz said. They seem to be leveraging in New York so they can also buy properties in Los Angeles, London or other cities, she said.
On her trips to China, Ms. Field has noticed a change in the conversation among potential clients. "When I first went over there five years ago, my presentations all had to be about return," she said.
"Everyone was looking for returns. Two years ago, return questions almost dried up. Now it is all about wealth preservation. They are anticipating a bubble" in China, she added.
For Ms. Field's team, that concern has translated into growing sales. Meetings with 37 potential Chinese clients this year resulted in nine signed contracts or closings on properties in Manhattan, at prices ranging from $3.5 million to $50 million. Most of those were at One57, she said.
Groups of Chinese are making their way to New York for house-hunting tours. A Mandarin-English luxury lifestyle magazine, YUE, is organizing a real estate conference in New York in October at which Ms. Field is scheduled to speak. More than 150 wealthy Chinese that Sotheby's has reached out to are expected to attend, she said.
After five years of traveling to Asia, Ms. Field acknowledges that she is still not fluent in Mandarin and has "only scratched the surface on the choreography" required to be successful with the mainland Chinese. There is proper protocol with greetings to consider, welcome gifts, seating and who eats when at meals. There are nuances related to distinguishing business time and social time.
Understanding Chinese negotiating styles has been a challenge, she said.
But nothing is more puzzling to brokers and non-Chinese sellers than feng shui, the Chinese belief system that often dictates a final purchase decision. Apartments need to be feng shui-friendly. The layout of the apartment -- which direction it faces, where the kitchen and bathrooms are -- are all factors. Ms. Wang said some of her clients have a family feng shui counselor "on speed dial" and won't hesitate to fly him or her in from China with a compass to evaluate a potential purchase.
Numbers are a particular focus. The number eight sounds like the word for "prosperity," and that is one reason some of the full-floor apartments at One57 were sold early to Chinese buyers for about $50 million apiece. The Extell Development Company, which is building One57, specifically set aside apartment 88 for Chinese buyers, and it is under contract to a Chinese buyer, Ms. Field said.
Developers like Extell and the Related Companies have tried to make buildings feng shui-friendly. The designer Clodagh created peaceful, harmonious lobbies at the Caledonia in West Chelsea and at 225 Rector in Battery Park City that have helped make those buildings popular with Chinese buyers, said Sherry Tobak, a senior vice president of the Related Companies.
But some buildings simply face an uphill battle. At 995 Fifth Avenue, the former Stanhope Hotel, Ms. Field said that Chinese buyers in Beijing and Shanghai initially were excited about an 8,000-square-foot apartment she was selling for $30 million -- until they realized it was a restoration, not a new building. "They were very concerned about past lives that were inhabiting the building," Ms. Field said.
A development at the former Drake Hotel site, 425 Park Avenue, which will be the city's tallest residential building (and some say the country's) when it opens, is not likely to have many Chinese residents. The number four sounds like the word for "death" in Chinese. Both Ms. Field and Ms. Lenz said they haven't received any calls from the Chinese, although wealthy Russians keep calling.
But knowing that four is not a good number to have in an address is the easy part. "I have talked to my tutors about this, hoping to get a road map, so I would understand what would be approved as good feng shui versus bad, but there is no road map," Ms. Field said.
Ms. Field is off to Asia again in two weeks, this time on a swing through Beijing, Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Sotheby's auction house will be selling art and wine. She is expecting the event to attract a lot of high-net-worth Asians from the region.
"It is drawing bigger numbers than our auction houses have in the past for any sales," Ms. Field said. "They are buying art and also looking for the houses to put the art in."
Correction: September 16, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption last Sunday with the Big Deal column, about Chinese buyers in New York City, referred incorrectly to the address of a building in Battery Park City where the lobby was designed with feng shui in mind. It is 225 Rector Place (not Street).

Abstract: Delightfully light-to-the-touch controls and 4-cylinder engines with electric-motor smoothness became hallmarks of cars like the Honda Civic, which elevated refinement in a mainstream small car to an art form. Buyers in the United States and Europe generally have different expectations about vehicle refinement, particularly in regard to the powertrain. Because manual transmissions are far more prevalent in Europe, for example, drivers are more used to the sound, vibrations and comfort levels associated with shifting gears manually.

Full text:   THE idea that good things come in small packages has rarely played well with American car buyers. And who can blame them?
After all, a longstanding notion that bigger was always better, combined with gasoline at bargain prices compared with the rest of the world, led Detroit's executives and engineers to direct their best efforts toward more profitable cars in the midsize and large classes. In the process, they sentenced their small cars to a starvation diet.
"This goes back to the domestic philosophy of 'small cars equal small profit,' " said Jim Hall, managing director of 2953 Analytics, an auto consulting firm. "The philosophy was that you're going to be low-profit, so you want to convince people to buy something bigger."
Even Henry Ford's early investors tried to persuade him to abandon his idea for the compact, efficient Model T and instead concentrate on big 6-cylinder touring cars because that's where the money was. Though Ford prospered with the Model T, his business plan later changed, and in the postwar years hulking, powerful American cars prevailed.
There's no getting around the basic mechanics that make longer, wider, heavier cars feel comfortable on the road and their 6- and 8-cylinder engines inherently silky and quiet running.
"Generally, the lighter and shorter the car, and the shorter its wheelbase, the greater the challenge in your overall refinement options," said Jim Federico, General Motors' global chief engineer for small cars.
He noted that while a smaller car's lighter weight can benefit fuel economy, it may also reduce the pleasure of traveling in it.
"First, mass is actually your friend for reducing N.V.H.," he said, using the engineer's shorthand for noise, vibration and harshness. "So our approaches to designing in refinement on a 3,100-pound Cruze and a 2,200-pound Spark will have many similarities and some differences."
Even the profile and proportions of the bodies are factors: a long car typically manages airflow at the rear more smoothly, while a design that has been truncated abruptly at the rear generates turbulence at speed.
"The shorter the vehicle, the more difficulty engineers have in making aerodynamics work in favor of fuel economy, as well as interior noise," Mr. Federico said. "Cars like the Spark create an expectation, because of their small size, that they have superhigh highway fuel economy. But in reality they have the aerodynamics of a brick."
The refinements that helped turn big cars into Detroit's profit centers were mostly absent when fuel efficiency became a selling point in the 1970s and '80s and a wave of new small cars arrived in showrooms.
Remember the Ford Pinto and Escort? Datsun F10? Dodge Shadow? The Chevrolet Chevette and Citation? They may have been cheap to buy, but there was little joy in driving them. These and other buzzy underachievers -- often called penalty boxes and worse by owners -- set a low bar for the small-car genre in the United States.
The picture is much brighter today. Small cars have the benefit of years of development, and American buyers demand greater levels of polish. Consider how far removed a modern compact like the European-bred Ford Fiesta has advanced from efforts of four decades ago like the troubled Pinto.
Some credit for this trend belongs to the vehicles that came from Japan and Europe, where gasoline has long been expensive and multivehicle families are far less common. There, the reference standard for small cars is on another plane entirely.
Delightfully light-to-the-touch controls and 4-cylinder engines with electric-motor smoothness became hallmarks of cars like the Honda Civic, which elevated refinement in a mainstream small car to an art form.
Buyers in the United States and Europe generally have different expectations about vehicle refinement, particularly in regard to the powertrain. Because manual transmissions are far more prevalent in Europe, for example, drivers are more used to the sound, vibrations and comfort levels associated with shifting gears manually.
Today's small cars actually span three main segments in the global vehicle market. The tiny A-segment cars include the Chevy Spark and Smart Fortwo. They're extremely short and very light. Slightly larger are B-segment cars like the Ford Fiesta and Chevy Sonic. The A- and B-cars are known as subcompacts.
In the C-segment -- typically called compacts -- are the largest of the small cars. Examples include the Toyota Corolla, a perennial sales leader, as well as the Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze, Hyundai Elantra, Honda Civic and Volkswagen's Golf and Jetta.
Chevrolet's entries in all three segments highlight the small-car dimensional differences that can limit their relative refinement. The Spark is just 145 inches long, has a 93.5-inch wheelbase (the distance between axles) and weighs about 2,240 pounds. The B-segment Sonic is 18 inches longer than the Spark with a wheelbase nearly six inches longer; the Sonic is also almost 500 pounds heavier. The C-segment Cruze is yet another 18 inches longer than the Sonic, with a wheelbase more than six inches longer; the Cruze weighs almost 400 more pounds more than the Sonic.
Mike Merlo is chief engineer of the 2012 Dodge Dart, which is based on the well-regarded Alfa Romeo Giulietta platform developed by Chrysler's parent, Fiat.
Mr. Merlo's counterparts in Italy define "vehicle refinement" differently from the American engineers.
"To them, refinement means a 'European feel' of the car," he said. "They spend a lot of time on seat comfort and its relation to the driving position, and maybe not as much time as we do on road isolation characteristics, because their roads are generally in much better condition than ours."
European car owners also favor three-season tires that have exemplary ride and handling characteristics in spring, summer and fall. When winter comes, they install tires with specific winter grip and performance; Americans typically mount all-season tires for year-round use.
"So we had to calibrate the Dart's suspension and ride characteristics for the tire differences," Mr. Merlo said. "The all-season tires led to trade-offs in the car's overall refinement."
A suspension calibration can involve changing the rubber bushings at the connecting points between the suspension and the body. The bushings are rated according to their specific hardness; different bushings give firmer handling, a more compliant ride or a combination of both. Calibration can also involve the selection of alternate wheels and tires, and upgrading to sophisticated, and more expensive, suspension dampers.
Mr. Merlo noted two important lessons, shared by the members of his Chrysler team and their Fiat counterparts, that brought a higher level of refinement to the new Dart. One was a type of door construction commonly used in Europe that features advanced noise-sealing techniques.
The other was Chrysler's unusually high standards for the stiffness of the car's body -- the torsional bending measurement. Chrysler's requirement surprised the Fiat engineers, but the extra rigidity made it possible to build the larger Dart from the smaller foundation of the Alfa.
"These really helped us end up with a cabin that's very quiet," Mr. Merlo said. "Because the body is stiff, it allows us a lot of flexibility to have both a softer-riding car when we want it to be soft and a firmer-riding car when we want it to have outstanding chassis dynamics."
With United States small-car sales up 14 percent in the last decade, automakers are increasingly devoting major design and engineering resources to their development. Extensive computer analysis of body construction and materials, noise and vibration sources and driving dynamics is done in the early stages of vehicle design before any metal parts are made.
The goal is to identify the sources within the vehicle that cause unpleasant acoustics, sloppy control or poor driving dynamics -- and reduce or eliminate them, rather than devising expensive fixes aimed at masking them.
Engineers can select from a deep box of technologies aimed at vehicle refinement, including sound-damping materials behind the dash panel, under the floor and in the headliner; thick door seals and laminated acoustic glass.
But the state of the art in executing a great small car is in knowing how to make the vehicle refined in the right places -- making a steel bulkhead a fraction of a millimeter thicker, or using an adhesive to join two parts.
"The key is to thoroughly understand the vehicle's dynamics and N.V.H. sources up front," Mr. Federico said.
"To an increasing number of American buyers, small cars are no longer base cars," said Mr. Hall, whose early experience as a magazine journalist exposed him to many of the worst small cars of past years. "They want the same things they have in their larger cars, just in a smaller size. They don't need the space, and they're a generation who are more open to small cars than their parents were."

But that's not what the polls or prediction markets are showing. President Obama and Mitt Romney appear to be running neck-and-neck, and in major betting markets Mr. Obama is the heavy favorite.
Has the economy lost some of its ability to influence politics?
Not at all, says Ray C. Fair, the Yale economics professor who uses economic data to predict presidential elections. As the final stretch of the campaign begins, Professor Fair's equations suggest that the economy is a liability for President Obama. But while the economy is weak, Professor Fair says, it's not all that weak, so his model is producing an emotionally unsatisfying result: based on the state of the economy alone, this election is just too close to call.
For a year in which a truly dismal economy sealed the electoral fate of an incumbent president, he says, look at 1980, when President Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan. In the nine months leading up to that election, per capita gross domestic product actually declined at an average annual rate of 3.7 percent, while inflation increased at an annual rate of 7.9 percent.
Professor Fair estimates that the comparable numbers for President Obama are G.D.P. growth of 1.62 percent and inflation of 1.51 percent. The low inflation rate is a plus for the president, while the mediocre G.D.P. growth rate is a problem -- though not a fatal one.
"You can quite properly call this economy 'weak,' " he said, "but it's nothing like what Carter faced." Mr. Reagan's overwhelming victory "fit the economic picture perfectly," he said. "This is a different situation."
He added: "If the economy were significantly weaker or significantly stronger -- if we were in a recession or if economic growth were really dramatically better -- we'd have a much clearer picture of who would win the election. But the economy remains in a range of mediocre growth. It puts us in the margin-of-error range."
As he has done since that 1980 election, Mr. Fair has plugged economic data into a computer model that correlates presidential elections. What's fascinating about the model is that it disregards nearly everything except the strength of the economy -- yet produces reasonably accurate predictions. The relative appeal of the candidates and the issues of their campaigns play no part.
Based on data entered on July 27, the model projects that Mr. Obama will receive only 49.5 percent of the popular vote in November, one percentage point less than Mr. Romney -- but the equations have a "standard error" of 2.5 percent, he said. That means that based on the state of the economy alone, the model is showing that either candidate has a reasonable chance of winning.
Professor Fair's equations reflect the historical edge enjoyed by incumbents. This time around, while the economy is bad enough to essentially wipe out President Obama's advantage, it's not bad enough to kill his chances, the model suggests. (It's available for do-it-yourselfers on Professor Fair's Yale Web site.)
Professor Fair will compute a fresh prediction based on data available in late October, but at this stage the political probabilities aren't likely to shift very much, he says. "It looks as though this will be a horse race, a very close one," he says.
He isn't the only one to rely on economic data for an election forecast. Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at IHS Global Insights, a research firm in Boston, says his firm's projections, using proprietary methods and different economic variables, show that the president is in serious trouble.
The unemployment rate is "a crucial variable that feeds into our equations," Mr. Gault said, and income growth, which also weighs heavily, is low. He estimates a mere 1.1 percent increase in per capita real income growth in the 12 months leading up to the election. The model projects that Mr. Obama will receive only 45.4 percent of the popular vote.
Mr. Gault doubts that the forecast will be borne out, however. "The equation says that based on history, a president running with those sort of economic numbers would be expected to have trouble being re-elected. That may be right. But I think there's no doubt that the equation is underestimating President Obama's chances."
The IHS model has an obvious limitation. It is based on data starting with 1948 and the election of Harry Truman, so it includes no period with economic circumstances as dire as those faced by President Obama at his inauguration in 2009. (Professor Fair's model, which he uses as a teaching device, includes all presidential elections going back to Woodrow Wilson's victory in 1916, and therefore encompasses the elections of the Great Depression.)
The Democrats today are arguing "that the economy was in free fall when President Obama came into office and that it has gotten back on track under his leadership," Mr. Gault said. "That might be effective. It's possible that this is the election that breaks the mold."
Many polls suggest that voters find the president more likable than Mr. Romney, he said, and this, too, could be decisive.
TWO economists, David M. Rothschild of Microsoft Research and Patrick Hummel of Google, have created a model that includes political as well as economic data, and makes state-by-state predictions for the Electoral College. It, too, shows President Obama losing.
But as Election Day draws nearer, Mr. Rothschild has found, prediction markets like Intrade and Betfair, as well as public opinion polls, become increasingly accurate. He melds data from those sources with findings of his "fundamental model" on a Web site, PredictWise, and finds that President Obama is actually the favorite.
"The economy is important," Mr. Rothschild said. "But it doesn't tell you everything."

Full text:   SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Wednesday that it would convene its Parliament this month, an unusual session that South Korean analysts said might officially introduce a program by the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, to revitalize the nation's moribund economy.
Since taking over the leadership after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in December, the younger Mr. Kim has repeatedly emphasized the need to improve the living standards of his impoverished people. He said in April, during his first speech, that he would ensure that North Koreans would "never have to tighten their belts again."
Since July, various news reports in South Korea have quoted anonymous sources in the North as saying that Mr. Kim planned to give factories and collective farms incentives aimed at increasing productivity. The state would let farmers keep 30 percent of their yield, the reports said; until now, it is believed that they could sell only a surplus beyond a government-set quota, which was rarely met. Factories would choose what to produce and how to market their wares, splitting any profits with the state and paying their own workers.
The changes, tested as pilot projects in selected farms and factories, will eventually be extended to the rest of North Korea and replace the country's dysfunctional state ration system, these reports said.
Such changes, if confirmed, would be the North's latest -- and perhaps boldest -- effort to overhaul its economy. A similar effort failed a decade ago.
"The coming parliamentary session will be a bellwether on where Kim Jong-un is taking his country's economy," said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea specialist at Dongguk University in Seoul.
The announcement by the North's official Korean Central News Agency that the Supreme People's Assembly would meet Sept. 25 gave no details as to its agenda. It is rare for the rubber-stamp Parliament to meet more than once a year. It last assembled in April, when legislators elected Mr. Kim to succeed his father as chairman of the National Defense Commission, the North's top state agency, the last of the top military, party and state titles he inherited.
Besides passing legislation and appointing top government officials, the North Korean legislature also announces important domestic and foreign policies. In 2003, it declared that the country would expand its nuclear weapons program.
On Friday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry vowed to expand the country's nuclear arsenal "beyond imagination." The threat came as the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that North Korea was making significant progress in building a new nuclear reactor widely seen as a means to enrich uranium and make weapons-grade plutonium. On Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry said its nuclear program was no longer for "peaceful purposes only" and the country acquired nuclear weapons to cope with the "persistent hostile policy" of the United States.
North Korea watchers in the South said that Mr. Kim, who South Korean officials believe to be 28, may retire some of the North's aging leaders, like Prime Minister Choe Yong-rim and Kim Yong-nam, the president of Parliament, both in their 80s, to put his own stamp on the leadership hierarchy and promote younger technocrats to drive his economic revitalization efforts.
The South Korean news reports on Mr. Kim's economic changes cited North Korean party officials who attended briefings on Mr. Kim's economic program. They varied in details while agreeing on a rough outline.
"The gist is to expand incentives for factories, individuals and collective farms to boost productivity," said Yoo Ho-yeol, a North Korea specialist at Korea University in Seoul.
Within collective farms, groups of four to six workers will be allowed to work as units to encourage competition, according to the Seoul bureau of Radio Free Asia, based in Washington, as well as Web sites in Seoul, which use sources in the North to collect news. Meanwhile, Jang Song-thaek, Mr. Kim's uncle and key policy adviser, visited China last month and won Beijing's commitment to help North Korea build two free economic zones on its border.
On Tuesday, a senior government official in Seoul, speaking on the condition of anonymity to a group of reporters, confirmed one element of the reported plans. He said the North was taking the lucrative trading rights from its powerful military and returning them to the cabinet. In April, Mr. Kim vowed to make the cabinet "the economic command." Analysts say that the North's former army chief, Vice Marshal Ri Yong-ho, who lost all his jobs in July, was fired for resisting an effort by Mr. Kim and Mr. Jang to curtail the military's economic rights.
Analysts in South Korea remained divided over whether Mr. Kim was trying to achieve genuine economic change, of the kind his country's main ally, China, has pursued, or seeking more productivity only to make up for his dwindling state coffers. The government has found it increasingly hard to earn hard currency in recent years as United Nations sanctions tightened and outside aid dwindled.
In a commentary published on the Web site of Sejong Institute of South Korea, Oh Gyeong-seop, an analyst, credited Mr. Kim with "reform within the system," rather than a shift toward a market economy. His program, as reported so far, "still adheres to the state ownership of properties and bans individuals from establishing their own business enterprises," he said.
Mr. Kim said in April that North Korea should stick to "socialist economic principles" while bolstering production. In July, his government even scoffed at reports of economic changes in North Korea, calling them a "hallucination," like "expecting the sun to rise from the west." In August, its main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, said North Korea might change "tactics" but would never abandon its "strategy" of building a "powerful socialist country."
In 2002, North Korea experimented with similar incentives, but it quickly backtracked when the markets and trading activities boomed and the government saw them as a threat to its near-totalitarian control on the population. In 2009, North Korea again cracked down on markets. Such interference set off runaway inflation and occasional outbursts of protest.
Pak Pong-ju, the former North Korean prime minister who was banished for pushing changes too far in 2002, returned to the center of economic policy in 2010. He is supported by Mr. Kim's aunt and Mr. Jang's wife, Kim Kyong-hee, whose influence has increased under the young Mr. Kim, according to analysts and officials here.
Meanwhile, word of a new round of economic change has created uncertainty among North Koreans, already fueling inflation. The price of rice has doubled since early June, Daily NK reported last week.
"Here people think that economic measures mean rising prices," it quoted a North Korean as saying.

Full text:   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- When Ronald Reagan asked voters a week before the 1980 election whether they were better off than four years earlier, he turned a race that had been nip-and-tuck for months into a landslide victory -- and showed how a pointed question can be a lethal political weapon.
Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, speaks often of that election in meetings with donors and other supporters, citing it to reassure those who are alarmed that he has not been able to build a lead against a president burdened with a listless economy, ballooning federal debt and a jobless rate deep in the red zone for an incumbent.
But if Mr. Romney believes the "Are you better off?" question will be political kryptonite for President Obama, he will have to reckon with an economic scorecard that is more mixed than he and other Republicans are claiming on the campaign trail. American voters, too, have more complicated feelings about their fortunes, and those of their children, than they did when Mr. Reagan first posed the question.
"People are not better off than they were four years ago, in the sense of where the economy is today compared to where it was," said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, ticking off statistics from the unemployment rate to housing prices. "But certainly, things could have been a lot worse. You can decide whether the glass is half-empty or half-full."
The half-full argument, which the Obama campaign will promote at the Democratic convention here this week, holds that the economy is far stronger than it was at the depths of the recession in early 2009 when it was bleeding 800,000 jobs a month.
Tepid though it may be, the pace of this recovery is on a par with the aftermath of other post-World War II financial crises, like those in Asia and Latin America.
In July, the United States added 163,000 jobs. The economy, which contracted 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2009, expanded 1.7 percent in the second quarter of this year. Stocks rose too: the Wilshire 5000 market index rebounded from 9,087 in January 2009 to 14,258 last month.
"We avoided falling into the abyss, and it was an open question whether we would," said Lawrence H. Summers, who was Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser until the end of 2010. "It may not be easy to explain, but it's right. It's the truth."
Voters, though, seem squarely on the half-empty side. Only 20 percent of those surveyed think their financial circumstances are better now than four years ago, while 39 percent think they are worse off, according to a CBS News poll conducted in August. That is just as pessimistic as during the financial meltdown a month before the 2008 election.
Moreover, 47 percent of those polled in April by The Times and CBS News think things are likely to get worse rather than better for the next generation of Americans, while only 24 percent think things will improve. That is also worse than when Mr. Obama took office, when 32 percent said the future would be worse.
But, as pollsters note, Americans have consistently expressed pessimism about the future, regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican was in office. In three decades of polling by The Times and CBS News, only during the last year of Bill Clinton's presidency did a solid plurality -- 44 percent -- of people voice optimism about the next generation.
Even in the final year of Mr. Reagan's presidency, in July 1988, 59 percent of people said the future would be "bogged down" by troubles rather than brighter.
Those numbers belie Mr. Romney's claim, in his acceptance speech in Tampa, Fla., that "for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future." They also offer Mr. Obama a line of counterattack.
The enduring pessimism, Mr. Obama's advisers say, reflects a deeper sense of grievance on the part of the middle class, which has seen incomes stagnate since the 1970s, even during times of prosperity. The campaign hopes to exploit those feelings by presenting Mr. Obama as a great defender of the middle class against the predatory policies of Republicans. In this way, they say, he may be able to detach himself from the current economic cycle -- and place himself in the broader current of economic change in America.
"Middle-class insecurity didn't start with the recession," said David Plouffe, a senior strategist to the president. "The question is who do you trust to build the kind of economy that's going to give the middle class security? That's the central mission of our presidency."
From taxes and the health care law to education reform and investments in high-technology manufacturing, Mr. Plouffe said, the Obama campaign will lay out the case that its policies will help the middle class while Mr. Romney's will harm it.
Stanley Greenberg, a pollster who helped develop Mr. Clinton's "It's the economy, stupid" campaign in 1992, said, "People want to know the plan," adding that Mr. Obama has "to talk about moving America to a place where the middle class can prosper."
But analysts say Mr. Obama must be careful about how he talks about investments, because voters understand that the federal government is broke and are therefore wary of promises. "If you stand up and say, 'Here are all the things we're going to spend money on,' you risk getting yourself into a big argument you don't want to have," said Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
For all the talk about the future, Mr. Obama cannot avoid the last four years. Some analysts said he should defend the health care law and the Dodd-Frank financial regulations, but in the context of laying the groundwork for future growth. He should also point out that the United States is one of the fastest-growing economies in the developed world, even at its sluggish pace.
"Yes, it's slower than a get-rich-quick scheme," said Austan Goolsbee, a former economic adviser to Mr. Obama. But as recent bubbles and meltdowns have shown, Mr. Goolsbee said, "get-rich-quick schemes didn't work."
This year is different from 1980 in an important respect. When Mr. Reagan asked voters whether they were better off, he listed four yardsticks: inflation, employment, America's standing in the world and their sense of security. In all of these areas, Mr. Plouffe said, "everything seemed to be off the rails."
This time, inflation is virtually nonexistent, and Mr. Obama has compiled a solid record in foreign policy and in national security.
Still, some experts said Mr. Obama should not underestimate the political salience of "Are you better off?" this year. David Gergen, a political analyst and former presidential adviser, recalls how he and Richard Wirthlin, a Republican pollster, came up with the question at a farm in Virginia while preparing Mr. Reagan for his debate with President Jimmy Carter.
Part of its appeal, Mr. Gergen said, was that Mr. Reagan was good at asking questions, especially ones he knew the answer to. The question, he said, also distilled "a sentiment that was there among voters but had not come together in a coherent way."
" 'Are you better off now than four years ago?' remains potent," Mr. Gergen said. "It may not be as compelling as it was then. But a campaign based on a feeling of people's resignation is not a winning campaign either."

Abstract: The Nixon administration not only supported the Clean Air Act and affirmative action, it also gave us the Environmental Protection Agency, one of the agencies the business community most detests, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to police working conditions. Consider what has happened to federal nonmilitary discretionary spending, which pays for housing vouchers and veterans' health, highway maintenance and the Food and Drug Administration -- essentially all the domestic social programs that are not mandatory like Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.

Full text:   To hear Republicans on the campaign trail, the United States could not have elected a more left-wing president than Barack Obama, one more hostile to business or more eager to expand government power. Left-wing Democrats, I'm sure, would disagree. If they had their druthers, they would probably make a more liberal, more pro-big government choice. Somebody, perhaps, like Richard Nixon.
That's right. The Nixon administration not only supported the Clean Air Act and affirmative action, it also gave us the Environmental Protection Agency, one of the agencies the business community most detests, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to police working conditions. Herbert Stein, chief economic adviser during the administrations of Nixon and Gerald Ford, once remarked: "Probably more new regulation was imposed on the economy during the Nixon administration than in any other presidency since the New Deal."
Nixon bolstered Social Security benefits. He introduced a minimum tax on the wealthy and championed a guaranteed minimum income for the poor. He even proposed health reform that would require employers to buy health insurance for all their employees and subsidize those who couldn't afford it. That failed because of Democratic opposition. Today, Republicans would probably shoot it down.
Historians might protest that it is crazy to brand Nixon a lefty. He was rabidly anti-communist. If anything, they might argue, his seemingly left-leaning policies underscore how uninterested he was in the economy and how far he would go to buy popularity with public money.
Still, Nixon's initiatives would never pass muster in the Republican Party of today, focused as it is on cutting taxes and public spending. His decisions not to try to undo big government programs passed by Lyndon Johnson's Democratic administration underscores how much the political center has moved.
The difference between then and now is that Nixon -- like most mainstream Republicans -- accepted that government had a role to play guaranteeing Americans' economic well-being. That consensus cracked around the time of Ronald Reagan's inaugural speech in 1981. "Government is not the solution to our problems, government is the problem," the president intoned. And the country's political center set off on a long rightward migration.
Interestingly, Americans say their political ideology has changed little since the late 1970s. The share of voters who defined themselves as liberal was 20 percent in 2010, up slightly from 19 percent in 1980, according to polls by The New York Times and CBS News. The conservative share over the same time rose to 35 percent, from 30 percent.
But these polls ignore how much the meanings of the terms have changed. The rightward drift in economic thinking becomes apparent in surveys asking about specific issues. In surveys 25 years ago, 71 percent of Americans believed it was the government's job to take care of those who couldn't care for themselves, according the Pew Research Center. This year the share is down to 59 percent. And most of the shift reflects a decline among Republicans.
Republicans' support for labor unions has fallen sharply since the late 1980s, according to Pew's research, as has their support for protecting the environment. Their drift fits the position of Congressional Republicans, whose views on the economy have been shifting right for the last quarter-century while Democrats' views have remained roughly still. And as Republicans have moved to the right, economic policy has followed.
Consider what has happened to federal nonmilitary discretionary spending, which pays for housing vouchers and veterans' health, highway maintenance and the Food and Drug Administration -- essentially all the domestic social programs that are not mandatory like Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.
When Nixon resigned from office in 1974, nonmilitary discretionary spending amounted to about 4 percent of the nation's economy -- roughly the same as at the end of the Johnson administration before him. Discretionary spending expanded through the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, reaching a high in 1980 of 5.2 percent of the nation's gross output. Then the tide turned: by 2008, before the Great Recession shrank the economy and the fiscal stimulus lifted spending, nonmilitary discretionary spending had fallen to 3.6 percent of national output.
Conservatives will say their ideas won simply because they are better. Social scientists have some alternative hypotheses of our great conservative shift.
The big government strategy from the 1940s through the 1970s produced a spectacular improvement in living standards. But many economists now say they believe the focus on full employment and income redistribution at the expense of everything else also contributed to the strategy's demise, removing the fear of joblessness and encouraging excessive wage increases.
Combined with cheap money printed by the Federal Reserve, it produced a burst of high inflation and high unemployment that bedeviled the 1970s -- discrediting government as an economic steward and letting a new belief take hold: the economy should be left to the market, which always knows best. The end of the cold war, which discredited central planning and other left-wing economic theories, probably helped solidify this stance.
Economic philosophies could shift again, of course. Just as the big government policies of the New Deal emerged from the Great Depression and World War II, the financial crisis and recession just past might again persuade Americans of the perils of unfettered capitalism and cause the pendulum to swing back.
Still, the scorched-earth debate over Obamacare underscores how difficult it will be for the American political system to swallow a more activist government than it has today.
Those nostalgic for Johnson's Great Society programs might remember that they occurred in a kinder, gentler economy in which American companies faced much less competition than they do today. Eastman Kodak could run a mini-welfare state through much of the 20th century --with profit-sharing, health benefits and pension plans -- because it had fat monopoly-type profits. Detroit's Big Three amounted to a cozy oligopoly.
Globalization and its attendant burst of competition put an end to the fairy tale. Companies squeezed costs to stay in the game, zeroing in on wages and working conditions. Unions, once politically powerful institutions fighting for workers' share, became weaker and weaker.
Half a century ago, American employers might have accepted a higher minimum wage on the ground that they needed American consumers to be able to afford their products. They might have supported public education on the ground that they needed an educated American work force. They might have accepted financial oversight because they raised money from small investors in American markets.
But globalization freed businesses from the limitations of one nation and the clutches of the nation state. As businesses' footprints extended around the world, these objectives became less important than assuring low taxes. Free to jump borders, businesses became much more difficult to tax or regulate. And in the current dismal economy, they don't seem too eager for a return of the big government days.
The United States is in ideological flux. The Great Recession has given us both the Tea Party and the Occupy Wall Street movement, and produced perhaps the most polarized government of the modern era. Liberal-leaning Democrats, often disappointed at the president's compromises, will pine for a more aggressive champion of workers' rights. But they may want to count their blessings. Americans today might not elect somebody as liberal as Richard Nixon.

Abstract: In a flier distributed to constituents, Representative David McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, who voted against the plan, said that it "would privatize Medicare for future retirees, raise the retirement age and keep in place the Medicare cuts included in last year's health care bill." A recent advertisement by the party attacked Representative Dan Benishek of Michigan, a freshman, saying that he had voted to "essentially end Medicare and raise costs on seniors by over $6,000," the amount the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the Ryan plan would shift annually to Medicare beneficiaries.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDTAMPA, Fla. -- Even as Mitt Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan exhort Republicans to embrace their proposed Medicare changes and spending cuts, the party's rank and file is growing less enthusiastic about the fight than the top of the ticket.
Republican lawmakers and candidates are distancing themselves from the Ryan budget plan, which helped make the proposed changes a national issue. Republicans say the party now belongs to the more senior -- and historically more malleable -- member of the ticket, Mr. Romney, and not Mr. Ryan, the younger conservative firebrand who has become the subject of repeated Democratic criticism.
"The plan is the Romney plan," said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. "He's the one that's going to drive the agenda."
The distancing ranges from subtle to stark. Some first-time House candidates, unencumbered by a vote on the Ryan plan, have told local news media outlets that they have not and will not endorse the proposals found in the vice-presidential nominee's budget. Some veteran lawmakers who voted for the plan are demurring on whether it will be the party's policy blueprint, while the few in tough races who voted against it have made their opposition a calling card.
In a flier distributed to constituents, Representative David McKinley, Republican of West Virginia, who voted against the plan, said that it "would privatize Medicare for future retirees, raise the retirement age and keep in place the Medicare cuts included in last year's health care bill." The flier added, "The Congressional Budget Office determined the plan would nearly double out-of-pocket health care costs for future retirees."
Ricky Gill, a 25-year-old Republican challenging Representative Jerry McNerney in California's Central Valley, said he "commended the fact that there's a mature conversation about the national debt." But, he added, "it would be very difficult for me to endorse any specific plan without having a seat at the table."
This week, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio repeatedly declined to say that a Republican election victory in November would be a mandate to pass a Ryan-style Medicare overhaul, instead pointing to energy, tax reform and more generalized deficit reduction.
Some Republicans continue to say that they will benefit from showing that they are willing to make hard choices about the deficit.
"In this election, on this issue, the usual posturing on the left isn't going to work," Mr. Ryan declared at the Republican National Convention. "Ladies and gentlemen, our nation needs this debate. We want this debate. We will win this debate."
Yet even Mr. Ryan chose to criticize Mr. Obama's Medicare cuts in his speech instead of describing his own plan.
The change in tone will disappoint conservatives like the anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who has said that the job of a Republican president is to sign the laws passed by a Republican Congress. Those laws were supposed to be dictated by Mr. Ryan's "Path to Prosperity," the budget approved this year by the House, which was seen by conservatives not as a starting point for negotiations but as marching orders.
Such certitude is giving way to political reality. Democrats have made the Ryan plan's Medicare prescriptions their No. 1 issue in the battle for the House and Senate. Even Republicans conceded the attacks are taking a toll.
One Republican political consultant working on House and Senate races admitted "the Ryan budget is well under water," hurting Republican House candidates in California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and Virginia, as well as Representative Rick Berg of North Dakota, once considered a shoo-in for the Senate. Republicans can effectively counter the Medicare attacks by going after Democrats on the president's health care law, the consultant said, but every moment tussling over health care is a diversion from the issue that Republicans say can win the race -- the economy.
Democrats are happy to concur. "We left for recess in a fairly neutral environment, where nearly a month later, we have a good stiff wind at our backs," said Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "That wind is mostly propelled by Paul Ryan and his budget."
Democrats are now pouring on the Medicare attack. A recent advertisement by the party attacked Representative Dan Benishek of Michigan, a freshman, saying that he had voted to "essentially end Medicare and raise costs on seniors by over $6,000," the amount the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the Ryan plan would shift annually to Medicare beneficiaries.
The same line of attack is on the air in North Carolina against the Republican challenger David Rouzer, coupled with the charge that the Ryan budget also would cut taxes for millionaires, "definitely not North Carolina values."
Republican candidates are reacting accordingly. Along with his colleague Mr. McKinley, Representative Denny Rehberg, Republican of Montana, openly disparages the Medicare proposal in his run for the Senate.
Mr. Gill, the California House candidate, cautioned, "The Republican Party has to be the party of fairness."
Even veteran Republicans who are not facing the Democratic fusillade are grappling with the reality of legislating such sweeping changes to programs as popular as Medicare. Under the Ryan proposal, those currently under 55 would no longer receive guaranteed government health coverage at 65. Instead, at 67, they would receive a fixed annual subsidy to purchase private health insurance policies or pay into the government fee-for-service plan. That subsidy would increase each year slightly faster than the growth of the economy, regardless of the rate of health care cost inflation.
Mr. Romney has embraced the plan in theory, and said during the primary campaign that, as president, he would sign it into law. But some Republicans suggest that he would take a less dogmatic approach to negotiations that would likely include Democrats. Mr. Romney has "a track record of bringing people in to work together," Mr. Hoeven said.
"Nobody knows whether it's going to be the full Ryan plan or not," cautioned Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare. "Mitt Romney will carefully go over every aspect of it."
Officials at the National Republican Congressional Committee said the partisan attacks were already losing their potency. Guy Harrison, executive director of the committee, predicted that within a week or so, frustrated Democrats would move on to other issues.
But other Republicans do not expect Democrats to let up, and Democrats signaled even before Mr. Ryan was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee that his plan would be at the center of their 2012 strategy. Tom Cotton, a rising Republican star in Arkansas running for the seat of Representative Mike Ross, a Democrat who is retiring, said his opponent had tried to label him a Ryan "clone." It will not work in his Republican-leaning district, he said, but other candidates are struggling.
Still, he said, most candidates are ready to fight for Mr. Ryan's plan.
"They recognize, as the House members already there recognize, we have to have this debate, and we have to win this debate," Mr. Cotton said, recalling ambush training he had in the Army when soldiers were drilled to face an attack head-on. "This is the most predictable ambush in politics. You don't duck and cover. You turn and face it."
Democrats are pointing to a number of recent polls, conducted by Democratic firms and suggesting that their candidates are gaining ground. On Friday, the House Majority PAC released a poll in a Minnesota race, showing that the Democratic challenger, Nick Nolan, was essentially tied with Representative Chip Cravaack, a freshman Republican.
This week, polls conducted for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed several Democrats in tight races with incumbent Republicans, including Patrick Murphy and Representative Allen B. West, a Tea Party-backed freshman, in a new Republican-leaning district in Florida; Dan Maffei and Representative Ann Marie Buerkle, another freshman, in a rematch from 2010 in upstate New York; and in a newly drawn district in California, Ami Bera and Representative Dan Lungren.
A poll conducted in early July by the Democratic firm Lake Research Partners for Mr. McNerney in California, who barely survived 2010 and now is running in a redrawn district far from his Bay Area base of support, showed Mr. Gill running far behind, Mr. Gill, however, pointed to a July 28 poll conducted by the Tarrance Group for his campaign that showed the race to be much closer.
Correction: September 4, 2012, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about Republican lawmakers and candidates who are distancing themselves from Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget plan misstated the age at which recipients would be affected by his Medicare proposal. It is for people currently under 55, not 55 or younger.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- When Mitt Romney declared during his unsuccessful campaign for the Senate in 1994 that the federal minimum wage should rise with inflation, a break with Republican doctrine, both Democrats and Republicans accused him of pandering to Massachusetts voters.
Mr. Romney has now maintained that position for almost two decades, qualifying his stand as he sought the Republican presidential nomination but never relinquishing the view that inflation adjustments would be good for workers, good for employers and good for the broader economy.
As he prepares to accept his party's nomination this week, his steady support for an idea vigorously opposed by conservatives and business groups underscores the complexity of predicting how he might manage the national economy.
During the current campaign, Mr. Romney has embraced the conservative view that government can best help the economy by getting smaller, and he has selected as his running mate Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who is a standard-bearer for fiscal conservatism. But a review of the positions that Mr. Romney has taken on economic issues during his two decades in politics reveals a recurring tension between his political commitments and his private sector experience at Bain Capital, which he often cited earlier in his political career in advocating a larger government role in the economy.
Mr. Romney has propounded the benefits of expanding and enforcing regulations, including the minimum wage and environmental laws. He has argued that government spending, including public investments in private companies, can stimulate the economy and create jobs. And he has advocated tax penalties to shape public behavior, as in his successful campaign to penalize Massachusetts residents who do not obtain health insurance.
In recent years he has modified or abandoned some of these positions as he courted Republican support. But the minimum wage is an example of an issue on which he has held constant.
And some people who have known him in both of his careers say that he still sees government through the pragmatic eyes of a businessman.
"I think his basic philosophy is, whether you're running a for-profit business, a nonprofit or a government agency, at the end of the day one should evaluate how one is doing, and continually evaluate success, and the right criteria is the level of customer satisfaction," said Thomas G. Stemberg, the founder of Staples and a friend and adviser to Mr. Romney since the mid-1980s.
The looming showdown over the federal budget would provide one of the first tests of how Mr. Romney would balance these influences as president. He has said during the campaign that the deficit should be reduced solely through spending cuts, and that less spending would stimulate growth. Mr. Ryan is a leading proponent of both views. But in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney worked with the Democratic-controlled legislature to close budget deficits through a combination of spending cuts and increased revenues from higher fees for public services and the elimination of some corporate tax deductions.
A Lost Investment
In 1985, Mr. Romney and his colleagues at Bain Capital made one of their first investments in Sanborn Industries, a Massachusetts company that made recycling systems for industrial coolants. The Environmental Protection Agency had just proposed a rule encouraging such recycling. But the agency delayed enactment, potential customers waited and Bain lost its money.
The lesson that Mr. Romney took, which he described 25 years later in his book "No Apology" was that the regulation was a good idea but that the government should have moved more quickly. "The regulations ultimately led to better machining industry practices," he wrote, "but because they weren't enforced for almost a decade, we lost our investment."
His support for minimum wage increases reflected the same principle, that government enforcement of minimum standards is economically valuable -- "I wish more Republicans and Democrats alike understood that important truth," he wrote -- and that businesses benefit when that enforcement is predictable.
When he endorsed inflation indexing during his 2002 campaign for governor, he said it would let businesses plan better than they could with intermittent minimum wage increases at the whim of politicians. "I do not believe that indexing the minimum wage will cost us jobs," he said. "I believe it will help us to retain jobs."
He said that again in 2008, during his first presidential campaign, and in January while campaigning in New Hampshire.
But under fire from conservatives, he modified his position, saying that automatic increases in the minimum wage should be suspended in some circumstances, like periods of high unemployment.
Mr. Romney has also stopped talking about the benefits of regulation, focusing instead on its costs. His campaign platform includes proposals to curtail rule making, like capping the total cost of regulation at the current level, without adjusting for inflation.
"For every regulation, there are unintended consequences, underestimated costs and unwanted influence from special interests," Mr. Romney said in a speech in March at the University of Chicago. "When the heavy hand of government replaces the invisible hand of the market, economic freedom is the inevitable victim."
A few weeks after taking office in 2003, Mr. Romney visited a solar panel factory in Lowell, a run-down mill town north of Boston, to announce that a state trust fund would invest $9 million in five companies developing clean energy technology and place an additional $15 million in a privately managed fund to make further investments.
During the current campaign, he has said that the government should not invest in individual companies, criticizing the Obama administration for doing so in cases like that of Solyndra, a bankrupt solar panel maker.
But in 2003, he extolled the potential economic benefits. The fund, he said, "can become a major economic springboard for the commonwealth by focusing on job creation in the renewable energy sector."
Mr. Romney's predecessor, Jane M. Swift, had proposed that the state should take $81.6 million from the Renewable Energy Trust, about half of its financing, to pare the state's budget deficit.
Rob Pratt, who ran the fund, said that Mr. Romney's staff called shortly after the inauguration to ask about investments that were ready to be announced. "It was very encouraging that he wanted to put his imprint on it," Mr. Pratt said in an interview. "After that, I never felt that they were going to take a run at gutting the trust."
A month later, in February, when the State Senate proposed draining $35 million from the fund, Mr. Romney argued for spending cuts instead. He ultimately agreed to take $17 million from the trust, but he immediately announced legislation requiring the state to buy a comparable amount of renewable energy, maintaining support for the industry by other means.
Mr. Romney's current opposition to such investments has placed him at odds with many business interests. "I know that not everyone is happy with my discourse on this," he told the Business Roundtable, an association of executives, in June. "But I don't think the government should be investing in individual companies to try and promote individual companies."
It has also disappointed some of those he worked with in Massachusetts. William Osborn, a private manager selected to help the state invest $15 million through the spinoff Green Energy Fund, said Mr. Romney had liked the idea of combining the strengths of government, including a longer investment horizon, with private sector discipline.
"He's altogether a different person now," Mr. Osborn said, "but back then there was no complaint that he wasn't supportive of this stuff."
Shunning a Tax Pledge
Barbara Anderson spent more than half an hour in March 2002 fruitlessly trying to persuade Mr. Romney, then seeking the Republican nomination for governor, to sign the pledge for no new taxes that the last three governors, all Republicans, had signed.
Ms. Anderson, executive director of Citizens for Limited Taxation, an influential group in the small world of Massachusetts conservatives, met with Mr. Romney in a hotel conference room north of Boston with a copy of the pledge printed on parchment-style paper "that looked a little businesslike," she said.
"What I remember is that he never stopped smiling," Ms. Anderson said in an interview. "He listened and gave us all the time we needed to make our case, and then he said what he was going to say: 'I'm just not going to sign it. It's not necessary. I'm not going to raise taxes.' "
But Mr. Romney would soon anger conservatives with a tax proposal that was not intended to raise any new money. In October 2002, he called for Massachusetts to shift from a flat-rate annual tax on automobiles to a tax based on emissions. Mr. Romney was careful to describe the plan as "revenue neutral." It was meant to change behavior. Owners of low-emission vehicles would pay less; owners of high-emission vehicles would pay more.
Ms. Anderson told The Boston Globe that it was an example of "big mama government telling us how to lead our lives."
The idea found little support in the legislature, but it was representative of Mr. Romney's broader view that government could improve the economy not just through tax cuts but also through penalties -- as in his landmark plan to penalize people who do not carry health insurance.
"Experience proves again and again that incentives are more effective than controls," he wrote in his book.
As Mr. Romney sought to close the state's budget deficit, he also sought to raise revenues by invoking what he described as the conservative principle of personal responsibility, cutting corporate tax deductions and raising fees for things like ice rink rentals and business licenses.
He invoked the same idea in a deal with the legislature to replenish the state's unemployment fund through a combination of benefit cuts and higher fees on businesses, with most of the burden falling on companies that had most frequently dropped workers onto the dole. All states use a version of this "experience rating" to set unemployment taxes; Massachusetts under Mr. Romney moved from a modest adjustment to one of the steepest slopes.
"It was kind of hard to argue against those changes," said Bill Vernon, Massachusetts state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business trade group.
Mr. Romney has indicated, however, that he would not replicate the Massachusetts approach nationally. He has said that the federal government's revenues are sufficient, and that he would focus on spending cuts.
He has also backed away from the use of tax penalties. In early 2006, he proposed what he later described as a "similar but more palatable" plan to offer a tax break for buyers of fuel-efficient vehicles, with no attempt to recover the lost revenues from owners of other vehicles.
And in December 2006, while preparing for his first presidential bid, Mr. Romney signed his name to a national version of the pledge for no new taxes.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Weapons sales by the United States tripled in 2011 to a record high, driven by major arms sales to Persian Gulf allies concerned about Iran's regional ambitions, according to a new study for Congress.
Overseas weapons sales by the United States totaled $66.3 billion last year, or more than three-quarters of the global arms market, valued at $85.3 billion in 2011. Russia was a distant second, with $4.8 billion in deals.
The American weapons sales total was an "extraordinary increase" over the $21.4 billion in deals for 2010, the study found, and was the largest single-year sales total in the history of United States arms exports. The previous high was in fiscal year 2009, when American weapons sales overseas totaled nearly $31 billion.
A worldwide economic decline had suppressed arms sales over recent years. But increasing tensions with Iran drove a set of Persian Gulf nations -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman -- to purchase American weapons at record levels.
These Gulf states do not share a border with Iran, and their arms purchases focused on expensive warplanes and complex missile defense systems.
The report was prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a division of the Library of Congress. The annual study, written by Richard F. Grimmett and Paul K. Kerr and delivered to Congress on Friday, is considered the most detailed collection of unclassified arms sales data available to the public.
The agreements with Saudi Arabia included the purchase of 84 advanced F-15 fighters, a variety of ammunition, missiles and logistics support, and upgrades of 70 of the F-15 fighters in the current fleet.
Sales to Saudi Arabia last year also included dozens of Apache and Black Hawk helicopters, all contributing to a total Saudi weapons deal from the United States of $33.4 billion, according to the study.
The United Arab Emirates purchased a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, an advanced antimissile shield that includes radars and is valued at $3.49 billion, as well as 16 Chinook helicopters for $939 million.
Oman bought 18 F-16 fighters for $1.4 billion.
In keeping with recent trends, most of the weapons purchases, worth about $71.5 billion, were made by developing nations, with about $56.3 billion of that from the United States.
Other significant weapons deals by the United States last year included a $4.1 billion agreement with India for 10 C-17 transport planes and with Taiwan for Patriot antimissile batteries valued at $2 billion -- an arms deal that outraged officials in Beijing.
To compare weapons sales over various years, the study used figures in 2011 dollars, with amounts for previous years adjusted for inflation to provide a consistent measurement.
A policy goal of the United States has been to work with Arab allies in the Persian Gulf to knit together a regional missile defense system to protect cities, oil refineries, pipelines and military bases from an Iranian attack.
The effort has included deploying radars to increase the range of early warning coverage across the Persian Gulf, as well as introducing command, control and communications systems that could exchange that information with new batteries of missile interceptors sold to the individual nations.
The missile shield in the Persian Gulf is being built on a country-by-country basis -- with these costly arms sales negotiated bilaterally between the United States and individual nations.

Full text:   7:24 p.m. | Updated with additional details.
Americans nearing retirement age have suffered disproportionately after the financial crisis: along with the declining value of their homes, which were intended to cushion their final years, their incomes have fallen sharply.
The typical household income for people age 55 to 64 years old is almost 10 percent less in today's dollars than it was when the recovery officially began three years ago, according to a new report from Sentier Research, a data analysis company that specializes in demographic and income data.
Across the country, in almost every demographic, Americans earn less today than they did in June 2009, when the recovery technically started. As of June, the median household income for all Americans was $50,964, or 4.8 percent lower than its level three years earlier, when the inflation-adjusted median income was $53,508.
The decline looks even worse when comparing today's incomes to those when the recession began in December 2007. Then, the median household income was $54,916, meaning that incomes have fallen 7.2 percent since the economy last peaked.
Income drops vary significantly by age, though. Households led by people between the ages of 55 and 64 have taken the biggest hit; their household incomes have fallen to $55,748 from $61,716 over the last three years, a decline of 9.7 percent.
Sustained unemployment among older workers may be at least partly to blame for this decline. Unemployment rates for that age group are relatively low, but once older workers lose their jobs, they have an unusually hard time finding re-employment. And even when they do find new work, they usually take a pay cut.
"I was laid off in '08, and I never really managed to get back into the job market," said Jan Thomas, 62, who lives in Sarasota, Fla. She decided to apply for Social Security early, even though that means her benefits are lower than they would be if she had waited until 66. "I've pretty much gone through my savings at this point. You know, taking money out of one account, then the other. Then it all just kind of went poof."
Younger Americans have also felt income declines in the three years since the recovery began. The inflation-adjusted median household income for those 25 to 34 fell 8.9 percent, while that for people under age 25 fell 6.1 percent.
Incomes for the oldest Americans, on the other hand, have risen steadily since the recovery began. Among those 65 to 74, the inflation-adjusted median household income rose 6.5 percent (to $42,113 from $39,548), and among those age 75 and older, the increase was 2.8 percent (to $26,991 from $26,244).
It's not clear why incomes rose for older people when as they fell for everyone else.
This may be because older Americans are working longer, taking in more income at more advanced ages. Perhaps they are working longer partly to compensate for the decline in the value of their homes. Rising employment rates among older people predate the housing bust, however.
The share of people over 65 who have jobs has been rising since the early 1990s; in 2011, 16.7 of people over 65 worked, compared with 11.1 percent two decades earlier.
The chart below -- which is based on a different Census Bureau survey that goes through 2010 only, unfortunately -- shows that almost all age groups have actually seen their income rise over most of the last 50 years, although incomes for non-seniors have been much more volatile. (Remember, though, that during recessions older people have at least some steady income from Social Security.)
Income losses since the recovery began also varied depending on educational attainment, Sentier Research found.
People with the least education and people with the most education had smaller income losses, supporting the idea that the job market in the United States is "hollowing out," as the M.I.T. economist David Autor has proposed, meaning that high-skilled and low-skilled jobs are growing while midskilled jobs are thinning out.
The median household income of high school dropouts has fallen 5.3 percent (to $24,495 from $25,860), while that for college graduates has fallen 5.9 percent (to $83,378 from $88,570).
Meanwhile, incomes for those with a midlevel education -- a high school diploma, some college but no degree, or an associate's degree -- slid much further.
As you can see in the chart above, the biggest percentage decline was for people who took some college courses but never got a degree. Their median income has fallen 9.3 percent over the course of the recovery so far, to $46,200 from $50,948. That must especially sting, given that these income losses are probably accompanied by student loan debt.
Black Americans appear to have suffered the most, according to the Sentier report.
The real median annual household income for blacks fell 11.1 percent from June 2009 to June 2012, landing at $32,498 from $36,567. That compares with 5.2 percent for whites, 3.6 percent for other race combinations (including Asians) and 4.1 percent for Hispanics -- all of whom started with higher incomes than blacks.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   ISHWARDI, Bangladesh -- The air thickened with tear gas as police and paramilitary officers jogged into the Ishwardi Export Processing Zone firing rubber bullets and swinging cane poles. Panicked factory workers tried to flee. A seamstress crumpled to the ground, knocked unconscious by a shot in the head.
Dozens of people were bloodied and hospitalized. The officers were cracking down on protests at two garment factories inside this industrial area in western Bangladesh. But they were also protecting two ingredients of a manufacturing formula that has quietly made Bangladesh a leading apparel exporter to the United States and Europe: cheap labor and foreign investment.
Both were at stake on that March morning. Workers earning as little as $50 a month, less than the cost of one of the knit sweaters they stitched for European stores, were furious over a cut in wages. Their anger was directed at the Hong Kong and Chinese bosses of the two factories, turning a labor dispute into something potentially much larger.
"If any foreigner got injured or killed, it would damage the country's image around the globe," said a police supervisor, Akbar Hossein, who participated in the crackdown. "We all know the importance of these factories and this industry for Bangladesh."
Bangladesh, once poor and irrelevant to the global economy, is now an export powerhouse, second only to China in global apparel exports, as factories churn out clothing for brands like Tommy Hilfiger, Gap, Calvin Klein and H&M. Global retailers like Target and Walmart now operate sourcing offices in Dhaka, the capital. Garments are critical to Bangladesh's economy, accounting for 80 percent of manufacturing exports and more than three million jobs.
But with "Made in Bangladesh" labels now commonplace in American stores, Bangladesh's manufacturing formula depends on its having the lowest labor costs in the world, with the minimum wage for garment workers set at roughly $37 a month. During the past two years, as workers have seen their meager earnings eroded by double-digit inflation, protests and violent clashes with the police have become increasingly common.
In response, Bangladeshi leaders have deployed the security tools of the state to keep factories humming. A high-level government committee monitors the garment sector and includes ranking officers from the military, the police and intelligence agencies. A new special police force patrols many industrial areas. Domestic intelligence agencies keep an eye on some labor organizers. One organizer who had been closely watched, Aminul Islam, was found tortured and killed in April in a case that is unsolved.
"The garment industry is No. 1 for exports and dollars for the country," said Alonzo Suson, who runs the Solidarity Center in Dhaka, an A.F.L.-C.I.O.-affiliated labor rights group. "Any slowdown of that development is a national security issue."
For the Obama administration, which has cultivated Bangladesh as a regional ally in southern Asia, labor unrest has become a matter of growing concern. In a May visit to Dhaka, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton raised labor issues and the Islam murder case. In June, Ambassador Dan W. Mozena warned Bangladeshi garment factory owners that any perception of a rollback on labor rights could scare off multinational brands and damage the garment industry. "These developments could coalesce into a perfect storm that could threaten the Bangladesh brand in America," he said.
For global brands, which are forever chasing the cheapest labor costs from country to country, Bangladesh has been a hot spot, especially as wages have risen in China. McKinsey, the consulting giant, has called Bangladesh the "next China" and predicted that Bangladeshi garment exports, now about $18 billion a year, could triple by 2020.
But in late July, representatives from 12 major brands and retailers, alarmed by the rising labor unrest, prodded the Bangladeshi government to address wage demands, a suggestion rejected by the labor minister. "No reason to be worried," Khandker Mosharraf Hossain, the minister, told reporters, noting that brands were not canceling orders.
Bangladesh was born in bloodshed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan and has since gyrated between military rule and fragile democracy. It has about 150 million people and is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Derided by Henry A. Kissinger as the world's "basket case," Bangladesh has since made considerable progress on fronts like women's literacy, juvenile and maternal mortality, per capita income, and life expectancy.
This upward arc is often credited to Bangladesh's vibrant civil society, but the garment sector, in which about 80 percent of the workers are women, has also played a critical role, providing socially acceptable jobs to women in a conservative Muslim country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in lobbying the United States for favorable trade preferences, has argued that such policies would improve the lives of millions of poor women.
Bangladesh's Home Ministry, in a written response to questions, said the government does not favor factory owners over workers but acts as a "referee/umpire" while maintaining an "investment friendly" environment for foreign and domestic investors.
Yet Ms. Hasina's government has resisted expanding labor rights in a country where the owners of about 5,000 garment factories wield enormous influence. Factory owners are major political donors and have moved into news media, buying newspapers and television stations. In Parliament, roughly two-thirds of the members belong to the country's three biggest business associations. At least 30 factory owners or their family members hold seats in Parliament, about 10 percent of the total.
"Politics and business is so enmeshed that one is kin to the other," said Iftekharuzzaman, director of Transparency International Bangladesh."There is a coalition between the sector and people in positions of power. The negotiating position of the workers is very, very limited."
A Country Within a Country
Mohammad Helal Uddin joined Rosita Knitwear in May 2010 and was thrilled to have the job. Rosita was inside the new Ishwardi Export Processing Zone, not far from his home village, meaning he could live with his wife and two young daughters and not have to toil in the fields. "I feel I have a kind of dignity in this job," he said.
Mr. Uddin, 28, worked in the knitting department and after six months was promoted, with a base salary of $55 a month. He soon began to notice irregularities. Workers were not getting promised annual raises, monthly attendance bonuses or the 17 paid holidays a year, beyond their usual one day off a week. Employees also said they worked four hours of overtime a day but were paid for only two.
Three decades ago, Bangladesh created a network of export zones to attract foreign investment with tax incentives and other benefits. Today, a large majority of Bangladesh's garment factories lie outside these zones, but the zones are favored by foreign investors. Rosita and its sister factory, Megatex, both owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate South Ocean, were the first plants in the Ishwardi zone. Zones like Ishwardi operate like countries within a country. They are governed by a separate agency, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, and by separate laws. By tradition, the authority has been run by a military officer, active duty or retired, and many factories have hired retired soldiers to oversee security.
For workers, wages were higher in the zones and conditions were better. But unions were initially banned, and workers had no right to organize until 2004 when Parliament, facing international pressure, approved worker associations at individual factories.
At the Rosita factory, workers elected a 15-member association last December, with Mr. Uddin as president. In January, a female employee complained that a Bangladeshi middle manager was pressuring her to have sex with one of the Chinese bosses. Enraged, workers demanded that the management address her complaint as well as the discrepancies over annual raises and earned leave. Six weeks of confrontation and chaos followed. In February, equipment in the Rosita factory was damaged during a rampage. Nearly 300 workers were accused of vandalism and fired, with their names posted on a blacklist at the gate of the Ishwardi zone. Mr. Uddin, who denied any wrongdoing, was fired and temporarily jailed.
When he tried to return to work on Feb. 20, Mr. Uddin said two black-clad officers hustled him into the tiny guardhouse. The officers were members of the Rapid Action Battalion, a government paramilitary force infamous for vigilante attacks known as "cross fire" killings. He said one of the officers ordered him to sign a resignation letter.
"I didn't do anything wrong," Mr. Uddin said he told them.
He said one of the officers pushed a gun against his shoulder. "If you don't sign," the officer told him, according to Mr. Uddin, "we will take you in the car and you will have to face the cross-fire."
Mr. Uddin signed. Inside the factories, according to several workers, police and paramilitary officers walked through the workrooms, holding termination letters. The message was clear: work or leave.
By March, an American labor rights group, the Institute for Global Labor and Human Rights, was advocating for the workers. A South Ocean executive arrived at Ishwardi and promised to address worker complaints over wages and unpaid leave. Then on March 20, workers discovered that managers had cut the piece rate, a type of production bonus, meaning a loss of wages. Another standoff ensued as managers closed the factories. But when workers returned March 25, the wage cut had not been fully restored.
Hundreds of workers gathered outside the front door of the factory in an impromptu sit-down strike. Eight workers, interviewed in June, said all the managers had left the factories. A small contingent of police officers soon arrived and ordered everyone back to work. A seamstress said a police officer knocked her to the ground, beating her unconscious with a stick and shredding her clothes. "I kept asking them to stop," said the seamstress, who asked not to be identified, fearing reprisals. "But even after I fell to the ground, they kept beating me and pulled my hair."
Workers began throwing stones and chanting slogans against the police, who fled. Hours later, after officials in Dhaka were notified, officers from the Rapid Action Battalion as well as surrounding police stations arrived. Officer Hossein, the police supervisor, denied that the police were aggressors, saying officers were told that foreign managers were trapped inside the factories and that angry workers were vandalizing equipment. "They attacked the police," Officer Hossein said. "They started the violence."
Cellphone videos show police officers firing rubber bullets and pummeling workers with cane poles. "They treated workers as if they were not human beings," one worker said.
The Power Equation
Bangladesh's two major political parties, the governing Awami League and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, often seem engaged in a blood feud. Yet, many analysts say, the two parties agree on one thing: safeguarding the garment industry.
Three months after the clash at Ishwardi, tens of thousands of angry workers protested near Dhaka, demanding higher wages and crippling one of the country's most important industrial zones for more than a week. Riot police officers dispersed the protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets, as scores of people were injured.
Following huge protests in 2010, Ms. Hasina raised the minimum wage for garment workers to $37 a month from about $20. But her government has resisted the renewed worker demands, even as executives at some leading brands have voiced support for adjusting wages and expressed concerns about labor unrest.
In June, top executives at the Swedish retailer H&M fretted that recurring labor protests were disrupting production and called on Bangladeshi factories to rectify the situation.
Major brands have been stung by bad publicity. This year, War on Want, a nonprofit group, found that workers in five factories making products for Nike, Puma and Adidas were paid less than the minimum wage and complained of workplace abuse and sexual harassment. In March, the parent company of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, PVH Corp., hurriedly donated $1 million toward a factory safety initiative as ABC News was preparing to broadcast a report on a fire that killed 29 workers in a Bangladeshi factory making clothes for Tommy Hilfiger.
"They want to see better standards and conditions in factories in Bangladesh," said Julia K. Hughes, president of the United States Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, a trade group in Washington. "No company is arguing that wages should not rise in Bangladesh. They are not saying what the wage should be, but absolutely wages should go up."
But many factory owners are skeptical that buyers are truly willing to pay higher prices. One owner, Shawkat Ali Bhuiyan, said he had stopped working with companies like Walmart and Target because his profit margin was almost nonexistent, while some Bangladeshi labor leaders blame the foreign brands for exploiting workers.
"We need to clean up the whole supply chain," said Roy Ramesh Chandra, a powerful public sector union leader. "The brands need to fulfill their responsibility. The manufacturers need to fulfill their responsibility. And the government should comply with international obligations and respect international labor standards."
Bangladesh has responded to international pressure in the past, sharply curtailing child labor and improving safety conditions in the 1990s. Now, though, the pressure points are the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain for wages, issues that require action by a political system dominated by business interests, including the garment sector.
A. K. Azad, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, played down the garment sector's political clout. "We are not powerful," he said, adding: "Power lies with the politicians. Power lies with the media."
But many apparel tycoons have also gone into politics or begun media careers, purchasing newspapers or starting independent news channels. Mr. Azad, who owns one of the country's biggest garment factories, also owns a Bengali-language newspaper and a television station. Several Western diplomats privately noted that news coverage often emphasizes the disruptions caused by protests above the concerns of workers.
At the Rosita and Megatex factories, South Ocean management hired a labor oversight firm, Verité, which detailed a host of problems, including humiliation of workers, summary firings and deliberate interference with the ability of workers to organize. New management teams are now running the factories, and Verité is helping put in place changes to increase wages and protect worker rights. "South Ocean have taken labor issues at the two factories extremely seriously and have taken swift actions to address those issues," the company's law firm, Winston & Strawn of Hong Kong, said in a statement.
Many of the workers involved in the March 25 clash are back on the job, despite their anger over how they have been treated. The seamstress who was knocked unconscious, her clothes shredded, said she had little choice, since she was the family's sole breadwinner. "I am helpless," she said. "We have to get food."
South Ocean dropped charges against Mr. Uddin but the police are still pursuing separate charges. Meanwhile, officials at the export zone authority have blacklisted him from being hired at factories inside the zones. "We spoke up," he said. "And we became criminals in the eyes of all authorities."

Abstract: In early 2011, Mr. Ryan, newly installed as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, gave Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, a hard time over his expansionary policies. Not only does the character in question, a Galt sidekick, call for a return to the gold standard, he denounces the notion of paper money and demands a return to gold coins.

Full text:   So far, most of the discussion of Paul Ryan, the presumptive Republican nominee for vice president, has focused on his budget proposals. But Mr. Ryan is a man of many ideas, which would ordinarily be a good thing.
In his case, however, most of those ideas appear to come from works of fiction, specifically Ayn Rand's novel "Atlas Shrugged."
For those who somehow missed it when growing up, "Atlas Shrugged" is a fantasy in which the world's productive people -- the "job creators," if you like -- withdraw their services from an ungrateful society. The novel's centerpiece is a 64-page speech by John Galt, the angry elite's ringleader; even Friedrich Hayek admitted that he never made it through that part. Yet the book is a perennial favorite among adolescent boys. Most boys eventually outgrow it. Some, however, remain devotees for life.
And Mr. Ryan is one of those devotees. True, in recent years, he has tried to downplay his Randism, calling it an "urban legend." It's not hard to see why: Rand's fervent atheism -- not to mention her declaration that "abortion is a moral right" -- isn't what the G.O.P. base wants to hear.
But Mr. Ryan is being disingenuous. In 2005, he told the Atlas Society, which is devoted to promoting Rand's ideas, that she inspired his political career: "If I had to credit one thinker, one person, it would be Ayn Rand." He also declared that Rand's work was required reading for his staff and interns.
And the Ryan fiscal program clearly reflects Randian notions. As I documented in my last column, Mr. Ryan's reputation for being serious about the budget deficit is completely undeserved; his policies would actually increase the deficit. But he is deadly serious about cutting taxes on the rich and slashing aid to the poor, very much in line with Rand's worship of the successful and contempt for "moochers."
This last point is important. In pushing for draconian cuts in Medicaid, food stamps and other programs that aid the needy, Mr. Ryan isn't just looking for ways to save money. He's also, quite explicitly, trying to make life harder for the poor -- for their own good. In March, explaining his cuts in aid for the unfortunate, he declared, "We don't want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency, that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives."
Somehow, I doubt that Americans forced to rely on unemployment benefits and food stamps in a depressed economy feel that they're living in a comfortable hammock.
But wait, there's more: "Atlas Shrugged" apparently shaped Mr. Ryan's views on monetary policy, views that he clings to despite having been repeatedly, completely wrong in his predictions.
In early 2011, Mr. Ryan, newly installed as the chairman of the House Budget Committee, gave Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, a hard time over his expansionary policies. Rising commodity prices and long-term interest rates, he asserted, were harbingers of high inflation to come; "There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens," he intoned, "than debase its currency."
Since then, inflation has remained quiescent while long-term rates have plunged -- and the U.S. economy would surely be in much worse shape than it is if Mr. Bernanke had allowed himself to be bullied into monetary tightening. But Mr. Ryan seems undaunted in his monetary views. Why?
Well, it's right there in that 2005 speech to the Atlas Society, in which he declared that he always goes back to "Francisco d'Anconia's speech on money" when thinking about monetary policy. Who? Never mind. That speech (which clocks in at a mere 23 paragraphs) is a case of hard-money obsession gone ballistic. Not only does the character in question, a Galt sidekick, call for a return to the gold standard, he denounces the notion of paper money and demands a return to gold coins.
For the record, the U.S. currency supply has consisted overwhelmingly of paper money, not gold and silver coins, since the early 1800s. So if Mr. Ryan really thinks that Francisco d'Anconia had it right, he wants to turn the clock back not one but two centuries.
Does any of this matter? Well, if the Republican ticket wins, Mr. Ryan will surely be an influential force in the next administration -- and bear in mind, too, that he would, as the cliché goes, be a heartbeat away from the presidency. So it should worry us that Mr. Ryan holds monetary views that would, if put into practice, go a long way toward recreating the Great Depression.
And, beyond that, consider the fact that Mr. Ryan is considered the modern G.O.P.'s big thinker. What does it say about the party when its intellectual leader evidently gets his ideas largely from deeply unrealistic fantasy novels?

Full text:   HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- Construction crews got as far as the first floor of what was to be Saigon Residence, a high-end apartment building in the center of Ho Chi Minh City. All that remains today of the abandoned project are piles of moldy bricks, rusting steel rods and a small team of security guards who have transformed the cement foundation into a parking lot for motorcycles.
In Vietnam's major cities, a once-booming property market has come crashing down. Hundreds of abandoned construction sites are the most obvious signs of a sickly economy.
A senior Vietnamese Communist Party official, speaking in the ornate drawing room of a French colonial building, compared the country's economic problems to the market crash 15 years ago that flattened many economies in Asia.
"I can say this is the same as the crisis in Thailand in 1997," said Hua Ngoc Thuan, the vice chairman of the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, the city's top executive body. "Property investors pushed the prices so high. They bought for speculation -- not for use."
Vietnam's economic problems appear less severe than those of the 1997 financial crisis -- the economy is still growing, albeit relatively anemically, at a rate of about 4 percent -- but the country's list of problems continues to grow.
The arrest this week of Nguyen Duc Kien, one of Vietnam's wealthiest businessmen, set off a 4.8 percent plunge in the country's stock market index Tuesday, the biggest drop in four years. The charges against Mr. Kien are vague. The state news media said he was accused of illegal business activity.
The opaque way that his case is being handled underlines a key aggravating factor for the country's woes: The awkward marriage between a secretive Communist Party leadership and a capitalist economy is clouding recovery prospects for the country of 91 million people.
Investors are skeptical of the government's economic management and question the reliability of statistics. The country's central bank says borrowers have stopped paying back 1 out of every 10 loans in the banking system, but Fitch Ratings said the percentage of bad loans might be much higher.
If the 1997 crisis was often blamed on "crony capitalism," Vietnam's problems could be described as crony capitalism with a communist twist. State-owned companies are stacked with friends and allies of the Communist Party hierarchy.
"The state is being manipulated by people within the state to make money," said Jonathan Pincus, the dean of the Fulbright Economics Teaching Program in Vietnam.
"Getting the Communist Party out of the management of these companies, that's what is required," he said. "I don't see that on the table."
Like property bubbles in other parts of the world, investors in Vietnam took advantage of free-flowing credit to construct buildings with the hopes of flipping them for a profit. One key difference is that some of the largest property speculators in Vietnam are state-owned corporations with top connections in the Communist Party and access to cheap money. Those companies are now grappling with unsustainable debt levels, or in the case of Vinashin and Vinalines, two large government conglomerates, flirting with insolvency.
Ho Chi Minh City is still buzzing with energy, swarmed by tourists and plagued by traffic jams -- all signs of the city's economic vitality. But that masks the symptoms of the nationwide economic woes: Young people are finding it harder to find jobs; nearly 20 percent of small and medium-size companies have gone out of business during the past year; and municipal infrastructure projects are being delayed or canceled.
Le Dang Doanh, a prominent economist and a former top official at a government research organization, said he was worried about the timing of the country's problems, coming just as the global economy is bogged down by debt and Europe grapples with the existential dilemma of the euro.
"The problem in Vietnam is a very, very toxic cocktail from the European debt crisis, the stagnation in the U.S. economy plus a very critical situation in the domestic economy," Mr. Doanh said. "It's a very dangerous mixture."
The private sector is helping keep the economy moving -- Vietnam is a major exporter of clothing and footwear to the United States -- but foreign money flows have slowed. Commitments by foreign investors were $8 billion for the first half of this year, one-quarter the level during the same period three years ago.
The consequences of Vietnam's economic problems are far-reaching. The revenues of municipal governments are shrinking across the country because property-transfer fees made up a large chunk of their income. Ho Chi Minh City's first subway line is now scheduled for completion in 2016, a year later than planned, according to Mr. Thuan, the Ho Chi Minh City senior official.
In the central city of Da Nang, which has thrived during the past decade, officials have been forced to cancel development projects on the outskirts of the city. Tran Van Son, the vice director of the Da Nang Department of Planning and Investment, said he was "very worried" that the city would have to scale back further because tax revenue was lagging even more than projected.
Young people are finding good jobs more elusive. On the outskirts of Hanoi, the capital, Nguyen Duy Huong, the 21-year-old son of rice farmers, spent the early part of the year searching in vain for work in computer repair shops.
"Every place I went to said they were looking for really strong technicians," Mr. Huong said. "They weren't taking interns."
Like many other young people in Vietnam, Mr. Huong lives on the frontier between information technology and the peasant economy. He has worked part-time at a photo-printing shop, using software to whiten faces and remove blemishes, but his family's main income comes from planting and harvesting rice by hand. In the quest for full-time work, he recently began taking software programming courses run by Reach, a nonprofit organization created by Plan International, a British charity.
The problems facing young people are nothing near the scale of the Spanish and Greek unemployment crises, but finding a job is no longer as automatic as a few years ago.
"Companies have more choices now," said Nguyen Thi Van Trang, who helps run the training program. "They don't have to take kids off the street anymore."
The government has battled the country's problems with classic macroeconomic tools: tightening the supply of money to choke off double-digit inflation and then slashing interest rates this year to energize the economy.
Yet banks remain very cautious, partly because of the growing number of customers unable to pay back their loans. The supply of credit in the economy is shrinking and consumption is flat; supermarkets, for example, have reported reductions in sales of 20 to 30 percent.
Mr. Doanh, the economist, said Vietnam needed much more than just an injection of money at lower interest rates.
The inefficient state-owned monoliths like Vinashin, which expanded wildly into businesses they were ill-qualified to operate, need to be dismantled, privatized or scaled down, Mr. Doanh said.
"Now is a good time for creative destruction," he said, referring to the concept of established companies' being replaced by more innovative competitors.
As in the United States, Vietnam's return to economic health rides in part on the revival of the real estate market.
There is so much excess supply of office space in Ho Chi Minh City that rents in the most desirable neighborhoods are half the level of three years ago, said Nguyen Duy Lam, the director of Pacific Real, a construction and real estate company.
In the hopes of drawing more foreign buyers, officials in Ho Chi Minh City have submitted a formal proposal to the central government to open up the property market to overseas Vietnamese, according to Mr. Thuan, the Communist Party official.
For now, though, real estate agents like Mr. Lam report that activity is freezing up.
"Everyone wants to sell, but they can't, even if they lower the price," Mr. Lam said in an interview on the roof of a hotel in Ho Chi Minh City. "There are no customers."
Mr. Lam is counting on the long-term prospects of the city. As he spoke, a contrasting picture of Vietnam emerged. The dark outlines of an unfinished skyscraper loomed overhead, but another construction site nearby was bucking the trend: On a Sunday evening, lit by floodlights, a crane swung back and forth as workers put up another building destined to fill out the skyline of Ho Chi Minh City.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: "The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability," it said.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Many Federal Reserve officials at their most recent policy meeting pushed for further actions to support the economy if the recovery failed to strengthen over the summer, an official account released on Wednesday showed.
"Many members judged that additional monetary accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery," according to the minutes of the meeting, which ended Aug. 1.
After that meeting, the Fed issued a statement that included stronger language to signal its commitment to helping the recovery. The minutes revealed that the committee had carefully chosen to say it "will provide additional accommodation as needed." In June, it used softer phrasing, saying that the committee "is prepared to take further action as appropriate." At the time, economists and analysts noted the change as a sign that the bank was more likely to act.
The next chance for the Fed's policy-making committee to introduce measures is in September. The committee is to meet Sept. 12-13, and Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman, is also scheduled to hold a news conference.
With few signs of a substantial and sustainable strengthening evident this summer, the minutes solidified the expectations of investors that the central bank would undertake additional measures to support the recovery sometime in the coming months -- even if the unemployment rate dropped and growth picked up modestly.
For instance, Capital Economics, a consultancy, described another significant round of asset buying as a "done deal" in a note to clients Wednesday afternoon. It "doesn't look like the Fed will be persuaded to hold fire in mid-September unless we see a dramatic improvement over the next couple of weeks," the consultancy said.
In response to the release of the Fed minutes, which usually come three weeks after the meeting, the dollar dropped relative to the Japanese yen and the euro. Stocks, which are near their highest prices in four years, rallied on the news after drifting lower in morning trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad index of the stocks of large publicly traded companies, rose 0.32 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,413.49.
After great anticipation ahead of its last meeting, the Fed's policy-making committee decided against taking action to bolster the economy, even as it said that the pace of the recovery had weakened through the first half of 2012. It repeated its pledge to support the economy if necessary.
"The committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability," it said.
In the meeting, Fed officials discussed a "number of policy tools" that the central bank might use to stimulate the economy.
Keeping the federal funds rate near zero for a longer period than currently indicated is one option, the minutes showed. The Fed has said it will keep that rate low through 2014.
"It was noted that such an extension might be particularly effective if done in conjunction with a statement indicating that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy was likely to be maintained even as the recovery progressed," the meeting notes said.
"A few" members suggested "replacing the calendar date with guidance that was linked more directly" to the economy, or removing any guidance as to when the rate would be increased.
The committee also discussed undertaking a new round of aggressive asset purchases to push down interest rates and spur investors to spend.
"A few participants" expressed concern that new measures might "increase the risks to financial stability or lead to a rise in longer-term inflation expectations."
But "many participants" said that such a program would help the recovery by pushing down long-term interest rates and easing financial strains. "Some" participants also argued that new measures would bolster confidence.
The unemployment rate remains above 8 percent amid weak economic data in the spring and summer on manufacturing, consumer sentiment and industrial production. Persistent headwinds identified by the Fed and other economic analysts include high unemployment, a still-depressed housing sector and financial market strain emanating from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.
In June, the Fed cut its official forecasts for growth both this year and next. It said it expected the economy to expand 1.9 to 2.4 percent in 2012, down from the forecast of 2.4 to 2.9 percent growth it made in April. In 2013, it expects growth of 2.2 to 2.8 percent, down from the 2.7 to 3.1 percent it forecast in April.
The Fed is already engaged in ambitious programs to support demand, bolster employment and support the wan recovery. It has cut its short-term interest rates to close to zero and held them there to encourage investment, and has said it will keep interest rates low at least through 2014. It is also engaged in a bond-buying program through the end of this year to bring down long-term interest rates.
Many market participants are betting on a big new round of bond buying -- called "quantitative easing" by central bankers and known as QE3, since the Fed has taken that action twice before.
But some Fed officials have expressed doubt about whether another such measure will work. The so-called hawks -- those more concerned with the specter of rising inflation -- have also argued that the Fed should abstain.

Abstract: The president's savings will come mostly from smaller payments to managed care companies, which provide the same services as Medicare at a higher cost, and from slower growth in reimbursement rates to health care providers. Protecting federal health programs over the long term, as the population ages and medical costs keep rising faster than economic growth, will require curbing the programs' spending.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDED
Older adults are understandably anxious about the political sniping over the future financing of Medicare. That is precisely the intention of the presidential campaigns.
Yet the cross-fire over who will cut Medicare by how much sidesteps a critical issue about the future of our medical care: If we must ration our care to hold down costs in the future, how can we do it in a fair, efficient and transparent way?
Mitt Romney's campaign was brazenly misleading in its charge that the president's health plan would cut medical services to older adults by reducing Medicare spending by $716 billion. The president's savings will come mostly from smaller payments to managed care companies, which provide the same services as Medicare at a higher cost, and from slower growth in reimbursement rates to health care providers.
But the response of President Obama's campaign also aimed to stoke voters' fears. It stressed -- rightly -- that the plan to curb Medicare costs proposed last year by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate, would add thousands of dollars to older Americans' out-of-pocket expenditures. Yet it ignored Mr. Ryan's recent efforts to soften the plan.
Both campaigns claim they are out to protect future health care. Yet the sniping hides the real issue. Protecting federal health programs over the long term, as the population ages and medical costs keep rising faster than economic growth, will require curbing the programs' spending. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that.
The federal government's spending on health care consumes 4.8 percent of the nation's economic production and is expected to eat up 9.2 percent in 25 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. A vast majority of economists agree that restoring a sustainable budget will mean either cuts in Medicare and Medicaid or a tax increase on the middle class.
Decisions will have to be made about what services are not worth the cost. Yet so far, our political leaders have failed to acknowledge this to voters, offering instead an illusion that we can resolve the matter without any pain.
Recall the political firestorm in 2009 when the Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women start regular screening for breast cancer at age 50 rather than 40. "This is how rationing begins," said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. "This is when you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician."
The task force is an independent panel of experts financed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Doctors and private insurers usually follow its recommendations. Still, in 2010 -- after Mr. Obama's health reform legislation passed Congress -- the department said that insurers should ignore its latest findings and instead go back to its recommendation from 2002: that women start screening at 40.
Does it make sense that older adults in their last year of life consume more than a quarter of Medicare's expenditures, costing more than six times as much as other beneficiaries? Are there limits to what Medicare should spend on a therapy prolonging someone's life by a month or two?
It's a tough political call. In light of the difficulties, our political leaders have preferred to punt on the issue, hoping it doesn't have to be decided on their watch. Instead, when they talk about health care, they call rationing by some other name.
Rationing is inevitable in a world with finite resources. We do it in this country, too, and it is still one of the least fair and most inefficient rationing systems in the world. You get care if you have the money to pay for it; if not, you probably won't.
The 30 percent of the population who are the heaviest users of health care account for nearly 89 percent of health care expenditures, according to a government study. But high-income Americans are more likely to see a doctor when they are sick, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the disparity between rich and poor is much higher than in other developed countries.
Meanwhile, tens of millions of Americans -- those whose employers don't provide health insurance, who are too poor to pay for it themselves and yet are too rich to use Medicaid -- get the least health care of all.
A study of hospital emergency rooms in Wisconsin found that victims of severe traffic accidents without health insurance got 20 percent less care. Hospitals spent $3,300 more on average for each victim who was insured. They kept the insured 9.2 days, on average, and the uninsured just 6.4 days. Unsurprisingly, the uninsured were 40 percent more likely to die from their injuries.
Every health care proposal from the right and the left includes some form of implicit rationing device. Mr. Ryan's plan, on the Republican side, would keep spending on Medicare under 4.75 percent of the nation's output until 2050 by giving older adults born after 1958 a dollop of money to buy their own insurance, forcing many to choose cheaper plans or fewer procedures.
The president's health care reform encourages rationing, too, by levying a tax on "Cadillac" insurance plans, and in turn pushing employers to seek cheaper options and lower costs. It creates an advisory board to cut costs from Medicare if spending rises above a set rate. And it finances an institute to evaluate which therapies are most clinically effective. Careful to avoid political blowback, the president's plan forbids Medicare to base its reimbursement decisions on the institute's findings.
But neither initiative seems likely to solve our health care financing squeeze over the long term. The cuts proposed by Mr. Ryan -- shifting the risk of health care inflation onto the shoulders of older adults -- are certainly drastic. They also seem politically unfeasible. Under Mr. Ryan's most recent proposals, in 2030 Medicare would spend $2,200 less in today's money on each new enrollee than under the most likely outcome envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office based on current policies. By 2050, it would pay $8,000 less. Voters seem to think that might be too drastic a cut.
The president's plan was more about offering health insurance to all, to end our Dickensian system of rationing by income, than long-term cost control. Savings mandated by the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years will be difficult to maintain beyond that.
It puts a lot of faith on eliminating waste, with potentially large savings. David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard, argues that a third of our health care dollars go to therapies that do not improve our health. A lot of that waste could be slashed simply by no longer paying providers a fee for each service, whether we need it or not, and paying them instead to keep us healthy.
Going after waste seems sensible in a health care system that costs more than almost any other in the developed world, yet delivers lower-quality care. But savings from waste tend to be hard to achieve. Even with the Affordable Care Act in place, federal health spending will eat up almost twice as much of this nation's economic product in 2037 as it does today, according to the budget office.
While it is reasonable for politicians to shy away from rationing -- especially when voters believe no expense should be spared to save a human life -- if the experience of other countries serves as precedent, they will probably get there sooner or later. In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence determines what therapies will be covered by the National Health Service. It generally recommends against paying for a therapy that costs more than $31,000 to $47,000 for each year of life gained, adjusted for quality.
Putting a value on life, as it were, is controversial. The National Institute in Britain has denied or limited coverage of expensive drugs for ailments like pancreatic cancer, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's. But in a world of limited budgets, such decisions must be made.
Similar systems exist in many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, where the government decided not to pay for a universal vaccine against pneumococcal disease until its price fell to 25,000 New Zealand dollars (about $20,000) per quality-adjusted life year.
Though this concept may sound foreign, Washington has been putting a price on life since the administration of Ronald Reagan -- who determined that regulations should pass through a strict cost-benefit analysis, with values placed on factors like life and health. The Environmental Protection Agency values a life at about $9 million today. In 2009, the Transportation Department used a price tag of about $6 million. If safety improvements on a road were projected to cost more than the value of the lives expected to be saved by the improvement, the project would be deemed too expensive.
This approach has been contentious. And it has had an impact on Americans' health. In 1991 an appeals court reversed the E.P.A.'s decision to ban asbestos on the ground that it was too costly. The E.P.A., it argued, "would have this court believe that Congress, when it enacted its requirement that the E.P.A. consider the economic impacts of its regulations, thought that spending $200 million to $300 million to save approximately seven lives (approximately $30 million to $40 million per life) over 13 years is reasonable." The court disagreed.
Medicare could well be forced, one day, to make similar evaluations.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Economic Scene column on Wednesday, about finding a fairer way to ration health care in the United States, misstated the results of a government study on health care expenditures. The study, by the Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, found that 89 percent of health care expenditures were accounted for by the 30 percent of Americans who use health care most heavily, not by the wealthiest 30 percent.

Full text:   BUENOS AIRES -- The cafe, just north of a leafy district affectionately nicknamed Villa Freud, was almost empty. Roberto Álvarez sipped his espresso, furrowed his brow and began ticking off the names of psychologists he had seen over the past decade. He stopped counting only when he noticed that he was running short of fingers.
"Let me tell you something about us Argentines," said Mr. Álvarez, a 51-year-old construction worker, after a tangent on Jacques Lacan, the famous French psychoanalyst who sometimes conducted sessions with patients in taxicabs. "When it comes to choosing a psychologist, we are like women searching for the perfect perfume. We try a bit of this and a bit of that before eventually arriving at the right fit."
Indeed, Argentines often manage a smile upon hearing that psychoanalysis has been on the wane in the United States and other countries, rivaled by treatments that offer shorter-term and often cheaper results than years invested in sessions of soul-searching. Even as Argentines grapple with high inflation and an economic slowdown, many seem to know precisely what they want (at least in one area of their lives): psychoanalysis, and plenty of it.
The number of practicing psychologists in Argentina has been surging, to 196 per 100,000 people last year, according to a study by Modesto Alonso, a psychologist and researcher, from 145 per 100,000 people in 2008. That compares with about 27 psychologists per 100,000 people in the United States, according to the American Psychological Association.
Those numbers make Argentina -- a country still brooding over its economic decline from a century ago -- a world leader, at least when it comes to people's broad willingness to bare their souls.
"There is no taboo here about saying that you see a professional two or three times a week," said Tiziana Fenochietto, 29, a psychiatrist doing her residency at the Torcuato de Alvear Hospital for Psychiatric Emergencies, a public institution. "On the contrary," said Ms. Fenochietto, who has been in therapy herself for the past eight years, "it is chic."
One need not wander far in this city to get a grip on the resilient obsession with neuroses of various stripes. The name Villa Freud is a nod not only to the Austrian founding father of psychoanalysis, but also to the number of psychologists who ply their trade in the buildings along the elegant streets around Plaza Güemes, in northern Buenos Aires.
A short cab ride away, in the theater district along Avenida Corrientes, lines form each night where the local adaptations of two hit plays have opened side by side: "Freud's Last Session," currently an imagined debate between Sigmund Freud and C. S. Lewis, and "Toc Toc," about obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Slip into many bookstores here, and tomes abound written by Argentines about the psychological ills that plague people, and their cures. Malele Penchansky's "Universal History of Hysteria" and Alejandro Dagfal's "Between Paris and Buenos Aires: The Invention of the Psychologist" are among the offerings. A new prizewinning Argentine comic book, "Repairer of Dreams," even blends psychoanalysis into the tale of a dystopian city called Polenia.
Psychoanalysis is not just for Argentina's moneyed classes, with some psychoanalysts in the state medical system offering patients free sessions. And while some private health plans do not pay for psychoanalysis, insurance programs for some unionized workers cover dozens of therapy sessions a year.
"We say no to charity and yes to equal opportunity," said Adriana Abeles, president and founder of the Fields of Psychoanalysis Foundation, which carries out research, trains students of psychoanalysis and provides therapy. When patients cannot afford to pay, they can volunteer in exchange for their sessions, doing jobs like repairing furniture, cooking or painting walls.
The country's growing supply of psychologists also means that consumers have considerable bargaining power. While some of the top analysts here charge the equivalent of hundreds of dollars per session, many work on a sliding scale in accordance with their patients' incomes, offering sessions for as little as $15 an hour.
Despite the continued boom in psychoanalysis, Argentina is not impervious to global treatment trends. Techniques like cognitive behavior therapy, which claim to offer shorter-term results, have gained ground here, and some health insurance plans frown upon the costs involved in drawn-out psychoanalytic counseling. Drug treatments have also made inroads, and some therapists in Argentina have expanded online offerings, turning to technologies like Skype.
But Andrés Raskovsky, president of the Argentine Psychoanalytic Association, recently asserted that psychoanalysis had little risk of extinction in Argentina since seeing a psychologist twice a week is still viewed as being affordable for much of the population.
Theories abound as to why hang-ups, and the professional class that treats them, seem to flourish here.
Martín, the main character in "Sidewalls," a critically acclaimed 2011 romantic comedy about life in the shoe box apartments of Buenos Aires, offers this theory: "Apathy, depression, suicide, neuroses, panic attacks, obesity, fear of heights, muscular tension, insecurity, hypochondria, sedentary behavior -- all are the fault of architects and construction entrepreneurs." (Martín, of course, in a scene worthy of a Woody Allen film, professes to suffer from all of them "except for suicide," and rarely leaves his high-rise building except to attend therapy.)
Others look to Argentina's past for explanations, and not just the sadness bred by the faded glory of a nation that was once wealthier than many European ones.
The country, some say, was long vulnerable to melancholia, or at least an acceptance of sharing those troubles with a patient listener. With its history of immigration, largely from Europe, Argentina has a tradition of drawing inspiration from European intellectual trends, including the rise of Freudian psychology a century ago. Spanish immigrants who sought opportunities away from the fascist rule of Francisco Franco were pivotal in establishing psychoanalysis in the 1940s as a respected profession in Argentina. Nowadays, some of the top psychoanalysts here are Jewish, most of them descendants of European Jews.
Others have sought to tie the appeal of psychoanalysis to the nation's music, like the tango, which can plumb decidedly dark themes. (There is even something here called "psychotango," which explores the use of psychoanalytic thinking and dance as a tool for "self-transformation.")
But Mariano Ben Plotkin, author of "Freud in the Pampas," a book about the emergence of psychoanalysis in Argentina, said the reasons were much more complex. "Sure, we have the tango, but the Portuguese have the fado," said Mr. Plotkin, referring to the mournful music of Portugal, a country with fewer psychologists per capita.
Instead, Mr. Plotkin, whose own parents sent him to a psychoanalyst several times a week when he was a child, attributes the rise of psychoanalysis in Argentina partly to its reception by a large, relatively well-educated middle class in the 1960s.
Despite the rise of rival treatments, Mr. Plotkin said he remained sanguine about what he called the "hegemonic" position of psychoanalysis in Argentina's psychological community. After all, ordinary Argentines readily employ psychological terms that in other countries would be the preserve of psychology majors, and can hold forth on the difference of Freudian and Jungian methods.
Respect for psychoanalysis extends to other realms as well. It is embedded in various state institutions; parents of children at public schools, upon being asked to attend meetings regarding their child's behavior, for instance, are sometimes surprised to learn that one of first discussions is with a psychoanalyst employed by the school system.
And in a sign of its wide acceptance, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her cabinet chief took time out in April to meet with leaders of the World Psychoanalysis Association, which was convening then in Buenos Aires.
Opening a newspaper or cultural supplement here often feels like leafing through decades-old editions of The New Yorker, when cartoons were drenched in psychoanalytic jargon.
Diego Sehinkman, a psychologist who writes a weekly column for the newspaper La Nación in which he describes imaginary therapy sessions with politicians across the spectrum, said: "We are fascinated in Argentina with peering into the suffering of people in power. Especially those who have made us suffer a bit."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDFRANKFURT -- The euro zone is hurtling back into recession, economists declared after official figures this week portrayed a shrinking economy. But by some measures the downturn has been under way for years.
With the exception of Germany, none of Europe's biggest economies have returned to the level of economic output they had at the beginning of 2008, before the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States spread across the Atlantic, according to calculations by two U.S. economists, Peter Rupert and Thomas F. Cooley.
The figures suggest that Europe is already well into what could become a lost decade -- a period of pernicious stagnation and wasted potential that could have lasting effects on ordinary citizens.
Economic growth not realized represents investments in education that were never made, research that was never financed, businesses that failed and careers that ended too early or never got off the ground.
"There are larger implications that people don't think about," said Mr. Rupert, a professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "There is a huge decline in human capital."
Just what marks the beginning and end of a recession is not always easy to define. One common definition is two consecutive quarters of falling output. By that standard, the euro zone is technically not yet in a recession.
Most economists agree, though, that a recession is also defined by other indicators like unemployment, industrial production and investment. The closest thing Europe has to an arbiter on the question is a committee of prominent economists convened by the Center for Economic Policy Research, a research organization in London.
By the committee's reckoning, the euro zone's last recession ended after the second quarter of 2009, the point at which the region hit bottom and began to grow again. The economists' panel, known as the Euro Area Business Cycle Dating Committee, has not yet begun to consider whether the euro zone is in recession again. But few people would argue that Europe, stricken by a self-inflicted debt crisis that began in 2010, has basked in prosperity recently.
"This is more than just a regular business cycle," said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. "I can't think of a time in the postwar period in any major industrial countries where we have had a downturn resume before the previous cycle was over."
Only Germany is wealthier than it was in the first quarter of 2008, when economic activity peaked. France is close, according to Mr. Rupert and Mr. Cooley, a professor at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. (The two publish a blog that tracks the business cycle, at european snapshot.com.)
Spain and Italy are both effectively back where they were in the darkest days of 2009, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a financial crisis that undermined the world economy.
Both countries resumed growing in 2009, but stalled in the middle of last year. Since then Spain has had three quarters in a row of declining gross domestic product, while the Italian economy has been shrinking for a year. There is little doubt they are deep in recession. Some economists predict that France and even Germany could follow.
In contrast, the United States regained all the ground lost since 2008 at the end of 2011. But it took twice as long to do so than had been the case for any other recession since World War II, according to Mr. Cooley and Mr. Rupert. They estimate that, had the United States continued growing at the same average pace as it has since 1950, the country would be more than $1.5 trillion wealthier today.
While economists already knew that euro zone G.D.P. was still catching up with 2008, experts like Mr. Cooley and Mr. Rupert have been parsing the sometimes inconsistent statistics issued by European countries to show how broadly the downturn has affected Europe's largest economies in the form of rising unemployment, declining consumer spending and falling investment.
Mr. Weinberg and others warn that the euro zone is on the same path as Japan was in the 1990s, when failure to deal with weak banks led to a decade of stagnation.
"There are some really good analogies," Mr. Weinberg said. "The Japanese never fixed their banks. There is a lesson to Europe in this."
When banks do not have adequate capital reserves, as is now the case with many, they hoard cash and are unwilling or unable to lend. The European Central Bank has gone to extraordinary lengths to supply banks with cash, offering three-year loans on easy terms. But the E.C.B. cannot compel those banks to issue loans to businesses, which would fuel expansion. Nor can it make them give credit to consumers to buy homes and cars.
In fact, E.C.B. surveys as well as money supply data show that banks remain reluctant to lend.
Attempts to fix this dysfunctional system have so far fallen short. The European Union has allocated EUR100 billion, or nearly $124 billion, to recapitalize ailing Spanish banks, but the money has not yet been spent, because the mechanisms to do so are not yet in place. The European Banking Authority has pressed weaker banks to rebuild their reserves, but many analysts say the agency's requirements are not strict enough to restore confidence in banks' health.
The social effects of so many years of poor economic performance are "very worrisome," said Lucrezia Reichlin, a professor of economics at London Business School. "We know that societies lose their cohesion when growth is very subdued."
Comparisons to Japan's lost decade may not go far enough, she said, noting that young Europeans have been particularly hard hit by poor growth. In Spain, more than half of people aged 16 to 24 are jobless.
"That would be a lost generation more than a lost decade," said Ms. Reichlin, who is also a member of the committee at the Center for European Policy Research that attempts to determine when recessions begin and end.
Under the best of circumstances, it would be a year or two before the euro zone economy could be expected to recover. And that will happen only if European leaders make the right decisions -- a questionable assumption -- and demand from Asia and the United States strengthens.
Leaders in Brussels and European capitals have pledged to improve budgetary discipline, remove government obstacles to growth and strengthen the banking system by establishing a common regulator at the E.C.B.
But progress toward these goals has been slow, held up by reluctance by countries like Italy to make changes and by countries like Germany to provide financing. Implementation of the European rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, has been held up by a lawsuit brought by a German citizens' group that will not be resolved until the country's Constitutional Court rules on Sept. 12.
And German voters remain opposed to measures economists say are needed to hold down borrowing costs for weaker countries like Spain, including some form of common debt.
Forecasts of euro zone growth are even trickier than usual because the economic pattern is unlike anything Europe has experienced in the past.
For example, Europe typically tracks the U.S. economy with a slight time delay, but now seems to have decoupled. In addition, the wealthier member states of the European Union used to move more or less in unison. But now Italy is doing much worse than France, not to mention Germany.
Under more pessimistic forecasts, the decline could last for years.
Mr. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics warns that even depression cannot be ruled out, if poor policy leads to a string of bank failures.
A breakup of the euro currency bloc, which many economists consider a serious risk, would have incalculable consequences.
"In the euro area, the main uncertainty is over if and how the current debt crisis can be resolved and whether a breakup of the euro can be avoided," Joachim Fels and Manoj Pradhan, economists at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients.
Some of the decline in euro zone economic output reflects lower government spending, as political leaders struggle to cut national deficits. In countries like Italy and Greece, where governments have a reputation for being wasteful, spending cuts could theoretically benefit the economy in a few years by eliminating bureaucracy that gets in the way of entrepreneurs.
Recessions can even be beneficial, in a way. They punish inefficient business practices and imprudent lending. But that is true only up to a point.
"When people talk about the cleansing effect of recessions," Mr. Rupert of the University of California said, "those aren't five-year recessions."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Sales at Wal-Mart, Though Still Rising, Suggest Wary Shoppers

Abstract: At Home Depot, which reported a 2.6 percent rise in same-store sales in the United States, consumers were pursuing small projects around the house, and executives said the housing market appeared to be stabilizing. In a reminder of just how giant Wal-Mart is, William S. Simon, chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in prepared remarks that the United States division's 0.4 percent increase in comparable-store traffic from a year ago represented 80,000 additional customers each day of the 13-week quarter.

Full text:   Consumers in the United States still seem to be holding their breath.
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer by far, reported quarterly results on Thursday that its executives said reflected a strained consumer, adding a sober note to more upbeat earnings reports from other retailers this week.
"Consumers aren't panicked about the economy, but they are worried," Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, wrote in a research note. Sales growth for top retailers slowed to 3.4 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared with a year ago, according to Mr. Johnson's analysis. In the first quarter, sales rose 6.2 percent compared with a year earlier. (Thirty of the 40 major retailers he tracks have reported quarterly results so far.) Consumers "are still buying, but they're buying less and they're buying closer to need," he wrote.
Wal-Mart's results suggested that shoppers in the United States -- particularly low- and middle-income shoppers -- remained stretched thin and wary about splurging. Sales at the company's stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent in the United States, which was its fourth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth domestically. However, executives said that did not mean the American shopper was feeling especially cheery.
"I don't think the economy's helping us," Charles M. Holley Jr., Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters. Customers are still very concerned about employment, gas prices and food inflation, he said. "If anything, our consumer's probably being a little more stretched because of gas prices."
The company's overall revenue increased 4.5 percent, to $114.3 billion, for Wal-Mart's second quarter, which ended July 27. Analysts had expected higher sales, of $115.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data, and Wal-Mart said currency fluctuations were largely to blame for the difference. Profit increased to $4.02 billion, or $1.18 a share, from the second quarter of 2011, a penny above what analysts were expecting. The company increased its earnings-per-share guidance for the full year to $4.83 to $4.93, up from the $4.72 to $4.92 it had issued earlier.
Wal-Mart said that currency fluctuations lowered net sales by $2.2 billion. Without currency fluctuations, net sales, excluding membership and other revenue, would have been $115.7 billion, about in line with analysts' estimates. Shares in the company fell about 3 percent on Thursday.
Sears Holdings, which also reported quarterly earnings on Thursday, cited several reasons for its big drop in same-store sales, which declined 2.9 percent at Sears stores and 4.7 percent at Kmart stores. The company said that was because of lower volume in its clearance sales and less demand for electronics and lawn and garden items.
Revenue at Sears Holdings declined 6.6 percent to $9.5 billion for the quarter. The company's loss of $132 million, or $1.25 a share, was improved from its loss of $146 million a year ago, thanks to cost-cutting.
Not all of the signs are dour. Quarterly reports from Target, Macy's, Home Depot and other large retailers this week, and a government report showing strength in consumer spending in July, painted a more optimistic picture.
Target posted a same-store sales increase of 3.1 percent and said that shoppers were starting to buy discretionary items again, though it said staples were still very popular. "We believe our guests will continue to be both cautious and resilient, shopping and spending at Target in disciplined ways," the company's chief executive, Gregg Steinhafel, told analysts.
At Home Depot, which reported a 2.6 percent rise in same-store sales in the United States, consumers were pursuing small projects around the house, and executives said the housing market appeared to be stabilizing. Macy's reported a 3 percent increase in revenue.
Strong results from both Nordstrom and Saks this week suggested that well-heeled shoppers were feeling confident. And Commerce Department data for July, released this week, showed an increase of 0.8 percent in retail sales, which exceeded analyst expectations and followed three months of negative figures.
In a reminder of just how giant Wal-Mart is, William S. Simon, chief executive of Walmart U.S., said in prepared remarks that the United States division's 0.4 percent increase in comparable-store traffic from a year ago represented 80,000 additional customers each day of the 13-week quarter.
Still, Wal-Mart's results suggested that midrange and low-end American consumers were still hesitant about spending money. Customers are responding to marketing that emphasizes cheap prices, Mr. Simon said, and executives said customers here were still living paycheck to paycheck.
Internationally, Wal-Mart's sales continued to grow at a quick clip, increasing 6.4 percent to $32 billion. That was a slower increase than usual -- in the first quarter, for instance, international sales rose 15 percent. And for the first time internationally, Wal-Mart executives pointed to a "paycheck cycle" -- when customers spend little as their paychecks run out and restock on basics once a new check arrives.
The company is in the midst of an investigation involving its Mexican subsidiary and, possibly, other foreign units. In April, The New York Times reported that executives at the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., had received credible evidence about bribery allegations in 2005 and 2006 in Mexico, but shut down an internal investigation into the issue. Bribery of foreign officials is illegal under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have opened investigations into the matter. Wal-Mart is conducting its own internal investigation into the Mexico allegations, and the company suggested in May that it was examining potential misconduct in other foreign subsidiaries.
This week, two congressmen sent a letter to Michael T. Duke, Wal-Mart's chief executive, reiterating a request for a meeting. The congressmen said that they had obtained internal documents, "including internal audit reports, from other sources suggesting that Wal-Mart may have had compliance issues relating not only to bribery, but also to 'questionable financial behavior' including tax evasion and money laundering in Mexico."
Mr. Holley said that Wal-Mart was not aware of any investigations regarding tax evasion or money laundering in Mexico. Company representatives have briefed Congressional staff members twice, he said.
The company spent $34 million in the quarter on expenses related to outside advisers on issues related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, like the law firms it has hired to investigate the matter, and said it expected those expenses to continue throughout the year.

Abstract: According to a Thomson Reuters database, school districts issued nearly $4 billion in such bonds last year, and have sold almost $3 billion more this year. In a statement, the Poway district pointed out that the bond issue was the fifth part of a plan to modernize the 24 oldest schools in the district, adding that while that bond "has a total repayment ratio of 9.3 times the principal amount," the overall borrowing program has a repayment ratio of just 4.2.

Full text:   The deleveraging of America is well under way, as individuals and companies recover from the excess borrowing that helped to produce the boom and left many people vulnerable when the bust arrived. Household debt is down nearly $900 billion over the last four years, partly from repayments and partly from defaults.
During the crazy times, homeowners could get mortgages that allowed them to pay less than the full amount of interest being charged, with the rest added to the principal. Commercial property owners generally paid the full amount of interest, but did not have to repay any principal until the loan matured in five or 10 years. For both homes and commercial properties, lenders were willing to rely on extremely optimistic appraisals.
For property buyers, those days are gone,
But for some borrowers, it is still possible to borrow now and pay nothing for decades.
There is a furor in California because the Poway Unified School District, in San Diego County, borrowed money last year on terms that even Countrywide would have laughed at during the boom. It will not pay a dime of interest or principal for more than two decades. Only then will it begin to service the bonds.
It is paying a high price. Although it has a good credit rating -- Aa2 at Moody's and AAâ[euro]" at Standard & Poor's -- it will eventually pay tax-exempt interest of up to 6.8 percent for the borrowings. When it issued more conventional bonds last year, it paid rates that were much lower, ranging up to just 4.1 percent.
For borrowing $105 million in 2011, taxpayers -- or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the children and grandchildren of today's taxpayers -- will pay $877 million in interest between 2033 and 2051.
In San Diego, the bond issue first gained attention on The Voice of San Diego, a Web-based publication, which published an article this month headlined "Where Borrowing $105 Million Will Cost $1 Billion: Poway Schools." As the Voice noted, others, including Joel Thurtell, a Michigan blogger, had written outraged articles about the bond issue. But it was the Voice article that attracted national attention, including a report on CNBC.
It turns out the Poway bond issue is not unique. This kind of borrowing has been going on for years, particularly in California, where the tax revolt that began with Proposition 13 in 1978 has made it harder and harder to finance education or other local government services. Assorted propositions approved by voters have made it very difficult to raise taxes at all.
According to a Thomson Reuters database, school districts issued nearly $4 billion in such bonds last year, and have sold almost $3 billion more this year. Back in 2006, when the credit boom was in full bloom, $9 billion worth of so-called capital appreciation bonds were sold.
The Poway issue is unusual in delaying interest payments for so long, but there have been others. Its neighbor, the San Diego Unified School District, borrowed $150 million in May, promising to begin payments in 2032.
School districts' logic for borrowing for construction projects always was that those who benefit should pay for a construction project. In the case of the Poway bond, however, it is at least possible that it will be the children of today's students who end up paying the bill. By then, many of these school buildings may be obsolete, or at least in need of another refurbishing.
In a statement, the Poway district pointed out that the bond issue was the fifth part of a plan to modernize the 24 oldest schools in the district, adding that while that bond "has a total repayment ratio of 9.3 times the principal amount," the overall borrowing program has a repayment ratio of just 4.2. That means that for every dollar borrowed, $3.20 in interest will be paid.
To put that into perspective, a 30-year mortgage at the same 6.8 percent interest rate would require $1.35 in lifetime interest payments for each dollar borrowed, or a repayment ratio of 2.35.
"The most important value received from the building program that is difficult to quantify is the educational value of providing today's students with quality learning facilities," said John Collins, the superintendent of the district, which has 34,000 students. "It is also difficult to calculate the dollar value of savings realized by avoiding the inflated construction costs of postponing the completion of the building program for a decade or more."
Your guess may be as good as his as to just how inflated those costs will be. But it is hard to believe that the district would not have been better off borrowing on terms that called for repaying the loan more quickly. The interest rate would have been lower, and the power of compound interest would not have caused the total payments to rise into the stratosphere.
But the option of getting reasonable financing may not have been available to the Poway district, or to many of the other districts that have resorted to these capital appreciation bonds. Poway officials had promised not to raise taxes, and this way they won't have to. At least not until 2033. They set the payments to begin after earlier bonds are paid off.
Nationally, it appears that fewer and fewer school districts have been able, or willing, to find ways to finance new buildings -- or even to pay teachers, as property tax revenue plunged with the deflating of the housing bubble and pinched states reduced assistance. State and local governments are spending less and employing fewer people now than they were before the recession. Adjusted for inflation, state and local investment in buildings and other assets is at the lowest level since 1998. Over the last 30 months, the economy has gained about half a million jobs in manufacturing, and lost nearly as many in state and local government.
Should districts issue such bonds? It is not an easy question to answer. Much of this expensive borrowing is a result of local officials searching for a way to meet their responsibilities at a time when opposition to taxes has become a mantra. This generation will not pay for what it needs, so some of its leaders have decided to saddle future generations with the bills.

Full text: Stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday amid signs that the nation's economic recovery was advancing, albeit slowly.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss of 7.36 points, or 0.06 percent, at 13,164.78. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.60 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,405.53 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 13.95 points, or 0.46 percent, to 3,030.93.
Industrial production increased last month as factories made more cars, computers and airplanes, according to the Federal Reserve.
It was a sign that manufacturing was recovering after a weak spring. Also, consumer prices were unchanged in July from June, as a small drop in energy costs offset slightly higher food prices. The Consumer Price Index has not changed since March, which means that inflation is in check.
Lower inflation gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to introduce programs intended to stimulate the economy. The Fed signaled at a meeting in late July that it was ready to act if growth and hiring stayed weak.
Recent reports have suggested that the economy improved somewhat in July. Employers created the most jobs in five months, while consumers spent a little more at stores after three months of declines.
Many investors wonder if the economy is fragile enough to create the sense of urgency for policy makers to act. The slightly better outlook for the economy could prompt the Fed to hold off on taking action when its policy committee next meets in September.
"We're in a period of very slow growth, though interest rates are low, and very little inflation," said David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. "Unless the U.S. economy goes into a swoon and there is no pick up in retail sales and deterioration in jobs growth or major shocks from Europe and China, the Fed will not take any action for now."
The bond market is betting that the Fed is not likely to act. Investors have been selling government bonds in recent days. On Wednesday, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 25/32, to 98 8/32, and the yield rose to 1.82 percent from 1.73 percent late Tuesday.
In the last few weeks, trading volume in the stock market has been low. On Wednesday, the number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange totaled just 2.6 billion, compared with an average of four billion on an average day. Investors may also be holding off on taking aggressive positions ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Wyoming at the end of this month.
Corporate earnings have been mixed.
Target, the discount retailer, rose $1.12 to $64.50 after reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations and raising its profit forecast for the year. Target is preparing its first expansion out of the United States, into Canada.
Deere, the farm equipment maker, fell $5.03 to $75.10 after reporting results that were well below Wall Street's expectations. The company attributed its poor results to a slowing global economy and the effects of a prolonged drought in the United States. Deere also cut its revenue forecast for the year.
Staples, the office supplies retailer, fell $1.97 to $11.49 after it said its income dropped 32 percent after weak sales in North America and Europe. The results fell short of analysts' expectations and the company cut its full-year earnings forecast.

July Retail Sales Rose 0.8%, Well Beyond Expectations

Full text: WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Retail sales rose in July for the first time in four months as demand increased for goods including cars and electronics, a sign that consumers could drive faster economic growth in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.8 percent last month, the largest gain since February and well beyond analysts' expectations.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices increased 0.3 percent in July, the fastest pace in five months, even as energy prices fell.
The broad-based expansion in retail sales bolstered the view that the slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter would prove temporary.
"Here comes the U.S. consumer," said Harm Bandholz, an economist at UniCredit Group.
Consumer spending drives the American economy, but sluggish retail sales contributed to weak growth in the spring.
Economic signs have been more reassuring this summer. Hiring accelerated in July despite a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent.
The strength in retail sales in July raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve would pursue a third round of bond-buying, or quantitative easing, to stimulate growth.
"Today's retail sales data further reduces the likelihood of QE3 in September, but does not take it off the table," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America in New York.
Fed policy makers will meet next on Sept. 12 and 13.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected retail sales to increase 0.3 percent.
Pointing to a strong gain in consumer spending in July, the so-called core measure of retail sales -- which excludes autos, gasoline and building materials -- rose 0.9 percent. That was the biggest gain since January.
Stronger consumer spending would help corporations that do business in the United States. Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement chain, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street predictions on Tuesday and raised its earnings outlook for the fiscal year.
Economic growth in the United States cooled to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter from a 2 percent pace in the first quarter, and economists are now banking on an acceleration.
The Commerce Department also said that in June overall retail sales declined 0.7, more than first reported, which economists said should curb some enthusiasm over the increase in retail sales.
"Given that sales are only marginally higher since the start of the year, households clearly remain cautious," said Amna Asaf, an economist with Capital Economics in Toronto.
While the Labor Department's index of producer prices, which measures prices received by farms, factories and refineries, climbed 0.3 percent last month on higher costs for consumer goods and food, the gain was muted by a drop in energy prices.
Excluding food and energy costs, core inflation at the wholesale level accelerated 0.4 percent in July. The core measure has held at higher levels even as a sharp drop in energy prices over the last year has pulled overall producer prices lower.
"This report suggests core inflation will persist despite price swings in food and energy," said Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays.

Abstract: [...]hacking away at the roughly $400 billion domestic discretionary budget (what's left of the federal budget after defense, Social Security, health and safety-net spending and interest on the national debt) will yield only a rounding error's worth of savings after popular programs (which Republicans heartily favor) like cancer research, national parks, veterans' benefits, farm aid, highway subsidies, education grants and small-business loans are accommodated.

Full text:   Greenwich, Conn.
PAUL D. RYAN is the most articulate and intellectually imposing Republican of the moment, but that doesn't alter the fact that this earnest congressman from Wisconsin is preaching the same empty conservative sermon.
Thirty years of Republican apostasy -- a once grand party's embrace of the welfare state, the warfare state and the Wall Street-coddling bailout state -- have crippled the engines of capitalism and buried us in debt. Mr. Ryan's sonorous campaign rhetoric about shrinking Big Government and giving tax cuts to "job creators" (read: the top 2 percent) will do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse.
Mr. Ryan professes to be a defense hawk, though the true conservatives of modern times -- Calvin Coolidge, Herbert C. Hoover, Robert A. Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, even Gerald R. Ford -- would have had no use for the neoconconservative imperialism that the G.O.P. cobbled from policy salons run by Irving Kristol's ex-Trotskyites three decades ago. These doctrines now saddle our bankrupt nation with a roughly $775 billion "defense" budget in a world where we have no advanced industrial state enemies and have been fired (appropriately) as the global policeman.
Indeed, adjusted for inflation, today's national security budget is nearly double Eisenhower's when he left office in 1961 (about $400 billion in today's dollars) -- a level Ike deemed sufficient to contain the very real Soviet nuclear threat in the era just after Sputnik. By contrast, the Romney-Ryan version of shrinking Big Government is to increase our already outlandish warfare-state budget and risk even more spending by saber-rattling at a benighted but irrelevant Iran.
Similarly, there can be no hope of a return to vibrant capitalism unless there is a sweeping housecleaning at the Federal Reserve and a thorough renunciation of its interest-rate fixing, bond buying and recurring bailouts of Wall Street speculators. The Greenspan-Bernanke campaigns to repress interest rates have crushed savers, mocked thrift and fueled enormous overconsumption and trade deficits.
The greatest regulatory problem -- far more urgent that the environmental marginalia Mitt Romney has fumed about -- is that the giant Wall Street banks remain dangerous quasi-wards of the state and are inexorably prone to speculative abuse of taxpayer-insured deposits and the Fed's cheap money. Forget about "too big to fail." These banks are too big to exist -- too big to manage internally and to regulate externally. They need to be broken up by regulatory decree. Instead, the Romney-Ryan ticket attacks the pointless Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, when what's needed is a restoration of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era legislation that separated commercial and investment banking.
Mr. Ryan showed his conservative mettle in 2008 when he folded like a lawn chair on the auto bailout and the Wall Street bailout. But the greater hypocrisy is his phony "plan" to solve the entitlements mess by deferring changes to social insurance by at least a decade.
A true agenda to reform the welfare state would require a sweeping, income-based eligibility test, which would reduce or eliminate social insurance benefits for millions of affluent retirees. Without it, there is no math that can avoid giant tax increases or vast new borrowing. Yet the supposedly courageous Ryan plan would not cut one dime over the next decade from the $1.3 trillion-per-year cost of Social Security and Medicare.
Instead, it shreds the measly means-tested safety net for the vulnerable: the roughly $100 billion per year for food stamps and cash assistance for needy families and the $300 billion budget for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Shifting more Medicaid costs to the states will be mere make-believe if federal financing is drastically cut.
Likewise, hacking away at the roughly $400 billion domestic discretionary budget (what's left of the federal budget after defense, Social Security, health and safety-net spending and interest on the national debt) will yield only a rounding error's worth of savings after popular programs (which Republicans heartily favor) like cancer research, national parks, veterans' benefits, farm aid, highway subsidies, education grants and small-business loans are accommodated.
Like his new boss, Mr. Ryan has no serious plan to create jobs. America has some of the highest labor costs in the world, and saddles workers and businesses with $1 trillion per year in job-destroying payroll taxes. We need a national sales tax -- a consumption tax, like the dreaded but efficient value-added tax -- but Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan don't have the gumption to support it.
The Ryan Plan boils down to a fetish for cutting the top marginal income-tax rate for "job creators" -- i.e. the superwealthy -- to 25 percent and paying for it with an as-yet-undisclosed plan to broaden the tax base. Of the $1 trillion in so-called tax expenditures that the plan would attack, the vast majority would come from slashing popular tax breaks for employer-provided health insurance, mortgage interest, 401(k) accounts, state and local taxes, charitable giving and the like, not to mention low rates on capital gains and dividends. The crony capitalists of K Street already own more than enough Republican votes to stop that train before it leaves the station.
In short, Mr. Ryan's plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices. And it couldn't pass even if Republicans were to take the presidency and both houses of Congress. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have no plan to take on Wall Street, the Fed, the military-industrial complex, social insurance or the nation's fiscal calamity and no plan to revive capitalist prosperity -- just empty sermons.

Full text: On the face of it, Senator Harry Reid's explosive but flimsily sourced claim that Mitt Romney paid no income tax seems preposterous. Mr. Romney has denied it, and without his returns no one can say for sure. But for someone who makes millions of dollars a year, would it even be possible?
Evidently it is.
It so happens that this summer the Internal Revenue Service released data from the 400 individual income tax returns reporting the highest adjusted gross income. This elite ultrarich group earned on average $202 million in 2009, the latest year available. And buried in the data is the startling disclosure that six of the 400 paid no federal income tax.
The I.R.S. has never before disclosed that last fact.
Not even Mr. Romney, with reported 2010 income of $21.7 million, qualifies for membership in this select group of 400. But the data provides a window into the financial lives and tax rates of the superrich. Since the I.R.S. doesn't release data for the tiny percentage of Americans at Mr. Romney's income level, the 400 are the closest proxy.
And that data demonstrates that many of the ultrarich can and do reduce their tax liability to very low levels, even zero. Besides the six who paid no federal income tax, the I.R.S. reported that 27 paid from zero to 10 percent of their adjusted gross incomes and another 89 paid between 10 and 15 percent, which is close to the 13.9 percent rate that Mr. Romney disclosed that he paid in 2010. (At the other end of the spectrum, 82 paid 30 to 35 percent. None paid more than 35 percent.) So more than a quarter of the people earning an average of over $200 million in 2009 paid less than 15 percent of their adjusted gross income in taxes.
How do they do it?
The data show that the ultrarich typically pay low tax rates every year, but 2009 was a special case. In 2008, people with large stock portfolios and other less liquid assets were disproportionately hit with large losses on paper. One of the oddities of the tax code is that capital gains taxes are discretionary, since they must be paid only when gains are realized. And they can be offset by losses. The silver lining in a bad year like 2008 for wealthy people is that they can "harvest" losses by selling assets, then use those losses to offset any gains. They can also carry forward the losses to offset gains in future years.
There's ample evidence that happened in 2009 among the richest taxpayers. Their average income, $202 million, dropped from $270 million in 2008 and was the lowest since 2004. Like Mr. Romney in 2010, for the richest taxpayers most income comes from capital gains and other investment income. Their net capital gains (the data doesn't include gross gains and losses) dropped by nearly 40 percent, from an average of $154 million in 2008 to $93 million in 2009, which accounts for nearly all of their drop in total income. Even with these lower gains, these 400 taxpayers, a minuscule fraction of the population at large, still managed to account for 16 percent of all capital gains. That is the highest percentage since the data was first released for 1992, when that percentage was less than 6 percent.
Tax experts I consulted said these results almost certainly reflected aggressive use of tax-loss carry-forwards from 2008, since the stock market bottomed in March 2009 and rallied strongly during the rest of the year.
The superrich also accounted for a disproportionate amount of dividend income, which averaged over $26 million for the top 400, or over 6 percent of total dividend income, also a record. Capital gains and dividends are both taxed at a maximum rate of 15 percent, as opposed to the maximum rate on earned income of 35 percent, which helps explain why so many of the superrich pay a relatively low rate. Still, that preferential rate doesn't get them anywhere near zero, or even 10 percent.
Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the Gould School of Law at the University of Southern California, explained it this way, "You start with income dominated by tax-preferred income -- capital gains and qualified dividends. That gets you to 15 percent. Then you use charitable contributions of appreciated securities to reduce ordinary income. But the charitable contribution deduction is capped at 50 percent of adjusted gross income. Now you're way down, but you're not at zero."
What does it take to get to zero, or close to it? According to Professor Kleinbard, there are only two additional ways: tax loss carry-forwards to offset capital gains, and tax shelters, many of which have been deemed abusive by the I.R.S., to offset any remaining ordinary income after other deductions.
(Other possibilities are the foreign tax credit and general business credit, but total tax credits averaged only $2.4 million for the top 400, and neither would seem to be of much benefit to Mr. Romney.)
Since Mr. Romney seems to have had relatively little ordinary income since leaving Bain Capital, he may have been able to get to a very low rate in 2009 using tax loss carry-forwards from 2008 to offset capital gains and charitable contributions to offset up to 50 percent of his ordinary income. Without access to the returns, it's impossible to know whether he would also have needed some additional form of tax shelter, aggressive or otherwise, to get even lower, or even to zero.
Mr. Romney has been taken to task for an abusive tax shelter used by Marriott International in 1994 while Mr. Romney was on the board and audit committee there. But there's been no direct evidence he knew the details, and in any event, the I.R.S. started cracking down on such shelters in 2000, making it highly unlikely Mr. Romney would have embraced the strategy for his own returns within the last decade.
He's also been faulted for treating a horse partly owned by his wife as a loss-generating passive investment, rather than as a hobby. Even though that had little effect on his overall tax liability, Professor Kleinbard contends that that and other tax avoidance measures demonstrate a propensity to engage in aggressive tax strategies.
But even Professor Kleinbard doubts that Mr. Romney paid no income tax. "It's possible theoretically that Romney didn't pay, but improbable," he said. Far more likely is that he paid a very low rate that would generate renewed criticism.
This may help explain why Mr. Romney is refusing to release more of his own returns, especially those for 2009. On the face of it, his stubbornness is perplexing. The electorate already knows that he's immensely wealthy and that he pays a very low tax rate compared with many people who make far less.
There's no reason to fault Mr. Romney for taking advantage of loopholes the tax code offers the superrich, however ill advised they may be as a matter of public policy. Mr. Romney didn't make the law, and he's called for broadening the tax base, which presumably means eliminating some of the breaks that benefited him. He could easily speak to that issue, since who would know better than he does which loopholes should be closed?
Senator John McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate who received 23 years of Mr. Romney's returns as part of the vice-presidential vetting process in 2008, has volunteered that "I can personally vouch for the fact that there was nothing in his tax returns that would in any way be disqualifying for him to be a candidate." Something that would disqualify, him, as opposed to merely alienating voters, may be a pretty high bar, but presumably it rules out anything illegal or unethical. Senator McCain declined to be more specific.
Which leaves plenty of room for speculation, informed or otherwise. Senator Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, set off a media storm when he told The Huffington Post the week before last that a former Bain Capital investor had told him Mr. Romney "didn't pay any taxes for 10 years," adding, "I'm not certain" if that's true. It can't be -- Mr. Romney must have paid sales, property and other taxes. Presumably Senator Reid's unnamed source meant that Mr. Romney paid no federal income tax for years.
The candidate promptly denied the claim, saying he had paid taxes every year. Still, he was vague, telling ABC News he "couldn't remember" whether he paid less than his 2010 federal income tax rate of 13.9 percent in some years and didn't specify which taxes he meant.
And when Senator McCain said there was nothing "disqualifying" in Mr. Romney's returns, he would not have seen Mr. Romney's returns for 2009, which were filed after his vice-presidential vetting.
As long as Mr. Romney withholds his returns, continued speculation, and even outlandish conjecture, will probably flourish. "It's reinforced my view that he'd be better off just releasing the returns rather than having people blindly speculating," Leonard E. Burman, a tax specialist and professor of public affairs at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told me this week. "It seems like one of those slow-drip water torture things, and eventually he's going to have to do it."
For the record, I paid total tax of 37 percent in 2010 and 33 percent in 2011. And should there be a groundswell of interest, I'll release my results for as many years as anyone wants. I haven't done the calculations for years before 2010, but I'd be surprised if they're much different.
What's abundantly clear, both from Mr. Romney's 2010 returns and from the returns of the top 400, is that at the very pinnacle of taxpayers, the United States has a regressive tax system. The top 400 earn more than 1 percent of all income in the United States, more than double their share in 1992. These 400 earned a total of $81 billion in 2009 -- but paid an average tax rate of just 19.9 percent.
"It's regressive because capital gains and dividends dominate the top returns and are taxed at a preferential rate," Professor Kleinbard said.
Professor Burman added: "Our tax code has a number of flaws, one of which is that it doesn't do a very good job of discriminating based on income. It is progressive over all, but very high-income people can pay very little tax. How they avoid tax is an important and legitimate issue we should be talking about."

Abstract: With the nation's worst drought in a half-century continuing to decimate crops, the government on Friday slashed its estimate of the soybean yield, made only a month ago, to the lowest level since 2003 and its estimate of the corn yield to the lowest level since 1995. "The United States is the world's largest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat, and likely price spikes will ripple through markets globally, with devastating consequences for those already struggling to get enough food to eat," said Eric Munoz, a senior policy analyst with Oxfam, an international aid group.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- With the nation's worst drought in a half-century continuing to decimate crops, the government on Friday slashed its estimate of the soybean yield, made only a month ago, to the lowest level since 2003 and its estimate of the corn yield to the lowest level since 1995.
The smaller harvests will drive up prices for food and animal feed, analysts said. The prospects are also increasing pressure on the Obama administration to divert less corn to the production of the biofuel ethanol.
Agriculture Secretary Thomas J. Vilsack, visiting drought-stricken farmers in Nebraska on Friday, said that despite the reduced crop production, farmers are in better shape today than during the last major drought, in 1988.
"Last time only 25 percent of farmers had crop insurance, but this time over 85 percent are covered," Mr. Vilsack said, noting that the government was still forecasting the eighth-biggest corn harvest ever.
But analysts warned of falling yields and spiking wholesale prices down the road. "It's scary when you see the numbers out today," said Terry Roggensack, an analyst at the Hightower Report in Chicago. "Unless there is normal weather and rain from here on out, I can easily see prices for corn and soybeans" rising 20 percent to 25 percent.
In the past month, as the country recorded the hottest month on record, the government lowered its production forecast for eggs, milk and pork. Beef production is expected to rise as ranchers cull more of their herds because of higher feed prices. But experts predict that the price of beef will not rise until next year as supplies tighten but feed costs continue to increase.
Last month, the Agriculture Department estimated that food prices would climb 3 percent to 4 percent in 2013. The overall economic effect in the United States, however, will be muted, given that American households generally spend only about 13 percent of their budgets on food and often elect to buy cheaper foods rather than pay higher prices.
On Friday, Capital Economics estimated that the rising food prices might knock 0.1 percent off the annual pace of economic growth.
Farmers in the hardest hit areas of the Midwest said that Friday's report only confirmed what they already knew.
"We've lost 60 percent of our average production, if not 70," said Nick Guetterman, president of the Johnson County Farm Bureau in eastern Kansas, who farms about 10,000 acres with his family. Mr. Guetterman said he expected crop insurance to cover his costs this year, but not much more. "You take what you get, that's all you can do," he said. "You go to church and pray."
The Agriculture Department's report has also renewed debate over the use of corn for ethanol production.
The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in 2005 and expanded in 2007, requires that 13.2 billion gallons of corn-based biofuel be produced in 2012. The goal of the standard is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
About 40 percent of the nation's corn crop now goes to ethanol producers -- the rest to animal feed, food and exports.
Retailers said that they did not expect to have to pass along price increases to customers in the short term.
"The drought has had an impact on commodity costs everywhere," said John Simley, a spokesman for Kraft Foods, the maker of a range of baked goods and meat products. "It's not likely to impact our costs in the near term, because of our commodity coverage positions," he said, referring to the company's hedges against fluctuations in the markets.
But severe weather has hurt agricultural production in other major exporting countries, including Brazil, Russia, Australia and India, not just the United States. That has raised concerns about global shortages of certain food commodities -- shortages that will increase food prices and stoke inflation.
"The United States is the world's largest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat, and likely price spikes will ripple through markets globally, with devastating consequences for those already struggling to get enough food to eat," said Eric Munoz, a senior policy analyst with Oxfam, an international aid group.
On Thursday, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said that global food prices jumped 6 percent in July, with the price of corn up 23 percent. It has warned developing countries to prepare for possible price fluctuations.
In one impoverished region of Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, Oxfam said that the past five years had seen a significant rise in the price of grains, making the area more vulnerable to any coming food price increases.
"There are a number of reactions," said Eric Hazard of Oxfam in Dakar, Senegal. "People diminish the number of meals, and the quality of their meals. We've seen an increase in migration."
Arif Husain, deputy chief of the Food Security Analysis Service at the United Nations World Food Program in Rome, said: "The real problem is this is the third price shock in the last five years. The poorer countries haven't had time to recover from previous crises."
The Agriculture Department report released on Friday forecast the corn yield to be 123.4 bushels an acre, the lowest in 17 years, down 15.5 percent from its July estimate. It also forecast the yield for soybeans, used in everything from fry oil to livestock feed, to be 36.1 bushels an acre -- down 10.7 percent, or 4.4 bushels an acre below last month's government estimate and 5.4 bushels an acre less than last year.
The new estimates are based on surveys of more than 25,000 farmers, as well as Agriculture Department experts inspecting fields for the first time since the drought began to drive up prices in mid-June.
The new crop forecast report prompted some commodity futures to rise. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures were up about 1 percent. Corn futures had already climbed on widespread expectation of a weak report. They declined on Friday, trading for about $8 a bushel, up from about $5.20 in June.
Critics of the ethanol fuel standard say the use of corn for ethanol is a major factor in the tripling in the price of corn since 2005. Livestock producers, hard hit by the rise in feed prices, have called on the Obama administration to waive the requirement until the drought is over.
"If not now, when?" said Randy Spronk, a pork farmer in Edgerton, Minn. "Livestock producers are getting killed out here with feed prices."
Mr. Spronk, the incoming president of the National Pork Producers Council, said livestock producers would have to reduce their herds and flocks because feed was becoming scarce and too expensive.
With half the nation's corn crop in poor condition, 156 House members and 25 senators have signed letters to Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, calling on her to issue a waiver on the ethanol standard.
Even the United Nations has called on the United States to ease the use of ethanol.
In a letter published in The Financial Times on Friday, José Graziano da Silva, the director-general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, wrote: "An immediate, temporary suspension of that mandate would give some respite to the market and allow more of the crop to be channeled toward food and feed uses."
The ethanol industry said calls to waive the fuel standards were premature.
"So far we have nothing more than speculation about what the danger to the corn crop is going to be," said Matt Harwig, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol industry trade group. "We need to take a wait-and-see approach."
Mr. Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said in an interview taped for C-Span's "Newsmakers": "We still need to get a farm bill passed to help to get some relief for livestock producers who lack a safety net. But American farmers are a resilient bunch. They will get through this."
The report does give farmers an overview of the suffering their peers across the country are experiencing, said Bill Northey, the Iowa secretary of agriculture. That will help farmers make decisions on handling their own crops, like when to cut them and when to sell them, he said.
Mr. Northey, who farms in northwest Iowa, said the grim outlook nationwide would lead him to hold onto a lot of his crop until he sees exactly how much his yields are at harvest. If he sold too much now, he said, he would run the risk of not being able to deliver on the sales if the yield turns out lower than expected.
"We'll be figuring some of those things out," Mr. Northey said. "But most of it's not going to happen until we get a combine in the field."

China's giant economy has emerged as a key driver of global growth, and hopes are high that rising affluence, urbanization and development will help mitigate the weakness of the European and U.S. economies.
The turmoil in Europe and the anemic pace of economic growth in the United States have, however, increasingly dragged down exports from China and other export-oriented countries in Asia, prompting rate cuts and other economy-bolstering steps from governments across the region in recent months. More steps are likely to follow.
Data released Friday showed that the growth in overseas shipments from China had ground to a near halt in July, with exports up just 1 percent from the same month a year earlier, far below expectations and well beneath the 11.3 percent in June.
Imports, too, disappointed, with an increase of 4.7 percent, underscoring that domestic demand had not been buoyed as much as hoped by efforts to foster bank lending and infrastructure work.
On Thursday, other government numbers painted a similarly disappointing picture: Industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment all grew less rapidly than economists had projected.
"Things really aren't going China's way," Alistair Thornton, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, said in a note. "Those looking for signs of resilience in China's economic data were merely disappointed yesterday, but they are going to be distraught today."
Combined, the July data show that Beijing's efforts to shore up growth in the face of the global downturn have so far proved insufficient, and that a much-anticipated growth pickup is unlikely to materialize for another few months.
The central bank cut interest rates twice in quick succession in June and July, and has also progressively lowered the reserve requirement ratio for banks, freeing up more cash for lenders to extend as credit. Central bank data released Friday, however, indicated that those moves had not translated into as much new lending as hoped.
Chinese banks extended 540.1 billion renminbi, or $85.86 billion, of new local-currency loans in July. The amount was larger than during the same month last year, but fell short of the roughly 700 billion renminbi analysts had expected.
"There cannot be a sufficient infrastructure spending boost without stronger lending, and we expect Beijing to push banks to extend more credit," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Crédit Agricole in Hong Kong.
"Demand is still there, and the economy is still growing at between 7 and 8 percent; it is not heading for a hard landing," he said.
But, he added, the poor external demand and softer domestic demand are likely to prompt Beijing "to roll out additional policy measures to turn the economy around."
At the same time, lower inflation, which dropped to less than 2 percent in July, has given the authorities more leeway to act now. Moreover, the leadership transition this year could provide extra impetus to step on the accelerator sooner rather than later.
"It's important for the political transition to take place in an environment of growth," Mr. Kowalczyk said. "They will want to do more to make the economy feel better; they have that time pressure breathing down their necks, and it is logical for them to use more levers to move the economy."
As a result, many analysts believe a further cut to the reserve ratio for banks is imminent; some also believe the central bank may lower interest rates, too, in a bid to ignite more growth.
More spending and a push to bolster infrastructure spending are also likely.
On Friday, the central bank set its benchmark daily reference rate for the renminbi at 6.3447 to the U.S. dollar, its weakest level since late November.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index extended its rally to a fifth day on Thursday, again making a small gain as lingering expectations for economic stimulus from central banks lent support to a market lacking catalysts.
Although the S.& P. 500 has posted three-month highs every day this week, it has climbed only 0.6 percent over the last three sessions, an indication that investors were reluctant to make aggressive bets despite the better-than-expected jobless claims and trade data that government agencies reported Thursday.
The Nasdaq composite index beat the other two major stock indexes, led by Cisco Systems after Goldman Sachs recommended the stock and Piper Jaffray upgraded its rating. Cisco rose 3.2 percent to $17.70 and was the Dow's biggest percentage gainer.
Materials stocks also advanced after James River Coal said the market for power-generating coal was showing signs of a recovery after big industrywide cuts in production. The stock surged 13 percent to $2.52 while Arch Coal rose 7.1 percent to $7.42. An S.& P. materials index rose 0.5 percent.
The three major stock indexes seesawed throughout the morning, with the S.& P. 500 mostly hovering above 1,400 in light trading as investors bet central banks would soon act to support a global recovery that has shown signs of stalling.
"It's almost eerie how flat the market has been," said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "But while there's a risk of our becoming overbought, I don't see why we'd see a decline of any magnitude until we hear what central banks will do."
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 10.45 points, or 0.08 percent, to 13,165.19. The S.& P. 500 inched up 0.58 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to 1,402.80. The Nasdaq composite index gained 7.39 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 3,018.64.
Markets held on despite weak Chinese economic data. Annual growth in factory output slowed to its lowest in more than three years in July, while annual consumer price inflation hit a 30-month low.
"This news is disappointing, but it only emboldens investors that we'll be rescued by central banks somewhere," Mr. Luschini said.
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week while the United States trade deficit in June was the smallest in 18 months, hopeful signs.
The beauty products maker Elizabeth Arden forecast 2013 profit above estimates on stronger sales and its shares rose 13 percent to $44.02.
Of the 445 companies in the S.& P. 500 that had reported second-quarter earnings through Thursday morning, 68 percent have exceeded analysts' expectations, in line with the average over the last four quarters.
Shares of Robbins & Myers, a provider of industrial fluids and fluid management systems, rose 27.4 percent to $59.63 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the company for $2.54 billion in cash. Varco shares added 0.8 percent to $76.98.
E*Trade Financial gained 6.9 percent to $8.57 after replacing its chief, Steven Freiberg. with its chairman, Frank J. Petrilli, on an interim basis.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 17/32, to 99 12/3, and the yield rose to 1.70 percent from 1.65 percent late Wednesday.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A senior Federal Reserve official said Monday that the employment data released last week had reinforced his view that the Fed must act to increase economic growth.
Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that the Fed should again expand its holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasury securities, and that the purchases should steadily continue until the Fed was satisfied with the health of the economy.
"You continue to do it until it's clear that you're no longer treading water," Mr. Rosengren said in an interview. "You continue to do it until you have documented evidence that you're getting growth in income and the unemployment rate consistent with your economic goals."
The government estimated that payrolls increased by 163,000 in July, more than in the last several months and more than analysts had predicted. But Mr. Rosengren emphasized that several indicators, including the unemployment rate and the share of the population in the work force, had retreated to their levels at the beginning of the year.
"For the last seven months we've been treading water. That's different from what we expected at the beginning of the year," he said. "I think it's time to swim to shore."
But another Fed official, Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that he did not support additional monetary stimulus because he did not think it would reduce unemployment. He said the real drag on the economy was a lack of action by fiscal policy makers.
"We have hit a wall and that wall is called Congress," Mr. Fisher told Reuters.
The Fed said after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee last week that it would act if the pace of job growth did not improve. The comments by the two officials offered the first glimpse of how the latest jobs data, released two days after the meeting, might affect the Fed's decision-making.
It is a limited glimpse. Mr. Rosengren and Mr. Fisher occupy opposite ends of the spectrum of Fed officials -- Mr. Rosengren already favored new action, while Mr. Fisher has consistently opposed new steps -- while the decision rests with a centrist group led by the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
Moreover, Mr. Rosengren and Mr. Fisher do not hold votes on the committee this year, although they participate in its discussions. Only five of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks vote in any given year, in addition to Mr. Bernanke and the other six members of the Fed's board of governors.
But the comments underscore the extent of divisions among Fed officials that have been obscured by the central bank's efforts to maintain a united public face.
Some officials always vote with the majority, even if they favor a different course of action. And several of the most outspoken officials do not hold votes this year. As a result, the Fed's decision to take no new action was supported by 11 of the 12 voters. The one dissent came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who said the Fed was providing too much stimulus.
Mr. Rosengren expressed frustration with opponents of new action, noting that Fed officials had predicted that they would fail to meet both of their goals this year -- not only is unemployment too high, but inflation is too low.
And he said that even officials who doubt the Fed's ability to foster job growth should support action to raise the rate of inflation from the current pace of about 1.8 percent to the 2 percent level the Fed considers most healthy.
"The one thing I think all economists agree on is that the Fed should be able to have an impact on inflation," he said. "We're missing on the inflation target. I think all economists would agree that we should take action to get back to the inflation target."
Mr. Rosengren's proposal for new action would be a significant shift from earlier rounds of asset purchases, when the Fed announced in advance how much money it would spend and over what period of time. Mr. Rosengren and other officials, including John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, say that the focus instead should be on results.
He acknowledged that some economists, including some Fed officials, were skeptical about the central bank's ability to stimulate the economy. They argue that reduced borrowing costs have at best an indirect impact on problems including the decline in government spending, concern about the European recession and the efforts of many consumers to pay their existing debts.
But Mr. Rosengren, who holds a doctorate in economics from the University of Wisconsin, said the available research showed clear evidence that the Fed's previous asset purchases had economic benefits, including increased asset prices, lower borrowing costs and a weaker dollar.
"Exports are important, and so if we have a new program it's probably going to slow down the appreciation that we've experienced in the dollar, which would help support our export markets," Mr. Rosengren said.
Mr. Rosengren said he did not have a firm view on what kind of measuring stick the Fed should use for a new program of asset purchases. But he suggested the Fed could target a minimum rate of nominal growth -- economic growth plus inflation -- of 4.5 percent. The government estimates the rate of nominal growth in the 2012 second quarter at 3.1 percent.
That approach is likely to face resistance from officials including Mr. Bernanke, who has expressed little tolerance for pushing inflation above 2 percent.

Abstract: According to a survey conducted in July by the University of Texas, 70 percent of Americans believe the climate is changing, compared to 65 percent in March, and only 15 percent say it isn't. Heat waves are invisible killers of old, poor and other mostly invisible people. [...]the summer of 1995, medical examiners and media outlets often neglected to report heat-related deaths altogether.

Full text: CLIMATE change is hardly a seasonal issue, but summer is the only time of year when Americans and the news media regularly fix their attention on the everyday heat emergency that's already altering life on our planet. Indeed, this summer's record-shattering weather across the United States has created a heightened level of interest in and concern about the consequences of climate change.
For the moment, we have an opportunity to make fundamental changes to the way our country deals with the environment, changes that would lock in public acceptance of climate change. But we have to act quickly -- not only because the crisis is urgent, but because one good blizzard could change a lot of minds.
For now, though, Americans, long cynical about global warming, are confronting the facts. According to a survey conducted in July by the University of Texas, 70 percent of Americans believe the climate is changing, compared to 65 percent in March, and only 15 percent say it isn't. Party affiliation continues to divide public opinion, but today most Republicans, 53 percent, believe in climate change, as do 72 percent of independents and 87 percent of Democrats.
Perhaps that's because this year's extreme weather has afflicted residents of red and blue states equally. The United States Drought Monitor, based at the University of Nebraska, reports that moderate to severe drought conditions this summer are affecting 64 percent of the lower 48 states, leading to domestic food inflation and record high prices for grain.
The Midwest is becoming a Dust Bowl, the Southwest and Rocky Mountains a tinder box. Lakes and rivers across the South are drying up. And a series of brutal heat waves, severe storms and prolonged power failures has punished residents of the Northeast, generating widespread concern that the region's infrastructure is woefully unprepared for the strange weather that's become our new norm.
But the most visible human drama of climate change is happening in cities. Cities are not merely the population centers where dense concentrations of people are trapped and exposed during dangerous weather events. They are also "heat islands," whose asphalt, brick, concrete and steel attract the heat while pollution from automobiles, factories and air-conditioners traps it. City dwellers experience elevated heat at all hours, but the difference matters most at night, when the failure of high temperatures to fall deprives them of natural relief. For the most vulnerable people, these "high lows" can be the difference between life and death.
Americans began to take urban heat seriously after 1995, when a record-breaking heat wave -- three days of triple-digit heat -- baked Chicago. Ordinarily, heat waves fail to produce the kind of spectacular imagery we see in other disasters, like earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. Heat doesn't generate much property damage, nor does it reveal its force to the camera or naked eye. Heat waves are invisible killers of old, poor and other mostly invisible people. Until the summer of 1995, medical examiners and media outlets often neglected to report heat-related deaths altogether.
But the great Chicago heat wave changed things. It caused so much suffering that at one point nearly half the city's emergency rooms closed their doors to new patients. Hospitals were not the only institutions stretched beyond capacity by the heat. Streets buckled. Trains derailed. The power grid failed. Water pressure diminished. Ambulances were delayed.
There were "water wars" in poor neighborhoods, where city workers cracked down on residents who opened fire hydrants for relief. There were surreal scenes at City Hall, where members of the mayor's staff declined to declare a heat emergency, forgot to implement their extreme heat plan and refused to bring in additional ambulances and paramedics.
And there was Mayor Richard M. Daley, telling reporters: "It's hot. It's very hot. But let's not blow it out of proportion," while the morgue ran out of bays and the medical examiner had to call in a fleet of refrigerated trucks to handle the load. When the temperatures finally broke, 739 Chicagoans had died as a result of the heat wave.
Chicago learned from the disaster, and today it is a national leader in planning for the next acute heat emergency. The city compiles a list of old, isolated and vulnerable residents, and public workers contact them when dangerous weather arrives. City officials and community organizations promote awareness and encourage residents to check in on one another. The local news media treat heat waves as true public health hazards. Everyone knows how perilous the new climate can be.
Unfortunately, Chicago keeps getting reminders. In the early July heat wave, despite its improved emergency response system, Chicago reported more heat deaths than any other city or state. And this week the Union of Concerned Scientists released "Heat in the Heartland," a study that reports an increased incidence of dangerous hot weather throughout the Midwest in the past 60 years, including elevated evening temperatures and more heat waves lasting three days or longer. Along with Chicago, the report singles out St. Louis, Detroit, Minneapolis and Cincinnati as being at risk, but also cites public health research predicting more heat waves in towns and cities throughout the Midwest and Northeast.
There are likely to be more such reports this summer, like a recent Environment America Research and Policy Center study finding more extreme downpours as a result of global warming. If a particularly strong hurricane hits, climatologists will once again explain that rising sea levels increase the likelihood of more, and more severe, storms, and perhaps even more Americans will begin believing in climate change. Then again, in our event-driven culture, a cold winter may well reverse the trend.
Americans' growing concerns about global warming will mean nothing if our national leaders are unwilling to seize the moment and do something about it. No city wants to be the next Chicago, and no urban government should go without the kind of acute-heat emergency plan that Chicago has today. But the question that may determine the life and death of future generations is whether we will face up to the larger heat emergency before the political climate changes once again.

Full text: With 163,000 new jobs created, July's employment growth topped both analysts' expectations and the meager job gains in May and June. While that growth was not enough to reduce the jobless rate -- now 8.3 percent -- it was enough to boost the stock market. For investors, the job tally was just high enough to be a pleasant surprise and low enough to give them hope that the Federal Reserve would soon intervene to juice the economy.
The market's reaction aside, the report actually shows how bad things are and highlights what needs to be done to improve conditions.
July's job-growth figure brings the monthly average tally for 2012 to 151,000, compared with a monthly average in 2011 of 153,000. At that tepid pace, it would take roughly 10 more years to regain the jobs that were lost -- or never created -- as a result of the Great Recession.
The month's jobless rate brings the average for 2012 to 8.2 percent, compared with an average in 2011 of 9 percent, though most of the "improvement" is because of a shrinking labor force, not more hiring. The average hourly wage in 2012, adjusted for inflation through June, has been $23.39; the average in 2011 was $23.44.
The picture that emerges is of a job market that is stuck. Broader measures reinforce that conclusion: In the first half of this year, economic growth averaged 1.7 percent; in 2011, it was 1.8 percent. For all the up and down of monthly and quarterly economic data, the economy lacks forward momentum.
When consumption and investment are not powering the economy, the government sector has to fill the gap with stimulus to boost consumer demand. Much of the economy's flat performance since 2011 reflects insufficient stimulus, reinforcing insufficient demand. That means sluggish job growth, lackluster pay and persistently weak demand. It's not a downward spiral, but it is self-reinforcing stagnation.
Politics, however, has gotten in the way of even basic moves to push the economy upward.
Responding to the latest employment report, the White House noted correctly that major areas of job weakness -- including positions in construction and teaching -- are precisely those that would have been the subject of the jobs bill proposed in 2011 by President Obama. That legislation was blocked by Congressional Republicans.
Mitt Romney responded to the July report by saying that the numbers reflect the failure of Mr. Obama's policies when, in reality, they reflect the success of the Republican obstructionism.
That leaves the Federal Reserve to try to boost the economy. But what's needed is direct intervention in the form of more federal spending on education, infrastructure, clean energy, basic research and job training. Until then, we're stuck.

Full text: Paul W. McCracken, a moderate Republican who served as an economic adviser to both Republican and Democratic presidents and who led President Richard M. Nixon's largely unsuccessful effort to tame the rising inflation of the late 1960s and early 1970s, died on Friday in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 96.
His death was announced by the University of Michigan, where he had taught for most of his academic career. A wide-ranging thinker, Mr. McCracken was part of a postwar generation of economists who believed that government should play an active role in moderating business cycles, balancing inflation and unemployment, and helping the disadvantaged.
His nearly three years at the White House coincided with a turbulent era marked by rising deficits, rampant inflation, the imposition of wage and price controls, and the breakdown of the system of fixed exchange rates that had governed the world's currencies since World War II.
As a result, by the early 1980s, Mr. McCracken, like other economists, questioned the Keynesian assumptions that had been dominant since the war. He concluded that high inflation had resulted from "a cumulative paralysis in our will" and called for greater fiscal discipline to limit the growth of government spending -- a topic that continues to vex Washington.
"Government was never during the 1970s able to bring itself to meet the first fundamental requirement of a successful price-stabilization policy -- namely, that its policies, quite simply, would not accommodate inflation," Mr. McCracken wrote in 1980.
In fact, at that moment the Federal Reserve, under a new chairman, Paul A. Volcker, had begun to raise interest rates sharply, producing back-to-back recessions, in 1980 and 1982, that at last broke the back of inflation, but at the cost of painfully high unemployment.
Paul Winston McCracken was born on Dec. 29, 1915, in Richland, Iowa. His father, a farmer, and his uncle, an economics teacher, encouraged him to study economics at William Penn College (now University) in Oskaloosa, Iowa. He graduated in 1937 and then taught for three years at Berea College in Kentucky, where he met Emily Ruth Siler, a student teacher.
They married in 1942, the same year Mr. McCracken received a master's from Harvard in economics and went to work at the Commerce Department in Washington. From 1943 to 1948 he was a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, while completing a Ph.D., also at Harvard. Then he joined the faculty at what is now the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
Mr. McCracken was a member of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1956 to 1959 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He advocated unsuccessfully for a tax cut to stem a major recession in 1957-58, and later said that the administration's hands-off approach to the economy had helped bring on another recession, in 1960-61, and cost Nixon, Eisenhower's vice president, the 1960 presidential election.
While a professor, Mr. McCracken served two Democratic presidents: John F. Kennedy, as a member of a task force on the domestic economy, and Lyndon B. Johnson, as part of a commission on budgetary accounting.
After winning the 1968 election, Nixon summoned Mr. McCracken to a meeting in New York. Asked to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. McCracken said he should call his wife, but Nixon replied: "I have a press conference in a few minutes, and I don't really have much to tell them. Why don't we just announce it there."
The president described Mr. McCracken as "a centrist, a man who is pragmatic in his economics."
Working for Nixon, Mr. McCracken was confronted with an inflation rate that had been rising since 1965, a byproduct of the deficits that the federal government had amassed during the Vietnam War.
In a speech in August 1969, he said inflation had "caused severe social and economic damage" and "had a socially disintegrating effect through its tendency to escalate group tensions."
He also called for expanding unemployment insurance, reorganizing work force training, exempting the poor from federal income taxes and improving mass transit -- positions that reflected the dominant liberal consensus of the times.
Mr. McCracken represented a middle ground between Johnson's advisers, who had advocated "fine-tuning" tax policies to regulate the economy, and the conservative, laissez-faire approach of the Chicago school, led by Milton Friedman. Mr. McCracken became the architect of a policy of gradualism, which sought to slow inflation by reducing growth slightly, without causing a recession.
He hoped to slow price increases through a combination of a budget surplus, brought about when a Johnson-era tax surcharge was extended, and tighter monetary policy by the Fed, which would rein in speculation by the stock market and wage demands by unions. He warned the government not to "lock the brakes so severely that the economy would be thrown into the ditch."
But prices continued to rise, despite a recession in 1969-70, and by mid-1970 Nixon had directed the council to issue "inflation alerts," singling out what Mr. McCracken later called "egregious cases" of inflation, including a large jump in New York City taxicab fares.
After a momentous weekend in the presidential retreat at Camp David, Nixon decided to impose wage and price controls for the first time since the Korean War. He also unilaterally ended the Bretton Woods system under which the United States had agreed to sell gold to foreign governments for dollars at fixed exchange rates.
The controls were popular and probably a factor in Nixon's overwhelming re-election victory in 1972, Mr. McCracken wrote.
But the controls proved unsustainable, as Mr. McCracken had warned in 1969, when he said they were "far less effective than many are now inclined to assume." They were abandoned by 1974. "Stagflation," a crippling combination of sluggish growth and high inflation, would continue to beleaguer the American economy until the early 1980s.
Mr. McCracken later maintained that gradualism had been working, "but its slow and erratic pace and the political requirements were not compatible." In fact, the price controls probably "exacerbated and extended" the inflation of the 1970s, he wrote in a 1996 essay in Presidential Studies Quarterly.
Mr. McCracken returned to Michigan at the end of 1971. He was the Edmund Ezra Day distinguished university professor of business administration until his retirement in 1986.
He is survived by two daughters, Linda Langer and Paula McCracken. His wife died in 2005.

Full text: There has been plenty to criticize about President Obama's handling of the economy. Yet the overriding story of the past few years is not Mr. Obama's mistakes but the scorched-earth opposition of Republicans, who have done everything they can to get in his way -- and who now, having blocked the president's policies, hope to win the White House by claiming that his policies have failed.
And this week's shocking refusal to implement debt relief by the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency -- a Bush-era holdover the president hasn't been able to replace -- illustrates perfectly what's going on.
Some background: many economists believe that the overhang of excess household debt, a legacy of the bubble years, is the biggest factor holding back economic recovery. Loosely speaking, excess debt has created a situation in which everyone is trying to spend less than their income. Since this is collectively impossible -- my spending is your income, and your spending is my income -- the result is a persistently depressed economy.
How should policy respond? One answer is government spending to support the economy while the private sector repairs its balance sheets; now is not the time for austerity, and cuts in government purchases have been a major economic drag. Another answer is aggressive monetary policy, which is why the Federal Reserve's refusal to act in the face of high unemployment and below-target inflation is a scandal.
But fiscal and monetary policy could, and should, be coupled with debt relief. Reducing the burden on Americans in financial trouble would mean more jobs and improved opportunities for everyone.
Unfortunately, the administration's initial debt relief efforts were ineffectual: Officials imposed so many restrictions to avoid giving relief to "undeserving" debtors that the program went nowhere. More recently, however, the administration has gotten a lot more serious about the issue.
And the obvious place to provide debt relief is on mortgages owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored lenders that were effectively nationalized in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration.
The idea of using Fannie and Freddie has bipartisan support. Indeed, Columbia's Glenn Hubbard, a top Romney adviser, has called on Fannie and Freddie to let homeowners with little or no equity refinance their mortgages, which could sharply cut their interest payments and provide a major boost to the economy. The Obama administration supports this idea and has also proposed a special program of relief for deeply troubled borrowers.
But Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the agency that oversees Fannie and Freddie, refuses to move on refinancing. And, this week, he rejected the administration's relief plan.
Who is Ed DeMarco? He's a civil servant who became acting director of the housing finance agency after the Bush-appointed director resigned in 2009. He is still there, in the fourth year of the Obama administration, because Senate Republicans have blocked attempts to install a permanent director. And he evidently just hates the idea of providing debt relief.
Mr. DeMarco's letter rejecting the relief plan made remarkably weak arguments. He claimed that the plan, while improving his agency's financial position thanks to subsidies from the Treasury Department, would be a net loss to taxpayers -- a conclusion not supported by his own staff's analysis, which showed a net gain. And it's worth pointing out that many private lenders have offered the very kinds of principal reductions Mr. DeMarco rejects -- even though these lenders, unlike the government, have no incentive to take into account the way debt relief would strengthen the economy.
The main point, however, is that Mr. DeMarco seems to misunderstand his job. He's supposed to run his agency and secure its finances -- not make national economic policy. If the Treasury secretary, acting for the president, seeks to subsidize debt relief in a way that actually strengthens the finance agency, the agency's chief has no business blocking that policy. Doing so should be a firing offense.
Can Mr. DeMarco be fired right away? I've been seeing conflicting analyses on that point, although one thing is clear: President Obama, if re-elected, can, and should, replace him through a recess appointment. In fact, he should have done that years ago. As I said, Mr. Obama has made plenty of mistakes.
But the DeMarco affair nonetheless demonstrates, once again, the extent to which U.S. economic policy has been crippled by unyielding, irresponsible political opposition. If our economy is still deeply depressed, much -- and I would say most -- of the blame rests not with Mr. Obama but with the very people seeking to use that depressed economy for political advantage.

Strong Yen Is Dividing Generations in Japan

Abstract: Just before the first tremors of the American housing crisis appeared in 2007, the exchange rate stood at 123 yen to the dollar, as the Bank of Japan kept interest rates low to stimulate growth, and money flowed out of Japan in search of higher returns.

Full text: SHIZUOKA, Japan -- As Japan has ceded dominance in industry after industry that once lifted this nation to economic greatness, there has been plenty of blame to go around. A nuclear disaster that raised energy costs. A lack of entrepreneurship. China's relatively cheap work force.
Increasingly, however, business leaders point to a problem that is at least partly within the government's power to control: a high yen that has made Japanese products, from televisions to memory chips, prohibitively expensive abroad. In an echo of a debate that raged in the United States in the 1980s, the government faces growing criticism for doing almost nothing to rein in the yen, despite alarm that the record-high currency is dealing crippling blows to the country's once all-important export machine.
One big reason, analysts and some politicians say, is simple, if generally left unsaid: A high yen benefits Japan's rapidly expanding elderly population, even if it hurts other parts of the country.
By speeding the flood of cheaper imported products into Japan, the strong yen is contributing to deflation, a broader drop in the prices of goods and services that has helped retirees stretch their pensions and savings. The resulting inaction on the yen, according to a growing number of economists and politicians, reflects a new political reality, with already indecisive leaders loath to upset retirees from the baby boom who make up more than a quarter of the population and tend to vote in high numbers.
"Japan's tolerance of the strong yen and deflation is rooted in a clash of generations," said Yutaka Harada, a professor of political science and economics at Waseda University in Tokyo. "And for now, the seniors are winning."
That victory comes at a high price, however, hastening the hollowing out of Japan's industrial base as companies continue to move abroad, exacerbating the nation's two-decade-long economic stagnation.
On Monday, the government released the final draft of a new economic strategy that it contends will help break what it described as a vicious cycle of a strong yen and deflation. But even though the long-awaited plan identifies the heart of the problem as Japan's aging population and declining export prowess, analysts said the government's modest approach fails to take on the entrenched interests, including the elderly, that have long stood in the way of fundamental change.
Japan can trace the start of the yen's latest rise to the worldwide economic panic that began in the United States and spread to Europe. Just before the first tremors of the American housing crisis appeared in 2007, the exchange rate stood at 123 yen to the dollar, as the Bank of Japan kept interest rates low to stimulate growth, and money flowed out of Japan in search of higher returns.
After the crisis began, raising doubts about the soundness of American and European banks and the ability of governments to stand behind them, the tide of money reversed. Japan, with its huge security cushion of domestic savers, became a haven for investors, driving the yen up.
The yen hit a postwar high of about 76 to the dollar in February and today remains not far from that level, trading Wednesday around 78 to the dollar. It would not be easy to reverse the value of Japan's currency; worldwide macroeconomic trends currently favor a strong yen. Nor are most experts suggesting that consideration of the elderly is the only cause of political paralysis over how to revitalize the economy.
But breaking that stalemate is becoming harder as the elderly's political clout grows. Even some retirees reveling in the benefits of the government's inaction see the long-term quandary.
Shigeru Ono, a retired oil company manager who won a small following blogging on deflation's virtues, can tick off the strong yen's advantages, including lower prices for shirts made in Vietnam and the Chinese flat-screen television he bought recently. He is also clear on the perils.
"The strong yen and deflation have been a boon for us baby boomers," said Mr. Ono, 62, who is living on limited savings and a fixed monthly pension of 130,000 yen, or about $1,660. "But I also know that they cannot be good for my son's generation."
The office of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda has defended the government's handling of the currency, not only by presenting its new plan, but also by pointing out that companies have been offered $6 billion in subsidies to help them move into higher-end products less affected by competition from other Asian exporters.
The Finance Ministry, meanwhile, has taken small steps to drive down the yen by buying a total of $200 billion worth of United States currency during the last two years. But officials said its efforts were never intended to do more than blunt surges driven by speculators.
A more effective step, economists said, would be for the Bank of Japan to essentially turn on the printing presses, encouraging the currency's value to drop. The Federal Reserve has done just that in response to the financial crisis and the economic weakness in the United States, keeping down the dollar's value and helping to foster a strong rise in American exports.
Critics say the central bank's entrenched bureaucrats have resisted doing something similar in recent years out of an outdated fear of rekindling the rampant inflation in the value of real estate and other assets of the 1980s bubble economy. But the bank argues that it makes little sense to intervene without longer-range economic fixes, like deregulating protected domestic industries to spur competition.
As such debates rage on, the supercharged yen bolsters the ability of Japanese to buy foreign goods and to travel abroad, but continues to eat away at the foundations of the economy, hurting companies from mighty Toyota to small ones like Kyouwa, a manufacturer of factory automation equipment in rural Seki, west of the rust-belt city of Shizuoka.
Kyouwa's second-generation owner, Ryuji Usuda, said he finally decided, after he lost an important Japanese customer last year to a Korean rival, that he had no choice but to move his production line to a new factory in Vietnam. He said the plant would allow him to make machines for 30 percent to 40 percent less than in Japan.
"Pretty soon, nothing will be made in Japan anymore," said Mr. Usuda, 40, who noted that many of the Japanese factories he supplied were also moving to Southeast Asia.
Last year, the influx of products from abroad contributed to Japan's first annual trade deficit in 31 years.
Some members of Parliament, including some from the governing party, have become worried enough to begin organizing a sort of political insurgency, proposing ways to fight the strong yen. But they have made little headway in changing the underlying political calculus.
"The strong yen robs from youth, but there is not much awareness here yet of generational inequalities," said Keiichiro Asao of the opposition Your Party.
One way to spur such awareness, critics say, would be to allow national pension payments to drop with falling consumer prices, as the law demands. But the government ignored the law for years rather than upset elderly voters.
Last year, it finally took a baby step, slightly trimming pension payments. The loss of just a couple of dollars a month, though, was enough to start Mr. Ono, the blogger, rethinking. "Now I am starting to realize that deflation can be bad, too," he said.

Full text: RIO DE JANEIRO -- After wrangling over Venezuela's status for years, Mercosur, the South American trading bloc, admitted the country as its fifth full member on Tuesday, reflecting the influence wielded by Brazil, the region's powerhouse.
Venezuela's inclusion in Mercosur, founded in 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and now clearly dominated by Brazil, followed a long diplomatic struggle. While Venezuela was provisionally admitted in 2006, its formal entrance was stalled by resistance in some member nations, notably Paraguay, where the Senate refused to ratify Venezuela's admission.
But Brazil, drawing support from Argentina and Uruguay, overrode those objections by having Paraguay suspended from membership in Mercosur after the ouster of President Fernando Lugo in June. Brazil justified the suspension by citing concerns about the impact of Mr. Lugo's removal on Paraguay's democratic institutions. Once Paraguay was sidelined, the other three nations moved swiftly to formalize Venezuela's membership.
The three nations have been working for some time to forge closer economic ties to oil-rich Venezuela. Its president, Hugo Chavez, who is campaigning for re-election, leapt at the opportunity to fully join Mercosur, describing the outmaneuvering of the Paraguayan Senate as a "failure of U.S. foreign policy."
Mr. Chavez, who appeared well rested in Brasilia, his first international trip since receiving treatment for cancer in Cuba in March, said, "The hand of U.S. diplomacy was behind that authoritarian Paraguayan enclave."
He was an hour late in arriving at the accession ceremony, and he skirted protocol by insisting on walking up the ramp to the palace of Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff, rather than taking an elevator. Her aides acquiesced.
The benefits to Brazil of Venezuela's Mercosur membership were made clear almost immediately when Mr. Chavez signed an agreement to buy as many as 20 passenger jets from Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, in a deal potentially worth $900 million.
Mercosur has been grappling with internal disputes over protectionist measures, largely originating in Argentina, and the rise of another regional bloc, the Pacific Alliance, whose four members -- Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru -- have enjoyed fast economic growth.
Mercosur's four original members already have a trade surplus of $4.8 billion with Venezuela, which relies heavily on imports of food and other goods. Brazilian companies have done especially well there since relations warmed between Mr. Chavez and Ms. Rousseff's predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
For Brazil, Venezuela holds longer-term strategic importance, in the form of its oil reserves, estimated to be among the world's largest. Venezuela is known for galloping inflation, food shortages and unpredictable treatment of foreign investors, but its oil revenues buoy one of Latin America's largest economies.
Still, the way Brazil maneuvered Venezuela into Mercosur makes some critics of Mr. Chavez apprehensive. They say Brazil is ignoring reports of Mr. Chavez's concentration of power and the erosion of judicial independence in Venezuela while it expresses concern over Paraguayan democracy.
"This sets a terrible example for the region," said Elsa Cardozo, a professor of political science at Central University in Venezuela. "It reveals Mercosur's political weakness at a time of precarious protection of democratic rights in Venezuela."

Full text: IT is not often that a stroke of a pen can quickly undo the ravages of nature, but federal regulators now have an opportunity to do just that. Americans' food budgets will be hit hard by the ongoing Midwestern drought, the worst since 1956. Food bills will rise and many farmers will go bust.
An act of God, right? Well, the drought itself may be, but a human remedy for some of the fallout is at hand -- if only the federal authorities would act. By suspending renewable-fuel standards that were unwise from the start, the Environmental Protection Agency could divert vast amounts of corn from inefficient ethanol production back into the food chain, where market forces and common sense dictate it should go.
The drought has now parched about 60 percent of the contiguous 48 states. As a result, global food prices are rising steeply. Corn futures prices on the Chicago exchange have risen about 60 percent since mid-June, hitting record levels, and other grains such as wheat and soybeans are also sharply higher. Livestock and dairy product prices will inevitably follow.
More than one-third of our corn crop is used to feed livestock. Another 13 percent is exported, much of it to feed livestock as well. Another 40 percent is used to produce ethanol. The remainder goes toward food and beverage production.
Previous droughts in the Midwest (most recently in 1988) also resulted in higher food prices, but misguided energy policies are magnifying the effects of the current one. Federal renewable-fuel standards require the blending of 13.2 billion gallons of corn ethanol with gasoline this year. This will require 4.7 billion bushels of corn, 40 percent of this year's crop.
Other countries seem to have a better grasp of market forces and common sense. Brazil, another large ethanol producer, uses sugar instead of corn to make ethanol. It has flexible policies that allow the market to determine whether sugar should be sold on the sugar market or be converted to fuel. Our government could learn from the Brazilian approach and direct the E.P.A. to waive a portion of the renewable-fuel standards, thereby directing corn back to the marketplace. Under the law, the E.P.A. would first have to determine that the program was causing economic harm. That's a no-brainer, given the effects of sharply higher grain prices that are already rippling through the economy.
The price of corn is a critical variable in the world food equation, and food markets are on edge because American corn supplies are plummeting. The combination of the drought and American ethanol policy will lead in many parts of the world to widespread inflation, more hunger, less food security, slower economic growth and political instability, especially in poor countries.
If the E.P.A. were to waive the rules for this year and next, the ethanol industry and corn farmers, who have experienced a years-long windfall, would lose out. Wheat and soybean farmers would also lose, because the prices of those crops have also been driven up: corn competes with soybeans for acreage and is substituted for wheat in some feed rations.
Any defense of the ethanol policy rests on fallacies, primarily these: that ethanol produced from corn makes the United States less dependent on fossil fuels; that ethanol lowers the price of gasoline; that an increase in the percentage of ethanol blended into gasoline increases the overall supply of gasoline; and that ethanol is environmentally friendly and lowers global carbon dioxide emissions.
The ethanol lobby promotes these claims, and many politicians seem intoxicated by them. Corn is indeed a renewable resource, but it has a far lower yield relative to the energy used to produce it than either biodiesel (such as soybean oil) or ethanol from other plants. Ethanol yields about 30 percent less energy per gallon than gasoline, so mileage drops off significantly. Finally, adding ethanol actually raises the price of blended fuel because it is more expensive to transport and handle than gasoline.
As the summer drags on, the drought is only worsening. Last week the International Grains Council lowered its estimate of this year's American corn harvest to 11.8 billion bushels from 13.8 billion. Reducing the renewable-fuel standard by a mere 20 percent -- equivalent to about a billion bushels of corn -- would offset nearly half of the expected crop loss due to the drought.
All it would take is the stroke of a pen -- and, of course, the savvy and the will to do the right thing.

Some at Fed Are Urging Pre-emptive Stimulus

Abstract: [...]officials, including the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Some Federal Reserve officials are reviving an idea that rose and fell with Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, as they seek to persuade colleagues to take new action to stimulate growth.
Central bankers generally set policy based on their judgment about the most likely path for the nation's economy. But Mr. Greenspan argued that the Fed sometimes should do more than its forecast suggested, buttressing the economy against large, potential risks. He described such moves as "taking out insurance."
On the eve of the Fed's policy-making committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, members who favor additional action argued that the likely path of the economy was itself sufficient reason for action. The committee predicted in June that without new measures unemployment would fall slightly, if at all, in the second half of the year.
But officials, including the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have sought to reinforce the case for action by arguing that the Fed also should seek to offset the looming risk that a European turndown will set off a global financial crisis, or that a failure to dismantle the potential year-end fiscal cliff of government spending cuts and tax increases will tip the economy back into recession.
"There are a number of significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and hence it may well be appropriate to insure against adverse shocks that could push the economy into territory where a self-reinforcing downward spiral of economic weakness would be difficult to arrest," Ms. Yellen said in a June speech.
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor who, like Ms. Yellen, served under Mr. Greenspan, said that the return of "insurance" as a factor in the Fed's decision-making was a necessary response to the current environment.
"There are many people who look at that idea and feel that this is what was done under Greenspan, and maybe this was one of the factors that led to excessive speculation," said Mr. Meyer, now senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm based in St. Louis. "But when the downside risks have grown as large as they have become, I think you have to consider it."
Proponents of new action continue to face resistance from officials who remain uncertain that the economy has lost momentum and would prefer to wait at least until the Fed's next meeting in September. Ms. Yellen herself is not among the officials who have said publicly that they are convinced the Fed should act now.
The hesitation also reflects widespread concern about the waning potency of the Fed's remaining tools, and about the cost of the most powerful measure, an expansion of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed also is under significant but counterbalancing political pressure in the midst of a presidential election. Republicans oppose additional action, which they describe as ineffective and likely to increase inflation, while Democrats want the Fed to do more.
Several leading analysts of the central bank predict that the Fed is most likely to take a relatively modest step on Wednesday, to show its concern while it awaits more economic data. The most likely action, they said, is an extension of the Fed's forecast that interest rates will remain near zero at least until late 2014.
Sven Jari Stehn, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients on Monday that the Fed would extend that forecast to mid-2015. That would be more than a year beyond the term of the Fed's current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
Mr. Greenspan described his approach to monetary policy in a 2004 speech in which he said that central banks are in the business of risk management, and that sometimes requires "insurance against especially adverse outcomes."
He gave as an example the Fed's response when Russia defaulted on its debts in 1998. The American economy was expanding, and Fed officials predicted that it would continue to do so. Some had been pushing Mr. Greenspan to tighten monetary policy. He did the opposite.
"We eased policy because we were concerned about the low-probability risk that the default might trigger events that would severely disrupt domestic and international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S. economy," Mr. Greenspan said then. "The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario."
Mr. Greenspan's impressionistic approach to monetary policy was widely held in awe during his time atop the Fed, mostly because it seemed to be working. But his ideas lost considerable luster when the economy collapsed, and some concluded that he had suppressed and exacerbated the underlying problems.
Mr. Bernanke, in contrast to his predecessor, has pushed the Fed in the direction of transparent and predictable decision-making, which he says he regards as significantly increasing the Fed's power by better controlling market expectations.
Some officials and economists also look askance at the idea of insurance because of the cost. It implies that inflation will be somewhat faster in the future.
And some see little reason to talk about insurance now.
Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton who was a Fed governor under Mr. Greenspan, said that the central bank should incorporate an assessment of less-likely risks into its decision-making.
But he added that there was little need for such nuances now.
"The Fed shouldn't really be worrying about the finer points of risk management," he said. "It should be hellbent on getting the unemployment rate down."

Full text: Going into the weekend, the research firm NRG told film studios that about 20 percent of moviegoers remained hesitant to go to the movies following the July 20 mass shooting in Colorado during "The Dark Knight Rises." Studios also worried about competition from the London Olympics and poor weather in parts of the country.
Something sure dragged down box office results: North American theaters sold about $135 million in tickets over the weekend, a 25 percent decline from the same period last year, according to studio distribution executives. "The Dark Knight Rises" (Warner Brothers) was No. 1, taking in an estimated $64 million -- a 60 percent drop from last weekend, when the movie benefited from strong advance ticket sales. "The Dark Knight Rises" has now taken in about $289.1 million in the United States and Canada, or 14 percent less than its franchise predecessor grossed over the same period in 2008, after adjusting for inflation.
"Ice Age: Continental Drift" (20th Century Fox) was second for the weekend, selling about $13.3 million in tickets, for a three-week total of $114.8 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. "The Watch," a Fox ensemble comedy, was third, taking in about $13 million. "The Watch," which cost $68 million to make, experienced publicity setbacks after the February shooting of a Florida teenager by a community watch participant. "Step Up Revolution" (Lionsgate) was fourth, taking in an estimated $11.8 million -- the lowest opening-weekend gross in the history of this four-film series; "Revolution" cost about $33 million to make. "Ted" (Universal) managed $7.4 million in ticket sales, enough for fifth place and a five-week total of about $193.6 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: Last week Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, declared that his institution "is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro" -- and markets celebrated. In particular, interest rates on Spanish bonds fell sharply, and stock markets soared everywhere.
But will the euro really be saved? That remains very much in doubt.
First of all, Europe's single currency is a deeply flawed construction. And Mr. Draghi, to his credit, actually acknowledged that. "The euro is like a bumblebee," he declared. "This is a mystery of nature because it shouldn't fly but instead it does. So the euro was a bumblebee that flew very well for several years." But now it has stopped flying. What can be done? The answer, he suggested, is "to graduate to a real bee."
Never mind the dubious biology, we get the point. In the long run, the euro will be workable only if the European Union becomes much more like a unified country.
Consider, for example, the comparison between Spain and Florida. Both had huge housing bubbles followed by dramatic crashes. But Spain is in crisis in a way Florida isn't. Why? Because when the slump hit, Florida could count on Washington to keep paying for Social Security and Medicare, to guarantee the solvency of its banks, to provide emergency aid to its unemployed, and more. Spain had no such safety net, and in the long run, that has to be fixed.
But the creation of a United States of Europe won't happen soon, if ever, while the crisis of the euro is now. So what can be done to save the currency?
Well, why was the bumblebee able to fly for a while? Why did the euro seem to work for its first eight or so years? Because the structure's flaws were papered over by a boom in southern Europe. The creation of the euro convinced investors that it was safe to lend to countries like Greece and Spain that had previously been considered risky, so money poured into these countries -- mainly, by the way, to finance private rather than public borrowing, with Greece the exception.
And for a while everyone was happy. In southern Europe, huge housing bubbles led to a surge in construction employment, even as manufacturing became increasingly uncompetitive. Meanwhile, the German economy, which had been languishing, perked up thanks to rapidly rising exports to those bubble economies in the south. The euro, it seemed, was working.
Then the bubbles burst. The construction jobs vanished, and unemployment in the south soared; it's now well above 20 percent in both Spain and Greece. At the same time, revenues plunged; for the most part, big budget deficits are a result, not a cause, of the crisis. Nonetheless, investors took flight, driving up borrowing costs. In an attempt to soothe the financial markets, the afflicted countries imposed harsh austerity measures that deepened their slumps. And the euro as a whole is looking dangerously shaky.
What could turn this dangerous situation around? The answer is fairly clear: policy makers would have to (a) do something to bring southern Europe's borrowing costs down and (b) give Europe's debtors the same kind of opportunity to export their way out of trouble that Germany received during the good years -- that is, create a boom in Germany that mirrors the boom in southern Europe between 1999 and 2007. (And yes, that would mean a temporary rise in German inflation.) The trouble is that Europe's policy makers seem reluctant to do (a) and completely unwilling to do (b).
In his remarks, Mr. Draghi -- who I suspect understands all of this -- basically floated the idea of having the central bank buy lots of southern European bonds to bring those borrowing costs down. But over the next two days German officials appeared to throw cold water on that idea. In principle, Mr. Draghi could just overrule German objections, but would he really be willing to do that?
And bond purchases are the easy part. The euro can't be saved unless Germany is also willing to accept substantially higher inflation over the next few years -- and so far I have seen no sign that German officials are even willing to discuss this issue, let alone accept what's necessary. Instead, they're still insisting, despite failure after failure -- remember when Ireland was supposedly on the road to rapid recovery? -- that everything will be fine if debtors just stick to their austerity programs.
So could the euro be saved? Yes, probably. Should it be saved? Yes, even though its creation now looks like a huge mistake. For failure of the euro wouldn't just cause economic disruption; it would be a giant blow to the wider European project, which has brought peace and democracy to a continent with a tragic history.
But will it actually be saved? Despite Mr. Draghi's show of determination, that is, as I said, very much in doubt.

Abstract: By 2030, when the last of us boomers have surged onto the Social Security rolls, entitlements will consume 61 cents of every federal dollar, starving our already neglected investment and leaving us, in the words of the study, with "a less-skilled work force, lower rates of job creation, and an infrastructure unfit for a 21st-century economy." Some of the entitlement bloat comes from the addition of new programs -- notably the prescription drug benefit espoused by our second boomer president, George W. Bush, and the Affordable Care Act, though at least that law sets in motion offsetting measures aimed at containing the soaring cost of health care.\n

Full text: IF you were born before 1946 or after 1964, you are free to go. Kindly close the door on your way out. I need a private moment with my fellow baby boomers.
So. I imagine you're all feeling a little unappreciated these days. We seem to have entered one of our periodic seasons of boomer-bashing. In rapid Op-Ed succession, we children of the postwar demographic bulge have been blamed for turning religion into an indulgent free-for-all, for giving elites a bad name and for making greed respectable, or at least acceptable. That's just this month, and just on this page. And it's not only conservatives beating us with the Woodstock whip. Kurt Andersen, a confessed liberal and one of our more prolific cultural omnivores, started the latest thumping July 4 with an argument that amoral self-gratification is just the flip side of social liberation: "Thanks to the '60s, we are all shamelessly selfish."
The notion that our generation has been spoiled rotten is not a terribly new thought. A dozen years ago Paul Begala (of Bill Clinton and CNN fame) published in Esquire the classic of boomer-loathing, "The Worst Generation." "The Baby Boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history," he declared. It's a sturdy genre. Perhaps while Googling yourself you have come across the blog Boomer Deathwatch ("Because one day, they'll all be dead"), a checklist of famous boomers who hit their actuarial sell-by dates. Even Barack Obama, who styles himself post-boomer though he was born in 1961, complained in "The Audacity of Hope" that today's hyperpolarized political discourse began with the "psychodrama of the baby boom generation."
Yes, yes, this criticism is glib. We didn't start the war in Vietnam, but members of our generation fought both in it and against it, demonstrating some of the spirit of sacrifice we are not famous for. Our ranks include the outsourcers of Bain and the wizards of the Wall Street casino, but also the entrepreneurial genius of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. The Bill Clinton of Monicagate was the first boomer president, but so was the Bill Clinton of relative peace and prosperity. Our record-buying dollars gave the world disco -- so sorry about that -- but also Motown and Springsteen. I'd say the argument will continue forever if that didn't sound like such an all-about-us, boomer thing to say.
But even though the caricature is way too easy, it has stuck, and we all know that it contains more than a nugget of truth. We are an entitled bunch.
This brings me to a soon-to-be released study by the incorrigible pragmatists at Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank. The study takes a familiar refrain and presents it with a graphic wallop. Though it was intended as a wake-up call, not an indictment of a generation, it can be read as both.
The authors examined two categories of federal spending over the past 50 years, representing two of government's fundamental missions. One was "investments," which includes maintaining our national infrastructure, keeping our military equipped, helping assure that our work force is educated to a high standard, and underwriting the kind of basic scientific research that is too risky or long-term to attract private money. The report calls this the legacy of President Kennedy's New Frontier, though the largest infrastructure project in our history, the interstate highway system, was Eisenhower's baby, a reminder of the days when Republicans still believed in that stuff. The other category was "entitlements," a catchall word for the safety-net programs that provide a measure of economic stability for the aging and poor: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.
You will not be surprised to hear that the red line tracking entitlements goes up while the blue line reflecting investments goes down. What is alarming is the trajectory.
In 1962, we were laying down the foundations of prosperity. About 32 cents of every federal dollar, excluding interest payments, was spent on investments, only 14 percent on entitlements. In the mid-70s the lines crossed. Today we spend less than 15 cents on investment and 46 cents on entitlements. And it gets worse. By 2030, when the last of us boomers have surged onto the Social Security rolls, entitlements will consume 61 cents of every federal dollar, starving our already neglected investment and leaving us, in the words of the study, with "a less-skilled work force, lower rates of job creation, and an infrastructure unfit for a 21st-century economy."
Some of the entitlement bloat comes from the addition of new programs -- notably the prescription drug benefit espoused by our second boomer president, George W. Bush, and the Affordable Care Act, though at least that law sets in motion offsetting measures aimed at containing the soaring cost of health care. Some of the growth is built into formulas that increase benefits faster than inflation or G.D.P. And a lot of it is us: boomers, aging into Social Security and Medicare. "We've reached the point where our working-age population over the next 30 years grows by one-fifth, and our elderly population grows 100 percent," said Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way.
Indignant readers are already revving up to tell me that Social Security and Medicare are sacred promises, that cutting them would be stone-hearted Republicanism. A.A.R.P., the lobby for people we used to call senior citizens until we realized that meant us, got hammered by the left earlier this year when its C.E.O. dared to convene a meeting of Washington insiders to even discuss the subject. No wonder A.A.R.P. shies away from supporting any entitlement reform.
But the traditional liberal alternatives -- raise taxes on the well-to-do, cut military spending -- are not nearly enough by themselves. The arithmetic simply doesn't work, unless we face the fact that entitlements are a bargain we can't afford to keep, not in full.
So the question is not whether entitlements have to be brought under control, but how. The Republican plan espoused by Mitt Romney and his fiscal lodestar Paul Ryan would cut the cost of entitlements largely by moving toward privatization: personal investment accounts for Social Security, vouchers for Medicare. And it's not at all clear the Republicans would assign any of the savings to investing in our future.
At least the Republicans have a plan. The Democrats generally recoil from the subject of entitlements. Centrists like those at Third Way and the bipartisan authors of the Simpson-Bowles report endorse a menu of incremental cuts and reforms that would bring down costs without hitting the needy or snatching away the security blanket from those nearing retirement. They include gradually raising the retirement age to compensate for the fact that we now live, on average, 14 years longer than when F.D.R. signed Social Security into law. They include obliging those of us who can really afford it to pay a larger share. They also include technical fixes like aligning the automatic cost-of-living formula with reality. To curtail the raging inflation of health costs, the government could better use its market clout to hasten electronic record-keeping, replace the fee-for-service model, reform medical malpractice laws and promote living wills. (A quarter of health care spending comes in the last year of life.) But you won't hear much of that on the campaign trail.
FELLOW boomers, we have done more than our share to make this mess. It's not our fault that there are a lot of us, but we have resisted any move to fix the system. We should make a sensible reform of entitlements our generation's cause. We should stiffen the spines of our politicians, and push lobby groups like A.A.R.P. to climb out of the bunker and lead. (And, by the way, we should resist the boomer temptation to take every cent of the reform from the pockets of our kids.) We should keep the heat on Congress and the president to double down on the cost-saving provisions in Obamacare.
We may not be the greatest generation, but we are the largest -- and we vote. We throw our weight around. What if we threw some of it in the right direction?

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
The United States economy has lost the momentum it appeared to be building earlier this year, as the latest government statistics showed that it expanded by a mere 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
The mired recovery makes the United States more vulnerable to trouble in Europe and, at home, the potential expiration of several tax breaks and other buoyant measures at the end of the year, known as the fiscal cliff. It also illustrates the election-season challenge to President Obama, who must sell his economic record to voters as the recovery slows.
Growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, lagged as consumers curbed new spending and businesses held back. Several bright spots in the first three months of the year, including auto production, computer sales and large purchases like appliances and televisions, dimmed or faded away altogether in the second quarter, and government at all levels continued to cut spending. Growth was not strong enough to drive down the unemployment rate, which has stalled above 8 percent in recent months.
The lackluster figure immediately gave Mr. Obama's opponents the opportunity to question the federal government's response to the financial crisis, though a vast majority of economists agree that the stimulus and the bank bailouts saved jobs. House Speaker John Boehner said the G.D.P. report, released Friday by the Commerce Department, showed "the need to stop all of the looming tax hikes." The report also spurred calls from liberals for the government to do more.
The Federal Reserve, which has lowered its forecasts in recent weeks, is watching the slowdown carefully as it considers further stimulus, though several analysts said Friday that they doubted that new action from the Fed could have much effect.
"Given where interest rates are, I think it should be evident that we're in one of those spots where in order to lift growth, government needs to spend money," said Steve Blitz, the chief economist at ITG Investment Research.
The economy is following a pattern established over several years now -- hopes raised by modest acceleration that later fizzles out -- that underscores the notion that rebounds after financial busts take their own excruciating time.
This year, some of the weakening was to be expected after a spurt of activity during an unseasonably warm winter. A mild uptick is expected in the second half of the year, driven in part by lower gas prices.
But improvement strong enough to provide real traction or lower the jobless rate remains out of reach. While the economy has not entered a downward spiral in which weakness feeds on itself, wrote Jim O'Sullivan, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, an analysis firm, "there does not appear to be much basis for expecting a significant pickup any time soon."
The government also provided on Friday a revised figure for first-quarter G.D.P., saying the economy then grew by a 2 percent annual rate. The previous estimate was 1.9 percent.
A slowdown in household spending is still hampering economic growth. Consumers increased their savings rate, a sign of increased uncertainty about the future. Governments also continued to cut spending. Exports accelerated in the second quarter despite more recent signs of diminishing demand, but the gain was canceled out by a larger increase in imports, which count against the gross domestic product. Economists expect exports to shrink as the dollar rises against other currencies, making American goods less competitive.
The housing sector, which has gone from a drag on the economy to a positive, continued to grow, posting a 9.7 percent gain -- though again, that is less than half its rate of growth in the first quarter.
Uncertainty cast a pall, coming from both the domestic front, with a presidential race and the fate of numerous federal policies in question, and from overseas, with companies like Ford reporting a decline in profit this week because of the slowdown in Europe, despite a healthy showing in North America.
"You can't blame all of it on Europe -- we have our own problems yet," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR Inc., a financial consulting firm. "When you have a credit bubble or asset bubble that's popped, the recovery process from that is just really long and really painful."
Inflation, a measure watched closely by the Federal Reserve as it determines whether to take further action, slowed as well, with consumer prices growing only 0.7 percent compared with 2.5 percent in the first quarter.
At Marble King, a small manufacturer in West Virginia that supplies retail distributors and manufacturers, an increase in orders in the first few months of the year leveled off in the second quarter, said Beri Fox, the owner and chief executive. "I have not seen continued growth, but it didn't go back down," Ms. Fox said. "That doesn't mean that in the fall orders, we aren't going to see a decline because they may be overstocked from what they ordered over the summer."
The Commerce Department also released updated estimates of economic activity for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Those figures showed that the recession was less severe than it seemed in the most recent reports, though more pronounced than in initial readings. As a consequence, that the pace of recovery also appears somewhat slower.
The new estimates show that economic activity fell by 3.1 percent in 2009 and then rose by 2.4 percent in 2010. Last summer, the government reported that activity fell by 3.5 percent in 2009 before rising 3 percent in 2010. The estimated pace of growth in 2011, 1.8 percent, remained basically unchanged. It was previously reported as 1.7 percent.
The revisions, part of an annual process, reflect the imprecise nature of the agency's work. Its initial estimates are derived from a mix of comprehensive data, samples and educated guesswork, and are refined over time. In this case, officials said they had significantly underestimated spending by state and local governments in 2009, and overestimated corporate profits and purchases in 2010.
The agency now estimates average annual growth of 0.3 percent over the three-year period, rather than 0.4 percent.
But the new numbers may modify public perception of two crucial economic trends. It appears that corporations rebounded more slowly from the recession than previously believed. And the more complete data used in the new estimates show that state and local governments increased spending in 2009 before cutting back in the next two years. Officials said they did not have enough information to explain the previously unreported increase, except to say the money was not spent on personnel or on infrastructure projects, the two categories that might have benefited most directly from the federal government's stimulus programs.
Alan Krueger, the president's top economic adviser, wrote in a White House blog post that the increase was "consistent with the Recovery Act cushioning the effect of the recession and helping to launch the recovery."

Online Correction: July 27, 2012, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article, as well as an accompanying summary and an e-mail alert, misstated the second-quarter trend in exports. They grew at a faster rate than in the first quarter; they did not flatten.

Full text: For years, allegedly serious people have been issuing dire warnings about the consequences of large budget deficits -- deficits that are overwhelmingly the result of our ongoing economic crisis. In May 2009, Niall Ferguson of Harvard declared that the "tidal wave of debt issuance" would cause U.S. interest rates to soar. In March 2011, Erskine Bowles, the co-chairman of President Obama's ill-fated deficit commission, warned that unless action was taken on the deficit soon, "the markets will devastate us," probably within two years. And so on.
Well, I guess Mr. Bowles has a few months left. But a funny thing happened on the way to the predicted fiscal crisis: instead of soaring, U.S. borrowing costs have fallen to their lowest level in the nation's history. And it's not just America. At this point, every advanced country that borrows in its own currency is able to borrow very cheaply.
The failure of deficits to produce the predicted rise in interest rates is telling us something important about the nature of our economic troubles (and the wisdom, or lack thereof, of the self-appointed guardians of our fiscal virtue). Before I get there, however, let's talk about those low, low borrowing costs -- so low that, in some cases, investors are actually paying governments to hold their money.
For the most part, this is happening with "inflation-protected securities" -- bonds whose future repayments are linked to consumer prices so that investors need not fear that their investment will be eroded by inflation. Even with this protection, investors used to demand substantial additional payment. Before the crisis, U.S. 10-year inflation-protected bonds generally paid around 2 percent. Recently, however, the rate on those bonds has been minus-0.6 percent. Investors are willing to pay more to buy these bonds than the amount, adjusted for inflation, that the government will eventually pay in interest and principal.
So investors are, in a sense, offering governments free money for the next 10 years; in fact, they're willing to pay governments a modest fee for keeping their wealth safe.
Now, those with a vested interest in the fiscal crisis story have made various attempts to explain away the failure of that crisis to materialize. One favorite is the claim that the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates artificially low by buying government bonds. But that theory was put to the test last summer when the Fed temporarily suspended bond purchases. Many people -- including Bill Gross of the giant bond fund Pimco -- predicted a rate spike. Nothing happened.
Oh, and pay no attention to the warnings that any day now we'll turn into Greece, Greece I tell you. Countries like Greece, and for that matter Spain, are suffering from their ill-advised decision to give up their own currencies for the euro, which has left them vulnerable in a way that America just isn't.
So what is going on? The main answer is that this is what happens when you have a "deleveraging shock," in which everyone is trying to pay down debt at the same time. Household borrowing has plunged; businesses are sitting on cash because there's no reason to expand capacity when the sales aren't there; and the result is that investors are all dressed up with nowhere to go, or rather no place to put their money. So they're buying government debt, even at very low returns, for lack of alternatives. Moreover, by making money available so cheaply, they are in effect begging governments to issue more debt.
And governments should be granting their wish, not obsessing over short-term deficits.
Obligatory caveat: yes, we have a long-run budget problem, and we should be taking steps to address that problem, mainly by reining in health care costs. But it's simply crazy to be laying off schoolteachers and canceling infrastructure projects at a time when investors are offering zero- or negative-interest financing.
You don't even have to make a Keynesian argument about jobs to see that. All you have to do is note that when money is cheap, that's a good time to invest. And both education and infrastructure are investments in America's future; we'll eventually pay a large and completely gratuitous price for the way they're being savaged.
That said, you should be a Keynesian, too. The experience of the past few years -- above all, the spectacular failure of austerity policies in Europe -- has been a dramatic demonstration of Keynes's basic point: slashing spending in a depressed economy depresses that economy further.
So it's time to stop paying attention to the alleged wise men who hijacked our policy discussion and made the deficit the center of conversation. They've been wrong about everything -- and these days even the financial markets are telling us that we should be focused on jobs and growth.

Abstract: Besides spiking bond rates, doubts are building about Greece's ability to meet its bailout conditions, with Willem Buiter, a Citigroup economist, saying there is a 90 percent probability that Greece will leave the euro zone in the next 12 to 18 months.

Full text: The head of the European Central Bank said on Thursday that policy makers would do "whatever it takes" to save the euro zone, buoying global financial markets.
But analysts were quick to caution that the euphoria could once again prove short-lived in Europe's long-running debt crisis, which has escalated in recent weeks on fears that Greece could soon be forced out of the common currency zone and that Spain and Italy might follow.
The comment by Mario Draghi, the bank's president, raised hopes that the central bank was becoming more willing to throw its weight around in bond markets, buying huge quantities of debt to keep borrowing costs for Spain and Italy from rising so high that they threaten the common currency.
"Within our mandate, the E.C.B. is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough," Mr. Draghi said, setting expectations for bold moves at the central bank's meeting next week.
The interest rates on Italian and Spanish bonds dropped sharply. Major stock markets in the United States rose more than 1.4 percent and in Europe jumped more than 4 percent.
Also on Thursday, a European official said that Greece could count on the continued support of the European Union as long as it met neglected commitments to its international creditors under its latest bailout.
In the three years that the euro zone crisis has festered, there have been numerous occasions when European officials unveiled policy responses and market optimism soon evaporated. Earlier this year, Mr. Draghi himself said that the worst of the crisis seemed to be over, after the central bank flooded banks with low-cost loans. But the mood soon turned sour again.
Mr. Draghi did not specify the actions that policy makers might take, but the Spanish government and the International Monetary Fund have all but begged the European Central Bank to resume buying bonds as a way to clamp down on the turmoil plaguing financial markets.
Traders have increasingly pinned their hopes on intervention by the bank and the Federal Reserve as the economic outlook in both the United States and Europe has weakened. Past asset-buying programs by central banks, like the European Central Bank's decision to buy Spanish and Italian bonds last fall, have helped stop precipitous market declines. But the bank has not bought bonds in the troubled countries for months.
Economists cautioned that Mr. Draghi was probably still reluctant to effectively begin financing European governments because of the uproar it would cause in Germany, where public opinion is firmly against bailing out countries seen as irresponsible.
"I have no doubt that the E.C.B. will save the euro area from collapse," said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. "The problem is that they are operating in a difficult political environment with general German hostility. They can only move at the tipping point or close to the tipping point."
Besides spiking bond rates, doubts are building about Greece's ability to meet its bailout conditions, with Willem Buiter, a Citigroup economist, saying there is a 90 percent probability that Greece will leave the euro zone in the next 12 to 18 months.
In Athens, Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, insisted that Greece would not be isolated if it pushed through stalled economic reforms demanded by its foreign creditors -- the commission, E.C.B. and International Monetary Fund. "The key word is deliver, deliver, deliver," Mr. Barroso said after talks with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.
He called for greater solidarity across the bloc. "All in the euro zone must come together to support our currency. Some have not realized that we are in the same boat," Mr. Barroso said, adding: "My message to Greeks is that they are not alone. We will stand by them."
Strategists are worried that each new instance of intervention seems to provide less relief than the last. This is because central banks have not been successful in addressing the underlying problems in Europe's weaker economies, which are growing worse with each passing month.
In recent days Spain's long-term borrowing costs had risen to nearly 7.7 percent, a level that would eventually make it impossible for the country to finance itself and would set off a chain of events that could destroy the common currency, with grave consequences for the global economy. The yield, or interest rate that bond buyers demand, plunged to 6.8 percent for Spanish 10-year bonds on Thursday, and dropped to 6 percent for Italy. That may have been his intent.
Ken Wattret, an analyst at the French bank BNP Paribas, said in a note that Mr. Draghi's comments might be "merely a threat to act, designed to put some two-way risk back into markets."
But traders will eventually try to test the central bank's resolve. So strong words by Mr. Draghi will probably be effective over the long term only if the bank officially declares that it will not tolerate market interest rates on European government debt above specified levels, and is willing to spend as much as needed to cap them.
The Swiss National Bank has used similar declarations to keep its currency from appreciating too much. But such a promise would require a willingness by the E.C.B. to effectively print money, a strategy that would outrage many Germans.
"The more credible the commitment, the less likely the market will test it," Jacques Cailloux, an economist at Nomura, said in a note Thursday. But he added, "This is easier said than done."
Vocal dissent from someone like Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank and an influential member of the European Central Bank governing council, might convey the impression that policy makers are divided and undercut their credibility. Mr. Weidmann has said many times that he believes large purchases of government bonds would violate a ban on using the bank to finance governments.
In response, Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the European Central Bank would stay within its mandate, which requires the bank to defend price stability above all else. But he added that if government borrowing costs interfered with the central bank's ability to influence interest rates, its main tool for controlling inflation, "they come within our mandate."
Mr. Draghi has noted in recent weeks that the bank's mandate also requires it to fight deflation, a ruinous decline in prices, as well as inflation. That is seen as also opening the door to huge bond purchases.
The bank has intervened sporadically in government bond markets since 2010 but has not bought any government bonds since March and only relatively modest amounts since Mr. Draghi took office in November.
Speculation that the European Central Bank would resume its purchases intensified after it cut its benchmark interest rate earlier this month to a record low of 0.75 percent. The cut does not appear to have lowered borrowing costs for business and consumers in countries like Italy and Spain that need it most. As a result, analysts say, the bank will need to reach for other monetary policy tools to restore the flow of credit, and ultimately to preserve the common currency.
The bank's governing council holds its monthly monetary policy meeting next Thursday.
Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group who covers Europe, said that Mr. Draghi would probably agree to large bond purchases only if several conditions were met. These would include guarantees from euro zone members that they would cover any losses and measures to ensure that Spain and Italy continue efforts to make their economies function more efficiently.
Mr. Rahman agreed that Mr. Draghi would ultimately do what it took to save the euro, partly because its failure would mean the end of the European Central Bank as an organization. "If the euro disintegrates, they are all out of work," Mr. Rahman said in an e-mail. "So, there is a preservation instinct at play here also."
In the markets, taking more risk was at play on Thursday for the first time in days. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 211.88 points, or 1.67 percent, to 12,887.93. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 22.13 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,360.02. The Nasdaq composite index rose 39.01 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,893.25.
In Europe, the Spanish Ibex 35 index soared 6.1 percent and the Italian FTSE MIB index jumped 5.6 percent. The CAC 40 in France gained 4.1 percent.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 102 27/32, while its yield rose to 1.44 percent, from 1.40 percent late Wednesday.

Abstract: Highways in Texas, nuclear power plants in Illinois, runways and subway rails in Washington and the concrete, steel and sophisticated engineering that undergird the nation's infrastructure are being taxed to worrisome degrees by heat, drought and vicious storms.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Scorching heat and the worst drought in nearly a half-century are threatening to send food prices up, spooking consumers and leading to worries about global food costs.
On Wednesday, the government said it expected the record-breaking weather to drive up the price for groceries next year, including milk, beef, chicken and pork. The drought is now affecting 88 percent of the corn crop, a staple of processed foods and animal feed as well as the nation's leading farm export.
The government's forecast, based on a consumer price index for food, estimated that prices would rise 4 to 5 percent for beef next year with slightly lower increases for pork, eggs and dairy products.
The drought comes along with heat. So far, 2012 is the hottest year ever recorded in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose records date to 1895. That has sapped the production of corn, soybeans and other crops, afflicting poultry and livestock in turn.
It is also harming parts of the infrastructure. Highways in Texas, nuclear power plants in Illinois, runways and subway rails in Washington and the concrete, steel and sophisticated engineering that undergird the nation's infrastructure are being taxed to worrisome degrees by heat, drought and vicious storms.
The impact of the hot and dry weather on the nation's farmers has put new pressure on Congress to move ahead on a pending five-year farm bill. But House Republican leaders have been reluctant to act because of divisions within the party's rank-and-file about the cost of the nearly $1 trillion bill.
The legislation includes several federal agriculture programs that farmers have come to expect, though it does not include any specific drought assistance. Several important disaster relief programs expired at the end of 2011, leaving farmers and ranchers who have lost cattle or grazing land with few options without Congressional action.
"I've been urging the House of Representatives to get a bill to the floor and get it voted on so they can conference with the Senate and get a farm bill passed," said Thomas J. Vilsack, the agriculture secretary.
For now, analysts said they expected the broader economic impact of rising food prices to be modest. Americans spend just 13 percent of their household budgets on food. The falling price of gasoline -- fuel and transportation costs being a major component of prices at restaurants and grocery stores -- will help temper any price increases.
Analysts said there might be little effect on economic growth or overall inflation, which has been running around 2 percent a year.
But economists said consumers -- particularly the poor and unemployed -- would still feel the effects.
"It is one extra kick in the stomach" for low-income families, said Chris G. Christopher, senior principal economist at IHS, a consulting firm. "There's a lot of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck. This is not a good thing for them."
Higher food prices might also damp consumer sentiment. "Consumers are very sensitive to the price of gas and food," said Jeet Dutta, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. "But overall inflation will still look pretty moderate for the rest of the year."
Economists fear a far greater impact outside of the United States because America is a major exporter of a broad variety of agricultural products. Lower production at home means less supply and higher prices abroad.
"We're seeing the price of wheat, corn and beans go up," said Marc Sadler, the head of the agricultural risk management team at the World Bank, noting that in other regions of the world, like Eastern Europe, yields were also falling.
"Food wheat is about bread and cookies and instant noodles. But it's about instant noodles in Asia and Indonesia, as much as it is about what you're going to buy in Walmart," Mr. Sadler said.
Countries that import substantial amounts of animal feed made from corn and soybeans will feel the impact the most, said Maximo Torero, an economist with the International Food Policy Research Institute, an international research group.
On Wednesday, government data showed the extent to which the heat and the drought had devastated crops and provided a first look at next year's expected price increases.
The Agriculture Department's figures show the largest percentage increase next year in its price indexes is expected for beef, a rise of 4 to 5 percent. The price of dairy products will increase 3.5 to 4.5 percent and eggs by 3 to 4 percent. Pork is expected to rise 2.5 to 3.5 percent.
The department also slashed its estimate for what was supposed to be the largest corn harvest on record. The government cut its corn yield forecast to 146 bushels an acre for the year, the lowest corn yield since 2003. The outlook just last month was for 166 bushels. The soybean yield is projected to be 40 bushels an acre, down from an estimate of 43.9 last month.
Cattle farmers in several states have already started selling off or culling cattle because the drought has ruined grass for grazing and the price for corn for feed has skyrocketed.
Daniel R. Glickman, the agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, said that as farmers started reducing or selling their herds, meat prices could fall because of a glut of beef on the market.
"So in the short term, that's good for customers," Mr. Glickman said.

Abstract: "If further action is called for, the most effective tool would be additional purchases of longer-maturity securities, including agency mortgage-backed securities," John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech in mid-July.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- A growing number of Federal Reserve officials have concluded that the central bank needs to expand its stimulus campaign unless the nation's economy soon shows signs of improvement, including job growth.
The question is expected to dominate the agenda when the Fed's policy-making committee meets next week, with some members pushing for immediate action while others seek to delay a decision at least until the committee's next meeting in September, so they can see a few more weeks' worth of economic data.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress last week that the options under consideration included a new round of asset purchases, or "quantitative easing," often described as QE3. As part of any such program, officials increasingly favor expanding the Fed's holdings of mortgage-backed securities for the first time since 2010.
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials are convinced that such a step would further drive down long-term interest rates and improve the pace of economic growth, but they are concerned that the benefits would be modest and the costs uncertain.
The Fed also could take the smaller step of extending its forecast that short-term interest rates would remain near zero beyond late 2014, but many economists regard such a step as unlikely to provide a significant jolt to growth.
Any significant action by the Fed will reverberate in a presidential election that may be decided by the health of the economy. Republicans have urged Mr. Bernanke to refrain from taking additional steps, arguing that the costs were likely to exceed the benefits, while Democrats have pressed for a new round of stimulus.
Officials increasingly say that the economy has lost momentum after stronger growth earlier in the year. The unemployment rate fell by a full percentage point, to 8.1 percent, between September and April, but it has since made no further progress. Fed officials predicted in June that if they did not take further action, the rate would remain at or above 8 percent for the rest of the year. Fed officials are also concerned about the continuing crisis in Europe and the impact of substantial tax increases and spending cuts at the end of this year.
Mr. Bernanke has said repeatedly that the Fed would act if it concluded that the economy would not grow fast enough to reduce the rate of unemployment.
"We are very committed to ensuring, or at least doing all we can to ensure, that we continue to make progress on unemployment," he told Congress last week.
For the Fed, there is a caveat that holds the key to understanding its pending decision. Current economic conditions would most likely warrant a cut in the Fed's benchmark interest rate. But of course the Fed cannot cut that rate, which has hovered near zero since late 2008. Instead it must decide whether to try improving the economy by other means.
There is considerable evidence that the Fed's purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities have reduced interest rates and encouraged investors to buy riskier assets like equities. Stock markets rally whenever the central bank hints at another round of purchases. The Fed has made two large rounds of asset purchases, first in 2008 and again in 2010. But the broader benefits of lower rates have been tamped down because many consumers and businesses are unable to qualify for loans.
Several Fed officials have expressed public support for buying mortgage-backed securities because studies show that such purchases have a larger effect on mortgage rates, allowing the Fed to take aim at the troubled housing market.
"If further action is called for, the most effective tool would be additional purchases of longer-maturity securities, including agency mortgage-backed securities," John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech in mid-July.
The uncertain costs of such purchases have created a higher bar for action. Some officials worry that the Fed will disrupt financial markets by acquiring too much of the outstanding volume of Treasuries or mortgage-backed securities.
"It would be helpful to have a better understanding of how large the Federal Reserve's participation would have to be to cause a meaningful deterioration in securities market functioning, and of the potential costs of such deterioration for the economy as a whole," Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said in a recent speech.
Other officials, however, play down this concern. The point of the purchases, in part, is to push investors into riskier assets. Mr. Bernanke told Congress last week that he recognized a theoretical limit on the amount of Treasuries that the Fed could own, but that he did not see it as an immediate constraint.
Another concern raised by some officials, and minimized by Mr. Bernanke, is that a larger portfolio could impede the Fed's ability to respond to rising inflation.
The Fed's purchases also have squeezed the premiums, in the form of higher interest rates, that investors normally demand to hold longer-term debt. As the distortion increases, so does the potential for disruption if premiums snap back toward historical norms.
And central bankers, cautious by nature and profession, also harbor wariness for the unforeseen risks of unprecedented actions.
Nonetheless, internal discussions have swung in the direction of additional action.
As recently as April, a majority of the officials on the Fed's policy-making committee -- there were then 17 members; there are now 19 -- indicated that they no longer expected to hold interest rates near zero through 2014, as they had stated.
But the outlook deteriorated so quickly that at its next meeting in June, the Fed announced a holding action, extending to the end of this year an effort to modestly reduce borrowing costs by adjusting but not expanding its investment portfolio.
Fed officials have now made clear that they may make a move before that program ends in December. But they may wait past the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday. While the government will release its estimate of second-quarter growth on Friday, postponing a decision until the Fed next meets in September would allow officials to consider two more months' worth of employment data.

Abstract: In the United States, the economy has hit a soft patch, and in a nasty election season the government is heading toward the so-called fiscal cliff, with spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect automatically at the end of the year. [...]today, bond prices are relatively high -- their yields, which move in the opposite direction, are extraordinarily low -- and stock prices are relatively high.\n

AFTER the last several years, you don't need a finance course to know that stocks are risky.
If you've looked at the fluctuating value of your own stock portfolio, you already have a visceral understanding of market volatility. These violent ups and downs provide powerful reasons for fleeing stocks -- and for buying protection in the form of government bonds, even if their yield is minuscule.
Investors may have absorbed the arguments for avoiding risk so completely that they have lost their taste for it. That's why a new position paper by Seth J. Masters, chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, is startling. Its title is "The Case for the 20,000 Dow."
On Friday, the Dow closed below 12,900. Mr. Masters says it's time to consider the chances that the Dow will rise by more than 7,000 points -- an increase of more than 50 percent. He says the odds of that happening by the end of this decade are excellent.
For long-term investors right now, he says, stocks are a much better bet than bonds. "This argument may seem provocative," he said in an interview. "But that's only because market conditions are so unusual, and so many people have become so pessimistic."
That pessimism is grounded in recent history, he acknowledged. The stock market is extremely volatile now, and stocks are being battered for all kinds of reasons. Take your pick. At the moment, major banks are being investigated for rigging interest rates. In the United States, the economy has hit a soft patch, and in a nasty election season the government is heading toward the so-called fiscal cliff, with spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect automatically at the end of the year.
In much of Europe, the economy has been contracting, and the finances and governance of the euro zone are unstable. On top of all this, in crucial emerging markets like Brazil and China, economic growth is slower than had been expected. And that is just a partial list of the factors weighing on the market. Quite often, stocks have been sinking for no apparent reason at all.
Even so, stocks over the next decade may be less risky, in some respects, than the supposedly safe market for United States Treasuries, Mr. Masters said. His underlying argument is that the world has faced dire conditions before, and markets and economies have bounced back.
"People are acting as though the world is going to end," he said. "It might end, but we think it won't, and we think that's no way to live your life."
Precisely because bonds are now extraordinarily overvalued and stocks are undervalued, in his view, stocks are extremely likely to outperform bonds over the next decade or two. The Dow Jones industrial average is likely to reach 20,000 during that time -- and probably within the next five to 10 years, he said.
"Our projected stock returns may sound optimistic," he writes. "They're not. They are well below the long-term average for U.S. and global equities and based on conservative assumptions about economic and market conditions. Bonds, on the other hand, are unlikely to outpace inflation, because current yields are extremely low."
Bernstein projects 8 percent median annual returns for a diversified portfolio of global and domestic stocks over the next 10 years, versus 2 percent for 10-year Treasuries. At that rate for stocks, "the Dow could hit 20,000 in five to 10 years," Mr. Masters continues. "In the same time frame, the S.& P. 500, a more representative index, could hit 2,000."
Annual stock market returns of 8 percent were, until recently, commonplace. At the moment, he concedes, they are not. And, in an interview, he said he was not predicting that stocks would actually rise 8 percent next year or in any given year but instead was presenting a "range of probabilities" for investment returns. "We don't know where stocks will go," he said. "And right now they are likely to be extremely volatile, which could feel very unpleasant."
BUFFERING that volatility makes sense for risk-averse investors, he says. Over the short run, for example, a portfolio that would typically contain 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds as a strategic allocation should be ratcheted down to 54 percent stocks and 46 percent bonds. That should reduce portfolio fluctuations. Eventually, though, he says, such a portfolio should return to a more typical stock allocation.
Over 10-year periods since 1900, stocks have outperformed bonds 75 percent of the time, according to Bernstein's calculations. But today, bond prices are relatively high -- their yields, which move in the opposite direction, are extraordinarily low -- and stock prices are relatively low. So the firm sees the chance of stocks beating bonds over the next 10 years at 88 percent.
Stocks have been cruel and it is hard to love them now. Still, Mr. Masters writes, "We think that 10 years from now, investors will wish they had stayed in stocks -- or added to them."
Correction: July 29, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Strategies column last Sunday, about reasons that the Dow Jones industrial average may eventually reach 20,000, misstated the assessment of current stock prices by Bernstein Global Wealth Management. In the firm's view, they are relatively low, not high.

Full text: FRANKFURT -- The International Monetary Fund, warning of "a sizable risk" that some euro zone countries could suffer a debilitating decline in prices, called on Wednesday for the European Central Bank to pump money into the region's economy by buying huge volumes of government bonds.
Such bond buying, which the Federal Reserve has undertaken in recent years to stimulate the United States economy, is a move the central bank has resisted, one that would probably outrage the fiscal disciplinarians of Germany.
And it is unclear whether the I.M.F.'s public push for big spending by the central bank will make it more or less likely for the bank's president, Mario Draghi, to act. He, like any central banker, wants to appear immune to outside pressure.
But the I.M.F. is well respected, and its warning of deflation, a destructive plunge in prices, could help give the central bank the economic rationale to use the stimulus of buying billions of euros in government bonds.
In a report critical of euro zone policy, the I.M.F. said that there was a 25 percent risk of consumer price deflation before 2014 and that the danger was greatest in countries, like Italy, where growth was slow and the government was counting on tax increases to reduce its huge debt.
"A deeper euro area crisis would have substantial global implications," the I.M.F. said in its report, which also warned of other possible shocks to the euro currency bloc, including the failure of a big bank.
The central bank did not comment on the fund's report.
Deflation is typically a feature of severe economic decline and soaring joblessness that far outweighs any benefit to consumers from falling prices. A downward price spiral would make it harder for countries like Greece, Italy and Spain to control government debt, the fund said, because falling prices and wages would further depress tax receipts.
Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy has been a leading proponent of government bond buying by the central bank. Spanish leaders have been pleading with the bank to buy their bonds and hold down borrowing costs.
The central bank has spent 212 billion euros, or $260 billion, at the current exchange rate, buying government bonds since 2010, but has resisted calls for it to mimic the much larger purchases by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
Since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed has made two rounds of purchases, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. Many economists say this quantitative easing is a reason the United States economy recovered from the crisis faster than most of its European counterparts.
Richard Barwell, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, doubted that the central bank would follow the monetary fund's advice without evidence of deflation throughout the euro zone. "I think they would view it as being counterproductive," he said. "It would be alleviating all pressure on policy makers to solve the underlying cause of the problem."
But fund officials framed their call for big bond purchases as a way for the central bank to maintain its control over interest rates and contain borrowing costs for troubled countries.
"It is an essential part of the E.C.B. fulfilling its mandate," Helge Berger, an adviser in the fund's European department, said during a conference call Wednesday with reporters.
Quantitative easing is how central banks stimulate the economy when they have already pushed interest rates as low as they can go. This month, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate below 1 percent for the first time, to 0.75 percent. But quantitative easing is opposed by Germany, the biggest contributor to the bank, because it would amount to the use of the central bank to finance governments. And German sentiment carries weight with the bank, which is reluctant to further divide the euro zone.
Mr. Draghi has given no clear signals that the bank is seriously considering quantitative easing or other measures. But on Tuesday, at a meeting here with Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, Mr. Draghi tentatively addressed a widespread concern that central bank bond buying hurts more than it helps. For instance, it could make the central bank a senior creditor over other bond buyers, who would then be at greater risk if a government defaulted on its bonds.
This year, when the central bank, I.M.F. and European Union agreed to another rescue of Greece, the bank would not share in the losses that private investors were required to take on their Greek bonds. That position inadvertently increased the perceived risk of other governments' bonds, by signaling that private investors would be last to collect in case of future losses.
But Mr. Draghi, at his meeting with Mr. Noonan, apparently indicated that the central bank was reconsidering its insistence that it rank above private investors when it holds a government's bonds. "Mr. Draghi noted that the question of burden sharing with senior bond holders is evolving at the European level," the bank said in a statement later.
The fund's warning about deflation was part of a report on euro zone policies in which the fund again criticized European leaders' handling of the euro crisis. "The deepening of the crisis suggests that its root causes remain unaddressed," the report said. It faulted what it said was a lack of "ambitious policies to restore strong and balanced growth across the euro area."
"The viability of the monetary union itself" is in doubt, the fund said. It praised progress by European leaders in recent weeks on creating a banking union with a central regulator -- based at the E.C.B. -- which it said would help prevent national regulators from pursuing policies designed to protect their banks at the expense of those of other countries.
Common bank supervision "allows banks to be guided by European or euro area considerations," Mahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the fund's European department, said during the conference call.
But the fund said that euro zone countries needed to go further, eventually issuing common debt and ceding some authority over their national finances. Germany and some other countries remain firmly opposed to common debt, so-called euro bonds, unless they have more control over spending by other euro zone countries. France and other countries favor euro bonds but have not been willing to give up control over their own budgets.
The fund acknowledged that it would take time to build a more durable currency union and said that central bank action was needed in the meantime.
"Monetary policy can play a role in easing the transition until structural reforms become effective," the fund said. "Because inflation is low and falling, the E.C.B. has room for lowering rates, and deploying additional unconventional measures would relieve severe stress in some markets."
In a response to the report on behalf of European Union institutions, Ambroise Fayolle, who represents France on the executive board of the fund, said that officials were "in broad agreement" with the fund's conclusions. He highlighted the progress that European leaders had made to impose more spending discipline on one another and strengthen the banking system.
"The authorities reiterate their resolve to take all the necessary actions to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area," he said in a statement.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- House Republicans pressed the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Wednesday to forswear additional actions to stimulate growth, warning that the results would be counterproductive.
Mr. Bernanke avoided commitments during two days of Congressional testimony, but he told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the Fed was prepared to expand its efforts if it concluded that job growth had stalled.
Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee, which hosted Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday, wasted little time in responding.
They questioned whether the Fed's existing efforts were bolstering growth and suggested any benefits had been exhausted. They fretted that the Fed was seeding higher inflation and postponing a necessary reckoning with the federal debt.
"The truth is the Federal Reserve cannot rescue Americans from the consequences of failed economic and regulatory policies passed by Congress and signed by the president," said the committee chairman, Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama.
Democrats made no countervailing effort to convince Mr. Bernanke that he should take additional action, instead congratulating the Fed chairman in the manner of people confident that they were speaking to an ally.
"I want to thank you for your steadfast commitment to taking action as you deem appropriate," said Representative Michael E. Capuano, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Said Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, "I would like to yield most of my time to you" to speak about the Fed's successes.
Representative John Carney, Democrat of Delaware, asked, "The Fed is doing everything it can to address the unemployment part of your mandate, is that correct?"
Mr. Bernanke paused a moment before responding that the Fed "certainly" could do more, and was considering whether it should.
"We are very committed to ensuring, or at least doing all we can to ensure, that we continue to make progress on unemployment," he said earlier in the hearing.
The three hours of testimony provided little clarity about what the Fed's policy-making committee would do at its next scheduled meeting July 31 and Aug. 1. Mr. Bernanke said Tuesday that the Fed remained uncertain about the economy, which appears to be growing slowly -- recovering from crisis, but not at a rapid enough pace to reduce persistent unemployment.
The Fed's beige book survey of regional business conditions, published Wednesday, reported "modest to moderate" growth in late June and early July. The regional reports were weaker in aggregate than the last report in early June.
While the Fed has responded vigorously to any sign that the economy is slipping back toward recession, it has hesitated to address the current malaise.
Sandra Pianalto, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, noted Tuesday that taking additional action carried significant risks, including the possibility that the Fed could disrupt the function of financial markets by soaking up too large a share of Treasury securities or other financial assets.
She also noted the Fed's limited power. "Monetary policy cannot directly control the unemployment rate; it can only foster conditions in financial markets that are conducive to growth and a lower unemployment rate," she said.
Republicans embroidered this theme on Wednesday.
Noting that "we have seen the greatest monetary stimulus in the history of our country," and that the economy was still just muddling along, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, asked Mr. Bernanke why he believed that additional measures would produce better results.
"There are limits to what monetary policy can achieve," Mr. Hensarling said.
Mr. Bernanke responded that monetary policy "is not a panacea," but he said that the Fed had succeeded in reducing borrowing costs, and that he was confident that the Fed retained the power to further reduce interest rates.
Mr. Bernanke did rule out one form of new action, the idea that the Fed could bolster growth by temporarily encouraging a higher rate of inflation.
Under questioning by Representative Patrick McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, Mr. Bernanke offered about as clear a rejection of such a policy as is ever heard from a central banker.
"I don't think, first, that we could do that without losing control of the inflation process," Mr. Bernanke said.
"Secondly," he continued, "I'm very skeptical that it would increase confidence among businesses and households and increase economic activity. I think it would create a lot of problems in financial markets as well."
"And so," he concluded, "I don't think that's a strategy that has a lot of support on the Federal Open Market Committee."

Full text: Beijing
A JOKE popular in China in recent years tells of an old Chinese woman and an old American woman who meet in heaven. "Just before I died, I could finally afford to buy a house," the Chinese lady says. The American responds, "Just before I died, I finally paid off my mortgage."
Though premised on stereotypes of spendthrift Americans and frugal Chinese, the story helps explain how an imbalanced world economy lost its bearings.
Two dimensions of the crisis distinguish it from past economic disruptions and explain its tenacity. The first is the paradox of credit, which is simultaneously dynamic and destabilizing. The expansion and dominance of global finance opened the gate for faster capital accumulation and material abundance, but at the same time sowed the seeds of crisis. In the United States, relaxed monetary policies and esoteric financial engineering gave consumers easy access to luxuries like bigger homes, better cars and more vacations, even if they had no savings.
A credit surplus in wealthy countries resulted in a production surplus in emerging, export-oriented countries like China and Brazil. These imbalances have had negative effects for both sides. In the West, manufacturing has been hollowing out for decades as industrialists migrate to developing countries, where labor, equipment and materials are cheaper. Moreover, the middle class has shrunk, as the returns of a finance-driven economy have flowed to "fat cats" who control the levers of credit. In emerging economies, urbanization and industrialization have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty but have also exacted a heavy toll on the environment.
The second dimension of the crisis is its interconnected nature. The world is not flat; it is more like a rapidly contracting fishbowl. Globalization explains why the thrashing of a small fish like Greece, which represents 2.3 percent of Europe's economic output, has threatened to drown the Continent. It also explains the plight of a goose farmer I got to know in a remote, mountainous part of Anhui Province. Before the crisis, the down from a single goose could be sold for about 13 yuan (about $2), but after the crisis the same amount of down sold for less than 7 yuan. The farmer's son, a migrant worker, was laid off from a factory, after numerous orders from overseas were canceled.
In the 1970s and 1980s, countries like China and India began to reform their economies, while information technology revolutionized production and marketing. But the global boom that resulted, with fast growth and low inflation, cannot be reproduced. The world economy has not found a new source of momentum since the Internet bubble burst in 2000. Instead, financial institutions, governments and consumers tried to achieve prosperity through reckless lending and borrowing (much of it for housing). Now rising labor and resource costs, growing inflation pressure and large sovereign debts have made fiscal and monetary policy less effective.
What can be done? First, we cannot expect neoliberalism -- privatization, deregulation, free trade -- to revive growth. The credit paradox is only narrowly a financial crisis -- it is a crisis of faith, one that summons us to turn away from a capital-centered economy to a human-centered one. Capital cannot be expected to be self-policing. To prevent it from mortgaging humanity's future, governments must reject laissez-faire attitudes. The "visible hand" of government is needed to manage the markets, revamp regulatory systems and bridle reckless behavior. Governments should encourage businesses to invest in the "real" economy -- to promote technological innovation and job creation rather than speculation and profiteering.
Second, the world's largest economies -- the United States, China, the European Union -- must improve coordination on macroeconomic policies, as well as regulation and trade, and resist the temptation of protectionism.
Third, balance must be restored: between the financial sector and the real economy; between domestic and overseas demand; between developed and developing countries. China has moved to encourage domestic consumption instead of relying solely on exports.
The Great Depression and the Second World War were followed by revolutions in aeronautics, nuclear energy and space exploration. The oil crisis of the 1970s was followed by an information-technology revolution. Only further innovation in science and technology can promote productivity and eventually lead the world out of the current crisis.
While it is crucial for the United States and China to bolster their own development, they also need to strengthen cooperation in trade, investment, finance, infrastructure, technology and other fields. The two economies have become highly interdependent; last year, bilateral trade topped $450 billion.
Frictions are hardly avoidable, but what's important is for the two sides to handle their differences through coordination based on equality and mutual understanding. Only by acknowledging our extreme interdependence will we make the fishbowl effect work for humanity, rather than against it.

Unions' Past May Hold Key to Their Future

Abstract: Elected in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan set out to destroy obstacles to unfettered markets -- including organized labor -- with ideological assistance from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. When organized labor bounced back in the late 1930s, Mr. Warren observed, it was in a different form, as big, inclusive industrial unions that organized workers at the company level, not by skill.

Full text: Organized labor is in free fall. The number of workers who belong to a union has plummeted about 20 percent over the last decade. Only 8 percent of all workers are unionized. And leading labor activists are wringing their hands over the seemingly inevitable death of a movement unable to cope with technological change.
"I see no reason to believe that American trade unionism will so revolutionize itself within a short period of time as to become in the next decade a more potent social force than it has been in the past decade," warns one of the nation's foremost economists.
The description sounds like the labor movement today. But the statistics are from 1930. George E. Barnett, president of the American Economic Association, issued the warning at the depth of the Great Depression in 1932.
Mr. Barnett proved to be quite wrong. A decade after his speech at the group's annual meeting in Cincinnati, one in five American workers belonged to a union. Some 10 years later, organized labor was at the peak of its power.
While it would be naive to invest too much faith in this mistake as a precedent, history offers some clues about how the labor movement -- once again on the mat, pummeled into insignificance by economic forces beyond its control -- might recover its relevance to American workers and society.
Today, fewer than one in 14 private sector workers belongs to a union, half the portion of 15 years ago. Where unions matter most -- fighting for workers' share of the spoils of economic growth -- they lost the battle long ago. Despite soaring worker productivity, the typical American worker takes home today only 2 percent more than a quarter of a century ago, after adjusting for inflation.
Yet while union leaders have spent the last decade fretting, they have been unable to reverse the downward trend.
Partly, this has to do with the diagnosis of the problem. Many union leaders still like to believe that an ideological shift spun the labor movement into a death spiral. Elected in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan set out to destroy obstacles to unfettered markets -- including organized labor -- with ideological assistance from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.
The ideological assault on unions changed workplace norms. In the United States, company executives who had tolerated unions as standard features of the workplace started spending billions to fight them off.
Losing control of the factory floor, unions lost touch with society, too. In the 1950s and '60s, union contracts set a standard that was followed across the economy. Today, they are too weak to be standard-setters. And nonunion workers tend to resent rather than applaud the better pay and benefits of their unionized brethren.
Only about one in five Americans say they trust unions, according to polling by Gallup, the same share that trust banks or big business. And unions' once impressive political clout has been overwhelmed by a wave of corporate money. Their biggest campaign this spring, trying to remove Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin from office after he rolled back collective bargaining rights for state employees, ended last month in ignominious defeat.
But this reading of history misses a fundamental part of the story. Notably, it underplays the impact of globalization, which intensified competition and spurred businesses to slash labor costs. And it ignores technology, which changed the nature of work.
In the 1920s, unions were as unprepared for change as they are today. Dorian T. Warren, a professor of political science at Columbia University, notes that at the turn of the 20th century, guilds were organized around crafts, like carpentry or glass blowing.
This structure gave organized labor enormous power in the economy. Running apprenticeship programs, guilds controlled the supply of labor at the time. But it left labor unions unprepared for the subsequent arrival of large corporations, which hired unskilled workers directly, without the imprimatur of a guild.
When organized labor bounced back in the late 1930s, Mr. Warren observed, it was in a different form, as big, inclusive industrial unions that organized workers at the company level, not by skill. Crucially, the unions understood that part of their job was to ensure that a labor contract would not put a company at a competitive disadvantage. They had to remove wages from competition. That was essential to their success. Otherwise, corporations would fight them to the death.
But no model of labor relations can last forever. This one worked as long as the United States remained largely a closed economy. Unions roughly ensured that working standards improved uniformly across many industrial sectors. If they negotiated higher wages or better working conditions at one airline or car company, others quickly followed -- even nonunion shops, which hoped to appease workers and prevent them from voting for a union.
Yet economic changes upended the pattern again. The new jobs created around the revolution in information technology of the late 20th century did not fit the mold of the corporations of old. New companies relied more on independent contractors and freelance work. The lifelong relationship established between industrial companies and their workers gave way to looser, shorter dalliances.
Perhaps most important, globalization exposed America's industrial-era titans to more intense competition. The emergence of powerful rivals overseas, where labor was cheap and unions scarce, made it more difficult for companies to improve wages and working conditions without becoming less competitive. And corporations, especially new high-tech companies that arose in southern states where labor law made it tougher to organize, turned against unions as albatrosses around their necks.
Unsurprisingly, a majority of unionized workers today are employed by the government, the last sector of the economy that is largely protected from foreign competition. "We are forced to conclude that a resurgence of labor unions in the private sector in the foreseeable future is unlikely," wrote the labor market scholars Henry S. Farber and Bruce Western of Princeton University a decade ago, echoing Mr. Barnett's thoughts 70 years before. And things have only deteriorated for the unions since then.
But if the prospects look grim for the unions of America's industrial era, the precedent of the 1930s -- when workers organized in droves -- offers perhaps a hint of a path for organized labor as the economy works its way forward from the Great Recession, a role that perhaps better fits the nation's corporate makeup.
The future labor movement may have to give up organizing work site by work site. Its biggest political fight in the last few years -- pushing a law to make it easier to organize a workplace -- may be irrelevant. And fighting to create new barriers to foreign competition is probably a lost cause. Instead of negotiating for their members only, unions might do better pulling for better wages and conditions for all workers.
Some scholars, like the economist Richard B. Freeman of the National Bureau of Economic Research, suggest the labor movement could take a page from the AARP's playbook and become a lobbying group. German-like worker councils could discuss workplace issues with management, without negotiating over pay.
Maybe unions don't have to entirely give up collective bargaining but broaden it. A model might be the alliance between the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Domestic Workers Alliance of New York City to push for a bill of rights for nonunionized nannies and maids.
In any event, 80 years from now, labor organizations will probably look as different as our current unions look when compared with the guilds of 80 years ago. Today's strongest unions -- of autoworkers and airline pilots -- could easily be the weakest, decimated by international competition. Unions may well be strongest in hospitals, hotels and other businesses not exposed to international trade.
Union leaders understand this -- to a point. They are slowly beginning to experiment with new models of organization. Time is not on their side, however. If they fail to embrace radical change, in 80 years unions may not be around at all.

Full text: CORRECTION APPENDED
WASHINGTON -- On Tuesday morning at precisely 8:30, after a 10-second countdown synchronized to the Naval Observatory's atomic clock, a Labor Department official will flip a master switch in the agency's battened-down pressroom and computers will blurt out the monthly Consumer Price Index.
Until that moment, the market-sensitive data will be guarded with launch-code secrecy, a precaution against anyone who might try to take advantage of an accidental or a surreptitious leak to gain an insider's edge in the financial markets, turning milliseconds into millions.
Yet for all the rituals of high security, government officials have become increasingly nervous that their process is vulnerable, and are now overhauling it.
After a yearlong review that included scrutiny by anti-hacking specialists from Sandia National Laboratories, officials at the Labor Department revoked the credentials of a few little-known news organizations that appeared to serve financial clients rather than the public at large.
The government has also ordered other media groups to replace their computers in the lockup room with new computers under tighter controls.
The efforts stem from the newfound importance of high-speed trading, which began to grow significantly in the middle of the last decade and is now a central part of some hedge funds' investment strategies. By gaining information seconds or minutes before others, high-speed traders -- sometimes known as high-frequency or algorithmic traders -- can use the computerized nature of modern finance to make quick profits or, if a bet goes wrong, take large losses.
In addition to the inflation numbers, the lockup process, in use at several agencies, covers releases on economic growth, home sales, gas prices, corn yields and the unemployment rate, among other things.
The Labor Department's overhaul was ignited by inquiries starting in 2007 from the F.B.I., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the department's own inspector general. Officials did not cite any specific major breach of security, but they had grown concerned that one was possible. Two instances in 2008, when Reuters accidentally released data a few seconds too early, heightened concerns.
The clampdown has strained the Labor Department's relations with some of the world's biggest news agencies, including Reuters and Bloomberg News. In negotiations with the department and at a fractious Congressional hearing, the companies suggested the government was taking extreme measures against an imagined threat.
At the center of the Labor Department's effort was a so-called Red Team from Sandia Labs, a federally financed research group operated by a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, which has half a century of experience in computer security, including work on the military's command and control networks.
The "root cause" for the review, the team noted, was the possibility of traders or their agents working inside the lockup.
Acting on the team's recommendations, Labor Department officials sought a wholesale replacement of the computer equipment in the lockup room. The replacement is scheduled to happen by September, although further steps to shield against surreptitious transmissions are possible later.
At a hearing of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last month, the former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Keith Hall explained the main worry, which is that the growing reliance on high-speed trading had created the potential for participants in the media lockup to give an unfair advantage to traders.
"Lockup participants may now have access to specialized computer equipment and software that links them directly to automated trading models," he noted. "This effectively allows financial market transactions to be driven from inside lockups."
Carl Fillichio, the Labor Department official in charge of the overhaul, described a series of malfunctions and violations over the last few years, including the installation of fiber optic cables in the lockup room without permission or the use of BlackBerrys or mobile phone cameras. Media companies themselves have complained about competitors who "may have gained unfair advantage in speed of transmission or have surreptitiously broken embargoes," Mr. Fillichio added in his testimony.
Some members of the media, however, say the crackdown is unnecessary. (The New York Times does not participate in the Labor Department lockup.)
"What is the problem you think, you imagine that this will prevent?" asked Daniel Moss, an executive editor at Bloomberg News, in an April conference call between Mr. Fillichio and news organizations. Mr. Moss, plainly exasperated, repeated the question several times but got no clear answer.
Government officials consider the potential security problems to be real. After a five-member team from Sandia Labs visited the lockup room last July, it identified "verified vulnerabilities in processes, procedures and systems used to protect" embargoed data, according to the summary of its report.
The team warned about methods of sneaking information out, such as by hidden transmitters, or bypassing the black boxes and master switches that keep the lockup room under electronic quarantine through other means, like wireless Internet. The team noted that "likely adversaries" had the technical and financial resources and possibly the willingness "to bend and potentially violate rules and laws."
But it said any culprits were unlikely to "employ violent means to meet their goal of exfiltrating embargoed data prior to the official release time."
At the oversight hearing, Mr. Moss of Bloomberg News argued that traditional media outlets were not the problem and suggested that the Labor Department instead expel those groups connected to algorithmic traders from the lockup.
Ultimately, the Labor Department did pull the credentials of a few organizations -- including Need to Know News, a small enterprise owned by the German exchange. Its data goes directly from the lockups to specialized trading programs. Mr. Fillichio explained that they were not "primarily journalistic" and did not "disseminate their information to a wide audience."
Chris Rhea, chief executive of Need to Know News, referred questions to a spokesman, who did not respond.
In the initial stages of the crackdown, Mr. Fillichio ordered lockup participants to use government computers, transmission lines and even pens and pencils and paper while inside the lockup. Media groups objected.
"This proposal threatens the First Amendment," Mr. Moss said at the oversight hearing, adding that it would give the government "access to a reporters' thoughts, drafts or notes as a condition for covering the news."
After another round of negotiations, the government backed off a bit. For now, some equipment owned by media companies is expected to stay. But over the next few months they will have to deliver new, shrink-wrapped terminals, which will be subject to inspection and maintenance by Labor Department technicians.
One question that is still unresolved is how many seats each organization will be allowed.
Space is tight in the lockup. And paradoxically, all the attention to this obscure room on a drab corridor has brought newcomers knocking, as if at the door of a speakeasy.
