Full text: Paul Ryan tried to brag about the economy last week, and it didn't go so well. "Not too long ago, progressive economists said strong economic growth couldn't be done anymore -- that a stagnant U.S. economy was the 'new normal,"' Ryan tweeted. "And yet, our economy is growing at its fastest rate since 2014."
Ah, yes: the good old days of 2014, also known as the sixth year of Barack Obama's presidency. Ryan's nostalgia for 2014 wasn't even the most-mocked part of his tweet. His attempt to make grand claims about a single quarter of growth was.
If the Trump economy were so wonderful, why would the speaker of the House feel the need to traffic in disingenuousness? Because the Trump economy isn't actually so wonderful. For most Americans, it is downright mediocre, and it has deteriorated somewhat since President Trump took office, despite the healthy G.D.P. and unemployment statistics.
The chart here tells the story. It shows the trends in average inflation-adjusted hourly pay, arguably the best measure of economic well-being for most people. As you can see, hourly wages are suffering through a Trump slump.
That slump isn't entirely Trump's fault, by any means. But he deserves some blame for it. Worst of all, he is doing virtually nothing improve the situation, instead enacting policies that will ultimately hurt workers' ability to earn a decent paycheck.
Let's start with the good news. The unemployment rate keeps falling, and economic growth is solid. These headline numbers are the ones that Republicans emphasize (and that the media sometimes overhypes).
As a result of the growth, nominal wages -- that is, the numbers people see in their paychecks, before taking inflation into account -- are growing. You can see the pickup in the gentle upward slope of the chart's solid gray line. Over the past year, the average hourly nominal wage has risen 2.7 percent.
There are two problems, though. First, 2.7 percent isn't a great growth rate for nominal wages. It was rarely so slow in the entire second half of the 20th century, for example. These days, though, most workers don't receive their fair share of economic output. An outsize share instead flows to corporate profits and the rich.
Second, nominal wages by themselves can't buy a higher standard of living. Prices matter, too. When the prices of good and services are rising faster than nominal wages, people end up with less buying power. And that is exactly what's happening now.
Inflation has surged, as you can see in the dashed line, mostly because of higher oil prices. Events in the Middle East, Russia and Venezuela have reduced the supply of oil, even as a growing global economy is increasing demand. Trump has aggravated the situation by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal, further raising oil prices.
Add it all up -- faster inflation plus mediocre nominal-wage growth -- and you get a stagnation in real wages. Welcome to the Trump wage slump.
My best guess is that real wages will do modestly better over the next year, barring another oil spike or an unexpected recession. But there is no reason to think that most Americans are on the cusp of truly healthy pay increases.
They face too many obstacles: Companies that are larger and more powerful than they used to be; unions that are weaker; and, thanks in large part to Trump, a federal government that keeps siding against workers, be it on overtime pay, work rules, health care costs, for-profit-college scams or tax cuts.
Right now, Trump is presiding over precisely the wage growth that he deserves: zero.

What Are Capitalists Thinking?

Full text: I've been fretting lately about the state of mind of America's capitalists. All these socialists coming out of the woodwork must have them in quite a lather. So I write today with some friendly advice for the capitalist class about said socialists.
You want fewer socialists? Easy. Stop creating them.
Every once in a while in history, cause and effect smack us in the face. The conditions under which the czars forced Russians to live gave rise to Bolshevism. The terms imposed at Versailles fueled Hitler's ascent. The failures of Keynesianism in the 1970s smoothed the path for supply-side economics.
And so it is here. As I noted recently in The Daily Beast, the kind of capitalism that has been practiced in this country over the last few decades has made socialism look far more appealing, especially to young people. Ask yourself: If you're 28 like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congressional candidate who describes herself as a democratic socialist, what have you seen during your sentient life?
You've seen the United States go from being a country that your parents -- or if you're 28, more likely your grandparents -- described as a place where life got better for every succeeding generation to a place where for millions of people, quite possibly including you, that's no longer true.
As that happened, you've seen the rich get richer, and you've perhaps noticed that the government's main response to this has been to keep cutting their taxes (in fairness, President Barack Obama did raise the highest rate in 2013 to 39.6 percent from 35 percent, although for single filers, that rate didn't kick in until earned income went above $400,000).
You witnessed the financial meltdown of 2008, caused by big banks betting against themselves. Capitalists might want to consider how all that looked to a young person who came from a working-class family and who probably knows someone who lost a job or even his house, while some of the bankers who helped create the mess walked away with golden parachutes, like that of Countrywide Financial's Angelo Mozilo, which The Times valued at $88 million.
You've watched corporations horde profits, buy back their stock and not reinvest in their workers the way they once did as they move jobs to Central America and Bangladesh. If you read a lot, you know that stock buybacks were permitted under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-18, which dates to the Reagan era, and that since it's just an S.E.C. rule, it can be changed without having to pass legislation, but no one in either of the Democratic administrations since then bothered.
I could go on like this for 20 paragraphs. Many more, in fact. But you get the idea. Back in the days when our economy just grew and grew, we had a government and a capitalist class that invested in our people and their future -- in the Interstate highways, the community colleges, the scientific research, the generous federal grants for transportation and regional development.
And, funny thing, during all this time, socialism didn't have much appeal. Back in the 1910s and '20s, during an era of intense labor strife and before the existence of the welfare state, there were a couple of Socialist Party members in the House of Representatives -- Victor Berger of Wisconsin and Meyer London of New York -- as well as hundreds of Socialist mayors and state legislators and local officials.
But during the "Trente Glorieuses," to use the French term -- the glorious 30 years from 1945 to 1975 when everything largely worked in Western economies -- socialism's appeal in America waned. In the 1910s and '20s, the Socialist Party's presidential candidates received hundreds of thousands of votes, or more. In 1956, the party's presidential hopeful, Darlington Hoopes, won a mere 2,044 votes (other small leftist parties did somewhat better).
During this time and into the Reagan era, the broader American left -- defined not by party but by belief -- played a constructive role in supporting civil rights, opposing the Vietnam War and doing what it could to fight the new concentration of wealth. But, with the Cold War raging, its numbers were small and its influence negligible.
So, back now to our 28-year-old. She was born in 1990. She will probably remember, in the late '90s, her parents feeling pretty good about things -- median household income did go up under Bill Clinton more than they had under any president in a long time, even more than under Ronald Reagan. But ever since, the median income picture has been much spottier, hardly increasing at all in inflation-adjusted dollars over 18 long years. And those incomes at the top have shot to the heavens.
So if you were a person of modest or even middle-class means, how would you feel about capitalism? The kind of capitalism this country has been practicing for all these years has failed most people.
Yes, it's given us lots of shiny objects to gush about. A smartphone that can display slow-motion video is a wonder. But an affordable college education, though perhaps not a wonder, is a necessity for a well-ordered society. So is a solution to a national drug crisis in which 115 people die every day, as well as a lot of other problems that the capitalism of our era has simply ignored.
I have mixed feelings about this socialism boomlet. It has yet to prove itself politically viable in general elections outside a handful of areas, and by 2021 we could wake up and see that it's been a disaster for Democrats.
But I understand completely why it's happening. Given what's been going on in this country, it couldn't not have happened. And if you're a capitalist, you'd better try to understand it, too -- and do something to address the very legitimate grievances that propelled it.

__________
The United States stock market might be worth nearly $2 trillion more if not for the trade war.
Consider that the cost that investors appear to be ascribing to President Trump's efforts to upend decades of trade relationships.
Typically, it's hard to know why stocks are up or down over short periods. And the 5.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index this year might seem to be one of those inscrutable moves. But a closer look at the factors that usually drive the stock market suggests that the escalating trade tensions are holding stocks back.
Two things happened at the start of the year that worried investors. First, soon after the S. & P. 500 hit an all-time high on Jan. 26, stocks plunged on fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more quickly than expected. Then, at the end of February, the Trump administration announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, the first clear shot in the trade war.
Since then, neither the economy nor the Federal Reserve has sprung any nasty surprises. When investors dumped stocks in February, they were reacting to an unexpectedly strong number for wage growth. Since then, though, the economy has grown, adding on average 215,000 jobs per month, without an acceleration in wage growth, which investors track to gauge inflationary pressures. Friday's jobs report for July showed annual growth in wages of 2.7 percent, in line with the monthly average this year.
And the Fed does not appear to be a threat right now to the stock market. Investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates twice more this year rather than once, which hardly constitutes a slamming of the brakes. In fact, the Fed said Wednesday that its monetary policy was still set to ensure that the economy remained buoyant.
What is more, the bond market seems to agree that the economy can keep growing without a breakout in inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was expected to trade at 3 percent or higher in the second half of this year as the economy picked up, according to The Wall Street Journal's Economic Forecasting Survey. But it has mostly traded below that threshold all year.
On their own, a steadily growing economy and relatively supportive Fed policies would normally provide a springboard for stocks. But investors have had another reason to bid stocks higher: Corporate earnings have been coming in stronger than expected.
So far, second-quarter earnings have exceeded Wall Street analysts' estimates for all 11 industry sectors of the S. & P. 500, according to researchers at BofA Merrill Lynch. Sales have surpassed estimates in nine sectors.
So to what degree have Mr. Trump's trade battles tainted the bullish stock market conditions?
One way to tell is to look at valuations, which reveal the underlying mood of investors. Right now, the S. & P. 500 is trading at 16.6 times what analysts expect its companies to make over the next 12 months, according to data from FactSet. But in the three months before the trade tensions really heated up at the end of February, the S. & P. 500 on average traded at 17.8 times earnings.
Applying that higher multiple to stocks today would take the index over 3,000 points. Such a rise -- 7.5 percent from Friday's level -- would add $1.8 trillion to the value of the stock market. The higher-than-expected corporate earnings would arguably support a higher valuation.
What happens next? While Mr. Trump appeared willing to forge some sort of trade truce with the European Union, his metals tariffs are still in place and the actions against China are escalating. A big test for investors comes next month, when the Trump administration might impose $200 billion of extra tariffs on China. Given their size, the stock market may actually fall if those go ahead.
If the Trump administration blinks and delays putting the tariffs into effect, it will signal a retreat from its plans to radically recast the United States' trade relations. But there could be a consolation prize: American investors may get to enjoy the nearly $2 trillion of gains that the trade war has apparently so far denied them.

First Task for New Leader of Pakistan: Rescuing Its Distressed Economy

Full text: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The economic mess awaiting Pakistan's new leader could take the thrill out of his election victory.
The country's current account deficit, a broad measure of the imbalance between imports and exports, has soared to an alarming $18 billion. Foreign currency reserves would cover less than two months of imports.
The Pakistani rupee is shaky, tax collection is scandalously low (last year, in a country of 200 million, fewer than a million people paid any taxes) and Pakistan was recently returned to an international "gray list" for failing to curb terrorism financing, making foreign transactions more complicated and expensive.
So what's a new prime minister to do?
Imran Khan, the former cricket player whose political party won Pakistan's disputed election late last month, vowed to tackle the distressed economy the moment he ascends to the premiership, which is expected to happen in the coming days.
But the task will be made more difficult because Pakistan has sandwiched itself between two financial powers: China, from which it has borrowed heavily, and the Western-dominated International Monetary Fund, which might be its short-term savior.
Pakistan has taken out billions in Chinese loans and run up a huge import tab bringing in bulldozers, train carriages and building materials as part of a Chinese-funded master plan to revamp its ports, roads and railways.
That $62 billion plan, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, has been celebrated by both countries as a long-term investment that will increase trade. It is a cornerstone of a global infrastructure initiative that China calls Belt and Road.
Economists agree that for Pakistan's economy to develop beyond rice and textiles, its main exports, it needs new infrastructure -- a lot of it.
But in the meantime, the Chinese plan is pushing Pakistan's deficits to unsustainable levels. The country's debt is rising rapidly and it is running out of hard currency to pay its bills. Pakistani economists say that Mr. Khan's team will have no choice but to beg the monetary fund for a multibillion-dollar bailout, one of more than a dozen that Pakistan has received since the late 1980s.
That prospect doesn't make the United States super happy.
"Make no mistake," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this week. "We will be watching what the I.M.F. does."
Mr. Pompeo objected to the idea of money from the fund being used by Pakistan to pay back Chinese loans.
"There's no rationale for I.M.F. tax dollars -- and associated with that American dollars that are part of the I.M.F. funding -- for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself," he said.
Pakistan's economy, it seems, has become yet another battlefield between the United States and China.
As the largest contributor to the fund, the United States has considerable sway over its decisions. And though the United States and Pakistan enjoyed close ties during the Cold War, the relationship has soured. President Trump froze aid to Pakistan at the beginning of the year, citing frustration with its tolerance of extremist groups that operate within its borders.
Economists say that if the United States tried to block a potential bailout, Mr. Khan's fledging government could face a major crisis. It is unclear what the United States' actual position is, and the fund would probably restrict Pakistan from redirecting bailout money to China. Several analysts said that Mr. Pompeo's remarks were more an expression of frustration than a definitive statement.
Despite its troubles, last year the Pakistani economy grew at more than 5 percent, faster than most Western economies.
But things could change quickly if Mr. Khan's government doesn't get a rescue package soon, experts said. Among the concerns are soaring inflation, bank runs, capital flight and new import controls that would make it more difficult to buy items like computers and spare auto parts.
"The situation is certainly not good," said Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Management, a brokerage firm based in Karachi, the country's economic capital. "We could see growth tumbling, interest rates increasing, inflation."
The trick for Mr. Khan will be managing expectations. He is a Pakistani success story: a legendary athlete who is good-looking, wealthy and connected to the global elite (he once played matchmaker for Princess Diana). His election could open new doors for Pakistan.
But how he handles the cold, hard numbers of Pakistan's up-and-down economy, more than anything else, will determine his success.

Pakistan's financial markets seem to like him. As soon as it was clear that Mr. Khan's party was winning the July 25 election, the rupee gained value and Pakistani stocks surged. Mr. Pompeo's remarks had the opposite effect on both.
This past week, Mr. Khan has continued his quest to win over enough independent lawmakers and those from smaller parties to form a coalition government.
The election was seen as heavily influenced by military and intelligence officials, who analysts say favored Mr. Khan and sidelined his competition. But his supporters see him as a figure of hope, having defeated two of the country's powerful political dynasties based partly on his promises of a less corrupt and more equitable society. In his victory speech, Mr. Khan said he wanted to turn Pakistan into an Islamic welfare state.
That is going to be hard to deliver if Pakistan goes hat in hand to the monetary fund, as many expect. Considered the lender of last resort, it can be a stern taskmaster.
In return for lending Pakistan upward of $10 billion, the fund would most likely require more fiscal discipline. That could mean Pakistan would have to reduce public spending and increase the amount of taxes it collects. Both could be a drag on growth and are not exactly the moves a populist prime minister would like to make during his first days in office.
Pakistani economists say Mr. Khan faces a tightrope in trying to reconcile the fund's demands with the goals of China's infrastructure plans.
"These are our two masters," said Turab Hussain, an economics professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences. "How do you serve both?"
Though China is a member of the monetary fund and one of its biggest contributors, it has a different philosophy when making its own loans. Getting paid back is not its only, or maybe even primary, goal.
As it seeks new markets for its construction companies and new pathways to ship its goods, China is financing ambitious infrastructure projects across Central and South Asia. Beijing also views these projects as a way to project its power and secure allies.
The goal of the monetary fund, by contrast, is to stabilize distressed economies and help countries avoid unsustainable financial imbalances. It structures loans with strict conditions to increase the chances the country will clean up its finances and be able to pay back its loans.
While Chinese loans don't have the same strings attached, they still have strings. In Pakistan, much of the profit from new power plants and roads goes straight back to Chinese companies.
And as China showed in Sri Lanka, it can be a hard-knuckled debt collector. When Sri Lanka couldn't pay back the money it had borrowed, China snatched one of its biggest ports.
"Pakistan is clearly falling to the China side," said Sian Fenner, lead Asia economist for Oxford Economics, a global research firm.
Even with a bailout from the monetary fund, she added, "I don't see that changing."

Full text: The economic expansion in the United States celebrated its ninth birthday last month. If it survives another year, it will be the longest on record.
But eventually something will kill it. The question is what, and when.
While it's impossible to predict the details or timing of the next recession with any confidence, we can identify some emerging threats to the expansion -- and with a bit of imagination, picture how the recession of 2020 (or 2022, or whatever year it ends up being) may unfold.
To be clear, the economy is going gangbusters right now. The nation's G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the strongest quarter of growth since 2014. But when you speak with some of the people who fret and worry about economic risks for a living, a few factors come up repeatedly.
Perhaps most worrisome, many of the culprits in ending the expansion wouldn't necessarily arise in isolation. Rather, each one could make the others worse, meaning the next recession might have multiple causes.
So, with a bit of creative license, here are the three most plausible scenarios for the good times to end.
The Wile E. Coyote Moment
The Federal Reserve has had a relatively easy time over the last year or two. Both inflation and employment have been gradually moving toward healthy levels as the Fed has gradually raised interest rates.
The job facing the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell, is on the verge of getting trickier. The risk that the Fed will miscalibrate interest rate policy and cause a slowdown or a recession is rising, in part because of the timing of the tax cuts and spending increases enacted this year.
Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, has a term for their likely dilemma: the "train wreck 2020" scenario.
The United States economy is either at or near full employment, and inflation is already near 2 percent. With growth still strong, Mr. Guha says, the Fed may soon find itself needing to raise interest rates more aggressively to keep inflation in check.
But at the same time, mainstream macroeconomic models have the economic lift from tax cuts fading sometime between 2020 and 2022. That means the Fed could be raising interest rates to slow the economy just as tax policy is also working to slow the economy.
Both affect the economy with unpredictable lags, so it could prove hard for the Fed to set policies that can prevent both overheating in 2019 and 2020 and a downturn in 2021 and 2022.
"There is probably some kind of perfect path where the Fed could thread the needle on this," raising rates just enough to prevent overheating but not enough to leave rates so high as to risk a recession once the impact of tax cuts fades, Mr. Guha said. "But what's the likelihood that you'll thread that needle? It's not one you'd want to be betting the farm on."
The former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke put it more colorfully at a conference in June. The stimulative benefit of the tax cut "is going to hit the economy in a big way this year and the next year," he said. "And then in 2020, Wile E. Coyote is going to go off the cliff."
Pop Goes the Debt Bubble
The last two recessions started with the popping of an asset bubble. In 2001 it was dot-com stocks; in 2007 it was houses and the mortgage securities backed by them.
So it makes sense to look to various markets that might be getting bubbly in dangerous ways. And that search leads quickly to debt markets, both in the United States and overseas.
Corporations have loaded up on debt over the last decade, spurred by low interest rates and the opportunity to increase returns for shareholders. The value of corporate bonds outstanding rose by $2.6 trillion in the United States between 2007 and 2017, according to data from the McKinsey Global Institute -- rising to about 25 percent of G.D.P. from about 16 percent.
The rise in debt loads overseas, especially in emerging markets, is even greater, according to McKinsey's data -- as is a shift toward more debt being owed by riskier borrowers.
Essentially, businesses have been in a sweet spot for years, in which profits have gradually risen while interest rates have stayed low by historical measures. If either of those trends were to change, many companies with higher debt burdens might struggle to pay their bills and be at risk of bankruptcy.
The 2020 train wreck narrative could intersect with the corporate debt boom. If inflation were to get out of control and the Fed raised interest rates sharply, companies that can handle their debt payments at today's low interest rates might become more strained. Moreover, with federal deficits on track to rise in the years ahead, the federal government's borrowing needs could crowd out private borrowing, which would result in higher interest rates and even more challenges for indebted companies.
The International Monetary Fund included a warning about this run-up in global corporate debt in its most recent Global Financial Stability Report. If inflation were to rise more quickly, Tobias Adrian, an I.M.F. official, said in a news conference, it could "trigger a sudden tightening in financial conditions and a sharp fall in asset prices," which is I.M.F.-speak for the kind of thing that can endanger economic growth.
Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey, does not see the rise in debt as likely to cause some macroeconomic crisis, but said it could cause distress for individual companies.
"I think there will be a rise in defaults, but I'm not alarmed," she said. "I don't see systemic interlinkages."
The 2007 housing downturn became a 2008 global financial crisis because mortgage-backed securities were stuffed throughout a highly leveraged global financial system. The 2000 dot-com crash became a 2001 recession because it triggered a broader pullback in corporate investment.
The question is whether the potential challenges for corporate borrowers in the years ahead can remain more isolated than in those precedents.
The Trade War Cometh
Many words have been devoted to the economic risks of the trade war with China and other trading partners.
It is relatively easy to identify individuals and companies with plenty to lose. But exports are only about 8 percent of total G.D.P. in a $20 trillion United States economy. The direct economic cost of the American tariffs on imports and retaliatory actions by other countries announced so far should be half a percent of total G.D.P. or less, hardly enough to raise recession alarm bells.
"Trade just isn't that big," said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein. "I have a very hard time coming up with numbers that would be big enough to cause a recession based on the trade math alone."
For the trade war to trigger a recession, then, it would need to escalate to a much larger scale than the limited tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar cells, washing machines and $34 billion in Chinese products currently covered.
Even if it were to expand to encompass hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports, as President Trump has threatened, in order to cause a recession it would need to prompt a broader crisis of confidence.
Perhaps the economic damage will be higher in other countries that are more reliant on trade than the United States, causing a slowdown in the global economy that reduces demand for American products over and beyond what tariffs might cause.
A global slowdown could also cause huge losses in American stock and bond markets, as American companies' revenues abroad could plummet. That means a hit to Americans' wealth and more expensive capital for businesses. It could be the thing that triggers a popping of the corporate debt bubble.
For the trade war to cause a recession, it would probably need to do major damage to business confidence, and lead companies to hold back from capital investments because of uncertainty over the future of trade policy.
So a trade war alone might not directly cause a recession in the United States. But a trade war that causes a global economic slowdown, a market sell-off and an evaporation of business confidence certainly could.
What are the odds of that? In a recent report, Moody's Analytics puts what it calls the "trade conflagration" scenario, which includes a late 2019 recession, at 10 percent likelihood.
More likely, the report argued, trade brinkmanship will continue until global financial markets weaken, leading to a deal that results in some of the most severe risks being taken off the table.
Each week seems to bring alternating signals of the risks of a trade war. In mid-July, President Trump floated threats to apply tariffs to all Chinese imports, which would drastically escalate the trade war. By late July, he was making more conciliatory gestures toward the European Union about striking a deal to lower tariffs across the board.
Regardless of the true odds of the three scenarios, this much we know: The seeds of the next downturn have almost certainly already been planted. The question is which of them will grow into a problem big enough to matter.

Full text: CARACAS, Venezuela -- Explosions caused pandemonium at a military ceremony where President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela was speaking on Saturday, making the first lady flinch and sending National Guard troops scurrying in what administration officials called an assassination attempt using drones.
The president, who was unharmed, later told the nation, "To all of our friends in the world, I am fine, I am alive." He blamed right-wing elements and said, "The Bolivarian revolution keeps its path."
Mr. Maduro has presided over a spectacular economic collapse in Venezuela, where inflation is expected to reach one million percent this year despite the country's large oil reserves. Economists blame decades of mismanagement under Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.
The drone attack was the latest in a string of attempts in recent years to end the tenure of Mr. Maduro, who was declared the victor of an election in May that carries his term until 2025. No previous assaults have been as bold, though, and this appeared to have been the first assassination attempt on a head of state using drones.
It was an attack that seemed scripted for Hollywood: Off-camera explosions. Low-flying drones exploding midair. The president and first lady ducking for cover. Thousands of soldiers in a military parade suddenly fleeing in a stampede that was broadcast to the country, live.
Jorge Rodríguez, the communications minister, said the attackers had used "several flying devices" that were detonated near where the president was standing.
The attack came shortly after 5:30 p.m. during an event the government said was meant to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the country's National Guard.
During the president's speech, which was broadcast live on state television, the camera began to shake. Mr. Maduro then looked into the air as his wife, Cilia Flores, flinched and reached for another official to brace herself.
The video feed was interrupted, but Mr. Maduro could be heard continuing to talk as voices in the background yelled for people to flee.
The video feed then showed figures dressed in black breaking through a barrier from the sidelines of a wide street where hundreds of uniformed guardsmen were arrayed in formation. The figures in black ran toward the guardsmen, who abruptly fled in panic.
The transmission then cut off.
Mr. Maduro, addressing the nation just before 9 p.m., blamed right-wing elements in Venezuela and Colombia for the attack, and said that President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia was also responsible.
"All the investigations point to Bogotá," he said, accompanied by his ministers and military high command. "They have tried to kill me today." Mr. Maduro also suggested involvement by unidentified Americans.
Carlos Julio Rojas, an activist in Caracas, said that he had just arrived to protest water shortages when he felt the first explosion.
"We thought it was a bolt of lightning, but with the second explosion we could see the wall vibrating," he said. "We saw the soldiers running."
Mr. Rojas said neighbors told him they had seen drones approach and explode midair.
Figures aligned with the opposition condemned the attack.
"This is not the way out of the Venezuelan crisis," said Nicmer Evans, a political scientist who has campaigned with the opposition. "No one wants the exit to be the death of someone to resolve this country's situation."
It was not the first time that the government, which has presided over years of food shortages and rules with an authoritarian fist, has suffered a spectacular attack in its capital.
In June 2017, Óscar Pérez, a rogue police officer, commandeered a helicopter and used it in a brazen midday assault to drop grenades on the Supreme Court building and to fire on the Interior Ministry.
Mr. Pérez took to Instagram to call for others to join his cause and wage attacks against military bases, but he was killed by the government during an assault in January.
In another attack last year, a group of soldiers struck a military barracks west of Caracas. Like Mr. Pérez, they released videos calling for others to join their cause, but no rebellion materialized.
And in 2016, Mr. Maduro himself was attacked by a mob who chased him down the street banging pots and pans and screaming that they had no food.
Despite widespread discontent, Mr. Maduro continues to hold power. His most popular rivals were banned from running in elections this spring, and opposition parties boycotted and said the vote was rigged.
Analysts said Saturday that while the attack might be used to drum up support for the president, it was a deep embarrassment for Mr. Maduro.
"It will boost his rhetoric and give some substance to his conspiracy theories," said David Smilde, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group. "But the optics of this weaken him. The images of him being interrupted in mid-speech and the armed forces running away make him look vulnerable."
Mr. Smilde dismissed theories on Saturday that the government had organized a failed attack to build support for Mr. Maduro. He said the attack appeared "amateurish."
A United States State Department official said its Caracas embassy had issued a security alert. Leaders friendly to Mr. Maduro offered their support and cast suspicion on foreign powers.
"We energetically repudiate this new aggression and cowardly attack," said Evo Morales, Bolivia's president and a fellow leftist. "After failed attempts to topple him democratically, economically, politically and militarily, now the empire and its servants try to take his life."
That wasn't the reaction of some residents who stood nearby as officials fled.
"Running like rats," said a woman who filmed a video of the soldiers and officials fleeing on Saturday. "All of those fancy cars of the plugged-in elites trying to get away at the same time."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Is it a Bear in Bull's Clothing? Invest to Prepare for Either Case

Full text: When it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.
Growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a sign of a buoyant economy set to keep growing for years to come, continuing a nearly decade-long expansion since the financial crisis in 2008.
Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.
On Friday, the Labor Department released the jobs report for July, showing the economy added 157,000 jobs, fewer than the expected gain of 190,000. The jobless rate dropped to 3.9 percent, suggesting slack in the labor market, but wages are growing slowly.
Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.
"In 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it," said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. "There is no gray zone. It's only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor."
Who's correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.
After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.
A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country's wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.
Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:
Diversify Your Portfolio
Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States' largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia -- none of them has caused a market correction.
Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. "We've seen cash come in to buy on the dips," Mr. Crowell said.
And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.
"The stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years," Mr. Crowell said.
Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.
"Consumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market," said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. "One of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up."
Mr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.
Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.
Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.
He cited last week's sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. "Last week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply," he said.
Be Aware of Opportunities
Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.
"When we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn't going to be as much population growth and consumption," said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. "Most of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater."
Mr. Roth pointed to the reaction over the flattening of the yield curve, which tracks the difference between the interest rate on short-term bonds and long-term bonds. He said talk about the yield curve inverting -- which means long-term borrowing costs become less than those in the short term -- was premature.
"The strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that," Mr. Roth said. "We haven't even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there's significant opportunity right now."
Yet investors need to pay attention. "The alarm is when the yield curve inverts," he said. "It's a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market."
Actively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.
Pick Recession-Resistant Stocks
Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.
For instance, after saying so many harsh things about European trading partners, Mr. Trump embraced Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, just last week.
"The worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output," said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.
That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.
"The flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he's doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements," Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.
Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.
"You could think of a Google, where people's search habits aren't going to change dramatically if there's a recession and there's already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company," he said. "You could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out."
The opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.
Consider the Tax Implications
Facebook's loss of nearly 20 percent of its value in one day was substantial. But Mr. Crowell said it should not cause people to run from the Big Tech stocks like Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix.
What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. "It's prudent to be mindful that those four names don't define a diversified portfolio," he said.
Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.
Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.
"People don't look at the after-tax returns," Mr. Morgan said. "I've had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, 'Should we stay in or get out?"'
If an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.
Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.
Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.

Full text: Stocks rose on Friday after the Labor Department said hiring remained solid in July and strong quarterly earnings continued to boost the market.
American employers added 157,000 jobs last month, fewer than analysts expected. But the Labor Department said more jobs were added in May and June than it had previously reported. That made up for the shortfall in July.
There was little reaction to China's threat to put tariffs on $60 billion in American goods. Larger multinational companies climbed while smaller, United States-focused companies lagged the rest of the market. That is the opposite of what generally happens when investors are worried about trade tensions.
Bond prices edged higher, sending yields lower. Food companies and other big-dividend stocks rose.
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, says the data show the economy is likely to keep expanding, but it is not heating up in a way that would push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly.
"That's exactly what the market wants to see," he said. "This report is right in the sweet spot."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.13 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,840.35. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 136.42 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,462.58. The Nasdaq composite rose 9.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,812.01. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 8.73 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,673.37.
The benchmark S.&P. 500 rose for the fifth week in a row. Some of those gains have been small, but that is the longest winning streak for the index this year.
The slightly weak jobs report reflected the bankruptcy of Toys "R" Us and job cuts in local governments, which dragged down the hiring totals.
Hourly wage growth remained modest in July, and inflation-adjusted wages are actually decreasing because inflation has gradually picked up. Mr. McMillan, of Commonwealth, says another reason for the slip is that companies are hiring people with lower education levels because there are more of those workers available. While low or stagnant wages are good for company profits and stock prices, it could pose a problem for the economy.
"One of the real questions going forward is whether in fact consumers can keep spending at the rate they have," he said.
Kraft Heinz climbed after the maker of Oscar Mayer meats and Jell-O pudding said improved sales in Europe and Asia helped offset weaker results from the United States and Canada. The New York Post also reported that Kraft has had talks with Campbell Soup about a possible deal.
The Post said Kraft had not made an offer. Kraft Heinz gained 8.6 percent to $64.48, and Campbell rose 2.5 percent to $42.76.
The cereal maker Post Holdings climbed 8 percent to $93.58 after reporting quarterly revenue that was higher than analysts expected. The company also said the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners was investing in its private brands division, 8th Avenue Food & Provisions.
The video game publisher Take-Two Interactive jumped 9 percent to $123.41 percent after it topped Wall Street's expectations in the fiscal first quarter and raised its projections for the rest of the year. The company said players spent more money on "Grand Theft Auto Online" and "NBA 2K18" than it had expected. Rival Activision Blizzard lost 3.7 percent to $71.32 after a weak revenue forecast.
China and the United States continued to threaten each other with tariffs. China's government said on Friday that it would put tariffs on $60 billion in goods including coffee, honey and industrial chemicals if the United States goes ahead with a proposal to tax $200 billion in Chinese imports. The Trump administration said this week that it might put a tariff of 25 percent on those goods, a higher rate than it had threatened previously.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.95 percent from 2.98 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude lost 0.7 percent to $68.49 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, dipped 0.3 percent to $73.21 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline slipped 0.1 percent to $2.07 a gallon. Heating oil fell 0.2 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1.3 percent to $2.85 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Energy companies traded lower after some disappointing quarterly reports. Noble Energy sank 7.9 percent to $32.89, and EOG Resources fell 2.8 percent to $122.41. Energy stocks have lagged the rest of the market in recent weeks after making big gains earlier this year.
Gold picked up 0.3 percent to $1,223.20 an ounce. Silver added 0.5 percent to $15.46 an ounce. Copper gained 0.9 percent to $2.76 a pound.
The dollar weakened slightly. It fell to 111.23 yen from 111.69 yen. The euro fell to $1.1578 from $1.1587.
The British FTSE 100 jumped 1.1 percent. Germany's DAX added 0.6 percent and the CAC 40 in France edged up 0.3 percent.
Japan's Nikkei 225 added less than 0.1 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gave up 0.2 percent. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8 percent.

Full text: The least educated American workers, who took the hardest hit in the Great Recession, were also among the slowest to harvest the gains of the recovery. Now they are a striking symbol of a strong economy.
The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma fell to 5.1 percent in July, the Labor Department reported Friday, the lowest since the government began collecting data on such workers in 1992. At the economy's nadir in the summer of 2009, the unemployment rate for high school dropouts hit 15.6 percent, more than three times the peak unemployment rate for college graduates.
Buffeted by technological change and seemingly out of place in an economy where skills and credentials are in ever more demand, this cohort struggled while more educated workers scored jobs and promotions and rose on the economic ladder.
High school dropouts make up 7.2 percent of the labor force, and some experts doubted they and other low-skilled workers would ever fully recover from the effects of the recession, said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics at the University of Michigan.
"As economists, we worried these workers would be shut out forever," she said. "But the long duration of the recovery has pulled them back in. As the economy adds more jobs, employers have had to dig a little deeper."
The improvement in the fortunes of less-educated workers was a highlight in a jobs report that showed continuing gains across a broad variety of sectors.
Over all in July, employers increased payrolls by 157,000, while the unemployment rate edged downward to 3.9 percent, near the 18-year low achieved in May.
The data echoed other positive economic news recently, including a report last week showing the economy grew by 4.1 percent in the second quarter.
And the headlines about President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum and a widening trade war with China seem to have done little to put a damper on hiring. The manufacturing sector, which is particularly sensitive to exports, was robust, adding 37,000 jobs.
Although the payroll increase in July was slightly below what Wall Street was expecting, upward revisions for May and June alleviated fears of a slowdown.
Several economists linked the shortfall to the shutdown of Toys "R" Us, and the loss of 32,000 jobs at sporting goods, book and hobby stores last month.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve upgraded its view of the economy's underlying condition from "solid" to "strong." The central bank remains on course to raise interest rates twice more this year, in September and December, to avert overheating.
Other indicators suggest the recovery is finally extending its reach. The Labor Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes workers forced to take part-time jobs because full-time positions are unavailable, fell to 7.5 percent in July, the lowest since 2001.
All this has translated into better economic opportunities for workers without a college degree, who account for a majority of the work force. It is a contingent that was championed by Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign, and one that both parties want to appeal to in the midterm elections in November.
The White House was quick to note that the economy is in the midst of the longest monthly streak of job growth in history.
And after 94 consecutive months of job creation, bosses and human resource departments are recalibrating their requirements.
"You definitely get the sense that employers are willing to look at workers they haven't looked at in the past," said Martha Gimbel, director of economic research at Indeed.com, the employment website.
Unemployed Americans who might not have put feelers out in the past are also venturing back into the hunt for a job, she said. On Indeed's search engine, much of the growth in queries lately has been for positions like full-time cashier, mobile home park manager, maintenance person and fulfillment associate.
"This is an indicator that low-skilled workers are seeing opportunities for themselves in the labor market," Ms. Gimbel said.
Until recently at Steel Ceilings in Johnstown, Ohio, the company's president, Rick Sandor, insisted on a couple of years' experience in metal fabrication before considering applicants. But he's had a harder time lately finding workers for his company, where shifts run from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. and temporary positions start at $14 per hour.
He now settles for candidates who show mechanical skills, like carpentry or heating and cooling repair. Mr. Sandor is willing to waive the requirement for a high school diploma as well and has even hired applicants with what he terms "minor" prison sentences.
"If a person was truly trying to get their life back together, we thought it would be helpful to offer them a job," he said.
Unemployment for less-skilled workers has been dropping for several years, with a pickup in hiring in sectors like manufacturing, construction and parts of health care. And to be sure, the month-to-month figures for unemployment among high school dropouts are volatile.
But the long-term trend is clear, as is hiring among the sectors responsible for it. Last month, the leisure and hospitality field recorded a 40,000 gain in positions, with half of that coming from restaurants.
For example, Buffalo Wings & Rings, a restaurant chain with 60 locations in 13 states, has been stepping up hiring and opening new restaurants.
Many outlets have seen double-digit sales growth over the past year, and some are up as much as 40 percent, said Nader Masadeh, the company's chief executive. The tax cuts that took effect in January are playing a role, Mr. Masadeh said -- most families may have gotten a relatively small tax cut, but it is enough to fuel a few more nights out.
"People feel good. They're going out and spending more money," he said. "In our segment, $50 feeds you and your family."
Still, the hot economy brings challenges of its own. At an annual gathering of the company's franchisees in June, Mr. Masadeh said, he was bombarded with questions about how to retain talent when workers can readily walk out the door and find another job. And costs are rising throughout his business.
"Right now the economy is great, but we're also seeing higher construction costs, higher commodity items, shortages of labor, so there's always something that counterbalances something else," he said.
That pressure, however, has not resulted in much fatter paychecks for most workers. The Labor Department said average hourly earnings ticked modestly higher in July, putting the annual rise at 2.7 percent. That's below the pace of inflation in recent months.
One reason for the lack of big raises is that a substantial number of workers remain on the sidelines, including the less-skilled ones who are now gradually coming back, said Simona Mocuta, senior economist with State Street Global Advisors.
"We are bringing unemployment way below 4.5 percent, which the Fed considers full employment," Ms. Mocuta said. "But we are getting very modest wage inflation. This is an issue not just for the U.S., but in every other developed market."
"Because the labor market is tight, less-educated workers have more of a chance of getting hired," she added. "For people with the highest level of education, it's easier to find jobs even when the economy isn't doing well."

Fed Keeps Rates Steady But Signals It Will Raise Them, Defying Trump

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its already high marks for the state of the economy on Wednesday, refusing to bow to President Trump's recent push for the central bank to pause its march toward higher interest rates.
Federal Open Market Committee officials voted unanimously at the end of their two-day meeting to keep interest rates unchanged, at a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. But the statement they issued keeps the Fed on track to raise rates next month and again in December, after two rate increases in the first half of the year. Its revised assessments of economic growth and the inflation rate could signal that those coming increases are even more likely than investors previously thought.
The statement declared that the job market continues to strengthen and that "economic activity has been rising at a strong rate." That is a change from the June statement, when the Fed said economic growth was "solid." Officials also improved their assessment of consumer spending, saying that it has "grown strongly."
The Fed statement did not convey any concern that Mr. Trump's trade policies could hamper growth, nor did it suggest worry about the sluggish pace of wage increases for most workers. The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, fielded a barrage of questions from members of Congress on those topics in testimony last month.
In their statement on Wednesday, Fed officials said the overall inflation rate and the rate that excludes volatile food and energy prices both "remain near 2 percent," which is the Fed's target level. In June, officials said those rates "have moved close to 2 percent."
In keeping with previous statements, officials continued to signal they will raise rates again soon, saying they expect "that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."
The slight changes reflect improving economic data in recent weeks. Economic growth clocked in above a 4 percent rate for the second quarter, and inflation ran slightly above 2 percent.
The statement did not come with an updated set of economic forecasts issued after the meeting or a question-and-answer session with Mr. Powell, who gives quarterly news conferences now but has chosen to pick up the pace next year and brief reporters after every Fed meeting. So there was no direct response to Mr. Trump, who has broken recent protocol and publicly criticized the Fed's path of rate increases, worrying that they will dampen a strong economic run.
Here are four takeaways from Wednesday's Fed statement:
The economy is running hot, but inflation fears remain contained.
Mr. Powell has consistently played down the notion that the economy is close to "overheating" -- growing so fast, with unemployment so low, that it sets off a rapid escalation in wages and consumer prices. The economy's 4.1 percent growth rate in the second quarter certainly is rapid, but its current pace for the year, about 3 percent, is only slightly above the Fed's most recent forecasts. The statement acknowledged that acceleration but expressed no concern over it.
"Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced," officials wrote, meaning that the likelihood is about the same that things could get better or worse in the economy. It's standard language of late for the Fed, and in keeping with analysts' expectations.
"We expect only minor changes to the policy statement to reflect the latest developments in the economy," economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note on Tuesday.
Trade fears aren't showing up in data.
As Mr. Powell noted in his testimony before Congress last month, the Fed has heard a lot anecdotally from businesses about fears of Mr. Trump's tariffs and threats hurting investment and growth -- but those fears have not shown up in the economic data. That's partly because a pre-tariff surge in soybean exports helped prop up growth in the second quarter, a trend that economists warn will reverse in the back half of the year.
"The escalating trade rhetoric hampers forecasters' near-term view of the economy, which is a particular problem for the Fed currently as it attempts to engineer a soft landing from the current expansion," Deutsche Bank researchers wrote this week.
A question before the meeting was whether the trade war had escalated enough to merit a warning in the statement.
Answer: It has not.
The Fed's next move still looks to be a rate increase.
Nothing in the statement suggested that officials are worried about growth or prepared to slow their pace of rate increases, a development that defies some recent Fed attempts to leave its options open on next policy moves.
Even when the Fed is not raising or cutting rates, it still sends signals to the market about where monetary policy is headed, through subtle, but crucial, changes in language. Some of those recent changes have sent a purposefully muddy signal, apparently meant to demonstrate flexibility to respond to events in the economy.
For example, in his testimony last month, Mr. Powell, the leader of the Federal Open Market Committee, said that "with a strong job market, inflation close to our objective and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the F.O.M.C. believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate."
Analysts saw that phrase and honed in on "for now."
"The inclusion of those words diluted the signal for continued gradual tightening, but not necessarily in a dovish or a hawkish way," Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote this week. "Rather, as we have been discussing, their inclusion continued the recent trend toward reduced forward guidance: The pace of tightening could be stepped up or slowed down, depending on the data."
That still seems possible, particularly from Mr. Powell's recent testimony, but the statement only points one way for now.
The Fed will not be bullied.
Mr. Trump has made no secret of his disagreement with the Fed's rate increases, tweeting last month that the central bank's moves undercut the United States economy and that its pattern of rate increases "hurts all that we have done."
The president, who had accused the Fed of keeping interest rates artificially low to help President Barack Obama, now appears ready to blame the central bank for trying to slow down a booming economy.
Mr. Powell has insisted the Fed is an independent body that moves in response to economic data, not political pressure. The statement seems to back that up. We'll have to wait for direct questioning at the next meeting, but for now, the Fed is telling Mr. Trump, in its very Fed way, to mind his own business.

Full text: Apple surged to its biggest gain in a year and a half Wednesday and drew closer to $1 trillion in value after it reported stronger iPhone sales and rising prices. But losses for energy and industrial companies left major stock indexes lower.
Already the most valuable company in the U.S., Apple was the biggest gainer of any S&P 500 stock Wednesday and the technology giant finished at another record high.
That made up for a lot of losses elsewhere in the market. Investors sold industrial stocks following reports that the Trump administration is considering a higher tax rate on Chinese imports. Energy and materials companies fell with the price of oil, and metals and car companies also declined.
After the close of trading, the administration said it might put a 25 percent tax on $200 billion in imports from China. It proposed a 10 percent tax in July, shortly after it placed a 25 percent tax on $34 billion worth of imports. China again threatened to retaliate.
China can't match the size of the tariffs the U.S. could put on Chinese exports. But Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management, said the Chinese government is already reacting to the new tariffs and the larger proposed ones by pumping more money into the economy and weakening its currency.
"They're sending a strong signal that they cannot just withstand (tariffs), but they can manage through a period of turmoil related to the negotiations," Nixon said.
The S&P 500 index slid 2.93 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,813.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 81.37 points, or 0.3 percent, to 25,333.82.
The Nasdaq composite added 35.50 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,707.29, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks lost 1.54 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,669.26. Almost two-thirds of the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange traded lower.
The S&P 500 index rose 3.6 percent in July in spite of the trade war between the U.S. and China. The markets got a lift from strong company earnings as well as efforts by the U.S. and European Union to resolve their trade differences.
As expected, the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged, but suggested it's likely to raise rates again in September. High-dividend stocks like consumer products makers sank as bond yields increased. Automakers fell as they reported their monthly sales and Ferrari plunged after it said it might not make some of the profit goals laid out by Sergio Marchionne, its late former CEO.
Apple said the average selling price for the iPhone jumped 20 percent in its latest quarter and its third-quarter profit and sales both surpassed analyst projections. Apple's third fiscal quarter is usually its weakest. The company's forecast for fourth-quarter revenue also topped Wall Street estimates.
Apple surged 5.9 percent to $201.50. That gives the company a value of $973 billion, based on its latest quarterly filing.
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and suggested it plans to keep raising rates as long as the economy stays healthy. The central bank noted the labor market continues to get stronger and the economy is growing at a strong clip, while inflation has reached its target of 2 percent a year.
Automakers mostly slid. Ferrari dropped 11 percent to $118 after new CEO Louis Camilleri warned that the company might not be able to reach the revenue targets outlined by Marchionne.
Industrial companies changed course again and took sharp losses.
Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3 percent from 2.96 percent.
Higher yields force interest rates on mortgages and other loans higher, making it more profitable for banks to lend money. However rising yields drew investors to bonds and away from high-dividend stocks like consumer goods makers.
SodaStream jumped 26.3 percent to $110.30 after the maker of beverage carbonation systems raised its annual forecasts following a strong quarterly report. Clothing maker Hanesbrands plunged 19.3 percent to $17.96 after it posted a smaller-than-expected profit and said Target won't renew a contract for an exclusive line of Champion clothing when the deal expires in January 2020.
Benchmark U.S. crude dropped 2 percent to $67.66 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 2.5 percent to $72.39 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline sank 1.7 percent to $2.05 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 1.9 percent to $2.10 a gallon. Natural gas dipped 0.9 percent to $2.76 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The price of gold gave up 0.5 percent to $1,227.60 an ounce. Silver fell 0.7 percent to $15.45 an ounce and copper plunged 3 percent to $2.75 a pound.
The dollar fell to 111.56 yen from 111.83 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1664 from $1.1697.
Britain's FTSE 100 dropped 1.2 percent and Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent. The French CAC 40 dipped 0.2 percent.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.9 percent and South Korea's Kospi added 0.5 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 0.9 percent.

Full text: It seems that last year's $1.5 trillion tax-cut package, despite heavily favoring affluent investors and corporate titans over workers of modest means, was insufficiently generous to the wealthy to satisfy certain members of the Trump administration. So now Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin offers an exciting plan to award an additional $100 billion tax cut to the richest Americans.
Specifically, Mr. Mnuchin has directed his department to explore allowing investors to take inflation into account when calculating their capital gains tax bill. (Instead of determining how much value a stock had gained by subtracting its selling price from its original purchase price, investors would first adjust the purchase price to reflect what it would be in inflation-adjusted dollars.) Fans of the move argue that it would benefit the wide swath of middle-class Americans who own stocks, along with all those older Americans whose homes have appreciated in value over the decades. And, indeed, many middle-class Americans could wind up with a sliver of savings. But not all investors are equal. Independent analyses say that a whopping 97 percent of the savings from Mr. Mnuchin's plan would go to the highest 10 percent of income earners. (For the severely math challenged, that would leave a paltry 3 percent to be divvied up by the remaining 90 percent of the country.) Two-thirds of all savings would go to the top 0.1 percent of income earners.
So in rough dollar terms, the administration is looking to hand $66 billion-plus to the ultrarich like -- just to name a few -- Mr. Mnuchin, who did very, very well during his years at Goldman Sachs (and already has a net worth estimated at $252 million); Wilbur Ross, the loaded secretary of commerce (estimated net worth: $506.5 million); Betsy DeVos, the even richer secretary of education (about $1.1 billion); and, of course, the extended Trump-Kushner clan. (To be sure, Ivanka Trump could use a financial pick-me-up to help take the sting out of having to close down her clothing brand.)
Thus die the final vestiges of this president's pretty little narrative about being a populist hero.
Hard-core economic conservatives and anti-tax activists have long pushed to index capital gains taxes for inflation under the dubious argument that it would bolster the overall economy. Unsurprisingly, this crusade has failed to catch fire in Congress, where even anti-tax lawmakers can be skittish about so blatantly playing to the plutocrats.
But here's where Mr. Mnuchin's plan is so politically inspired. He hopes to cut Congress out of this deal altogether by declaring it a regulatory matter and allowing Treasury to unilaterally redefine the term "cost." No need to subject this process to the messiness of the legislative process when it is so much more efficient to claim jurisdiction for oneself and change the meaning of words to suit one's purpose. Behold Trumpian logic at its purest.
One potential sticking point is that Mr. Mnuchin's proposal may not be, strictly speaking, legal. Congress has never authorized the Treasury Department to interpret tax law in the bizarre way the secretary is advocating. And the last time such a possibility was floated, in 1992, President George Bush's Justice Department shot it down with extreme prejudice. The department's Office of Legal Counsel went so far as to issue a 23-page opinion laying out in excruciating detail why the Treasury Department does not have the legal authority to index capital gains for inflation by means of regulation.
So there's that.
But the Trump administration isn't one to fret about legal niceties when pursuing its pet projects. It much prefers to plow forward and let the court challenges shake out as they will. You win some. (Think travel ban, eventually, after multiple revisions.) You lose some. (Snatching migrant kids from their families at the border.) But as the adage goes, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Mr. Mnuchin may well figure that the risk is worth the potential gain for himself, his wealthy friends and, more broadly, members of the Republican Party's donor class who might very well show their gratitude by channeling some of their tax savings into party coffers. Besides, a case like this could take a while to wend its way through the courts, and who knows how many millions could be saved in the meantime.
Beyond pure greed and a desire to suck up to the 0.1 percent, it's hard to see any real-world logic behind this move. As political messaging goes, it seems flat-out bonkers to position Republicans as the party of the superrich -- especially during a critical midterm election campaign with control of both houses of Congress on the line.
But at this point, President Trump may have decided that it doesn't much matter what economic policies he pursues so long as he can keep the base distracted and fired up with his relentless culture warring. (Build the wall! Lock her up! Gorsuch! Kavanaugh! Stand for the anthem or be fired!) In early 2016, candidate Trump famously boasted that he "could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody" and not lose any voters. Since becoming president, he has been given little cause by his base -- or by Republicans in Congress -- to doubt his political infallibility. As such, with Mr. Mnuchin's proposal, as with so many other moves undertaken by this administration, Mr. Trump's thinking may boil down to little more than, "Why the heck not?"
This may strike some as a depressingly cynical reading of what is being proposed. What, you thought their motives were pure?

Full text: U.S. stocks rose Tuesday following strong results from industrial and health care companies as well as a report that the U.S. and China are trying to restart trade talks. Small companies rallied.
Bloomberg News reported that representatives of the U.S. and China are looking for ways to open new talks to end their trade war. The report cited two people familiar with those efforts and said there was no agreement about a time frame for talks or what issues would be discussed. Earlier this month both nations placed import taxes on $34 billion worth of goods, and they've been threatening more severe measures.
The trade dispute could affect sales for many industrial companies and new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports are also sending costs for those companies higher. Companies including Deere and Caterpillar jumped while engine maker Cummins rose after its second-quarter report.
Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon, a unit of BNY Mellon Asset Management, said investors have mostly stayed calm during the trade dispute because they think most of the tensions will get worked out by November. Rising corporate profits, which have been helped by the recent tax cuts, are also helping.
"Everybody thinks a deal will be cut before the midterms," he said. "That allows you to shake off the bad news and embrace the good."
Earnings from companies including Pfizer and Illumina gave health care stocks a boost and real estate companies climbed as well. Banks were left out of the rally as interest rates slipped.
The S&P 500 index rose 13.69 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,816.29, making up most of the losses it took on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 108.36 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,415.19. The Nasdaq composite added 41.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,671.79. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks jumped 17.67 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,670.80.
Deere, a farm equipment maker whose profits would be hurt by China's tariffs on soybeans, surged 4.8 percent to $144.79. Engine maker Cummins gained 4.1 percent to $142.81 after a better-than-expected second-quarter report. After a slump on Monday, construction equipment maker Caterpillar rose 2.9 percent to $143.80.
Genetic testing tools maker Illumina raised its forecasts after a strong second quarter and its stock climbed 12.1 percent to $324.36. Pfizer rose 3.5 percent to $39.93 after the biggest U.S. drugmaker topped analysts' projections and raised its forecasts for the year.
Elsewhere, cable company Charter Communications advanced 3.6 percent to $304.58 after its quarterly profit surpassed analysts' estimates.
High-powered laser maker IPG Photonics nosedived 26.9 percent to $164.04 after it said demand from Europe and China worsened during the second quarter. The company's revenue forecast for the current quarter fell far short of Wall Street's estimates.
Apple climbed 2.5 percent to $195.14 in aftermarket trading after reporting that its third-quarter profit and sales both topped analysts' projections. Its fourth-quarter sales forecast was also better than expected.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending grew another 0.4 percent in June, and a key measurement of inflation is up 2.2 percent over the last year. For the last four months, inflation has equaled or been slightly higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. The Fed is meeting Tuesday and Wednesday but isn't expected to raise interest rates again until later this year.
The Labor Department said wages and benefits for U.S. workers continued to rise, but they grew at a slightly slower pace in the second quarter. That's a sign that even though unemployment is low, wages aren't picking up.
Technology companies ended a three-day losing streak. Chip equipment maker KLA-Tencor soared 10.5 percent to $117.42 after it topped Wall Street expectations in the second quarter. Chipmaker Qualcomm gained 3.3 percent to $64.09 as it started to buy back stock from shareholders.
Apple added 0.2 percent to $190.29 as investors waited for its quarterly report.
Technology stocks had plunged more than 5 percent in three days, and they regained only a small portion of that Tuesday.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.96 percent from 2.97 percent.
Economic growth in the 19-country eurozone slowed to 0.3 percent in the second quarter as trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe hurt business confidence. Since then, the EU and U.S. have agreed to hold off more tariffs and try to free up trade, though details remain hazy.
The French CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 gained 0.6 percent. The DAX in Germany added 0.1 percent.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose less than 0.1 percent after the Bank of Japan didn't announce any major changes to its monetary policies. South Korea's Kospi added 0.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.5 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude lost 2 percent to $68.76 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 1 percent to $74.25 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline slid 1.4 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Heating oil shed 1.8 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 0.5 percent to $2.78 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,223.60 an ounce. Silver added 0.1 percent to $15.56 an ounce. Copper rose 1.4 percent to $2.83 a pound.
The dollar rose to 111.83 yen from 111 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1697 from $1.1710.

__________
President Trump's trade war is making life uncomfortable for some large American corporations, but they have found a way to reduce the pain: Pass it on to customers.
The Trump administration's tariffs have pushed up the prices of steel and aluminum and have raised costs for companies that make everything from cars and tractors to dishwashers. These companies face a choice. They can bear the higher costs themselves and report weaker profits, which might crater their stocks. Or they can charge more for their products, in effect making their customers bear much of the financial burden of the tariffs, at least for a while.
Many companies are opting for the latter.
As they report second-quarter earnings, they are going out of their way to let their shareholders know that it is customers who are paying.
Caterpillar, while reporting record profits on Monday, predicted that tariffs would add as much $200 million to its costs in the second half of this year. The company added, however, that it would try to partly offset the hit by increasing the prices of its products. Whirlpool, which uses steel and aluminum in its dishwashers and washing machines, said it had hoisted its prices this year. Coca-Cola said last week that it had increased prices in the United States in part because of tariff-related cost increases.
"It's been very hard for companies to pass costs through to prices for many years," said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. "The thing about tariffs is that they make a very good excuse: Blame it on Trump."
The impact of the tariffs, and who bears their brunt, could have big implications for the wider economy. The tariffs are raising expenses at a time when companies are paying more for other materials and labor. If most of these costs are passed on to consumers, inflation, already rising after being dormant for years, could accelerate. What is more, since the metals tariffs have been in effect only since the start of June, their full impact has not been felt.
Some companies can't foist higher prices on their customers because of the risk to their sales. General Motors, for instance, slashed its profit forecast last week in part because of higher steel prices.
And telling investors that customers will pay up does not mean they will believe you.
Still, some economists say companies may be able to get away with charging more for a while longer. With the economy buoyant, there may be enough customers who can afford the increases. David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, noted that a deeper dig into wage data showed strong rates of growth, and, he added, a recent survey showed that consumers appeared to be stepping up purchases of big-ticket items in anticipation of price increases.
The Federal Reserve is raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. But the tariffs, along with other pressures, could prompt the Fed to tap the brakes more firmly, which could spook the stock market.
"We are seeing tariffs adding to classic late-cycle inflation pressures," Mr. Rosenberg said. "This may force the Fed to do more than the market has priced in."
Much depends on whether President Trump follows through on his proposed trade policies. To some extent, the strength of corporate earnings has bolstered America's position in its trade fights. Profit margins for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are at their highest in many years, in part because of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, Mr. Yardeni noted. But the longer the trade war drags on, the harder it will be for corporate America's bottom line to hold up.
"Trump gave companies a record profit margin, and now he might take some of that away," Mr. Yardeni said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is considering bypassing Congress to grant a $100 billion tax cut mainly to the wealthy, a legally tenuous maneuver that would cut capital gains taxation and fulfill a long-held ambition of many investors and conservatives.
Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina this month that his department was studying whether it could use its regulatory powers to allow Americans to account for inflation in determining capital gains tax liabilities. The Treasury Department could change the definition of "cost" for calculating capital gains, allowing taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset, such as a home or a share of stock, for inflation when it sells.
"If it can't get done through a legislation process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we'll consider that," Mr. Mnuchin said, emphasizing that he had not concluded whether the Treasury Department had the authority to act alone. "We are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth."
Currently, capital gains taxes are determined by subtracting the original price of an asset from the price at which it was sold and taxing the difference, usually at 20 percent. If a high earner spent $100,000 on stock in 1980, then sold it for $1 million today, she would owe taxes on $900,000. But if her original purchase price was adjusted for inflation, it would be about $300,000, reducing her taxable "gain" to $700,000. That would save the investor $40,000.
The move would face a near-certain court challenge. It could also reinforce a liberal critique of Republican tax policy at a time when Republicans are struggling to sell middle-class voters on the benefits of the tax cuts that President Trump signed into law late last year.
"At a time when the deficit is out of control, wages are flat and the wealthiest are doing better than ever, to give the top 1 percent another advantage is an outrage and shows the Republicans' true colors," said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. "Furthermore, Mr. Mnuchin thinks he can do it on his own, but everyone knows this must be done by legislation."
Capital gains taxes are overwhelmingly paid by high earners, and they were untouched in the $1.5 trillion tax law that Mr. Trump signed last year. Independent analyses suggest that more than 97 percent of the benefits of indexing capital gains for inflation would go to the top 10 percent of income earners in America. Nearly two-thirds of the benefits would go to the super wealthy -- the top 0.1 percent of American income earners.
Making the change by fiat would be a bold use of executive power -- one that President George Bush's administration considered and rejected in 1992, after concluding that the Treasury Department did not have the power to make the change on its own. Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, has long advocated it.
Conservative advocates for the plan say that even if it is challenged in court, it could still goose the economy by unleashing a wave of asset sales. "No matter what the courts do, you'll get the main economic benefit the day, the month after Treasury does this," said Ryan Ellis, a tax lobbyist in Washington and former tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform.
Liberal tax economists see little benefit in it beyond another boon to the already rich.
"It would just be a very generous addition to the tax cuts they've already handed to the very wealthy," said Alexandra Thornton, senior director of tax policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, "and it would play into the hands of their tax advisers, who would be well positioned to take advantage of the loopholes that were opened by it."
The decades-long push to change the taxation of investment income has spurred a legal debate over the original meaning of the word "cost" in the Revenue Act of 1918, and over the authority of the Treasury Department to interpret the word in regulations.
"I think we ought to look at not penalizing Americans for inflation," said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who said he would like to see the Treasury Department make the change through regulation.
Mr. Bush's Treasury Department determined that redefining "cost" by regulatory fiat would be illegal -- a conclusion buttressed by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which found that "cost" means the price that was paid for something.
But conservatives have disputed this conclusion. Pushing Mr. Trump to make the change, Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, has cited a 2002 Supreme Court decision in a case between Verizon Communications and the Federal Communications Commission that said regulators have leeway in defining "cost" to make the case that the Treasury Department can act alone.
"This would be in terms of its economic impact over the next several years, and long term, similar in size as the last tax cut," Mr. Norquist said, suggesting that making the change would raise revenue for the government by creating new economic efficiencies and faster growth. "I think it's going to happen and it's going to be huge."
He and others said last year's tax cut would also pay for itself, but despite strong economic growth, corporate tax receipts have plunged and the deficit has soared.
According to the budget model used by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, indexing capital gains to inflation would reduce government revenues by $102 billion over a decade, with 86 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent. A July report from the Congressional Research Service said that the additional debt incurred by indexing capital gains to inflation would most likely offset any stimulus that the smaller tax burden provided to the economy.
"It is unlikely, however, that a significant, or any, effect on economic growth would occur from a stand-alone indexing proposal," the report said.
Michael Graetz, a tax law professor at Columbia University who worked in the Treasury Department's tax policy office when the department determined that taxing capital gains could not be changed by regulation, said he still thought that the decision to change the law should fall to Congress.
He pointed out that the department would have to make decisions about what types of assets would be indexed and that it would essentially be picking winners and losers.
"There's certainly no legal authority for Treasury to choose what assets to treat this way," Mr. Graetz said.
Two law professors, Daniel J. Hemel of the University of Chicago and David Kamin of New York University, wrote in a paper last month that states, charities and other entities could sue the Treasury Department if it tried to make the change. Mr. Kamin said in an interview that the change would create opportunities for gaming the tax code, in part because other parts of the code, such as interest payments, would still be unadjusted for inflation.
A framework for a second round of tax cuts, released by the Ways and Means Committee last week, did not address taxation of capital gains. It is highly unlikely that Congress will pass another tax bill this year because of the slim Republican majority in the Senate.
Democratic senators have written to Mr. Mnuchin, urging him to stand down.
"Treasury does not have the unilateral authority to take our tax code and expose it to widespread gamesmanship," said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. "Indexing capital gains under this regime is a boondoggle for the rich, plain and simple."
A Treasury Department official wrote Mr. Wyden a two-paragraph reply this month. "We appreciate your taking the time to express the thoughts outlined in the letter," it read. "We will take them under advisement."

Full text: TECHNOLOGY
Apple releases its earnings report while trade tensions loom.
Apple, the world's most valuable company, is the last of the big tech companies to report earnings this quarter, scheduled for after the market closes on Tuesday. Apple has been largely insulated from many of the issues that have recently hit other tech companies, including regulatory fines and data misuse, and it is expected to report another round of big profits. Apple, however, may soon face headwinds outside its control with an accelerating trade war between the United States and China. The company assembles many of its products, including iPhones, in China, while also depending on the country as its No. 3 market.

ECONOMY
The European Union will issue an estimate of economic growth.
The European Union statistics agency will publish an estimate of its economic growth during the second quarter on Tuesday, shedding light on whether trade tensions are taking a toll on growth. President Trump's tariffs on European steel and aluminum affect a relatively small sliver of the economy. But Mr. Trump's aggressive stance on trade may have unsettled European business executives and made them reluctant to invest, which would cut into gross domestic product.

ECONOMY
The Fed will probably hold interest rates steady.
The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates steady at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, does not have a news conference scheduled, which means Fed watchers will have to wait to hear his opinion of President Trump's recent criticism of the Fed's interest rate increases this year.

______
AUTO INDUSTRY
Tesla, facing supply and financial concerns, reports earnings.
Tesla reports its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, and again the focus will be less on the expected loss than on any update on the number of Model 3 sedans the company has built. The electric-car maker is striving to be able to produce at least 5,000 Model 3s per week. The company's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said that Tesla will be profitable in the second half of the year if it can reach that number. Tesla built that many in the final seven days of June, but it's unclear if it has been able to sustain that level of output. Analysts expect a loss of about $3.50 a share for the quarter. A year ago, the company reported a loss of $2.04 a share.

AUTO INDUSTRY
New vehicle sales are expected to have held steady in July.
On Wednesday, automakers will report new vehicle sales in July in the United States. The market researcher Cox Automotive said it expected sales of 1.4 million cars and light trucks, in line with the same period from a year ago. So far this year, new car sales are coming in stronger than expected. Sales in the first half of the year are running ahead of the same period in 2017. But Cox said sales could soften in the second half, with both gasoline prices and interest rates on the rise, and some manufacturers reaching their limits on incentives and discounts.

AUTO INDUSTRY
European automakers may issue tariff warnings in their earnings reports.
The German automakers Volkswagen and BMW will report earnings this week, and they will most likely warn about the ill effects of the trade disputes involving the United States on their sales and profits. BMW, which reports on Thursday, faces stiff tariffs on cars it exports from a factory in South Carolina to China, which is retaliating against punitive measures enacted by the United States. Volkswagen, which reports on Wednesday, has factories in Tennessee and Mexico and faces higher production costs because of American tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as uncertainty about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

ECONOMY
Bank of England may raise interest rates. But maybe not.
The Bank of England's monetary policy committee is widely expected raise the bank rate slightly to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent on Thursday, but weak wage growth and inflation numbers have made the move less certain. A rise could lift the pound, but the currency is also under pressure from concerns around Britain's departure from the European Union.

ECONOMY
The unemployment rate is expected to return to 3.9 percent.
On Friday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on the nation's hiring and unemployment for July. Wall Street analysts are looking for another strong month of growth with payrolls expected to expand by 190,000. The jobless rate is expected to decrease to 3.9 percent; it inched back up to 4 percent in June because a surge of Americans decided to join the labor force, a sign that more people are optimistic about their employment prospects. Wage growth, though, has continued to disappoint. Economists are expecting the average hourly wage to climb by 0.3 percent, which would keep the annual year-over-year increase level at 2.7 percent.

Full text: ATTAPEU, Laos -- As heavy rains lashed southern Laos over the weekend, volunteers from many countries were continuing to help victims of earlier flooding caused by the failure of a foreign-funded hydropower dam.
"It shows the spirit of humanity," Yen Saisamon, a 17-year-old Laotian volunteer, said on Friday at a relief center in the town of Attapeu, where cardboard boxes of instant noodles and condiments were labeled in Chinese, Thai and Vietnamese.
Yet if foreigners are helping now, they also share a piece of the blame.
The accident at the billion-dollar Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydroelectric project last week has cast a harsh spotlight on the unspoken compact between the ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party and giant outside financial interests: The companies get access to Lao's abundant natural resources; Laotian officials get some revenue; and no one will cast undue scrutiny on investment projects that exacerbate rural poverty -- or, in this case, kill innocent villagers.
Laos's one-party communist government and the international financial institutions that support it have long embraced a "high-wire act" of prioritizing investment over stronger regulation, said Keith Barney, an expert on Laos at the Australian National University. But in the accident's wake, "the potential pitfalls of poor regulation are now evident for everyone to see," he said.
The South Korean company that is the main builder of the hydroelectric project has admitted that it knew the dam was deteriorating a day before it failed.
Mr. Barney said the accident at the dam, part of the hydroelectric project, was perhaps the biggest challenge to the ruling party's legitimacy since its handling of the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, which led to rapid inflation. Officials may now face more pressure to incorporate social and environmental protections for rural people in the push for development, he said.
"Their response could either build confidence in the government or undermine it," Mr. Barney said, likening the challenge to the one that President George W. Bush faced after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Laos, a former French colony, has a history of exploitation by foreign powers. In the precolonial era, for example, people from present-day Laos were sent as slaves to a kingdom in what is now Thailand. And during the Vietnam War, Laos was a prime target of the United States, which made it one of the most heavily bombed places on earth.
In the decades since the Lao People's Revolutionary Party came to power in 1975, the government has pursued an economic model that prioritizes selling off land, timber, minerals and other resources to giant conglomerates from China, Thailand, Vietnam and elsewhere. A high-profile example is a continuing project by Chinese engineers to drill hundreds of tunnels and bridges through Laos to support a railway that will eventually connect several Asian countries.
Laos has been promoting hydroelectric power investments since the 1990s, and while initial financing came from the World Bank and other development agencies, the clear trend has been toward corporate funding, said Philip Hirsch, an emeritus professor at the University of Sydney in Australia who has studied hydroelectric power in the Mekong region for decades.
The government has said it wants hydroelectric dams to transform Laos into Southeast Asia's "battery."
Laos's approach to development has paid off handsomely for domestic elites, while often leaving the rural poor at the mercy of foreign corporations.
Analysts see Attapeu Province, where the flooding occurred, as a case study. Even though it is brimming with logging, agribusiness, mining and hydropower projects, villagers "generally don't reap many benefits from these activities" and instead face the most significant social and environmental impacts, said Miles Kenney-Lazar, an expert on Laos at Kyoto University in Japan.
Well before the accident last Monday, foreign-funded projects in Attapeu had caused deforestation, loss of access to traditional lands and forests, chemical pollution of waterways and rapidly changing water levels, Mr. Kenney-Lazar said.
His research has focused on the province's largest Vietnamese investor, the Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group, which operates rubber plantations and other businesses and which advocacy groups have accused of thuggish land-grabbing tactics in Laos and in neighboring Cambodia. (The company has denied the accusations.)
After the flash floods that the dam failure set off last week, a top Laotian official blamed substandard construction. The main builder of the hydroelectric project, SK Engineering & Construction of South Korea, said on Friday that it would take responsibility if a formal investigation found it culpable. The company has acknowledged seeing troubling signs before the accident, saying it "immediately" reported damage to the local authorities.
But Laos will probably not allow an independent inquiry, in part because the government owns 25 percent of the hydroelectric project and was supposed to have regulatory oversight of its planning and construction, said David J. H. Blake, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of York in England who has written widely on Laos.
The accident has prompted some quiet criticism of the government by ordinary Laotians, but people in this country of about seven million are generally reluctant to speak out. That is especially true since the 2013 disappearance of Sombath Somphone, a United States-trained agriculture specialist, in an episode widely seen as a warning to government critics.
Mr. Blake said the accident would not threaten the party's dominance, in part because the government is tightly controlling the narrative in the state-controlled news media. Relief donations in Attapeu Province may even help strengthen the party's hand in the worst-hit areas, he added, by "giving more power and control to the state-party machinery."
The state-controlled news media has provided shifting and contradictory statements about the number killed in the accident -- putting the death toll at 27, for example, but later revising it to four. Independent analysts say the deaths could exceed 27, as volunteer rescue groups continued to operate in the flooded areas.
On Saturday, the official Vientiane Times warned of "fake news" posted on social media and reported by some foreign news outlets, and said that Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith had urged Laotians to follow only official sources for updates. The government has warned foreign news organizations not to report on the accident independently.
In the town of Attapeu, the flood-relief effort is being run partly out of the Hoang Anh-Attapeu Hotel, which is named after the Hoang Anh Gia Lai Group, the same Vietnamese conglomerate that advocacy groups accuse of environmental and human rights abuses. The hotel's seven managers are all Vietnamese, said one of them, Nguyen Chi Cuong.
"Laos is pretty undeveloped," Mr. Cuong, speaking in Vietnamese, said on Friday in the hotel's high-ceilinged dining room.
In the marbled lobby, men in pressed slacks and dress shirts watched as Laotian workers unloaded toilet paper, toothpaste and instant noodles -- supplies for the flood victims -- from a delivery truck in the parking lot. Some of the supervisors wore shirts that said SK Engineering & Construction.
A receptionist, Soukkida Senonghiem, said that while foreign investment was generally good for Laos, it was ordinary people who suffered when projects went awry.
Still, she said, this particular accident had a silver lining.
"It's lucky that the dead are our own people, not foreigners," she said. "That might have affected our image and caused bigger problems."

'Trump Boom' Just a Whisper On the Stump

Full text: NEWARK, Ohio -- His Republican opponent doesn't say much publicly about the Trump tax cuts, but on a warm night in a small-town union hall an hour outside Columbus, Danny O'Connor was happy to talk about them -- a lot.
"We just saw, this last December, a $2 trillion swipe of the national credit card, a giveaway to big corporations," Mr. O'Connor, the Democrat in a special election on Aug. 7 for an open congressional seat here, told the crowd, drawing nods. "That doesn't do anything for us. It doesn't do anything for working people."
That seems to go against what Republicans intended. Party leaders in Washington talk frequently about the tax cuts and a "Trump boom" that will doom the "blue wave" this election year -- or at least shrink it to a ripple. News on Friday that the economy grew at a robust 4.1 percent between April and June seemingly supplied more ammunition to a message centered on tax cut-fueled prosperity.
But so far, that is not how it is playing out on the campaign trail.
With little more than a week to go before voters here head to the polls, the airwaves are instead dominated by more general promises to create jobs and, from Republicans, by dark warnings on wedge issues such as immigration, meant to rally the conservative base. A Republican "super PAC" is blitzing the Ohio airwaves, contending that electing Mr. O'Connor will mean "more crimes, more drugs."
"Danny O'Connor would join the resistance," the Congressional Leadership Fund ad concludes, with the Democrat flanked by three women: Hillary Clinton, Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Elizabeth Warren.
[Video: The Liberal Resistance Watch on YouTube.]
A Wesleyan Media Project analysis of national advertising data from Kantar Media/CMAG also shows Republicans are rarely bragging to voters about the economy's strength.
Republicans have reason to doubt the efficacy of an economic message in hotly contested midterm campaigns, which have historically been referendums on the sitting president. The last time the economy grew 4 percent in a quarter was in the middle of 2014, under President Barack Obama, just before Senate Democrats lost nine seats -- and their majority -- that fall.
For their part, Democrats are weaponizing the tax law -- which is mired in only middling popularity -- against Republican opponents in some key races. Their critiques have been fed by government statistics showing that wages for typical American workers have not risen over the past year, after adjusting for inflation, even though Republicans promised the tax cuts would unleash rapid wage growth.
That's true in Ohio's 12th District, which stretches from mostly affluent suburbs of Columbus, where residents probably benefited a good deal from the tax cuts, to the foothills of the Appalachians, where they haven't. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's first ad in this special election opened with a hit on the Republican, Troy Balderson, for supporting "a massive corporate tax break that helps rack up $2 trillion in debt."

Mr. O'Connor and his allies have now spent more money attacking the tax cuts than Mr. Balderson and Republican groups have spent extolling them, even though the Democrat is being outspent over all, two to one.
The National Republican Congressional Committee has run ads criticizing Mr. O'Connor on taxes and playing up the strength of the economy. But on the Columbus airwaves, those messages have largely given way to more inflammatory issues.
Mr. Balderson's campaign did not respond to repeated requests for an interview on tax policy and his advertising decisions. But other Republicans say the messaging strategy reflects a judgment over how best to motivate their core supporters to vote in the Aug. 7 election to replace Representative Patrick J. Tiberi, a Republican who helped write the House version of the tax bill and who retired this year to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable.
The district has been held by Republicans for nearly four decades. Until this year, it was considered solidly red, thanks in part to a redrawing of its boundaries by Republicans in 2012, which pushed thousands of Democratic voters into another district. Mr. Balderson, a state senator, won a crowded primary this spring with Mr. Tiberi's support.
Mr. Tiberi said in an interview that the timing of the special election -- in the depths of summer, as many families vacation and prepare for the start of a new school year -- was forcing Mr. Balderson to focus on issues that can best grab Republican voters' attention. Regardless of the outcome next month, the two candidates will face off again in November.
"This right now, for the Balderson campaign, is about turning out Republicans -- if Republicans vote, Troy wins," Mr. Tiberi said. "In the fall, I think you'll see more issues, and more economic issues."
Many Republicans said last year, as the tax cuts were speeding through Congress, that the new law would excite their base and help preserve their congressional majorities in the midterms. The law permanently reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from a high of 35 percent. It doubled the standard deduction for individuals and cut individual tax rates, although those provisions expire at the end of 2025. Party leaders predicted that as Americans began to see the law's benefits, its popularity would rise.
Instead, polls suggest that support for the law peaked shortly after it was passed, and has declined slightly since. A July online poll of 9,767 people by the research firm SurveyMonkey, conducted for The New York Times, found that views on the law were essentially split, with 48 percent in favor and 47 percent against. Opposition was higher among college-educated voters, which could support Mr. O'Connor's argument in the 12th District, which features the most educated electorate in Ohio.
Attendees at Mr. O'Connor's union hall fund-raiser on Wednesday here in Licking County expressed concern over the tax law, especially on fiscal grounds.
"We can't afford it," Ann Petrushka, a teacher in Licking County, said. "I'm not sure we can recover from it."
In an interview over half a turkey sandwich and a Bud Light, Mr. O'Connor said he would vote to keep the law's middle-class tax cuts, but he repeatedly called it unaffordable for working-class voters and raised the possibility that it could lead to safety-net cuts and the raising of the retirement age. Mr. O'Connor's "$2 trillion" price tag for the bill rounds up an estimate of $1.9 trillion from the Congressional Budget Office, which does not account for additional economic growth produced by the tax cuts.
Mr. O'Connor said that many of the voters he talks to feel as if they are still not getting ahead, even with low unemployment and accelerating economic growth, and that even affluent voters in his district see the law as unfair.
"Income inequality is high, wage growth is low," he said. "Folks doing well still want to have an economy that works for the middle class."
As they turn to November, Democratic candidates across the country are echoing that message. They are working critiques of the tax bill into a broader argument about stagnating real wages and rising health care costs, to portray Republican rule under President Trump as primarily benefiting the wealthy and leaving American workers to pick up the tab.
"Democrats are right to press this," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for American Bridge, a liberal opposition research group that is helping Democrats in the midterms. "Republicans ran on populism in 2016, and their policies delivered the opposite."
Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat running for re-election against Representative James B. Renacci, a Republican, in a state that Mr. Trump won handily, said Republicans "should be ashamed of their tax bill, and I think they are." In an interview, Mr. Brown said he would be willing to devote an entire debate with Mr. Renacci just to the tax law: "I think this is a fundamental difference between the two parties."
Republican officials said the strong growth report on Friday could soften candidates' reluctance to dwell on economic themes, though they also said that Republicans would continue to attack Democrats on other issues, especially their ties to the House Democratic leader, Ms. Pelosi, who is unpopular with conservatives.
Mr. Trump said on Friday that he would stump for Republicans in tough races nearly every day for the last two months of the campaign, arguing that the strength of the economy would help lift his party's fortunes.
"It's a positive, unifying message for Republicans around the country" to talk about tax cuts and growth, said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. "We're not shying away from it, but I wouldn't expect to see it in every ad."
So far, voters have seen it in hardly any. The tax law "takes a back seat" in campaign advertising, said Erika Franklin Fowler, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, and few candidates are talking about the strength of the stock market or economic growth.
"Generic tax references are pretty common," she said. "But when they make tax statements, they typically are, 'I will fight for lower taxes for the middle class."'
Mr. Tiberi said Republicans should be proud to tell voters that cuts in corporate tax rates encourage companies to move their headquarters to central Ohio and other parts of America.
Tim Kane, an economist at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, agreed.
"Tax policy is a winning issue; it's one that I think Republicans are smart to embrace," Mr. Kane said.
Mr. Kane ran in the Republican primary for Mr. Tiberi's seat. He finished third.

Full text: Last week, my colleague Bret Stephens imagined a news article on the morning after President Trump's re-election . Today, I imagine a different outcome.
In the end, it was a lot simpler than it often seemed.
Donald J. Trump, who spent much of the past four years as a historically unpopular president, lost his bid for re-election Tuesday. His approval rating hasn't approached 50 percent since he took office, and neither did his share of the vote this year.
In an era of deep national anxiety -- with stagnant wages, rickety health insurance and aggressive challenges from China and Russia -- voters punished an incumbent president who failed on his central promise: "I alone can fix it."
Since he rode down the Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy five years ago, Trump has frequently looked like a man for whom the normal rules of politics did not apply. He won a shocking upset in 2016, which lent him an aura of invincibility. Pundits started to doubt much of what they had previously believed.
But as Trump seethed -- and tweeted -- in defeat late Tuesday and President-elect Elizabeth Warren celebrated, the arc of the Trump story is starting to make more sense than it has for much of his chaotic presidency:
The normal rules of politics do apply to Donald Trump, after all.
Four years ago, he became the fifth man to win the presidency while losing the popular vote. Now he becomes the fourth of those five -- along with John Quincy Adams, Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison -- to serve only a single term, and to be unpopular during most of it. The exception is George W. Bush, who benefited from being a wartime president.
In hindsight, the extraordinary nature of the circumstances that propelled Trump in 2016 have become obvious: the unpopularity of his opponent, Hillary Clinton; the help from Russia; the late involvement of James Comey, the then-F.B.I. director who now hosts an ABC talk show; and Trump's razor-thin victories in several states.
Without that good fortune this year, Trump still won roughly 90 percent of self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning voters. Yet it was not nearly enough.
"Trump said he was going to fix things, and he didn't," said Kevin O'Reilly, 54, of Manchester, N.H., who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, Trump in 2016 and Warren this year. "I don't think he really cares about the middle class. He cares about himself."
Exit polls showed disillusionment across the swing states that Trump won four years ago and lost this year, including Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In a sign of the country's changing political map, he held on to Ohio and Iowa, two relatively old and white states -- but became the first Republican since 1992 to lose Georgia.
Huge margins among women were central to the victory of Warren, who will become the country's first female president. "I'm just tired of him," said Jennifer Diaz, a 47-year-old from Cobb County, Ga., outside Atlanta.
Heading into the campaign, Trump's advisers believed they had two major advantages: the economic growth of the past four years and the undeniable liberalism of Warren and her running mate, former Attorney General Eric Holder. Neither panned out as the Trump campaign had hoped.
For one thing, solid G.D.P. growth -- similar to the rate during Obama's second term -- has not translated into middle-class income gains. Average income growth, post-inflation, has hovered near zero since early 2018.
(In August, Trump became the first president since Richard Nixon to force out the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing the agency of releasing "fake news" on wages. Outside economists said the charge was false.)
Warren's liberalism, meanwhile, did make some voters anxious, exit polls showed. But most swing voters do not follow the minutiae of policy debates, and many simply decided that she understood their problems better than Trump.
She and Holder consciously borrowed from the populist strategy of Obama's 2012 campaign against Mitt Romney. Rather than emphasize Trump's personal behavior, as the 2016 Clinton campaign did, they cast him as a greedy billionaire who corruptly used the presidency to enrich himself further. They also largely ignored Trump's repeated criticisms of the ongoing N.F.L. national anthem protests.
The Democrats paired their message with broadly popular economic proposals: tax increases on the rich, expanded Medicare and child care, free community college and -- highlighting an unfulfilled Trump promise -- an infrastructure program. Budget watchdogs said the Warren agenda would increase the deficit. Many voters, evidently, did not care.
A final vote tally will not be available for weeks, but The New York Times's "election needle" currently projects Trump to win 46.1 percent of the popular vote. If that holds, it would be nearly identical to his share in 2016. This year, however, third-party candidates won fewer votes, and Warren is on pace to clear 50 percent.
From the start of Trump's meteoric political career to the end, he never enjoyed the support of most Americans.
Postscript: Why did I choose Elizabeth Warren as Trump's opponent? For one thing, she's highly plausible. Mostly, though, I wanted to use the same Democratic nominee Bret Stephens did in his column -- to avoid any suggestion that the specific nominee was the reason I was suggesting a different outcome than he did.

China's Long, Quiet Push Into Latin America

Full text: QUINTUCO, Argentina -- The giant antenna rises from the desert floor like an apparition, a gleaming metal tower jutting 16 stories above an endless wind-whipped stretch of Patagonia.
The 450-ton device, with its hulking dish embracing the open skies, is the centerpiece of a $ 50 million satellite and space mission control station built by the Chinese military.
The isolated base is one of the most striking symbols of Beijing's long push to transform Latin America and shape its future for generations to come -- often in ways that directly undermine the United States' political, economic and strategic power in the region.
The station began operating in March, playing a pivotal role in China's audacious expedition to the far side of the moon -- an endeavor that Argentine officials say they are elated to support.
But the way the base was negotiated -- in secret, at a time when Argentina desperately needed investment -- and concerns that it could enhance China's intelligence gathering capabilities in the hemisphere have set off a debate in Argentina about the risks and benefits of being pulled into China's orbit.
"Beijing has transformed the dynamics of the region, from the agendas of its leaders and businessmen to the structure of its economies, the content of its politics and even its security dynamics," said R. Evan Ellis, a professor of Latin American studies at the United States Army War College.
For much of the past decade, the United States has paid little attention to its backyard in the Americas. Instead, it declared a pivot toward Asia, hoping to strengthen economic, military and diplomatic ties as part of the Obama administration's strategy to constrain China.
Since taking office, the Trump administration has retreated from that approach in some fundamental ways, walking away from a free trade pact with Pacific nations, launching a global trade war and complaining about the burden of Washington's security commitments to its closest allies in Asia and other parts of the world.
All the while, China has been discreetly carrying out a far-reaching plan of its own across Latin America. It has vastly expanded trade, bailed out governments, built enormous infrastructure projects, strengthened military ties and locked up tremendous amounts of resources, hitching the fate of several countries in the region to its own.
China made its intentions clear enough back in 2008. In a first-of-its-kind policy paper that drew relatively little notice at the time, Beijing argued that nations in Latin America were "at a similar stage of development" as China, with much to gain on both sides.
Leaders in the region were more than receptive. The primacy over Latin America that Washington had largely taken for granted since the end of the Cold War was being challenged by a cadre of leftist presidents who governed much of the region -- including Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay and Bolivia -- and wanted a more autonomous region.
Beijing's invitation came at a fortuitous time: during the height of the financial crisis. Latching onto China's voracious appetite for the region's oil, iron, soybeans and copper ended up shielding Latin America from the worst of the global economic damage.
Then, as the price of oil and other commodities tanked in 2011, several countries in the region suddenly found themselves on shaky ground. Once again, China came to their aid, striking deals that further cemented its role as a central player in Latin America for decades.
Even with parts of Latin America shifting to the right politically in recent years, its leaders have tailored their policies to fulfill China's demand. Now Beijing's dominance in much of the region -- and what it means for America's waning stature -- is starting to come into sharp focus.
"It's a fait accompli," said Diego Guelar, Argentina's ambassador to China.
Back in 2013, he published a book with an alarming-sounding title: "The Silent Invasion: The Chinese Landing in South America."
"It's no longer silent," Mr. Guelar said of China's incursion in the region.
Trade between China and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean reached $ 244 billion last year, more than twice what it was a decade earlier, according to Boston University's Global Development Policy Center. Since 2015, China has been South America's top trading partner, eclipsing the United States.
Perhaps more significantly, China has issued tens of billions of dollars in commodities-backed loans across the Americas, giving it claim over a large share of the region's oil -- including nearly 90 percent of Ecuador's reserves -- for years.
China has also made itself indispensable by rescuing embattled governments and vital state-controlled companies in countries like Venezuela and Brazil, willing to make big bets to secure its place in the region.
Here in Argentina, a nation that had been shut out of international credit markets for defaulting on about $ 100 billion in bonds, China became a godsend for then-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.
And while it was extending a helping hand, China began the secret negotiations that led to the satellite and space control station here in Patagonia.
Argentine officials say the Chinese have agreed not to use the base for military purposes. But experts contend that the technology on it has many strategic uses.
Frank A. Rose, an assistant secretary of state for arms control during the Obama administration, said he spent much of his time worrying about China's budding space program. American intelligence and defense officials watched with alarm as China developed sophisticated technology to jam, disrupt and destroy satellites in recent years, he said.
"They are deploying these capabilities to blunt American military advantages, which are in many ways derived from space," Mr. Rose said.
China is not alone in regarding space as a critical battlespace for future wars. Last month, the Trump administration announced it would create a sixth military branch devoted to space.
Antennas and other equipment that support space missions, like the kind China now has here in Patagonia, can increase China's intelligence-gathering capabilities, experts say.
"A giant antenna is like a giant vacuum cleaner," said Dean Cheng, a former congressional investigator who studies China's national security policy. "What you are sucking up is signals, data, all sorts of things."
Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman, said American military officials were assessing the implications of the Chinese monitoring station. Chinese officials declined requests for interviews about the base and their space program.
Beyond any strategic contest with the United States, some leaders in Latin America are now having doubts and regrets about their ties to China, worried that past governments have saddled their nations with enormous debt and effectively sold out their futures.
But Mr. Guelar argued that hitting the brakes on engagement with China would be shortsighted, particularly at a time when Washington has given up its longstanding role as the region's political and economic anchor.
"There has been an abdication" of leadership by the United States, he said. "It surrendered that role not because it lost it, but because it doesn't wish to take it on."
'A Window to the World'
The Argentine government was in crisis mode in 2009. Inflation was high. Billions of dollars in debt payments were coming due. Anger was swelling over the government, including its decision to nationalize $ 30 billion in private pension funds. And the worst drought in five decades was making the economic situation even more bleak.
Enter China, which stepped forward to brighten the outlook. First, it struck a $ 10.2 billion currency swap deal that helped stabilize the Argentine peso, and then promised to invest $ 10 billion to fix the nation's dilapidated rail system.
In the middle of all this, China also dispatched a team to Argentina to discuss something that had nothing to do with currency fluctuations: Beijing's ambitions in space.
The Chinese wanted a satellite-tracking hub on the other side of the globe before the launch of an expedition to the far side of the moon, which never faces the Earth.
If successful, the mission, scheduled to launch this year, will be a milestone in space exploration, potentially paving the way for the extraction of helium 3, which some scientists believe could provide a revolutionary clean source of energy.
China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control General, a division of the country's armed forces, settled on this windswept 494-acre patch in Argentina's Neuquén Province.
Flanked by mountains and far from population centers, the site offered an ideal vantage point for Beijing to monitor satellites and space missions around the clock.
Félix Clementino Menicocci, the secretary general of Argentina's National Space Activities Commission, a government agency, said the Chinese had pitched officials with promises of economic development and the prospect of enabling a history-making endeavor.
"They've become major players in space in the span of a few years," Mr. Menicocci said of China's space program.
After months of secret negotiations, Neuquén Province and the Chinese government signed a deal in November 2012, giving China the right to the land -- rent free -- for 50 years.
When provincial lawmakers caught wind of the project after construction was already underway, some were aghast. Betty Kreitman, a lawmaker in Neuquén at the time, said she was outraged that the Chinese military was being allowed to set up a base on Argentine soil.
"Surrendering sovereignty in your own country is shameful," Ms. Kreitman said.
When she visited the construction site, she said, she pressed Chinese officials for answers but walked away feeling even more concerned.
"This is a window to the world," she recalled the Chinese supervisor at the site saying. "It gave me chills. What do you do with a window to the world? Spy on reality."
Rapid Growth, and Then Peril
The pitch was certainly not subtle, but then, it was never meant to be.
China's policy document on Latin America in 2008 promised governments in the region to "treat each other as equals," a clear reference to the asymmetric relationship between the United States and its neighbors in the hemisphere.
As "our relationship with the United States diminished, our relationship with China grew," said Brazil's former president, Dilma Rousseff, whose ties with the Obama administration suffered after revelations that American officials had spied on her, her inner circle and Brazil's state-controlled oil company. "We never felt that China had imperial designs on us."
The new alliance paid off, helping propel Latin America to the kind of growth rates that Europe and the United States envied.
"Latin America won the China lottery," said Kevin P. Gallagher, an economist at Boston University. "It helped the region have its largest growth spurt since the 1970s."
Yet, Mr. Gallagher said, the bounty came with significant peril. Industries like agriculture and mining are subject to the boom-and-bust cycles of commodity prices, which made relying on them too heavily a big gamble over the long term.
Sure enough, global commodity prices eventually tumbled. In July 2014, as several leftist leaders were presiding over distressed economies, China signaled even more ambitious plans for the region. At a summit meeting in Brazil, President Xi Jinping announced that Beijing aspired to raise annual trade with the region to $ 500 billion within a decade.
In an interview with journalists, Mr. Xi hailed the trust his government had built in Latin America by quoting a Chinese proverb: "A bosom buddy afar brings distant lands near."
For emphasis, he quoted the Cuban national hero José Martí and the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho, and recited a line from the epic Argentine poem "Martín Fierro" by José Hernández: "Brothers be united because that is the first law."
Soon, China took a step that startled the Pentagon. In October 2015, China's Defense Ministry hosted officials from 11 countries in Latin America for a 10-day forum on military logistics titled "Strengthening Mutual Understanding for Win-Win Cooperation."
The meeting built on the ties China had been making with militaries in Latin America, including donating equipment to the Colombian military, Washington's closest partner in the region.
Borrowing from the playbook the United States had used across the world, China organized joint training exercises, including unprecedented naval missions off the Brazilian coast in 2013 and the Chilean coast in 2014. Beijing has also invited a growing number of midcareer military officers from Latin America for career development in China.
The contacts have paved the way for China to start selling military equipment in Latin America, which had long regarded the United States defense industry as the gold standard, said Mr. Ellis, the War College scholar.
Venezuela has spent hundreds of millions on Chinese arms and matériel in recent years. Bolivia has bought tens of millions of dollars' worth of Chinese aircraft. Argentina and Peru have signed smaller deals.
Mr. Ellis said the Chinese had also probably pursued cooperation relationships with Latin American nations, with an eye toward any possible confrontation with the United States.
"China is positioning itself in a world that is safe for the rise of China," he said. "If you're talking about the 2049 world, from the perspective of Latin America, China will have unquestionably surpassed the United States on absolute power and size. Frankly, if it was a matter of sustained conflict, you reach a point where you can't deny the possibility of Chinese forces operating from bases in the region."
Just weeks after the space station began operating in Patagonia, the United States made an announcement that raised eyebrows here in Argentina.
The Pentagon is funding a $ 1.3 million emergency response center in Neuquén -- the same province where the Chinese base is, and the first such American project in all of Argentina. Local officials and residents wondered whether the move was a tit-for-tat response to China's new presence in this remote part of the country.
American officials said that the project was unrelated to the space station, and that the center would be staffed only by Argentines.
No Need for New 'Imperial Powers'
Latin America experts in the Obama White House watched China's rise in the region warily. But the administration raised little fuss publicly, sharing its concerns with leaders mostly in private.
Besides, former officials say, Washington did not have much of a counteroffer.
"I wished the whole time I was working in Latin America that any administration had as well thought-out, resourced and planned a policy as the pivot to Asia for Latin America," said John Feeley, who recently resigned as the American ambassador to Panama after a nearly three-decade career. "Since the end of the 1980s, there really has never been a comprehensive hemispheric long-term strategy."
While President Barack Obama was widely hailed in the region for restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba in late 2014, Washington's agenda never ceased being dominated by two issues that have long generated resentment in Latin America: the war on drugs and illegal immigration.
While the Trump administration has yet to articulate a clear policy for the hemisphere, it has warned its neighbors not to get too cozy with China. Former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson publicly cautioned that Latin America did not need new "imperial powers," adding that China "is using its economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit; the question, is at what price?"
That question is being vigorously debated in some corners. Former President Rafael Correa of Ecuador was interrogated by prosecutors in February as part of an investigation into whether the decision to promise the country's crude reserves to China through 2024 harmed national interests.
In Bolivia, which has also seen a surge of Chinese investment, several industries have withered as Chinese products have become cheaper and easier to buy, said Samuel Doria Medina, a Bolivian businessman and politician who has run unsuccessfully against President Evo Morales three times.
"Our financial, commercial and, ultimately, political dependency keeps growing," Mr. Doria said. Bolivia and several other leftist leaders who have tied their lot to China, he warned, have "mortgaged the future" of their nations.
Yet China's influence has not diminished, even as Latin America shifts to the right politically. In recent months, Beijing persuaded Panama and the Dominican Republic to sever ties with Taiwan, notable victories in one of China's foreign policy priorities.
China's clout, analyst say, is also a sign of how much the Trump administration has alienated governments in the region by adopting harsh immigration policies and pursuing hardball tactics on trade in a part of the world where Washington already has an ample surplus.
Jorge Arbache, the secretary for international affairs at Brazil's Planning Ministry, said Washington's "lack of predictability" had prevented a more ambitious partnership from taking root, while China had been far clearer about its vision.
"Everyone expects China to become even more influential," Mr. Arbache said.
'People Are Afraid'
Soon after being nominated as Argentina's ambassador to China in late 2015, Mr. Guelar said, he steeled himself for an arduous task: pushing to renegotiate the space station agreement.
The former government, he said, had given away too much, recklessly failing to specify that the base could be used only for peaceful purposes.
"It was very serious," he said. "At any moment it could become a military base."
To his surprise, he said, the Chinese agreed to the use base solely for civilian purposes. But that did not assuage concerns in Bajada del Agrio, the closest town to the station, where residents speak of the Chinese presence with a mix of bewilderment and fear.
"People see it as a military base," said Jara María Albertina, the manager at the local radio station. "People are afraid."
The mayor, Ricardo Fabián Esparza, said the Chinese had been friendly and even invited him to look at the images the antenna produces. But he is more apprehensive than hopeful.
"From that telescope, they probably can even see what underwear you're wearing," he said.
The United States is the one that should be most concerned, he said. The base, he said, is an "eye looking toward that country."

Full text: A Stately Six-Bedroom House in Buenos Aires
$ 3.5 MILLION (96.6 ARGENTINE PESOS)
This grand four-story townhouse is in Recoleta, an upscale coastal neighborhood in Buenos Aires known for its French-inspired architecture and cultural and historic sites like the Recoleta Cemetery, where Eva Perón and other dignitaries are buried.
The limestone house, just off the elegant Avenida Alvear, was built in 1925 and designed by the noted architect Alejandro Christophersen, whose work included the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange building.
"This is one of the last great mansions available," said Adriana Massa, the chief executive of Adriana Massa Sotheby's International Realty, which has the listing. While the house is in need of updates, she said, it retains many of its original details, including marble and Slavonian oak floors, wood-burning fireplaces and ornate moldings and columns.
The 9,687-square-foot townhouse, attached on both sides, has six bedrooms, three full baths and one half bath. Through the arched wooden doors on the ground level, a marble-floored foyer with high ceilings leads to an office area, study and powder room, with access beyond to a large marble patio and backyard.
The first floor, which can be reached by elevator, contains much of the entertaining space. A large central gallery at the foot of a grand marble staircase leads on one side to a rear-facing formal dining room with a fireplace and on the other to an expansive living room with a fireplace and a library with built-in bookshelves. The living room overlooks the residential Montevideo Street. There is also a small kitchenette on this level.
A roomy master suite with oak floors and molded arches is on the second floor, as are a terrace and two more bedrooms with en suite baths. On the top level is a family room, along with three small bedrooms, a laundry room, a large kitchen with a granite-topped island and an informal dining area, and a spacious terrace.
At the rear of the patio is space for at least four cars, as well as a small structure containing two staff rooms and a full bath.
"This house is special because of the location," Ms. Massa said, noting its proximity to hotels like the Palacio Duhau Park Hyatt and the Alvear Palace, as well as high-end shops and fashion showrooms.
Recoleta, with a population of around 200,000, is on the coast of the Rio de la Plata, in the northern area of Buenos Aires, Argentina's capital. In addition to the well-known cemetery and several public parks, Recoleta is home to a number of museums, including the National Museum of Fine Arts, the National Palace of the Arts and the Holocaust Museum of Buenos Aires. Ezeiza International Airport is about 20 miles away.
Market Overview
Argentina's housing market "had a promising start in the first quarter" after a strong performance last year, said Miriam Rivas, a senior sales leader at Raul Mel Propiedades, a brokerage in Buenos Aires. But in recent months, currency fluctuations and economic turbulence have slowed activity considerably, as the country struggles to curb inflation and stimulate foreign investment.
"Ongoing sales were renegotiated," Ms. Rivas said, "or they fell apart."
She estimated that home prices in the second quarter were at least 10 percent lower, on average, than in the previous quarter.
Elias Kier Joffe, the managing partner of the Buenos Aires law firm Kier Joffe, said foreign buyers in particular have been wary of the economic uncertainty: "They want to wait and see, just in case there's an opportunity."
But he and other real estate professionals remain optimistic about the market's eventual recovery. "Every five years you have a small crisis," Mr. Joffe said. "The prices eventually go up."
Ms. Rivas agreed, adding that Buenos Aires was likely to lead the way. "The Buenos Aires market is one of the most dynamic real estate markets of Argentina," she said. "Prices normally rise more quickly and with a greater rate than in the rest of the country."
Who Buys in Buenos Aires
Foreigners make up a small portion of home buyers in Buenos Aires, real estate professionals said. Most foreign buyers are from the United States, Britain, Italy and Spain, Mr. Joffe said, adding that he has also seen interest from Australians.
"Buenos Aires is known as the Paris of South America," he said. "International people would like to have an apartment there, just as they would like to have an apartment in Miami or New York."
The Recoleta neighborhood typically attracts older buyers, he said, particularly retirees or those who have business in the city. Younger buyers prefer trendier areas like Palermo Soho, he said.
Buying Basics
There are few, if any, restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate in Argentina. But most foreign buyers pay cash because local financing is difficult to obtain, said Sebastian A. García Menéndez, a partner in the Buenos Aires law firm García Menéndez.
American dollars are typically used for pricing and transactions, rather than Argentine pesos.
The buying process is fairly straightforward, Mr. Joffe said: After an offer is made and a price agreed upon, the buyer provides a down payment, usually around 30 percent of the sale price. A date is set for the closing, at which time the deed is transferred through a notary public. The notary is also responsible for overseeing the title search and ensuring that all taxes on the property have been paid at the time of closing.
Many buyers opt to hire an experienced local real estate lawyer to help guide them through the process.

Full text: Tax cuts and federal spending are adding fuel to the already strong economy, putting the United States on a pace for its best year of growth in well over a decade.
The Commerce Department reported Friday that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, grew at a 4.1 percent rate in the second quarter of the year. Consumers led the way, shrugging off higher gasoline prices and sluggish wage growth to step up their spending on everything from cars to clothes to restaurant meals.
President Trump hailed the data as evidence that his policies on trade, taxes and other issues were working. Robust growth is good news for Republicans, who are counting on the economy to help them in midterm elections this fall.
"Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world," Mr. Trump declared outside the South Portico of the White House, flanked by his top economic advisers.
[Fact check: Mr. Trump cited a long list of indicators of how well the economy has performed on his watch, some lacking context or foundation.]
Economists caution that the latest acceleration, while good news for American businesses and households in the short term, is unsustainable in the long term and could raise the risk that the recovery will flame out in the years ahead.
The quarter's figures were pumped up by a range of one-time factors that are unlikely to recur. Most forecasters expect growth to cool in the second half of the year -- even without factoring in the possibility of a trade war, which corporate executives in recent weeks have cited as a source of uncertainty that could force them to pare hiring and investment plans.
But there is little question that this spring was a high point in the rebound from the recession that struck a decade ago.
[Watch: Ben Casselman answers viewer questions about G.D.P. growth.]
The unemployment rate, which topped out at 10 percent, has fallen to 4 percent. Job growth is on a record streak. American factories, an emphasis for Mr. Trump, are hiring at their fastest rate in two decades. And the second quarter's performance -- the best quarterly showing since 2014 -- was equaled or exceeded in just four quarters during the eight years of the Obama administration.
Measures of underlying growth were robust, and economists say it is increasingly likely that full-year growth in gross domestic product could hit 3 percent in 2018 for the first time in the nearly decade-long recovery.
"The bottom line is that the economy is doing better," said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton.
At Grote Company, a manufacturer of food-processing equipment in Columbus, Ohio, business is "record fantastic," according to Bob Grote, the company's chief executive.
"Everybody I talk to is literally having banner years the past few years," he said. "I don't see any end in sight right now."
Mr. Grote said he was benefiting from several trends. Confident consumers are eating out more, leading to more demand for the pepperoni slicers, bread cutters and sandwich-assembly equipment that Grote makes. The tight labor market is making it harder for food businesses to hire workers, creating more demand for automated equipment. And the tax cuts passed last year have encouraged customers to invest in equipment -- and have led Grote to do the same, moving projects planned for 2019 or 2020 up to the present day.
"We've spent more on capital equipment this year than we probably have in the last five combined," Mr. Grote said. "We're going to see the benefits of it a lot sooner."
That's exactly the kind of investment that the tax law was meant to encourage. So far, however, there is scant evidence that companies broadly are reinvesting their tax savings. Business investment in equipment has grown more slowly in the first half of the year, and many companies are choosing to pay dividends and buy back shares instead.
"Business spending is not picking up the way proponents of the tax cut had hoped," said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays.
Instead, the tax cuts seem to be encouraging consumer spending, which rose 4 percent in the spring quarter, the biggest increase since 2014. Increased federal spending -- the result of the two-year budget deal passed by Congress this year -- is likewise giving the economy a lift, helping to nudge G.D.P. growth out of the rut of 2 to 2.5 percent where it has spent much of the recovery.
Whether those policies are a good idea is another question. Many economists question the wisdom of passing what amounts to a deficit-funded stimulus package when unemployment is low and the economy is strong. Few outside the White House think a growth rate of 4 percent is sustainable in the long term, in part because the aging of the baby boom generation means a shrinking share of the American population is working.
"It's economic conventional wisdom that in times like this you should prepare for the future and get your fiscal house in order, and we're really doing the opposite," said Michael A. Peterson, chairman of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which has long argued for reducing the federal deficit.
For policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the tax cuts and spending increases could pose a nearer-term challenge. The Fed has been trying to strike a delicate balance, raising interest rates gradually in an effort to keep inflation in check without snuffing out the recovery. If the second quarter's growth rate continues, it could risk accelerating inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly. That, in turn, could cause a recession.
There is little to suggest that will happen, however. Inflation slowed slightly in the second quarter, and Friday's report is unlikely to persuade officials to deviate from their gradual and carefully devised march to higher interest rates. The central bank is on track to raise rates twice more this year, after two increases in the first half of the year.
The more immediate risk may be the possibility of a trade war. Mr. Trump has placed tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from China, the European Union and other countries. Trading partners have responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs, and both sides have threatened more.
Tensions with Europe appeared to ease this week when Mr. Trump and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, agreed to work toward a trade deal. But the durability of that truce is unclear, and relations with China remain fraught.
Trade friction has yet to dampen business leaders' confidence, however, let alone caused them to change their behavior. In conference calls in recent weeks, executives said they were watching tariff announcements closely, and companies including General Electric, Whirlpool and United Technologies have said tariffs are raising costs or cutting into profits. Few, however, said they were slowing hiring or canceling projects.
"You're hearing some notes of caution, but nothing specific regarding pullbacks," said Bill Warlick, an analyst for Fitch, the ratings agency. Big companies, he said, make big investment decisions years in advance and will be slow to change course.
In the short term, trade tensions may be contributing to growth by prompting foreign buyers to stock up on American products before their governments impose retaliatory tariffs. Soybean exports, in particular, have surged, rising more than 50 percent in May from a year earlier.
Over all, exports rose at a 9.3 percent rate in the second quarter, accounting for a quarter of the total G.D.P. growth. But the trend is unlikely to last: Exports will almost certainly slump in the third and fourth quarters, and will turn into a drag on overall G.D.P. growth.
"We don't want to overexaggerate the strength of the economy given the real risks that are being put in place by the policy choices," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the accounting firm RSM U.S.
That said, he added, "it's undeniable things are better economically."

New Tax Laws Make Timing Divorce Tricky

Full text: Lawyers and accountants often push their clients to plan for unpleasant events. Better to be prepared now than to pay the consequences later. But the Republican tax law that took effect in January has added a new urgency for wealthy Americans contemplating divorce.
Several key changes in the law may determine whether it is better to complete or update a divorce agreement by Dec. 31 or wait until the new year.
One of the biggest changes affects alimony, which will not be a tax break for Americans whose divorce agreements are completed or updated after this year. The new tax law is also causing parting spouses to look more closely at benefits for their children and the values of privately owned businesses and partnerships.
There is a lot of money at stake for wealthy couples. Nearly 600,000 taxpayers claimed alimony deductions totaling more than $10 billion for the 2010 tax year, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
Here are four areas that couples considering a divorce should examine before the end of the year:
Alimony
When it comes to alimony, the tax law is going to turn the calendar back 77 years. That was when the Revenue Act of 1942 first made alimony deductible for the spouse paying it and taxable for the spouse receiving it.
The deduction was granted to help couples make the transition from being joint taxpayers to paying separately, said Suzanne L. Shier, chief tax and wealth planning strategist at Northern Trust.
But the arrangement has led in recent years to underreporting alimony payments. The last estimate from the I.R.S. showed that almost half of recipients paid no tax on alimony or paid tax on an amount that was less than what the former spouse claimed as a deduction, Ms. Shier said.
In other words, ex-spouses could be overstating the alimony they paid to increase their deductions, or ex-spouses receiving alimony could be understating the amount. Or both.
The tax change could become problematic in divorces settled after Dec. 31 because one spouse will lose a tax benefit and the other will gain one. Under the new system, the alimony payer will be taxed on the full amount while the recipient will pay no tax on it.
"When you're trying to resolve cases, that ability to get a tax benefit has been very useful," Judith L. Poller, a partner and co-chairwoman of the family law group at Pryor Cashman.
A simple solution for couples negotiating a divorce, and expecting an alimony payment, is to complete the agreement by the end of the year to preserve the deduction. But this could be easier said than done in an acrimonious divorce.
Prenuptial Agreements
For couples who drew up prenuptial agreements, the outcome should they divorce is more uncertain. It is common in prenuptial documents for lawyers to insert language calculating alimony payments based on years of marriage and a clause saying alimony payments are deductible for one spouse.
Jeffrey Cohen, a divorce lawyer at Cohen Goldstein, said he was not sure whether these clauses would hold up in 2019 and beyond.
"You have a written contract on the one hand, but people say, 'I wouldn't rely on it,"' he said.
In the absence of guidance from the I.R.S., Ms. Poller said a document providing for deductible alimony might not be honored if alimony was no longer deductible. A married couple might want to consider renegotiating the agreement before the end of the year, even if it might unsettle the marriage.
Business Valuation
But there are reasons to delay a parting of ways. Other tax-driven divorce issues require a more careful eye.
One is how private businesses should be valued. This has always been an important component of divorce settlements. But the new tax law increases the cash flow of certain pass-through entities -- businesses where the taxes on the earnings are paid by the owner, not the company -- in a way that raises their value.
"Because of increased cash flow and reduced taxes, my business could have gone from a value of $6 million to $9 million," Mr. Cohen said. "Whoever wants the money will get more, and whoever has the money will have more to give."
Figuring this out will require more valuation experts, increasing the cost and time it might take to get a divorce.
A business is almost always the most contested asset in a divorce, with a lot of the numbers in a settlement derived from its value, said Neena Tankha, a partner in the matrimonial and family law practice at Warshaw Burstein.
One of those numbers is child support, which she said was generally negotiated only once, with a provision made for inflation-adjusted increases. This raises the importance of getting the value right.
"We might think that business might have a higher valuation, but what does that mean?" Ms. Tankha said. It means wait and see. Any higher cash flow from the change in the tax law this year will not be known until the business owner files a tax return next year.
The difference in valuation could be slight, said Ilan Hirschfeld, managing partner of New Jersey advisory services at the accounting firm Marcum. He said he had run calculations showing that a $10 million business could be worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars more under the new law, which might not be worth holding up a divorce settlement.
But not knowing that exact valuation throws more uncertainty into the negotiations. So for couples going through a divorce now, and expecting a big increase in the value of their business next year, it might be better to postpone.
Other Assets
Child support has always been nondeductible and remains so. But some practitioners are reminding their clients to look closely at the tax benefits of different assets.
For instance, couples should weigh receiving a house versus a spouse's retirement plan, said Jim Mahaney, vice president of strategic initiatives at Prudential. Traditionally, Mr. Mahaney said, the spouse who has custody of the children wants the house. But the new tax changes, particularly in states where deductions for high state and local taxes have been capped, may make the family home less valuable in the long run than a retirement account with a similar value.
Spouses who get the retirement account will not be able to draw down on it until age 59½, but they will have a more solid financial base in their later years. And by opting for the retirement account over the house, they can avoid paying those property taxes.
Examining how the wealthier spouse is going to pay for a child's education is also important. Given the changes in the tax laws, 529 college savings plans can now be used for private school. They used to be limited to postsecondary and college education.
This can help with school costs sooner, but it presents several problems. One is whether enough money will be left over to pay for college.
But Mr. Mahaney points to another: making sure spouses don't count the assets in a 529 plan toward their contribution to school or college.
"The rules are the rules," he said. But the new tax law "adds a different level of complexity, and the negotiation on the amounts is going to be so challenging."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- America's booming economy has a problem: a shortage of truck drivers.
The industry -- historically reliant on older, white male drivers -- is facing a record shortage with an estimated 50,000 more drivers needed to meet demand, according to the American Trucking Associations. The lack of available drivers is rippling through the supply chain, causing a bottleneck of goods that is delaying deliveries and prompting some companies to increase prices.
The Trump administration and the industry are trying to alleviate the problem by loosening federal rules and enticing nontraditional drivers like women, teenagers and minorities to operate big rigs.
The Transportation Department has recently sidelined a number of safety regulations that trucking lobbyists said posed unnecessary burdens but that trucking unions supported, including requiring that rigs be outfitted with speed-limiting software and that drivers be screened for sleep apnea. The speed-limit measure, proposed by the Obama administration after a decade of lobbying from safety advocates, would have prohibited trucks from traveling faster than either 60, 65 or 68 miles per hour.
The White House is also backing a pilot program that allows younger drivers with military training to operate commercial vehicles across state lines. While the program is a trial, it represents a broader willingness to allow drivers under 21 to make interstate deliveries -- something federal regulations currently prohibit.
And, in a bid to recruit more drivers, many trucking companies have added perks, including signing bonuses and increased pay.
The shortage has been percolating for some time, as younger generations expressed less interest in the industry and wages lagged. Driver churn is also a problem -- at large fleets, turnover rose to an annualized rate of 95 percent last year, according to industry figures. The median wage is around $42,480 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
While autonomous trucks may someday negate the need for drivers, trucking executives say that day is still too far-off to solve today's problem.
As the global economy has strengthened, demand for trucks to move goods has outpaced the supply of drivers, resulting in freight carriers setting higher rates and companies raising prices on products, in some cases by as much as 20 percent.
Food companies in particular, like Campbell Soup, General Mills and Mondelez International, have cited higher freight costs as weighing on profits in recent months. "Like the broader industry, we're seeing sharp increases in input costs, including inflation in freight and commodities," General Mills said in its third-quarter earnings release in March.
Darren Hawkins, the chief executive of YRC Trucking, one of the nation's largest freight carriers, said the severity of the shortage means that successfully tapping underrepresented pools of candidates is crucial.
"There's an industry problem, and that is, we have to do a better job of attracting new people into the driving occupation, previous audiences we haven't reached," Mr. Hawkins said. "Right now the American Trucking Associations says we're 50,000 drivers short, and those numbers will continue to grow. So we've got to open up other pieces."
Trucking is already more onerous to enter than some of the industry's competitors, including retail, construction and fast food. In addition to weeks in trucking school, which can cost several thousand dollars, it often requires drivers to spend long, solitary stretches of time away from home.
Women and minorities make up just fractions of the overall trucking population: 94 percent of drivers are men, and two-thirds of all drivers are white, according to a 2017 report released by the American Trucking Associations.
Facing record driver shortages, trucking companies "are making the adjustments because they have to," said Kevin Reid, the founder of the National Minority Trucking Association.
"The industry has not focused on recruiting and retaining the next generation," Mr. Reid said. "Trucking is an industry that needs to be rebranded. There was a cool factor to trucking in the 1970s and 1980s. We don't have that now, so the question is, how are we going to reach the next generation of truckers?"
Kristina Jackson, a 22-year-old African-American truck driver based in Raleigh, N.C., is exactly the type of person the trucking industry wants to attract. After graduating from college, she wanted a job that would allow her to travel and be financially independent. She never considered trucking until her boyfriend's father, a trucker himself, encouraged her to give it a try.
A year into driving, she is constantly reminded that she's an outlier in the industry.
"When people found out I was in trucking, they were shocked because of my gender and age," she said. "The first thing you think of is an old white male. People say to me, 'You don't look like a trucker.' I say, 'What does a trucker look like?"'
Ms. Jackson thinks that more young people could easily be persuaded to join the industry, adding that she has personally recruited 10 of her friends in their 20s. But she thinks recruiters so far have done a poor job of showcasing the young truckers in the industry.
"When people think of truckers, they don't see our faces," Ms. Jackson said of young drivers.
The measure backed by the Trump administration seeks to change that and targets high school graduates, a demographic long considered by trucking companies that has remained largely out of recruiters' reach.
"If you are graduating from high school and you are not going into the military, you are not going to college, for all practical purposes, you can't go into trucking because you have to be at least 21 to drive interstate freight," said Bob Costello, the chief economist of the American Trucking Associations. "You're not going to sit around and twiddle your thumbs."
The administration's age proposal is the most controversial of the initiatives devised to attract new drivers. Some states already allow those under 21 to drive trucks within state lines, and the industry has lobbied to lower the interstate driving age similarly. But safety advocates have voiced opposition, arguing that the "riskiest cohort of drivers" should not be empowered to drive across state lines.
The trucking industry is hopeful that the pilot program, if successful, will eventually prompt the Trump administration to reduce the driving age for all types of people, not just those with military training. Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, has publicly supported the program, which seeks to recruit 200 drivers under the age of 21 serving in the National Guard. The department will collect data on those drivers, such as accidents and miles driven, and then compare it with the data of other new drivers between the ages of 21 and 24.
"The pilot program can benefit the public and military community in so many ways. It will benefit the public and the economy by providing well-trained, safe truck drivers," Ms. Chao said this month at an event promoting the program in Omaha, accompanied by Senator Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who is chairwoman of the Surface Transportation Committee.
DeAndre Lewis, a 20-year-old college student in Austin, Tex., said he would have benefited from a program that allowed him to receive certification when he was 18. He is hopeful he can soon swap his summer jobs for driving a big rig, which would pay more.
Mr. Hawkins said that lowering the driving age was just "one tool in a very large toolbox," and that trucking companies would also have to reach out to women and minorities.
Ellen Voie, the president of the Women in Trucking Association, said the industry was beginning to realize it must do a better job of recruiting women.
One of the biggest marketing hurdles the industry has to overcome is tamping down the prevailing notion that the road is not an appropriate -- or safe -- place for women.
"There's still men out there who think women shouldn't be driving trucks. They're few and far between, but they're vocal," Ms. Voie said. "But the experience has changed a lot over the past five years because carriers are trying hard to make sure women have a good experience."

Full text: The federal government acknowledged on Friday that your last few cellphones were more valuable than it thought.
That disclosure came tucked in a package of revisions the government made to the economic growth statistics it published from 2012 to 2017.
From time to time, data wizards at the Commerce Department take a new look at their past estimates of how large the economy was in a given quarter, and how fast it was growing, and re-evaluate those estimates using new information that has come to light.
This year, that new information includes a better way to measure the quality of cellphones, which, you may have noticed, usually improve with each new iteration.
[ The economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate in the last quarter, the government said Friday. ]
The statisticians concluded America's imported cellphones were improving more rapidly than previously calculated -- that consumers had actually gotten more for their money than we thought. That change had a ripple effect, all the way up to annual economic growth figures, which emerged from the revisions ever so slightly changed from previous estimates.
Here are four takeaways from the total package of revisions:
The economy under President Obama was better than advertised
Revisions added $82.7 billion to the size of the United States economy at the end of 2016, which means it grew a tenth of a percentage point faster in President Barack Obama's second term than previously thought. Growth in President Trump's first year in office, 2017, was actually smaller by the same amount.
That's not an economic earthquake, but the headline change does mask some bigger swings in individual components of gross domestic product. For example, companies appear to have invested $110 billion more in 2012 than previously thought, largely because the statisticians more or less missed some huge corporate spending on cloud computing technology. The revisions employed improved measures of I.T. investments, and voilà.
Winter's not as cold as it seemed
For a while now, experts at the Bureau of Economic Analysis have struggled with something called seasonal adjustment, which is their way to rebalance raw economic data to allow for an apples-to-apples comparison of growth at different times of the year. Even after two rounds of fixes, growth in the first quarter, which includes most of the winter, has consistently run lower than subsequent quarters. This revision brought what the bureau said were the final batch of fixes, and it has changed past winter numbers to look much better -- and made some quarters from later in the year look worse.
Growth in the first quarter of 2016 has been revised up to 1.5 percent, from 0.6 percent. Growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was revised down to 2.3 percent, from 2.9 percent. (That revision complicates Republican claims that growth was surging with companies' expectation that President Trump would sign a big tax cut package into law, by the way, but the revision for the first quarter of 2018 that is announced Friday could help their case that the enactment of the law sped up growth.)
Over all, growth averaged 2.1 percent in the first quarter from 2012 to 2017, up from 1.6 percent. For the third quarter, it averaged 2.4 percent, down from 2.7 percent. That may not perfectly smooth out the seasonal bumps, but it's close.
Americans are saving more than we knew
Possibly the most dramatic shift in the revisions came in the bureau's measure of the personal savings rate, which is how much Americans set aside as a share of their income each year. Last year, that rate looked really low: 3.4 percent, a level that economists warned could mean consumer spending could fall off, dampening growth.
Well, surprise! It was a mistake, apparently. The bureau made use of a new Internal Revenue Service analysis and concluded that the government had been overestimating the amount of national income held by corporations and underestimating how much of it was held by proprietors of businesses. That meant people -- as opposed to corporations -- had been sitting on more money than the government previously thought. And that meant the savings rate was higher.
The revised rate for 2017 nearly doubled, to 6.7 percent. So Americans aren't spending as unwisely as previously thought, although other statistics provide a sobering reminder of how unprepared many people are for an economic shock: In 2016, 44 percent of American households said they would not be able to easily handle a hypothetical emergency expense of $400, according to the Federal Reserve.
Your cellphone made the trade deficit worse than we thought
Americans buy a lot of phones that are made in other countries. And those phones keep getting better -- a phone you can buy for $100 today is capable of much more (for good or ill) than the phone you bought for the same price in 2013. That means it's more valuable.
Using a new tool from the Fed, the government is now better able to estimate the value of that improvement -- and see how much it underestimated it in the past.
And it turns out they underestimated by a lot. The revisions make clear that the phones Americans were importing were more valuable phones, in inflation-adjusted terms, that previously thought. Because that pushes up the real value of imports, it adds to the trade deficit, which has been in the news a bit lately.
Increasing the trade deficit detracts from the gross domestic product, so we're left with an interesting math exercise from all these revisions. For 2015, for example, a positive revision to the G.D.P. from larger-than-previously-measured levels of investment and personal spending was partially canceled out by the increase in the trade deficit from the phone you bought.
In other words, you got a better deal than you knew on that phone. Which kind of hurt the economy. At least, so far as we can tell right now.

Full text: It had become an article of investor faith on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley: Quarter after quarter, year after year, the world's biggest technology companies would keep raking in new users and ever-higher revenue. And with that, their share prices would continue to march upward, sloughing off any stumbles.
This week, that myth was shattered. And investors responded Thursday by hammering the stock of Facebook, one of the world's most valuable companies. Shares of the social media giant fell 19 percent, wiping out roughly $120 billion of shareholder wealth, among the largest one-day destruction of market value that a company has ever suffered.
Investors dumped Facebook shares after the company reported disappointing second-quarter earnings, in which the company warned of a sharp slowdown in sales growth in coming quarters along with rising spending on security and privacy enhancements.
The sudden drop also amounted to a test of the giant, technology-focused stocks that have carried the market for much of the year.
Before Facebook's tumble, more than half the returns in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index this year had been provided by just a handful of technology-related stocks, said Savita Subramanian, an equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In recent years, investors -- from individual traders to the world's largest hedge funds -- have snapped up shares in these companies, which include Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google's parent company, Alphabet. These tech giants were viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver profit growth regardless of economic conditions.
As a result, their share prices soared. This year alone Apple is up some 15 percent; Alphabet has gained more than 20 percent; Amazon has surged more than 50 percent; and Netflix is up nearly 90 percent.
Facebook's stumble suggests that some of these stocks -- as well as the broader market -- could be particularly vulnerable if their financial results don't live up to investor expectations.
Until Thursday, Facebook was enjoying enormous gains. The stock was up more than 23 percent for the year, before it reported earnings after Wednesday's close. By Thursday afternoon, all of its gains for the year had vanished.
It was the details of Facebook's report that seemed to spook investors. The company's quarterly revenue fell slightly short of meeting the expectations of Wall Street analysts. And executives warned that the company would invest heavily in privacy and security, and that revenue growth would most likely slow in coming quarters.
[Read more about the accumulation of issues Facebook said is starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business.]
Still, Facebook's sharp drop seems to have had a limited effect on the broader market, which has shown signs of gaining traction in recent weeks as companies largely reported strong second-quarter earnings.
On Thursday, the S.&P. 500 was down only slightly, despite Facebook's tumble. Other large tech firms didn't take any cues from Facebook: Alphabet shares rose 0.8 percent and Apple slipped only 0.3 percent. Amazon fell 3 percent, but recovered those losses after hours on Thursday after issuing a strong quarterly earnings report.
The S. & P. 500 fell just 0.3 percent Thursday, to 2,837.44, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent to 25,527.07. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was the hardest hit by Facebook's tumble, dropping 1 percent to 7,852.18.
The S. & P. 500 is up more than 6 percent this year despite trade tensions surrounding the United States and its largest trading partners and the Federal Reserve's increases in interest rates. The index ended Thursday only about 1 percent below its high hit on Jan. 26.
"The market is looking ahead," said Jeffrey Rubin, director of research at stock market information firm Birinyi Associates. "There are always going to be these one-day disasters."
It's quite possible that Facebook's shares could recover and continue to climb. In March, the company's handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech businesses and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms. Shares of Facebook fell 17 percent in the days after news broke. By May, the company had erased those losses.
Still, the sheer size of Facebook's fall on Thursday became a focus for investors. The decline in Facebook's market value was roughly equivalent to the entire value of some of the country's best-known companies, including McDonald's, Nike and the industrial conglomerate 3M.
There are few examples of single-day losses so large. In September 2000, as the tech stock boom turned to bust, the chip maker Intel warned that its sales could slow, sending its stock price down by more than 20 percent. The rout knocked $91 billion off its market value in a day. Adjusted for inflation, that loss would be more than $130 billion in 2018 dollars, greater than the value Facebook lost on Thursday.
But given the vast market value of today's tech giants, and the fact that 20 percent declines in share prices are not unheard-of, the size of the losses shouldn't be surprising.
Apple is now worth more than than $950 billion. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are not far behind, with market values of more than $800 billion. Even after the drop Thursday, Facebook is the fifth-largest publicly traded company, by market value, at more than $500 billion.

Full text: Workers may finally be getting a bigger piece of the economic pie -- at least in Europe. Just don't ask why, or whether it will last.
In the decade since the financial crisis, much of the global economy has recovered and is back on stable footing. Companies are reporting record profits, unemployment levels are plummeting and overall global growth is back on track.
Wages in most developed countries, however, have barely budged.
The economic puzzle has ramifications for global political as well as financial stability. Resentment among middle- and lower-class workers, and the feeling they were not getting a fair share of economic growth, helped elect Donald J. Trump and contributed to the rise of right-wing parties in parts of Europe.
"This is one of the big economic questions of our time," said Ángel Talavera, lead eurozone economist at Oxford Economics in London.
Europe may offer an exception to that trend. Wages in the eurozone are rising again after years of stagnation, a welcome development not only for working people but also for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.
The central bank has been pulling out all the stops to push inflation back toward a level considered healthy for growth. But wage increases are effectively a prerequisite for sustained inflation, and, until recently, the bank had been frustrated by the failure of eurozone citizens' paychecks to rise along with strong economic growth.
When official data last month showed that hourly wages in the eurozone rose 2 percent in the first three months of 2018 -- finally -- the central bank got the signal it was looking for. It announced it would end its main stimulus measure at the end of the year. At a meeting of the bank's Governing Council on Thursday, that plan was reaffirmed.
Yet a mystery remains. Economists have not been able to agree on why pay for most people in the United States, Europe, Japan and other wealthy countries had long been stagnant even as unemployment plummeted. In Europe, experts attribute the spike to an acute shortage of workers in countries like Germany, but there are many other theories.
And because officials don't know for sure why wage growth recovered in the region, they can't be sure it's sustainable. Japan has seen surges in wage growth that quickly sputtered.
Back in simpler days, falling unemployment usually led to higher wages. Employers had to compete harder for workers, and paychecks rose across the board. Inflation also went up, at least temporarily, as businesses passed on the higher cost of labor to customers.
The Phillips Curve, a graph plotting the inverse relationship between falling joblessness and rising inflation, named for its originator, the New Zealand-born economist William Phillips, was for decades a staple both of introductory economics courses and of monetary policy.
But in recent years the relationship between growth, wages and inflation has become much harder to understand. Economists have devoted enormous energy trying to explain why inflation and wages remained stuck in neutral even as unemployment in countries like Germany fell to record lows.
In a measure of the issue's importance, the European Central Bank made the interplay of those factors the focus of its annual gathering last month of leading economists in Sintra, Portugal.
Economists there offered numerous theories to explain the phenomenon. The decline of unions has taken away employees' bargaining power, some said. Globalization, outsourcing, and the easy flow of money and information across borders have also forced workers in wealthy countries to compete with those in poorer ones.
Another suggestion is that the rise of companies like Apple, Google and Amazon has concentrated power in fewer companies and squelched competition. And the so-called sharing economy, exemplified by Uber or Airbnb, has made many people into freelancers with few benefits.
In one much-discussed paper presented at Sintra, Uta Schönberg, a professor at University College London, compared data from Germany and France and came to the conclusion that low wage growth and rising inequality were a result of diminished bargaining power by workers.
Flat wage growth in Germany during the last two decades coincided with reforms that allowed companies to opt out of collective bargaining agreements, weakening union power. In France, where union agreements applied to whole industries and were binding for companies, wages continued to climb and inequality was less pronounced.
But France paid a price. While unemployment fell below 4 percent in Germany, it remains above 9 percent in France. The implication is that companies may not hire as much if they are locked into union wage contracts.
Professor Schönberg pointed out that pay in Germany has begun rising again, suggesting that the effect of reforms was temporary. At a certain point, low unemployment does still seem to lead to higher wages. It just may take longer than it used to.
That is no doubt what the European Central Bank is counting on. Wages are a key issue for the bank because, by law, its job is to keep inflation at or close to 2 percent. It would be hard to believe that inflation is on an upward trend without an accompanying rise in pay.
Even after five years of steady economic growth, until recently inflation in the 19-nation euro area remained stubbornly below the official target. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in May and 2 percent in June, but the numbers were not very convincing. The increases were due almost exclusively to a steep rise in energy prices, which fluctuate often.
Wage growth "was the key variable we would look at for convergence of inflation," Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in June after a meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council.
Still, economists are far away from any consensus on why wages have taken so long to rise even when companies gripe they can't find the people they need.
Mr. Talavera of Oxford Economics argues that unemployment data does not measure large numbers of workers who have given up looking for jobs. When demand for labor recovers, these people join the work force again, acting as a buffer and preventing labor shortages.
This hidden reserve of workers is bigger than economists thought, Mr. Talavera said. But in Europe it appears to have finally been exhausted. "That is one of the reasons you haven't seen wage growth picking up substantially," he said.
If he's right, that should mean that wages will continue to rise.
The fact that low wage growth has afflicted virtually every wealthy country, though, suggests that there are deeper forces at work that are not yet fully understood.
Aviv Nevo, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, summed up the mood of uncertainty about the dynamics of wages and prices by referring to the idea of the streetlight effect, where researchers look for information only where it is easiest to find, rather than probing further.
During a discussion in Sintra, Professor Nevo said, "We're all drunks looking under the lamppost."

Full text: Iran's central banker was fired on Wednesday in the first senior shake-up since the United States abandoned the nuclear agreement nearly three months ago and restored sanctions, moves that worsened an already weak Iranian economy.
The dismissed official, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank for five years, had been widely assailed for what critics called his mismanagement of Iran's monetary policy, which contributed to a steep drop in the value of the country's rial currency.
Some also faulted Mr. Seif for failing to foresee that the Trump administration would withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which had eased economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear work.
President Trump's decision, announced in May, accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial's decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity.
Mr. Seif may have been further impaired by the Trump administration's decision, after reimposing sanctions, to blacklist him for what it called his role in money transfers to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization that the United States regards as a terrorist group. The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties.
His departure, announced in Iran's state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani's government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise.
The Trump administration's warning that buyers of Iranian oil must reduce their purchases and find other suppliers, which in principle could cripple Iran's most important export, has caused particular alarm.
Mr. Rouhani's administration had said that the nuclear agreement, reached in 2015, would bring prosperity after prolonged isolation, a miscalculation that has caused a political backlash against him and his top aides. Even after Mr. Trump was elected, there was still hope in Iran that his threat to scrap the nuclear agreement was just bluster.
"From November 2016 they should have seen the dark clouds -- they were sleepwalking," said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a Brookings Institution scholar who is an expert on Iran's economy.
"Iran has had a very large shock to the economy in the last few months. That's the Trump shock," he said. "You just can't have people in there who expected this not to happen."
Mr. Rouhani's announcement of the central bank change at a cabinet meeting appeared to reflect his concession that such steps were needed to counter the criticism. Mr. Seif's replacement, Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former economics professor, banker and insurance official, had been designated as Iran's next ambassador to China before he was abruptly summoned from Beijing for the new job.
PressTV, an official Iranian news outlet, said Mr. Rouhani had described Mr. Hemmati as "an experienced banker and insurer, with good manners, high spirits and strong capabilities, recommending all members of the government to cooperate with him."
Precisely how Mr. Hemmati intends to slow or halt the fall in the rial's value remains unclear.
It took about 30,000 rials to buy $1 when Mr. Seif took over in 2013. Now it costs more than 90,000 to buy $1. By some estimates, Iranians have taken nearly $60 billion out of the country in the past few years.
"People don't think holding rials is the best way of preserving their savings," Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said.
The central bank shake-up came as Iran dismissed any prospect of talking with Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday appeared to keep open the possibility of negotiating a new agreement with Iran that he called "a real deal," two days after he threatened Mr. Rouhani in an apocalyptic Twitter message.
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, said negotiations with the United States would never happen "under the shadow of threats," PressTV reported.
"The United States should not bite off more than it can chew and should know its place in this era, and make further efforts to understand Iran's status, dignity and role," Mr. Qassemi was quoted as saying.

How to Tell if the Trade War Is Starting to Damage the U.S. Economy

Full text: There's no question that some American companies are feeling the bite of the trade war that the Trump administration is waging against much of the world.
As others have reported, a Missouri nail factory is laying off people because of tariffs on imported steel; Harley-Davidson plans to move some production to Europe in response to retaliatory tariffs; soybean farmers face a loss of income resulting from new Chinese import taxes.
But it's a mistake to assume that difficulties of individual companies and industries are the same as a force powerful enough to bend the overall trajectory of the United States economy.
"The direct effects on the U.S. economy are small, because the economy is really big and it is mostly domestically driven," said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. "Still, tariffs hurt, and we're starting to see some precursors of an impact already."
To assess how the trade war could affect growth, the job market and inflation at the macroeconomic level, you need data. The trouble is that much economic data operates with long time lags. By the time there would be solid evidence that the trade war was doing damage, the damage would already have been done.
But certain indicators are likely to provide early signs of trouble: data that is more big picture than individual anecdotes, but more timely than things like G.D.P. and the unemployment rate.
If you want a dashboard for evidence of economic damage from the trade war, here's what should be on it.
Business Confidence and Capital Spending: Look to Surveys
One of the key ways trade tensions can slow a nation's overall growth is by causing businesses to pull back on capital expenditures.
The hard data on business investment tends to be released with long delays. If executives become gloomier about the future, the earliest evidence will probably come from frequent surveys of them.
For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia surveys manufacturers about their plans for capital spending; that measure has fallen in the last few months. Other surveys, like one of small businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business, suggest more stable capital spending plans.
But while the evidence is uneven today, these market indicators and confidence surveys could amount to the canary in the trade war coal mine if they take a decisive turn for the worse.
"I am watching business sentiment very closely," said Nathan Sheets, chief economist of PGIM Fixed Income. "If we started to see business sentiment turn, that would be an indication that key constituencies in the business community are getting nervous."
The Stock Market: Exporters vs. the Rest
The closest thing to a real-time indicator of the trade war's possible effect on corporate profits is the stock market. Several household-name companies with deep exposure to global commerce, like Boeing, Caterpillar and John Deere, have become bellwethers for the trade war.
But to understand whether trade tensions are affecting the overall economy, it's worth watching whether dips in the stock market remain limited to those companies with direct exposure to global commerce, or start to encompass even service industries and those with mainly domestic business.
"While a few small companies have been hit very hard by the tit-for-tat tariff war, in general, smaller companies are less impacted than big multinationals with global supply chains and worldwide sales," said Blu Putnam, chief economist of the CME Group. "Hence, the Russell 2000 has been outperforming the S.&P. 500 as the trade war has intensified."
If that changes, it will be evidence that the trade war is translating into gloomier prospects for the United States economy as a whole.
Prices and Inflation: What Futures Tell Us
One likely effect of a trade war is on prices -- in most cases, increasing them for American consumers.
This will eventually show up in overall inflation numbers, but that could take time, especially since most of the early rounds of tariffs are aimed not at finished consumer goods but at raw materials and industrial products.
You can get some sense of what's coming by looking at commodity futures markets for items that are affected. Many businesses, for example, have reported higher steel and aluminum prices because of tariffs on imported metals.
Futures markets offer clues as to how long traders think the higher prices will last. For example, the current price for Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel is $916 per short ton -- but futures prices imply that will fall to $759 by December of 2019.
In other words, for that particular commodity, the smart money seems to think that higher prices will be temporary.
The inverse of higher prices for metals is evident in lower prices for soybeans and other agriculture products -- caused by Chinese and European retaliatory tariffs that depress international demand.
The price of soybeans has fallen sharply. But futures markets currently imply that they will rebound, to $9.04 per bushel by early 2020 from $8.48 now.
For both goods, the market prices suggest the trade distortions will be temporary. If that changes, it will be a bigger deal for both overall price inflation facing consumers and for the incomes of farmers and other producers of commodities.
It's also worth keeping an eye on the producer price index, calculated by the Labor Department, which captures the prices of the raw materials that companies use to make finished products. If the trade war is going to feed into broader consumer inflation, it is likely to show up there first.
Jobs: Look to the Claims
The trade war is arriving amid the healthiest labor market in at least 18 years, with the unemployment rate around 4 percent. But how will we tell if it's starting to cause pain?
The earliest sign would probably be in the portions of business confidence surveys that ask about hiring intentions. The Institute for Supply Management's employment index, a subcomponent of its survey of manufacturers, pulled back a bit in June, but was still at a level indicating healthy job creation.
If indicators like that one started to fall, it would be a sign that the trade war was making companies more reluctant to hire.
Similarly, if the anecdotal reports of layoffs caused by tariffs became widespread, you would expect to see the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits spike upward.
That data is released weekly, so it is the closest thing we have to a real-time barometer of layoffs. But so far it shows no hint of trouble; jobless claims have hovered near record lows in recent weeks -- including hitting the lowest level since 1969 in the most recent report.
How do things look if you put it all together? As of mid-July, the evidence that the trade war is doing meaningful economic damage is scarce. But by keeping an eye on the right tools, it's possible to get early warning signs if that starts to change.

Forecast For Inflation In Venezuela: 1,000,000%

Full text: MEDELLÍN, Colombia -- The prediction was eye-popping even for Venezuela's collapsing economy: One million percent inflation by year's end, according to the International Monetary Fund.
On Monday, the fund released a periodic estimate of growth and inflation rates around Latin America, a roundup that included neighbors like Chile (where inflation should be headed to 3 percent) and Peru (where growth is predicted to reach 3.7 percent).
But it is Venezuela that continues to chart a different course from neighbors--with an increasingly breakneck economic disintegration.
Real gross domestic product, the value of goods and services produced in the economy and adjusted for inflation, is expected to fall by 18 percent in 2018, the third consecutive year of double-digit declines, the fund estimated.
And then there is the million-percent inflation.
"We are projecting a surge in inflation to 1,000,000 percent by end-2018 to signal that the situation in Venezuela is similar to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000's," the fund stated in its report.
With Venezuela's government not releasing official figures, the fund's prediction gave a concrete number to a situation that the country has felt with increasing urgency this year.
On the streets of Caracas, the capital, prices have skyrocketed to levels so high that many vendors now refuse to take bolívars bank notes, the national currency, because their value is eroding so fast. Some wealthy Venezuelans have turned to alternatives like Bitcoin. Store owners guess the prices they should be charging for goods; restaurant menus change weekly; and the price of the dollar, sold on the black market, has reached 3.5 million bolívars.
The inflation crisis comes on top of deep political repression led by President Nicolás Maduro, who was declared the winner of a vote this year that will extend his term until 2025. Lack of basic food and medicine has forced hundreds of thousands to flee the country. The authorities in neighboring Colombia said last week that 870,000 Venezuelans were now in the country.
In its report, the monetary fund blamed drops in oil production and "large macroeconomic imbalances" for the country's financial problems. It painted a grim picture for the months ahead, predicting that government officials would run fiscal deficits paid for by printing more money, "which will continue to fuel an acceleration of inflation."
For its part, Venezuela's government says the woes are a result of an "economic war" waged on it by the United States and wealthy businessmen hoarding supplies and raising prices.
While the million-percent figure may be largely symbolic, the fund's prediction that the country would soon mirror some of history's worst episodes of inflation caught the attention of analysts.
"At this point, the Titanic is at a 270 degree angle from where it should be,"said Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez, an economist at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
The period after World War I ruined the economy of the German Weimar Republic. Before the war, the dollar was worth 4.2 marks; by 1923, a dollar cost 4.2 trillion marks. Germany eventually replaced its currency and stabilized it, but millions were financially ruined.
Zimbabwe faced a similar fate under Robert Mugabe after land confiscations and strongman rule precipitated a financial collapse. At one point the country printed a note worth 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollars. The country eventually scrapped its currency as well.
But Mr. Lansberg-Rodriguez said Venezuela might be less successful in fixing its currency issues because of a history of botched attempts to replace the bolívar. He added that Zimbabwe was in a better position to recover because it had a more diversified economy than Venezuela's.
"The level of chaos in Venezuela makes it that much more difficult to restore confidence and break out of this cycle," he said.

Full text: GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- Guyana is a vast, watery wilderness with only three paved highways. There are a few dirt roads between villages that sit on stilts along rivers snaking through the rain forest. Children in remote areas go to school in dugout canoes, and play naked in the muggy heat.
Hugging the coast are musty clapboard towns like Georgetown, the capital, which seems forgotten by time, honeycombed with canals first built by Dutch settlers and African slaves. The power grid is so unreliable that blackouts are a regular plague in the cities, while in much of the countryside there is no electricity at all.
Such is the unlikely setting for the world's next big oil boom.
In the last three years, ExxonMobil has drilled eight gushing discovery wells offshore. With the potential to generate nearly $20 billion in oil revenue annually by the end of the next decade, roughly equivalent to the revenues of the much-larger Colombia, there could be enough bounty to lift the lives of almost every Guyanese.
If all goes well, one of the poorest countries in South America could become one of the wealthiest. Suddenly the talk of Georgetown is a proposed sovereign wealth fund to manage all the money, as if this were a Persian Gulf sheikhdom.
But there are obstacles. If history is any guide, countries that discover oil often waste their opportunity, as the resource blends seamlessly with corruption. Countries with weak political institutions like Guyana are especially vulnerable.
"You have an alignment of money and power in the hands of the state, so the party in power controls the resources," said Floyd Haynes, a Guyanese-born finance professor who is a consultant to Business Ministry. "And the money is usually squandered, misapplied or downright stolen."
Senior government officials here have little experience regulating a big oil industry or negotiating with international companies. The civil service is corrupt, and the private sector is slow to innovate, businessmen and aides to senior officials acknowledge.
Still, there is cautious optimism. "We see this oil discovery as almost like providence," said Raphael Trotman, the natural resources minister. "We've been given a second chance to get things right."
The first chance was independence from Britain in 1966, and that chance was blown. A plague of ethnic tribal politics has produced a fragile state with an economy propelled by drug trafficking, money-laundering, and gold and diamond smuggling. A vast majority of college-educated youths emigrate to the United States or Canada, while those who stay behind experience high rates of H.I.V. infection, crime and suicide.
Can oil wealth help Guyana overcome its history, or will the windfall that will flood government coffers merely turn the page to a new tragic chapter?
"The challenges are enormous and shouldn't be underestimated," said Lars Mangal, president of Totaltec Oilfield Services, a Guyanese company seeking to train local workers in safety and basic oil operations. "We have to overcome nepotism, entitlements, corruption, cynicism and skepticism."
The Guyanese government, under its agreement with Exxon, will receive roughly half the cash flow from oil production once the company's costs are repaid. Economists say that will mean the country's current gross domestic product of $3.6 billion will at least triple in five years.
But with exploration out of sight 120 miles offshore, and no refinery planned, the economic benefits for the population have been limited so far, making some cynical. Only about 600 Guyanese have found direct employment on the drill rigs, shore bases and offices, and that number may increase only to about 1,000, oil executives say.
"When we have big projects, we hire foreign companies who bring their own workers," said Khemraj Dhaneshrie, a young chemist at the Leonora estate sugar mill.
Mr. Dhaneshrie is typically skeptical about his government's ability to oversee foreign operations after Guyana's long experience of opportunistic Chinese investment. He noted that the Chinese financed and built an enormous factory in 2009 to rescue the sugar industry, but it turned out to be a $181 million boondoggle.
"The Chinese cut down our forest, dug out our gold, and we never got a cent," he said. "We could end up with the same experience with ExxonMobil."
In the Past, Wasted Opportunities
Colorful Hindu monuments tower over Guyana's rice fields, a reminder of the cultural distance between the country and its Latin American neighbors. It is English speaking because of the legacy of British rule, and its two biggest ethnic groups are Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese -- the descendants of slaves from Africa and of indentured servants brought from the Indian subcontinent in the 19th century.
Until now, the country had never produced oil, and traditionally it has traded its rice crop for fuel from Venezuela. Now it is attracting experienced Texas oilmen like Doug McGehee, Exxon's Guyana operations manager.
Over the last 37 years working for ExxonMobil, Mr. McGehee has taken his black cowboy boots, silver belt buckle and Texas A&M class ring into the oil fields of Angola, Kazakhstan and Equatorial Guinea. In all those places, oil wealth has risen to the top, only to leave the poor behind. Last year, for example, a Paris criminal court convicted the vice president of Equatorial Guinea of money-laundering and embezzling more than $100 million.
But as Mr. McGehee monitored operations aboard the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship on a recent day, he insisted that Guyana could be different.
"The math is right here," he said, noting that the country has a tiny population -- below 800,000 -- to share all the new wealth. Guyana's government stands to take in more than $6 billion in royalties and taxes annually by the end of the 2020s, according to the Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy.
"If the government manages the resource right, every Guyanese should benefit with better schools, better health facilities, better roads," Mr. McGehee said.
That is no small "if."
Guyanese need look no further than neighboring Venezuela to see a failed state where the world's largest oil reserves have not prevented hunger, shortages of medicine and hyperinflation from producing widespread misery. Nearby Trinidad and Tobago offers another example of how countries dependent on oil can neglect traditional industries and then suffer severe economic shocks when crude and natural gas prices fall.
Scholars call the syndrome the "resource curse."
Others warn of the "Dutch disease," a phenomenon so labeled in the 1970s after a natural gas boom sapped the strength of manufacturing in the Netherlands. Nations that contract the disease from a sudden influx of mineral money typically suffer a surge of inflation, while labor from farming and other traditional professions is drawn to the higher-paying oil sector. Thus, wealth becomes more concentrated.
There are some examples of countries effectively using oil to reduce poverty. Malaysia, with large offshore oil production, has kept its economy diversified and growing. In the Middle East, Oman is a model for using oil and gas wealth to modernize its economy.
But dispiriting examples of wasted opportunity abound.
"We're all concerned about the negatives," Prime Minister Moses V. Nagamootoo said.
Dawn Chung Layne, who operates a sewing business out of her mother-in-law's concrete house in Georgetown, is also anxious. She is attending workshops at the Center for Local Business Development, a program financed by Exxon, to learn ways she can benefit from the oil economy. She hopes to make curtains and linen for cafeterias on the oil ships, and uniforms for sports teams established by foreign companies and their families.
But she also sees risks in these new ventures. More affluent Guyanese may turn away from the sports uniforms she already makes to buy name brands like Nike and Adidas, she said, and she is concerned that food prices will rise.
"Check out the Trinidad economy," she said. "They thought oil was the best thing since sliced bread, and they spent Sunday to Sunday. They stopped producing and imported everything with oil money. It could happen here."
'This Could Be Game Changing'
Before the recent breakthrough, various oil companies had drilled more than 40 wells off Guyana and neighboring Suriname since the 1960s. All were dry holes or otherwise not economically promising. But as oil prices rose a few years ago, Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell decided to take another look. (Shell eventually dropped out of the partnership.)
Exxon's top geoscientist on the scene was Kerry Moreland, an Oklahoman whose family has been in oil for three generations. Ms. Moreland toyed with becoming a professional bowler and had interned as a tornado chaser for a Tulsa television station before going to work for Exxon and traveling the world in search of new fields. She pinpointed on the map where the first deepwater well, named Liza-1, should be drilled.
Recalling the day three years ago when she decided to duck out of some business meetings in Georgetown to visit the drilling platform, she said there was no more than a 20 percent chance that a meaningful amount of oil would burst out from three miles below the ocean bottom.
As luck would have it, just as her helicopter landed on the platform, the drill bit penetrated the oil reservoir. She went to the control room as the first data from the wells showed promising signs of hydrocarbons. When rock fragments came to the surface a few hours later, they were dripping with oil.
"At that moment, it was 'Oh, my God, we've made a discovery,"' Ms. Moreland said. "You have to pinch yourself and ask, 'Is this really happening?' And it hit right then, this could be game changing for the country, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. It was a dream come true for any geologist."
Exxon is known in the industry as a slow-moving, stodgy company, but Ms. Moreland's enthusiasm caught fire through the executive wing in the Texas headquarters known as the God Pod. Within three months, the company sent two vessels to conduct the largest three-dimensional seismic test that Exxon had ever undertaken, over 6,500 square miles, in search of more oil.
There's a lot at stake for Exxon in Guyana.
In recent years, its stock price has slumped because of disappointing production and depleting reserves. The company invested heavily in Canadian oil sands and in natural gas when prices were high, bets that have not worked out as well as expected. While the company was forced to write off large assets in Canada, Western sanctions on Russia foiled its plans to drill in the Russian Arctic.
Darren Woods, the company's chief executive, has a plan to reverse company fortunes, and Guyana is a big part of it.
Leading a consortium that includes Hess and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Exxon is making an effort here that is nothing if not ambitious. Within three years of its big first discovery, it has begun drilling the first of 17 wells that will start yielding oil in 2020, with a floating production, storage and offloading vessel able to handle 120,000 barrels a day. And that is just the first phase.
Another floating vessel, with a capacity of 220,000 barrels a day, is planned, and a third vessel is being considered. In all, 500,000 barrels a day could be produced by sometime in the next decade -- the equivalent of Ecuador's national output. (Repsol of Spain, Tullow Oil of Britain and other companies are exploring, too.)
"It's a growth area for us," said Mr. McGehee, the Exxon operations manager. "We keep finding oil."
That produces nothing but excitement for the 60 Guyanese workers on the Noble Bob Douglas drill ship, who have typically seen their incomes soar.
Gorshum Inniss, a 25-year-old roustabout with an easy smile and flashing dark eyes, is working on a crane crew lifting casing pipe for new wells, doubling what he earned working on a tugboat. He said he now had enough money to visit his parents and younger brother in New York and planned to build a house for him and his daughter.
"I'm proud to be one of the pioneers in this big moment for Guyana," he said. "I see Guyana as the new Middle East."
An Endangered Beach?
Not far from the turbulent Venezuelan border, there is a quiet stretch of coastline, pounded by surf, known as Shell Beach because its sand is made of tiny crushed seashells that make it feel like sawdust. Several endangered species of turtles come to nest at night. Once hunted for food, they are jealously guarded from poachers by residents who make a living fishing and selling coconuts.
Audley James, a former turtle hunter who makes necklaces out of beads and coconut shells, remembers when Trinidadian environmental consultants representing Repsol came six years ago to give two days of spill-response training.
The Trinidadians taught the residents how to lay temporary floating barriers to protect the beach from an oil spill, and gave them training certificates that look like diplomas. But there has been no further training that might prepare them for what is now a much less theoretical hazard.
"Plenty of us don't understand what is going on," Mr. James said.
Environmentalists are worried that oil will forestall development of renewable energy and that the government and oil companies are not fully prepared to prevent a possible spill.
"It's two years before first oil, and we don't have a national oil spill contingency plan," said Annette Arjoon-Martins, president of the Guyana Marine Conservation Society. "We have our hands in the mouth of a jaguar."
Ms. Arjoon-Martins said the government's agreement with Exxon did not specify in enough detail the company's responsibilities in case of a spill. Government officials disagreed, saying the country's laws would hold the company fully liable.
Exxon executives say the company is doing everything possible to minimize the dangers of a spill disaster. The company has skimmers and oil booms on hand to collect errant oil, and it has applied to the government to use chemical dispersants in an emergency to break up any spilled oil. They say Guyana is close enough to the Gulf of Mexico to bring in plenty of help in an emergency.
The company has agreed to map the coastal mangroves and study the area's fish, bird and turtle migration routes to set priorities in case a cleanup is ever needed, executives said. And in another potential environmental benefit, the company is planning to build a natural-gas pipeline to shore that will replace the heavy fuel oil burned for the country's power plants, lowering costs to consumers and businesses.
"We are committed to develop these resources in the most responsible way with a minimal impact on the environment," said Rod Henson, Exxon's Guyana manager. "We stand by our operations, and in the unlikely event of an incident, we will absolutely respond immediately and we will fully take care of our responsibilities."
Local oil executives say one obstacle to overcome is a lackadaisical attitude toward safety among Guyanese workers, who frequently arrive at their construction and wharf jobs in flip-flops and sometimes use their hard hats as soup bowls. That is something Exxon and other companies are working to change with courses and other training that teach workers to be careful, not only for their own safety but also to safeguard the fragile marine environment.
At a recent daily meeting of the crew of the Noble Bob Douglas to review environmental and safety precautions, Mr. Inniss, the roustabout, was given a chance to make his own safety presentation. He told of a serious accident he had a couple of years ago working on his motorcycle when he neglectfully left the motor running while adjusting a chain. He lost three fingertips.
"Use your heads before you use your hands," he told the room full of Guyanese and American workers. He got an ovation and smiled proudly.
'I See a Lot of Red Flags'
To visit the most senior oil regulator in Georgetown, one needs to climb an exterior staircase of warped wood that could sorely use a fresh coat of paint.
At the top is the tiny office of Newell Dennison, the acting head of the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission, whose desk is stacked high with folders beside a single metal filing cabinet. His office is spare of decorations, aside from two bouquets of artificial tropical flowers.
Mr. Dennison has a computer by his desk, from which he could consult data gathered by Exxon drill ships, though he said he had yet to do so. "We're in transition," he explained. "It's a challenge."
For all the international attention that Guyana's oil bonanza is beginning to generate, Mr. Dennison and the Department of Natural Resources have a mere nine technically trained people responsible for regulating oil production, engineering and geological research.
"You would expect we would have a problem to have 100 percent monitoring with our lack of resources," said Mr. Dennison, a middle-aged geologist with horn-rimmed glasses and a neatly trimmed goatee. "My commission cannot be all of a sudden everything people expect us to be."
There are a few signs of progress.
Guyana's president, David A. Granger, a retired military commander leading a fractious coalition, has tried to establish a legal framework for the coming bonanza. To bypass corrupt officials, Mr. Granger has announced his intention to form an energy department for policymaking, responsible to the president, and an independent petroleum commission to regulate the industry and grant exploration and production licenses.
Under pressure to break with past secretive deals with international companies, Mr. Granger published Guyana's contract with Exxon on a government website in December, opening a vigorous public debate on its terms. He has promised to end closed-door bidding for drilling rights, and to open auctions for future development.
Many of the changes have been promoted by Jan Mangal, Mr. Granger's personal petroleum adviser and brother of Lars Mangal, the businessman. Jan Mangal, a Guyanese-born former Chevron project manager, has advised the president to put a hold on new leasing until the petroleum commission can be established with new personnel and has called for an investigation of several oil-exploration concessions made by the previous government to small oil companies.
"I see a lot of red flags," said Mr. Mangal, who shuttles between Guyana and his home in Houston. "We cannot allow the Guyanese industry to be built around this shabby foundation of corruption."
There are other signs of trouble.
Foreign development bank advisers have told the government that legislation to create a sovereign wealth fund to invest the royalties and taxes coming to the government lacks sufficient regulatory controls to avert corruption. The legislation is now in limbo. Mr. Granger's energy department has not gotten off the ground, and a bill to set up the petroleum commission is stuck in the National Assembly.
That leaves Mr. Dennison and his commission in charge of regulation. He said he and everyone in the government felt pressure to get things right.
"Of course I worry," Mr. Dennison said.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump accused China and the European Union on Friday of manipulating their currencies to gain an edge in global trade and escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying those moves were putting the United States at a disadvantage.
Mr. Trump appears ready to blame the Fed for trying to slow down a booming economy that he wants to make a centerpiece of the midterm elections. The president's $1.5 trillion tax cut, along with federal spending increases, have injected new stimulus into an economy that is finally shaking off the last vestiges of the recession.
In a flurry of early-morning Twitter posts, Mr. Trump complained that the Fed's pattern of rate increases "hurts all that we have done" and that a "stronger and stronger" United States dollar was "taking away our big competitive edge."
He also doubled down on his trade fight with China, vowing in an interview with CNBC that aired Friday that he was ready to impose tariffs on $500 billion worth of Chinese imports -- roughly all the goods China sends to the United States each year.
But behind Mr. Trump's criticism is an economic paradox of his own making: The very policies he has pushed, like tax cuts, increased government spending or protectionist tariffs, are fueling many of the global changes that he finds so troubling.
A booming United States economy is strengthening the dollar against other currencies, and Mr. Trump's tariffs are prompting some countries, like China, to take steps to protect their exporters. The Fed, concerned about too rapid an expansion that is fueled in part by the enormous fiscal stimulus ushered in by the White House, is slowly raising rates to keep the economy from overheating.
White House aides said that Mr. Trump was not trying to influence the Fed, the nation's central bank, but added that he would prefer if officials paused their plans for rate increases to avoid dampening economic growth. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is on track to raise them twice more by the end of the year, officials indicated after the Fed's meeting in June.
Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, said the president's tweets displayed "a breezy ignorance of facts and limited understanding of basic principles of economics."
"The dollar is strengthening against other currencies because the U.S. economy is doing well and is implementing a fiscal expansion through a massive tax cut, both of which Mr. Trump has claimed credit for," Mr. Prasad said. He added that condemning rate increases as "implicitly aiding the enemy in U.S. trade wars is a dangerous and destructive strike against the Fed's independence."
While financial markets seemed to shrug off Mr. Trump's initial comments on the Federal Reserve, which came on Thursday, his Twitter posts on Friday -- all of which seemed aimed at pushing the dollar lower -- drew a reaction.
The dollar, as measured by the United States dollar index, fell sharply. Prices of 30-year United States Treasury bonds, which are highly sensitive to changes in inflation expectations, also dropped, pushing yields -- which move in the opposite direction -- higher. Prices for gold, a traditional hedge against inflation risk, rose.
"Trump clearly doesn't accept that a strong dollar and a widening trade deficit are the natural result of his own fiscal expansion," said Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the White House's National Economic Council, said in an interview that the president strongly believed that his policies would increase investment and draw workers into the labor force.
"The United States is the hottest economy and investment destination in the world right now," thanks largely to Mr. Trump's policies, Mr. Kudlow said. "Money is flowing in from everywhere, and that's terrific."
Mr. Trump's sharp words come ahead of a gathering in Argentina this weekend of finance ministers of the Group of 20 countries, where Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, is expected to participate in a dozen bilateral meetings and broader multilateral meetings. The chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, will also be in attendance and will participate in a discussion on global economic risk, the Treasury Department said.
It will be the third such meeting of the world's top economic officials in recent months in which Mr. Mnuchin is expected to bear the brunt of the frustration of American allies. Viewed as a voice of moderation on trade in the Trump administration, Mr. Mnuchin will once again try to do damage control and will be a sounding board for growing concerns about American tariffs on steel and aluminum and the prospect of new tariffs on automobile imports.
In a slew of trade actions, the president has already imposed tariffs on about 4 percent of American imports, including foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar-power products, and a variety of goods from China. But he has threatened to greatly escalate those measures, expanding tariffs to cover about a quarter of all United States imports.
A senior Treasury official who previewed the event said that Mr. Mnuchin does not have a meeting scheduled with Chinese officials in Buenos Aires. They are expected to interact during the multilateral discussions, but one-on-one negotiations are currently stalled.
The Treasury secretary will meet separately this weekend with counterparts from Group of 7 countries to discuss ways to coordinate "concrete action with regard to China and its economic aggression," the official said.
In the interview with CNBC, the president described the tit-for-tat threats on China as a poker game, saying the trade conflict was "the right thing to do for our country."
"I raised 50, and they matched us," he said. "I said, 'You don't match us. You can't match us because otherwise we're always going to be behind the 8-ball."'
China's currency has weakened in recent months, though economists debate whether the change has been propelled by markets turning more cautious or whether Beijing has sought to weaken its currency to bolster its exporters. Mr. Trump's own Treasury Department declined to label either the European Union or China a "currency manipulator" in an April report.
Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said that China would be able to offset the effect of Mr. Trump's tariffs through changes to its currency. However, any changes would have to be made gradually to avoid alarming investors and prompting capital flight, which could destabilize Chinese markets.
Mr. Trump's trade actions have invited retaliation from Europe, Mexico, Canada and other countries, as well as China, taking a heavy toll on major American exporters, including farmers. In another Twitter post on Friday, Mr. Trump defended his strategy.
"Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years," he said. "The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers."
Farmers have been struggling with lower commodity prices in recent years, but the price of soybeans has plummeted sharply since the beginning of May, as China, the United States' biggest foreign buyer, threatened to curtail its purchases.
Though Mr. Trump has a strong base of support among American farmers, many insist that exporting is vital for their livelihoods and that trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the president has heavily criticized, have benefited them. American agricultural exports have nearly tripled since Nafta went into force in 1994, reaching $140.47 billion in 2017. They continue to outpace agricultural imports, which have also risen.
"Trade has been the one bright spot for farmers," said Joseph W. Glauber, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. "Until the tariffs were put on, farm exports have been near record highs in value."
Ron Moore, the chairman of the American Soybean Association and a farmer in Illinois, said that tariff threats had appeared to have caused the market to collapse in recent months. "There's extreme amount of volatility in the marketplace right now," he said. "That really makes farmers nervous. We've all got bills to pay."

Full text: The drugmaker Merck said Thursday that it would lower prices on several drugs by 10 percent or more, but its rollback affects minor products and would not lower the cost of its top-selling, expensive cancer and diabetes products.
The move follows recent announcements by Pfizer and Novartis that they would freeze price increases for the rest of the year, as the industry confronts sustained criticism from President Trump, lawmakers and the public over the rising cost of prescriptions.
Merck's action shows just how cautiously the industry is shifting strategies: It did not cut the prices of any blockbusters like the cancer treatment Keytruda or the diabetes drug Januvia. Instead, it said it would reduce by 60 percent the list price of Zepatier, a hepatitis C drug whose recent sales have dipped so low that, after paying after-the-fact rebates to insurers, the company recorded no sales in the United States for the product in the first quarter of this year.
The six other products that Merck said it was discounting were drugs that had lost their patent protection and are available from other manufacturers as low-cost generics.
In a statement, Merck said it was lowering the prices in an effort to reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients. It also said it would not increase the average net price -- the amount after discounts are applied -- of its products above the rate of inflation for the rest of the year.
Major drug companies have become the target of escalating tension over prices, and the Department of Health and Human Services, now run by Alex M. Azar II, a former pharmaceutical executive, has been weighing options to make some changes.
The president has repeatedly slammed pharmaceutical companies. Just last week, Mr. Trump singled out Pfizer in a tweet for raising prices on dozens of drugs, increases the company has since deferred. After freezing their prices, Novartis and Pfizer have since been rewarded with congratulatory presidential tweets.
His administration outlined a detailed proposal to address the issue, a plan that received more than 2,000 comments, many from the drug and benefit managers industries.
Mr. Trump had announced in May that major drug companies would, within two weeks, enact "voluntary massive drops" in prices, but that did not happen.
Merck's announcement on Thursday appeared to be the first time in recent memory that a company pledged to lower the list price of its drugs.
Adam J. Fein, chief executive of the Drug Channels Institute, said even though Merck's move was small, it reduces how much middlemen like wholesalers and pharmacy benefit managers are paid. "Every player's economics change when list price drops," he said. If others follow suit, he said, "we are moving into uncharted waters."
Much of the outrage over high drug prices has been driven by the gap between the list price of a drug, which is set by the manufacturer, and the net price, which is the amount -- after rebates -- that insurers and large employers pay.
Consumers are often exposed to the higher list price because they either do not have insurance, or because their insurance requires them to pay the list price before their deductible is met. In the statement, Merck said that it chose the drugs "based on a range of factors including the gap between list price and actual discounted (net) prices paid in the market, the contractual obligations under existing arrangements with payers, and the opportunity to broaden access to treatment."
Zepatier has struggled in recent years in the face of competition from other hepatitis C treatments, and fewer patients who are seeking treatment for the disease. Zepatier brought in $131 million in global sales in the first quarter of 2018, a 65 percent decline over the first quarter of 2017. After paying rebates to insurers, the company recorded $0 in United States sales of Zepatier for the first quarter.
By contrast, the cancer treatment Keytruda had sales in the United States of $838 million in the first quarter of 2018. The diabetes drug Januvia brought in $465 million in the same period.
Other drugs that Merck said it would discount its price on include the brand-name versions of products that long ago lost their patent protection and are readily available from competitors at steeply discounted prices. They include Prinivil, the brand name for the blood pressure drug lisinopril, which lost its patent protection in 2002.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: The National Guideline Clearinghouse is a federal database intended to help doctors answer almost any medical question you can think of: Can this emergency room patient tolerate a procedure that normally requires an empty stomach? Does that patient need a stent? Which antibiotic should this patient be started on?
If that sounds like a small matter, it isn't. The sheer volume of medical information now within a few clicks' reach can make it difficult, even for doctors, to separate wheat from chaff. Clinical guidelines based on careful consideration and solid impartial research can be difficult to tell apart from those based on weak data, or rooted in a clear conflict of interest (usually a financial stake in whatever treatment they are promoting). The clearinghouse, which not only vets countless sources of medical information but also makes its results easily searchable, is regarded as the most dependable repository of its kind in the world.
On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services took it offline, the latest casualty in an administration determined to eliminate science from the government's agenda.
The official explanation is maddening enough: a budget shortfall that roughly equals the amount Tom Price spent on travel during his brief tenure as department secretary. The site costs just $1.2 million a year to operate, and is maintained by an agency with a budget of more than $300 million.
But the more complete explanation -- involving political discord over the site's parent agency and sustained indifference on the part of doctors and patients -- should concern anyone worried about the state of American health care.
The clearinghouse was created in the 1990s as part of a wider movement to better link the practice of medicine to sound scientific research. It has been in danger of disappearing almost since the start.
Republicans argue that the database is redundant with other programs. But in some cases, other motivations for eliminating it have been all too clear. In the late 1990s, when it endorsed nonsurgical interventions for back pain, the back surgeon lobby waged an attack that resulted in huge funding cuts and placed a permanent target on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (A.H.R.Q.), the agency that houses the database.
Since then, A.H.R.Q. has survived numerous attempts on its life, most recently in 2017, when the Trump administration proposed folding it into the National Institutes of Health. To its credit, Congress rejected that proposal, and instead gave the agency a $10 million bump. But the increase was not enough to undo the damage done by all the previous years' cuts. Adjusted for inflation, A.H.R.Q. has lost about $120 million in funding since 2010.
The agency's staff has managed to keep the clearinghouse database afloat by taking money from one pot, then another, as funds dry up, but this year it ran out of pots.
Budget cuts are not the only problem, though. The clearinghouse gets about 200,000 visitors a month, and professional medical societies have protested the database's closing. But many individual doctors have greeted the news with a shrug, saying they rarely visit the site anyway. And most consumers have no idea what the database is, or why it matters.
That's too bad. America spends around $3.5 trillion a year on health care, and more than $30 billion on biomedical research. But we have made very little effort to link the two. In fact, studies indicate that much of the care we receive is not based on any sound scientific evidence; we receive only about half of the care we do need, and a lot of care that doesn't benefit us at all. The clearinghouse, were it better utilized, could help solve this problem, and in so doing, could improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs.
Health officials say they're working aggressively to get the database back online, either by handing it off to another agency, outside company or nonprofit group, or through a public-private partnership of some kind. It is not clear how those efforts will fare. Would a new operator adhere to the same standards of quality and impartiality that the site is known for? Will the database itself still be public and free? And if the answer to those questions is no, who will speak up?
A better solution would almost certainly be for Congress to appropriate the money needed to keep the database up and running. It could do that simply by renewing the Affordable Care Act fund that was covering the database's operating costs, and that is scheduled to expire in 2019.
Of course, Congress will take that action only if constituents demand it. But in a country that has voted representatives in and out of office based on their health care policies, and that prides itself on drawing attention to intractable diseases (we dump ice buckets on our heads to raise funds to fight A.L.S., and walk countless miles for breast cancer), evidence-based medicine should be an easy sell.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- President Trump criticized the Federal Reserve on Thursday for raising interest rates, a rare rebuke by a sitting president that upends longstanding White House protocol to avoid commenting on monetary policy.
Mr. Trump, in an interview with CNBC set to air on Friday morning, said that he was "not thrilled" about the Fed's decision to raise interest rates twice so far this year, to a current range of 1.75 to 2 percent. He implied that the moves, which are aimed at getting interest rates back to historically normal levels, could derail his administration's efforts to bolster the economy and put the United States at a disadvantage.
"I don't like all of this work that we're putting into the economy and then I see rates going up," Mr. Trump said, according to excerpts released by CNBC. "I am not happy about it."
The highly unusual comments come as Mr. Trump and Republicans try to make a booming economy a big issue in the midterm elections this year. At a White House event on Thursday, Mr. Trump -- flanked by executives from some of the biggest companies in the country -- announced a worker retraining program that he said would further goose employment. On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers are trying to pass a second round of tax cuts that would make permanent many of the individual cuts in last year's $1.5 trillion package.
But as the economy finally gains steam after years of sluggish growth in the wake of the Great Recession, the Fed is facing a delicate political and economic balance. Unemployment is at an 18-year low. Inflation is running above the Fed's 2 percent target. Gross domestic product growth could hit 3 percent this year, which would be the best rate in more than a decade, and growth for the second quarter is estimated to be as high as 5 percent when the numbers are released on Friday morning.
If the Fed raises rates too quickly, it risks slowing growth at a time when wages have stagnated for most American workers, after accounting for inflation. But if it raises rates too slowly, some Fed officials fear the economy could "overheat" and ignite a rapid spiral of price increases that could eventually prompt a recession. Historically, presidents have preferred lower rates, because faster economic growth typically helps incumbents win re-election.
Indeed, during his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump accused the Fed of getting political, saying that the bank's chairwoman at the time, Janet L. Yellen, should be "ashamed" for keeping interest rates low -- a move he said was meant to help President Barack Obama.
The Fed is on track to raise rates twice more this year, for a total of four increases in 2018, after cutting them to near zero in the wake of the financial crisis. The chairman of the Fed, Jerome H. Powell, has continued to express confidence that the United States economy is strong enough to handle higher borrowing rates. Typically, a period of economic expansion is the exact moment when a central bank seeks to raise rates, to keep price growth in check -- and in part to maintain firepower to lower borrowing costs during the next economic downturn.
Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council, said on Thursday that Mr. Trump's comments were not unusual in historical context.
"Lots of people talk about the Fed. That doesn't mean they're jawboning them," Mr. Kudlow said, adding that the president was not "in any way, shape or form trying to influence the Fed or undermine its independence."
Former White House officials said Mr. Trump's words could backfire by building pressure on Fed officials to demonstrate political independence.
"Likely result of Presidential intervention is higher rates as Fed needs to assert its independence," Lawrence H. Summers, a top economic official in the Obama and Clinton administrations, said Thursday on Twitter. "That is part of the reason why wise Presidents respect Fed independence."
It is not the first time that Mr. Trump and members of his administration have broken economic policy protocols. The president tweeted about the monthly jobs report shortly before its release on June 1, hinting that it would be strong. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, moved currency markets in January when he said a weak dollar could help the United States in trade.
In his interview with CNBC, Mr. Trump said that rising rates were putting the United States at a disadvantage with its trading partners, including Japan and the European Union, which have kept their own interest rates near zero as the Fed has increased rates. The rate hikes have contributed to a strengthening of the dollar in recent months, which allows Americans to more easily buy imported goods and services. That can widen the trade deficit, a metric that Mr. Trump believes indicates weakness in the American economy.
Mr. Trump also seemed to suggest he would not try to meddle in the Fed's affairs, saying "I'm letting them do what they feel is best." He also called Mr. Powell, whom he nominated as Fed chairman last year, "a very good man."
Mr. Trump said that he understood he was breaking with that protocol, but that he did not care.
"Now I'm just saying the same thing that I would have said as a private citizen," he said. "So somebody would say, 'Oh, maybe you shouldn't say that as president.' I couldn't care less what they say, because my views haven't changed."
Presidents have no direct authority over interest rate decisions, only the power to appoint some of the Fed members that set those rates.
While there have been some instances in the past of presidents weighing in on monetary policy, those have been rare. Independence from presidential criticism has long been a hallmark of the Fed's existence, and a contributor to its ability to maintain monetary policy that aims to keep inflation stable and the economy running at maximum employment.
A Fed spokesman declined to comment on Thursday. The two most recent past leaders of the Fed, Ms. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke, also declined to comment.
Mr. Powell has said repeatedly that the president has not attempted to interfere with the Fed's policy decisions and would have no success if he tried.
"Let me just say I'm not concerned about it," Mr. Powell told the Marketplace radio program in an interview last week. "We have a long tradition here of conducting policy in a particular way, and that way is independent of all political concerns."
Asked about possible White House displeasure over rate increases at his inaugural news conference in March, Mr. Powell responded: "No. That doesn't keep me awake at night. We don't consider the election cycle."
Mr. Trump has nominated five members to the Fed board, including Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist who is awaiting confirmation by the Senate on his appointment as vice chairman, and Michelle W. Bowman, the Kansas banking commissioner, who has been nominated for a seat reserved for community bankers. Both pledged to carry out their jobs free of political interference during their confirmation hearings, and Mr. Clarida said that the president had "absolutely not" indicated a preference for how he should vote on interest rate decisions.
But one of the candidates Mr. Trump considered for chairman, the former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, said on a Politico podcast this year that during an interview for the position, the president had made his opinions on interest rate policy clear.
"If you think it was a subject upon which he delicately danced around, then you'd be mistaken. It was certainly top of mind to the president," Mr. Warsh said. Later, he added: "In some sense the broader notion of an independent agency, that's probably not an obvious feature to the president."
Mr. Warsh said on Thursday that he was too busy to discuss Mr. Trump's CNBC comments.
The most recent presidents to openly pressure a Fed chairman to keep interest rates low, to lift growth, were George Bush and Richard M. Nixon.
"I respect his independence," Mr. Nixon said of the chairman at the time, Arthur F. Burns, at his swearing-in at the White House in 1970. "However I hope that independently he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed." Mr. Nixon continued, "That's a vote of confidence for lower interest rates and more money."
His aides would later seek to undermine Mr. Burns, including by spreading a story that he had sought a big pay increase at a time he was urging lower pay hikes. Mr. Burns later wrote in his diary of Mr. Nixon, "I knew that I would be accepted in the future only if I suppressed my will and yielded completely -- even though it was wrong at law and morally -- to his authority."
In the administrations of Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush, there were efforts to influence the Fed chairmen Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, though those tended to be more subtle.
Nicholas F. Brady, Treasury secretary to Mr. Bush, privately urged Mr. Greenspan to lower interest rates in spring and summer 1991, as Mr. Greenspan's reappointment as Fed chairman was being weighed.
However, upon being reappointed, Mr. Greenspan did not lower rates as much as the Bush administration preferred. Mr. Bush would later blame Mr. Greenspan for his election loss in 1992, which occurred in the aftermath of a recession.
"I reappointed him, and he disappointed me," Mr. Bush said in a television interview in 1998.

Full text: SEOUL, South Korea -- Asian stock markets were drifting Thursday in mixed trading as investors awaited further moves in global trade disputes.
KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.2 percent to 22,839.59, while South Korea's Kospi shed 0.2 percent to 2,285.99. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged 0.1 percent lower to 28,107.16 while the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.3 percent to 2,777.41. Australia's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.3 percent to 6,265.00.
FED TESTIMONY: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell wrapped up his semi-annual testimony to Congress about economic and monetary policy with an overall positive assessment. However, he warned that trade battles with China and higher U.S. tariffs on foreign products cause higher inflation that might require a change of strategy.
ANALYST'S TAKE: "The tone is little changed from yesterday with earnings and the Fed relief carrying markets higher and providing positive leads for us here in Asia. That said, markets lack real conviction amid the waffling sentiment," Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.
WALL STREET: U.S. stock indexes finished slightly higher Wednesday. The S&P 500 index rose 0.2 percent to 2,815.62. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 percent to 25,199.29. The Nasdaq composite finished nearly flat, losing 0.67 points to close at 7,854.44. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 0.3 percent to 1,691.87.
OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude added 12 cents to $68.88 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Wednesday, the contract rose 1 percent to finish at $68.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 6 cents to $72.84 per barrel in London. It added 1 percent to settle at $72.90 a barrel on Wednesday.
CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 112.70 yen from 112.85 yen. The euro strengthened to $1.1647 from $1.1638.

Full text: The United States labor market is closing in on full employment in an economic expansion that just began its 10th year, and yet the real hourly wage for the working class has been essentially flat for two years running. Why is that?
Economists ask this question every month when the government reports labor statistics. We repeatedly get solid job growth and lower unemployment, but not much to show for wages. Part of that has to do with inflation, productivity and remaining slack in the labor market.
But stagnant wages for factory workers and non-managers in the service sector -- together they represent 82 percent of the labor force -- is mainly the outcome of a long power struggle that workers are losing. Even at a time of low unemployment, their bargaining power is feeble, the weakest I've seen in decades. Hostile institutions -- the Trump administration, the courts, the corporate sector -- are limiting their avenues for demanding higher pay.
Looking at the historical relationship between working-class wages and unemployment, wage growth should be rising about a percentage point faster than it is right now. In June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, wages were growing at a yearly rate of 2.7 percent before inflation.
While wages have failed to accelerate, consumer prices have climbed. In 2015, inflation was close to zero. When price growth is zero, a dollar extra in your paycheck means a dollar more real purchasing power. Real hourly pay grew at a healthy pace of about 2 percent that year.
But price growth is back to more normal levels now. Over the past year, for example, consumer price inflation was 2.9 percent, just about the same rate as hourly pay. Data released on Tuesday show that real weekly earnings for full-time, middle-wage workers hasn't grown at all since early 2017.
Barring an unforeseen shock to the system, I expect the jobless rate to continue to fall, probably to rates we haven't seen since the 1960s. The Federal Reserve forecasts unemployment of 3.5 percent by the end of this year.
Unemployment at such a low level should force up wages, but it may not be enough to generate consistent, real gains.
That's because the trade war may push inflation higher, so it will take faster nominal wage growth to keep pace with prices. Thus far, the impact of the tariffs has been minimal, because of the small share of imports affected, and because "final products"-- things that consumers buy versus intermediate materials used for production -- have thus far been spared. But if President Trump follows through on his threat to place 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of imports from China, including many consumer goods, prices could get a nudge.
Even before the trade war, the Federal Reserve was well into its campaign to raise the benchmark interest rate it controls, and it has suggested it may raise rates a bit more quickly than previously planned. Higher rates are intended to cool down the hot labor market, and this too could dampen the pace of wage growth.
G.D.P. has sped up and may clock in at around 4 percent in the second quarter of this year, but not enough of that growth is reaching workers. This is, of course, the defining characteristic of high inequality. Since the early 1980s, G.D.P. growth has failed to consistently increase working-class incomes.
Still, in earlier periods, tight labor markets were able to deal a blow to inequality. The last time unemployment was at 4 percent, in the latter 1990s, the share of national income going to paychecks was 3 percentage points higher than it is today. In other words, even with the economy now near full employment, profits are squeezing paychecks.
Slow productivity growth is another constraint on wages. When companies are able to produce more efficiently, they can absorb higher labor costs without sacrificing profit margins. But such gains have been elusive in this recovery, so businesses are increasing profits at labor's expense.
More than ever, the dynamics of this old-fashioned power struggle between labor and capital strongly favor corporations, employers and those whose income derives from stock portfolios rather than paychecks.
This is evident in the large, permanent corporate tax cuts versus the small, temporary middle-class cuts that were passed at the end of last year. It's evident in the recent Supreme Court case that threatens the survival of the one unionized segment of labor -- public workers -- that still has some real clout.
It's evident in the increased concentration of companies and their unchecked ability to collude against workers, through anti-poaching and mandatory arbitration agreements that preclude worker-based class actions. And it's evident in a federal government that refuses to consider improved labor standards like higher minimum wages and updated overtime rules.
Even if workers' real wages do pick up, their gains may be too short-lived to make a lasting difference. The next recession is lurking out there, and when it hits, whatever gains American workers were able to wring out of the economic expansion will be lost to the long-term weakness of their bargaining clout. Workers' paychecks reflect workers' power, and they are both much too weak.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the economy is humming and the financial system is safe, but cautioned that trade policy has cast an uncertain shadow over the United States.
In the first of two days of semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Powell fielded repeated questions from lawmakers about why inflation-adjusted wages continue to grow slowly despite a tight labor market. Mr. Powell acknowledged the disparity between low unemployment and weak wage gains but offered no quick fix, telling the Banking Committee that while wage growth has increased slightly over the past few years, it continues to lag the gains Americans enjoyed in the years before the financial crisis.
Pressed repeatedly by Democrats about what the Fed could do to accelerate wage growth, Mr. Powell said a strong economy and low unemployment would ultimately lift wages. He said a range of factors outside the Fed's control have contributed to middle-class wage stagnation over the past three decades, including a slowdown in advancements in educational attainment in the American work force.
He offered a mixed assessment of whether the new tax law has stimulated the American economy, agreeing with a Republican senator's assessment that the mere anticipation of tax cuts increased growth last year but telling a Democratic senator that it was too soon to say if the law had begun to lift wages.
"I think it would be early to look for a bill that was signed into law less than a year ago to be affecting much of anything," Mr. Powell said.
At a time when inflation has finally begun to rise -- and by some measures, to run above the Fed's 2 percent target -- Mr. Powell faced almost no questioning or criticism about price increases, and no pushback on the central bank's plans to continue raising interest rates gradually. He offered no hint that the Fed was rethinking plans to return rates to historically normal levels, keeping with the Monetary Policy Report that Fed officials sent to Congress last week.
He was mostly pressed on economic policy matters, particularly trade. Mr. Powell largely avoided expressing concern over the tariffs that President Trump has levied on imports from China, the European Union and other trading partners, but said that "countries that have gone in a protectionist direction have done worse" historically than countries that have opened themselves to trade.
Mr. Powell said it was possible Mr. Trump's strategy would end up liberalizing trade, by forcing other nations to reduce tariffs levied on American exports. He also said the opposite was possible, and that growth and wages could be dampened by an escalating trade war.
"We don't see it in the numbers yet," Mr. Powell said, "but we've seen a rising chorus of concern."
Several Democrats criticized Mr. Powell's approach to financial regulation, including questioning why the Fed is loosening the Volcker Rule to allow large banks to engage in more risky trading at a time of soaring profits for the financial industry. As he often does, Mr. Powell said he favored tailoring regulations to reduce their burdens on business while maintaining effectiveness. "Financial stability, I don't worry about that too much," he said.
The only sustained moments of conflict in the hearing came when Mr. Powell was questioned by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a prominent critic of Wall Street, who pressed the chairman on the results of the Fed's recent stress tests for large banks.
Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and State Street all received "conditional" approval to return money to shareholders following the tests after the Fed exams found weakness in their capital levels during a severe economic downturn. The companies were forced to freeze their payouts at last year's levels, but did not fail the tests.
"The Fed looked the other way," she said. "The Fed let these banks off with a conditional non-objection. It looks like, to me, the Fed is heading in the wrong direction here."
Mr. Powell said the Fed had not changed policy governing stress tests nor treated banks differently than it has in years past. Earlier in the hearing, he told the committee that this year's round of tests was "by a margin, the most stringent stress test we've done yet."
On policy issues, Mr. Powell urged the federal government to move away from its outsize role in supporting the housing market.
"It's really important for the longer run that we get the housing finance system off the government's balance sheet," he said. The comments caused a dip in Fannie and Freddie's stock prices.

Full text: U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as retailers, technology and household goods companies all made solid gains and helped the market shake off a weak start. Netflix slumped after investors were disappointed with the streaming video company's subscriber growth.
Stocks skidded at the start of trading as Netflix plunged early on, and investors sold some of their other recent favorites including Facebook and Apple. But those stocks later recovered and Netflix narrowed its losses. Technology companies also turned higher and strong results from Johnson & Johnson pulled health care stocks upward.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a positive view of the economy as he told Congress that he expects the Fed to keep gradually raising interest rates. Powell said the Fed believes the economy will stay strong and inflation will remain at around 2 percent for the next few years. Stocks have fallen previous times that Powell gave major addresses, but they didn't do so on Tuesday.
Investors focused on company earnings, which aside from Netflix were mostly good. Financial services company Charles Schwab and regional bank Comerica both rose.
"Double-digit earnings growth for this quarter and this full calendar year remains on track, and a 10 percent gain in earnings next year is also still doable," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for CFRA.
While investors have been buying U.S. stocks and selling foreign indexes this year, Stovall said earnings growth for companies in overseas markets will probably improve in 2019 while U.S. profit growth slows down. That could make non-U.S. markets more appealing.
The S&P 500 index rose 11.12 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,809.55 after it dropped 9 points at the start of trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 55.53 points, or 0.2 percent, to 25,119.89. The Nasdaq composite jumped 49.40 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,855.12 and surpassed the record high it set last week. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 8.72 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,687.26.
Companies that sell clothing, food and household goods made solid gains. Ralph Lauren advanced 2.6 percent to $133.30 and PepsiCo climbed 1.7 percent to $114.88. Amazon as it said sales in the first hours of its annual Prime Day promotion improved compared to last year in spite of website problems. The company said it's resolving those issues. The stock rose 1.2 percent to $1,843.93.
Netflix's weak subscriber totals sent the stock down 5.2 percent to $379.48. The company has regularly beaten its own subscriber forecasts but failed to do so in the second quarter and its third-quarter estimate was lower than analysts expected. Things looked far worse for Netflix in early trading as the stock plunged 14.1 percent before recovering most of that drop. Even with Tuesday's loss, the stock is up 98 percent this year.
Johnson & Johnson's second-quarter profit grew thanks to better results from its prescription drug business, and it posted higher sales than analysts expected. The stock gained 3.5 percent to $129.11.
Financial services company Charles Schwab climbed 3.6 percent to $52.88 after it surpassed Wall Street forecasts in the latest quarter.
UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurance company, once again beat expectations in the latest quarter and raised its annual profit forecast. But the company's spending on medical costs was higher than analysts expected, and the stock lost 2.6 percent to $250.29. Investors worried that other health insurers would have similar problems, and competitors Anthem and Humana also slipped.
Advertising companies sank after Omnicom said its business in North America decreased in the second quarter and its U.K. business also shrank. The advertising conglomerate lost 9.5 percent to $70.69 and Interpublic Group shed 6.1 percent to $22.26.
The European Union and Japan signed a broad trade deal Tuesday that will eliminate nearly all tariffs across a third of the global economy. Japanese consumers will pay lower prices for European wine and pork, while Japanese machinery parts, tea and fish will get cheaper for Europe. The deal has been in the works for years and contrasts with the more protectionist approach of U.S. President Donald Trump.
Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.86 percent.
Benchmark U.S. crude erased an early loss and finished little changed at $68.08 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 0.4 percent to $72.16 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline gained 1.2 percent to $2.03 a gallon. Heating oil added 0.8 percent to $2.07 a gallon. Natural gas fell 0.7 percent to $2.74 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Metals prices continued to fall. Gold dripped 1 percent to $1,227.30 an ounce. Silver sank 1.2 percent to $15.62 an ounce. Copper fell 0.6 percent to $2.75 a pound. All three are near their lowest prices in a year.
The dollar rose to 112.83 yen from 112.30 yen. The euro fell to $1.1664 from $1.1714.
Germany's DAX jumped 0.8 percent and the CAC 40 in France added 0.2 percent. The British FTSE 100 index rose 0.3 percent.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 percent after reopening from a public holiday. South Korea's Kospi lost 0.2 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.3 percent.

Strong earnings expected from banks this week.
Will big banks keep clocking big profits? JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo kicked off earnings season for the largest United States banks on Friday, revealing another quarter of strong growth despite a relatively small increase in lending. Bank of America reports its second-quarter results on Monday morning, followed by Goldman Sachs on Tuesday and Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Trading revenue won't be what it was during the busy beginning of 2018, but the banks are trying to make up for lackluster markets by cultivating other businesses like wealth management and consumer finance.

Netflix expected to report an expanding subscriber base.
Netflix reports its second-quarter earnings on Monday, just days after it got the big news that it led the pack in the Emmy nominations. That was a first for a streaming service, and it also snapped HBO's 17-year streak for leading all networks in Emmy nominations. With a market capitalization swelling to more than $170 billion, Netflix had said earlier this year that it expected to reach 125 million paying subscribers in the second quarter, up from its total of 118.9 million in the first quarter. As Netflix has reported in previous earnings, the bulk of any growth is expected to come from international markets.

E.U.'s treaty with Japan will counterbalance U.S. protectionism.
Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the European Union's heads of government, will visit Tokyo on Tuesday to sign an agreement with Japan to lower trade barriers. The treaty is the latest example of how the European Union is aggressively pursuing free trade agreements as a counterweight to American protectionism. Among those expected to benefit from the accord are European wine and cheese makers, whose products will no longer be subject to tariffs when entering Japan. The signing ceremony with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, had been scheduled for a week earlier in Brussels but was postponed because of catastrophic flooding in Japan.

Google faces fines from the E.U. for antitrust violations.
European authorities are expected to hit Google with a multibillion-dollar fine on Wednesday for violating antitrust laws by using its dominance in the smartphone market to box out rivals. Google has been a frequent target of European regulators, who have been more aggressive in taking on Silicon Valley giants than their counterparts in the United States. Last year, Google was fined $2.7 billion in another antitrust case, and Apple, Facebook and the chip maker Qualcomm have also been penalized by the European Commission in recent years. In the decision to be announced this week, the European competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, is expected to rule that Google unfairly required handset makers using its Android smartphone operating system to prioritize Google services like search over its rivals' offerings.

Trump administration will hold hearings on proposed auto tariffs.
The Commerce Department will hold a hearing on Thursday in its ongoing investigation into whether imports of automobiles and auto parts compromise American national security, an inquiry that could ultimately result in sweeping tariffs on roughly $350 billion of imported products. The hearing will include testimony from dozens of domestic and international companies, industry groups and officials from other countries and the Department of Defense, which the Commerce Department said it would weigh before making a recommendation on possible tariffs. President Trump has threatened to place a 20 percent tariff on foreign automobiles, a measure that would fall heaviest on American allies. In 2017, 98 percent of passenger vehicles imported into the United States came from Mexico, Canada, the European Union, Japan or South Korea.

Microsoft to report results of cloud computing shift.
Microsoft is an older tech company that looks surprisingly youthful these days. The software maker has successfully navigated the shift to selling its products as an internet service, so-called cloud computing. When the company reports its quarterly results on Thursday, analysts will be focusing on the growth trends in two businesses. The first is Azure, Microsoft's service for cloud-based computer processing and storage, a market where the company is a strong No. 2, behind Amazon. The other is Office 365, the cloud version of the company's popular office productivity apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

Full text: With rumblings about trade wars, post-Brexit predictions of the demise of the European Union and worries over North Korean nuclear missiles, lately the world beyond the United States has hardly seemed a promising place to invest.
Yet some investors toted up solid returns in the second quarter -- as well as over the last five years -- by prospecting, at least partly, abroad. Here are three mutual funds that managed that feat.
Matthews China Small Companies Fund
The name of Tiffany Hsiao's fund -- Matthews China Small Companies -- makes plain where she puts her shareholders' money. China, of course, is one of the countries on which President Trump has focused much of his anti-trade ire. As a result, the United States and China have been tit-for-tatting each other with tariffs.
Ms. Hsiao, who has been lead manager of the fund since 2015, said the sorts of stocks she seeks are insulated from spats over international commerce. "Small-cap companies are more domestically focused," she said. "They're not typically exporters. In the United States, you see the same thing."
She prefers the stocks of outfits that are helping Chinese companies and consumers increase their productivity. "The root of economic sustainability is that you have to grow productivity," Ms. Hsiao said. "That's why we're interested in software, automation and health care."
Her fund's biggest recent holding, Silergy, is a bet on the development of China's semiconductor industry. Silergy designs analog semiconductors, which are used in a wide variety of electronics.
"Semiconductors are China's largest import, even more than oil," Ms. Hsiao said. "So we've been heavily invested in semiconductor makers and designers and toolmakers for those companies."
Ms. Hsiao also buys companies, like GenScript Biotech, offering Chinese patients the latest medical advances. GenScript performs gene synthesis and biotech research for drug makers as well as developing its own treatments, including one for multiple myeloma, a blood cancer.
"Cancer treatment is the biggest unmet need in Chinese health care," she said. "In the U.S., if you get cancer, you're likely to get an innovative biotech drug about 80 percent of time. In China, 65 percent of treatment is still chemotherapy."
A challenge for an investor in emerging-market small caps is a dearth of the corporate disclosures and market regulation that developed-world investors take for granted. Ms. Hsiao said she compensated by sleuthing.
"I'll interview ex-bosses and ex-co-workers," she said. "When I visit a factory, I always ask to see the defects. How do they define a defect? If a little scratch qualifies as a defect, then I don't think you're going to cheat me on the numbers."
Ms. Hsiao's fund, which has a net expense ratio of 1.5 percent, returned 2.37 percent in the second quarter, compared with 2.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. For the five years that ended June 30, it returned an annualized average of 14.78 percent.
T. Rowe Price Global Stock Fund
David J. Eiswert, portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price Global Stock Fund, enjoys a broader remit than Ms. Hsiao: He's free to survey the world in search of promising bets. His fund has lately invested about two-thirds of its assets in the United States.
"We're usually overweight the U.S. because that's where the best intellectual property is," Mr. Eiswert said. "But after the Trump victory, we went underweight because stocks went up so much, and emerging markets were in crisis."
Mr. Eiswert called himself a "careful contrarian" about emerging markets and said he waited for crises to buy companies he liked.
The fund's largest emerging-market bet -- the Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant -- is also its largest holding. (Alibaba is based in China but has American depositary receipts that trade in the United States.)
"Facebook, Amazon, Google -- there are elements of natural monopoly in those businesses," Mr. Eiswert said. "In China, it's similar with Alibaba. And monopolies are good ways to make money." Amazon, Facebook and Google's holding company, Alphabet, are also top holdings.
The fund has a heavy slug of technology stocks -- about a third of its assets, compared with only a fifth for the typical world stock fund tracked by Morningstar. That allocation may reflect Mr. Eiswert's background: He spent about a decade as a tech analyst and tech fund manager for T. Rowe Price before taking his current post in 2012.
One of the fund's broad themes is rooted in his thinking about a technology trend he calls "deflationary progress."
"It's one of the reasons we don't have a lot of inflation right now," despite steady economic growth and low unemployment in the United States, he said. With video and audio streaming, companies like Netflix and Spotify can offer far cheaper alternatives than the cable TV and purchased music they're replacing.
"The average American pays something like $125 month for cable," Mr. Eiswert said. "Netflix is $12 a month." That price difference has helped to spur the growth of Netflix, which is one of the fund's holdings.
Mr. Eiswert's fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.84 percent, returned 3.06 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 16.48 percent over the last five years.
DFA Global Real Estate Securities Portfolio
The DFA Global Real Estate Securities Portfolio also invests at home and abroad; its assets are allocated about two-thirds to the United States and one-third elsewhere, with Japan and Australia topping the foreign list.
It buys mainly real estate investment trusts but can also hold stakes in two of its sibling funds -- DFA Real Estate Securities Portfolio and DFA International Real Estate Securities Portfolio.
"We're in 22 countries around the world, both developed and emerging," said Joseph H. Chi, a fund manager and one of the leaders of portfolio management for Dimensional Fund Advisors, the fund's parent.
The fund aims to give investors broad-based exposure to real estate. Dimensional doesn't make many real estate investments in its other stock mutual funds because many clients already have some exposure through vacation homes and rental properties, Mr. Chi said. Its separate real estate funds let them fine-tune their overall asset allocations.
Mr. Chi said this fund didn't make bets on individual securities, gathering up promising ones and avoiding potential laggards, but rather held a broadly diversified basket of real estate investment trusts -- nearly 450 in all. The holdings are generally weighted by market capitalization -- the larger a REIT's market cap, the larger its place in the fund.
Though the fund is actively managed, it focuses on minimizing costs and generally keeps turnover very low, recently about 2 percent.
"Turnover is expensive, so we're very cost sensitive about how we trade," Mr. Chi said.
The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.24 percent, returned 5.36 percent in the second quarter and an annualized average of 7.43 percent over the last five years.

Full text: People often notice big, sudden price changes -- like, say, when an avocado shortage sends the cost spiraling up at their local grocery. It can be harder to keep track of what happens to the cost of an essential product or service over the course of years.
There has been an intense public debate about energy prices, in particular, and whether efforts to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases would send the cost of electricity soaring. It's time to check in on what has happened -- whether those costs have changed in the way critics of or advocates for clean energy predicted.

Full text: Summer is perennially peak season in air travel and this summer appears to be an especially good time to fly as airline competition, the increased deployment of fuel-efficient planes, and expanding route maps offer travelers more choices and often bargain fares.
The number of fliers is expected to rise 3.7 percent this summer over last, with a record 246.1 million passengers traveling domestically on United States airlines between June 1 and Aug. 31, according to Airlines for America, the industry trade organization representing most of the major American airlines.
Added capacity has helped keep prices down, even as demand is rising, according to research by the airfare prediction app Hopper. It estimates that prices will be down this summer 6.7 percent compared to last summer, forecasting average domestic fares to drop to $211 in July and August from $240 in June.
"Every summer, there's a big spike in the number of people traveling, but the last few years we've had low oil prices which has caused airlines to increase capacity," said Patrick Surry, the chief data scientist for Hopper. "That could be coming to an end with rising oil prices. This summer may be your last chance to get a cheap deal, particularly if you're flying internationally."
Since the industry was deregulated in 1979, increased competition and airline consolidation caused airfares, when adjusted for inflation, to drop 40 percent, according to the Eno Center for Transportation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank devoted to transportation issues. In 2016, it found the average domestic round-trip ticket in the United States cost $367 versus $187 in 1979.
"Airlines became very efficient at trying to get as many paying passengers onboard per flight," said Paul Lewis, the vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center. "Seats got closer, load factors got higher and while we don't tend to like cramming into an airplane, that's how we're able to enjoy relatively low fares."
Technology advancements and the surge in low-cost carriers, particularly on international routes, have made flying more convenient, if not necessarily more comfortable.
More Efficient Aircraft
Some of the new class of aircraft, particularly the wide-bodied carbon composite planes, which include the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350, are more comfortable, and not just in business class. The plastic parts mean airlines can pressurize the cabin at 6,000 feet versus 8,000 feet and commensurately increase the humidity in the aircraft.
Lighter aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines allow airlines to fly longer and farther. The Australian airline Qantas recently launched a Dreamliner on a 17-hour route between Perth in western Australia and London. In October, Singapore Airlines plans to begin flying the industry's longest route when it relaunches Newark-to-Singapore nonstop flights (a route it ceased flying in 2013) aboard the Airbus A350-900. The flight will take 18 hours and 45 minutes.
"Then they were flying quad engines and now they can do it with two," said Seth Kaplan, the managing partner at Airline Weekly, an industry publication. "Being able to cover the same distance with half as many engines with far less fuel can make it viable again."
American travelers are more likely to encounter the more common, next-generation, narrow-body planes that have more fuel-efficient engines and aerodynamic designs that allow them to fly farther and more cost effectively -- even though they are mostly made of traditional materials like aluminum. Boeing's 737 Max increased the range for a similar size plane by 19 percent to 3,850 nautical miles. Airbus says its A320neo models save up to 20 percent on fuel while cutting emissions and engine noise.
With Airbus' newer single-aisle planes, Hawaiian Airlines has expanded its Hawaii-bound service from its traditional West Coast hubs like Los Angeles to San Diego and Long Beach, Calif., this summer. Norwegian Air Shuttle is newly flying Boeing's 737 Max between New York Stewart International Airport to Dublin with one-way fares starting as low as $164 this summer.
New International Routes
The three major Persian Gulf carriers -- Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways -- have aggressively marketed to American fliers, offering relatively affordable economy fares to Asia, in particular by positioning their base airports in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, respectively, as long-distance flight hubs. Last year, I couldn't pass up a $950 flight to Sri Lanka on Qatar that required a change of planes in Abu Dhabi when the next cheapest fare, also a one-stop, was $400 more.
United States airlines have cried foul, noting that Gulf governments with deep pockets are subsidizing these money-losing routes at the expense of true competition. In May, the United Arab Emirates, which owns Emirates and Etihad, agreed to more financial transparency; Qatar agreed to the same earlier this year.
"American carriers believe they're not playing fair and over the next 12 months we'll have a better sense of how this will play out," said Mr. Lewis.
Gulf carriers aren't the only foreign airlines trying to steal traffic from popular European hubs like Amsterdam, London and Frankfurt. Turkish Airlines has positioned Istanbul as a convenient stopover for flights to Eastern Europe. It even offers free Istanbul city tours for those with long layovers.
Legacy carriers in the United States -- American, United and Delta -- have expanded their networks by partnering with foreign airlines to sync connecting flights. They are also increasing seasonal nonstop service, such as American's Chicago-to-Venice flights introduced this summer, when demand warrants.
"It's a win-win for all parties," said Rob Britton, the founder of the aviation consultancy AirLearn. "It's allowed the airlines to build networks in all directions. And it's good for the consumer because they're given enormous choice."
Bargain Flights Abroad
Budget-minded fliers have embraced low-cost flights for their rock-bottom fares, so much so that legacy carriers in the United States have created frill-free fares to compete with them. Hopper found that Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air expanded their domestic capacity by 15 percent in the last year.
International low-cost carriers, including WOW Air, Germanwings, Cebu Pacific and others, expanded their service to American markets by 52 percent in the past year, according to Hopper.
This year, Primera Air, a Latvia-based carrier that operates low-cost flights within Europe, added North American routes to Boston, Newark and Washington, D.C. Summer flights from Newark to London's Stansted Airport start at $169 one-way.
Whether low-cost carriers can make long-haul travel profitable, something that has rarely been done, remains to be seen. Norwegian Air, for example, reported substantial losses in 2017. Nevertheless, the very presence of bargain fares affects pricing across the spectrum of carriers.
"Even if you don't fly Norwegian, other airlines have to compete with them and it puts downward pressure on airfares," said Mr. Kaplan. "So, it's an interesting time for air travel."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Profits Swell, But Laborers See No Relief

Full text: Corporate profits have rarely swept up a bigger share of the nation's wealth, and workers have rarely shared a smaller one.
The lopsided split is especially pronounced given how low the official unemployment rate has sunk. Throughout the recession and much of its aftermath, when many Americans were grateful to receive a paycheck instead of a pink slip, jobs and raises were in short supply. Now, complaints of labor shortages are as common as tweets. For the first time in a long while, workers have some leverage to push for more.
Yet many are far from making up all the lost ground. Hourly earnings have moved forward at a crawl, with higher prices giving workers less buying power than they had last summer. Last-minute scheduling, no-poaching and noncompete clauses, and the use of independent contractors are popular tactics that put workers at a disadvantage. Threats to move operations overseas, where labor is cheaper, continue to loom.
And in the background, the nation's central bankers stand poised to raise interest rates and deliberately rein in growth if wages climb too rapidly.
Workers, understandably, are asking whether they are getting a raw deal.
"Sure, you can get a job slinging hamburgers somewhere or working in a warehouse," said Christina Jones, 53, of Mobile, Ala. Ms. Jones spent eight months searching for a job with living wages and benefits, after being laid off from a paper company where she had worked for nearly 13 years. Dozens of interviews later, she landed work last month at a concrete crushing company as an accounts payable clerk for $14 an hour -- two-thirds her previous salary.
"You hear, 'Oh, the unemployment rate is as low as it's ever been,"' Ms. Jones said, but "it was discouraging."
Businesses have been more successful at regaining losses from the downturn. Since the recession ended in 2009, corporate profits have grown at an annualized rate of 6.5 percent. Several sectors have done much better. On Friday, for example, banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup reported outsize double-digit earnings in the second quarter.
Yearly wage growth has yet to hit 3 percent. And when it does, the Federal Reserve -- which has a mandate to keep inflation under control even as it is supposed to maximize employment -- can be expected to tap the brakes.
As Fed policymakers have explained, allowing the economy to run too hot "could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn." And persistent wage increases, unlike growing profit margins, are considered a signal that the heat is on.
The bank's primary method of cooling the economy is to dampen spending and investing by raising interest rates and making it more expensive to borrow money -- an antidote that could hurt profits in some sectors as well as trim payrolls. The thinking goes like this: Better to inflict some pain now, in the form of higher joblessness and sluggish wage growth, than to allow more pain later.
After keeping benchmark interest rates at near-zero levels during the recession, the Fed has been gradually nudging them up. So far this year, it has raised rates twice.
With tariffs piling up and potentially pushing prices higher, odds are that the Fed will push through two more increases before 2018 ends. The Labor Department reported this week that one inflation measure, the Consumer Price Index, had increased 2.9 percent in 12 months -- the highest level in six years.
Discomfort with a tight labor market and growing worker bargaining power is to some degree baked into the Fed's makeup. Pressure to raise wages during expansions will inevitably be seen as precursors to insidious inflationary pressure.
The conventional wisdom that higher wages inevitably lead to higher prices, however, is flimsy, some economists argue.
"It theoretically makes sense," Michael R. Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the link between wage increases and inflation, "but empirically, it's increasingly difficult to find a real strong link."
A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, for example, concluded that "the connections among wages, prices, and economic activity are more akin to a tangled web than a straight line," and that "the ability of wages to help predict future inflation is limited."
Regardless, there is plenty of evidence that workers have yet to receive their fair share of this most recent expansion -- or even the previous one.
Since the century's start, labor's share of the nation's income has sunk to the lowest levels in decades.
In 2000, when the jobless rate last fell below 4 percent, corporations pulled in 8.3 percent of the nation's total income in the form of profits; wages and salaries across the entire work force accounted for roughly 66 percent.
Now, the jobless rate is again fluttering below 4 percent. But corporate profits account for 13.2 percent of the nation's income. Workers' compensation has fallen to 62 percent.
If workers' share had not shrunk, they would have had an additional $532 billion, or about $3,400 each, said Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And at this point in the recovery, shifting some of those corporate profits to workers would have no effect on inflation, he noted.
In the tug of war between workers and investors, Americans living on a paycheck have seldom been left with a shorter end of the rope.
Fredy Amador has spent years working for various temporary help agencies, packing boxes of baby clothes, quality-checking packages of popcorn and doing other work at warehouses across the Chicago area. Despite what he says are frequent promises of permanent work, he has never been able to escape temp status.
Recently, his situation got worse. He used to receive holidays and paid vacations, he said, but the agency that offered them lost its contract to another firm that did not. "They want to avoid all the benefits," said Mr. Amador.
Mr. Amador, 34, said he earns $12 an hour, far less than the $20 an hour or more earned by permanent employees doing similar work. For extra money, he drives for the ride-hailing service Lyft on the weekends. "Even if you have really good skills, you have to start as a temp," said Mr. Amador, who moved to the United States from Honduras 12 years ago. "They never give you an opportunity to move on."
Economists have offered various explanations for why workers are not doing better: the steady weakening of labor unions, the ability of American companies to find cheaper labor abroad or automate further, piddling productivity growth and the rise of superstar companies that are extremely efficient with a relatively small labor force.
The recent tax overhaul has further pumped up corporate earnings. Promises that lower tax bills for businesses would translate into higher wages have yet to materialize. Higher gas and medical care costs have eaten away at whatever gains most workers have made.
Nor are those extra profits going into business expansion. Since the first of the year, American companies including Apple, Wells Fargo and McDonald's have announced nearly $680 billion in buybacks of their own stock, according to the research firm TrimTabs. In essence, they are directing a majority of the windfall to investors and chief executives, who tend to have large stock-based compensation packages.
Profits are also financing foreign mergers and acquisitions. "A lot of U.S. businesses are looking abroad to see what they can buy," said Jason Gerlis, managing director of TMF Group U.S.A., a global consulting firm, "because it's easier to finance or capitalize offshore."
The reason is a change in the tax law that limited interest deductibility on domestic investments, but not on those abroad. International deals in the first half of 2018 nearly doubled compared with the same period last year.
The United States may be leading other big industrialized countries in economic growth, but its labor force does not fare well in comparison. American workers' share of their country's total output fell much sharper and faster than the average reported by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The United States also had a larger proportion of low-wage workers than nearly every other member.
When the economy was struggling, employers became accustomed to inboxes flooded with résumés and snaking lines of eager applicants. Many may have forgotten, or never learned how, to compete for workers.
When it comes to complaints of a labor shortage, as Neel Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, has said: "If you're not raising wages, then it just sounds like whining."

Full text: It's a sign of the times: A new game show, "Paid Off," debuted on Tuesday offering winners not dream vacations or new cars, but a pile of cash to help lessen the crushing weight of their student debt.
The reach of America's student loan problem -- total debt is now about $1.4 trillion -- is vast. Millions of people are in default, and many young people are graduating into adulthood facing payments that limit their ability to buy homes and to start families of their own. Some employers have even begun dangling student loan repayment benefits as a perk to potential workers.
A new analysis of federal loan data indicates that the average student's debt load is plateauing, and perhaps even declining slightly, at least when adjusted for inflation.
That should be welcome news, except that it comes with a major asterisk: College has not become more affordable, but more students seeking bachelor's degrees, especially at higher-cost colleges, have borrowed as much as they can under the federal loan program.
As a result, the analysis suggests, many parents are going deeper into debt to pay for their children's education.
[Try our student loan calculator for a guide to the borrowing picture at various institutions, and what it takes to repay the loans after graduation.]
For students receiving bachelor's degrees, the average debt load at graduation was $30,301 in 2015-16, about the same as estimates for the previous three years, according to the analysis, which is based on data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. The federal Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics conducts the study every four years.
Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher and vice president of research at SavingForCollege.com, ran the numbers. He believes the explanation for the flattening is that many students simply cannot borrow any more money through the federal loan program.
More than 40 percent of students in the 2015-16 school year reached the limit of $31,000 for dependent students, up from 39 percent in 2011-12.
But some students -- those whose parents cannot get federal parental loans, called PLUS loans -- have a higher cap on how much they can borrow. (They can borrow up to $57,500, the same limit used for independent students.)
The percentage of all students taking advantage of the higher maximum loan amounts rose to 7.4 percent of those receiving bachelor's degrees in 2015-16, up from 5.8 percent in 2011-12 and 3.3 percent in 2007-08, according to Mr. Kantrowitz's analysis.
In that time, parents' average debt load at graduation for federal PLUS loans rose 14 percent, or $4,090, to $33,291 in 2015-16 from 2011-12.
"Parents are a pressure-relief valve for when students hit the Stafford loan limits," Mr. Kantrowitz said, referring to the federal loan program.
Among PLUS loan borrowers in 2015-16, roughly two-thirds were taking loans on behalf of students pursuing bachelor's degrees who had reached their loan limit in their senior year, Mr. Kantrowitz said.
In a further wrinkle, although parental debt loads have risen significantly, the number of parents taking out federal PLUS loans declined by about 10 percent from 2011-12 to 2015-16.
"It may be that we are in an economic recovery and as the stock market improves, fewer parents are borrowing and don't need to borrow," Mr. Kantrowitz said. "But those who borrow need to borrow more because the cost of college continues to rise," he said, adding they were also picking up the slack for children who were unable to take out more federal loans.
The data also shows more students opting for lower-cost public colleges. That seems like a practical move. But, Mr. Kantrowitz said, it suggests that families are feeling financially squeezed.
"Parents are realizing they just can't afford that more expensive college," he said. "The shift from private to public is of concern mainly because it is a sign of financial pressure, a kind of canary in the coal mine."
More problematic is separate data that shows low- and middle-income students enrolling in associate degree and certificate programs instead of bachelor's degree programs. That, Mr. Kantrowitz said, is "of greater concern because students who could benefit from a bachelor's degree are scaling back their educational attainment for no reason other than college affordability."
Chart A Shifting Burden: The average student's debt load is leveling off, a new analysis of federal loan data show. That's not true for many parents.; Spreading the Financial Pain: The overall percentage of parents borrowing alongside their children has dropped slightly, but those who are borrowing are taking on significantly more debt.; Sign of a Widening Gap: The data also indicates that more students are choosing public colleges over private ones simply for financial reasons.

Fed Shrugs at Trade Woes In Congressional Report, Offering Upbeat Outlook

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials presented a rosy economic report card to Congress on Friday, playing down risks to growth from trade tensions and declaring that the financial system is "substantially more resilient than during the decade before the financial crisis."
The Fed released its semiannual Monetary Policy Report just ahead of scheduled testimony before the House and Senate next week by Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman.
The Fed's report suggests officials are likely to stay on their telegraphed path of gradually raising interest rates to bring them back to historically normal levels. Officials raised rates at their June meeting, to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent, and signaled that they could raise rates twice more for a total of four rate increases this year.
At times, the report reads like a bit of self-congratulation among Fed officials for their performance in recent years, including steering inflation close to the Fed's 2 percent annual target, supporting strong economic growth and a low unemployment rate, and pushing Wall Street firms to strengthen their defenses against a potential financial shock.
It drops language from previous reports that stressed worry that inflation would continue to run below the target. It also reaffirms that economic activity "increased at a solid pace" for the first half of the year and that "the labor market has continued to strengthen."
The report highlights some lingering concerns in the economy, most notably slow wage growth. Adjusted for inflation, earnings for most American workers have not risen in the past year. Other measures, which include employer-provided benefits such as health care, have increased after inflation is factored in, but not by as much as could be expected when the unemployment rate is about 4 percent.
Officials blamed that sluggishness on persistent weakness in labor productivity.
"Those moderate rates of compensation gains likely reflect the offsetting influences of a strong labor market and persistently weak productivity growth," officials wrote.
The economic development that has most concerned stock markets and economists in recent months -- the Trump administration's escalating trade war with China and allies like Canada, Mexico and the European Union -- barely registers in the report as a threat to the recovery.
While noting that trade concerns have rattled stock traders, bond buyers and currency markets, officials said they were confident that the Fed's current policy path was the right one to handle those concerns.
"Many participants continued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases," officials wrote. "This view was predicated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path of policy firming likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with, among other considerations, the possibilities that U.S. fiscal policy could have larger or more persistent positive effects on real activity and that shifts in trade policy or developments abroad could weigh on the expansion."
The report includes several observations about the evolving structure of the United States economy that carry implications for policymakers, particularly members of Congress and the administration as they seek to get able-bodied individuals back to work. The Fed attributes a decline in work force participation among less-educated Americans in part to technological advancements that have automated jobs.
And it says a decline in participation among women, as compared with other industrial nations, is being driven by family policies in the workplace that do not support working parents.
"Caregiving responsibilities play an important role" in explaining why prime-age women participate less in the work force than men, the report says. "This decision may reflect a lack of affordable child care."
The report notes that rising oil prices have cost American families, on average, $300 a year more in gasoline. But it makes the case that oil price increases are far less damaging to the economy over all than they used to be, because of a surge in domestic oil production over the last decade.
That surge means that more of the money Americans spend on gasoline now stays in the country, the report says: "On net, the drag on G.D.P. from higher oil prices is likely a small fraction of what it was a decade ago and should get smaller still if U.S. oil production continues to grow as expected."

Mnuchin, Facing Bipartisan Ire, Says China Talks Have 'Broken Down'

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The trade war between the United States and China showed no signs of yielding on Thursday, as Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, told lawmakers there was no clear path to resolution and Beijing blasted the administration over its approach.
Mr. Mnuchin, who has tried to avoid calling the trade tensions with China a "war," said talks with Beijing had "broken down" and suggested it was now up to China to come to the table with concessions. President Trump, speaking in Brussels on Thursday, described the trade talks with China as a "nasty" battle.
The Chinese, meanwhile, accused the United States of "acting erratically" and said the administration had "blatantly abandoned the consensuses that two sides have reached and insisted on fighting a trade war with China."
Republicans and Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee showed little patience for Mr. Mnuchin's answers about the lack of progress, repeatedly pressing him about whether there was a strategy to resolve the trade war and expressing concern that it was starting to hurt parts of the economy.
The White House has already hit Beijing with tariffs on $34 billion worth of imports and China has responded with a similar amount of levies on American goods, including soybeans, pork and cars. On Tuesday, the administration outlined tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese products, including many consumer products like furniture, dog leashes and fish.
"Is there a master plan?" asked Representative Mia Love, Republican of Utah. "I implore you to work to end this thing soon."
Lawmakers from both parties have been bombarded with complaints about tariffs from soybean farmers, carmakers, nail manufacturers and other businesses about the fate of their industries as they are starting to face higher steel and aluminum costs and feel the pain of retaliation from Europe and China.
On Thursday they pressed Mr. Mnuchin, who is seen as a voice of moderation on trade in the administration, to persuade Mr. Trump to back away from the trade war.
Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the committee, told Mr. Mnuchin that he was deeply concerned about the state of global trade and signs that business optimism was starting to wane. He said that he was not impressed with the lone trade deal that Mr. Trump has struck, with South Korea, and warned that the strong run of economic growth was at risk.
"I would just assure you we very much are monitoring the impact on the economy of all these trade issues," Mr. Mnuchin said in response to questions about the economic effect.
Mr. Mnuchin defended the administration's approach and insisted that economic growth remained Mr. Trump's priority, which did nothing to mollify Mr. Hensarling, a close ally of the president.
"I appreciate the words; I am concerned about the deeds," he said.
Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also repeatedly -- and exasperatedly -- pushed another Trump administration official to detail a strategy for prevailing in the trade dispute during a hearing on Thursday morning.
"The administration needs to explain to Congress where this is all headed," Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and the committee's chairman, told Manisha Singh, an assistant secretary at the State Department, as she prepared to testify.
"To my knowledge, not a single person is able to articulate where this is headed, nor what the plans are, nor what the strategy is," Mr. Corker said.
The committee's top Democrat, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, told Ms. Singh at another point that "I don't understand what the pathway is here, at the end of the day."
Ms. Singh, who leads the department's Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, defended the administration's moves. "Our endgame is for China to change its behavior," she said.
After Ms. Singh tried to explain the administration's approach, Mr. Corker replied, "That enlightened us in no way."
While Mr. Trump prizes unpredictability, his approach to trade agreements is sowing uncertainty that many business leaders, officials, lawmakers and others worry could undercut an otherwise booming economy.
In an interview with the radio program "Marketplace" on Thursday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said that "we don't know" how the trade dispute will play out, but that it could harm the recovery.
"I wouldn't want to, you know, dive into a bunch of hypotheticals here," Mr. Powell said, "but I would say, you can imagine situations which would be very challenging, where inflation is going up and the economy is weakening."
The Trump administration has asked China to make a wide array of changes, including reducing its trade surplus with the United States, stopping what it described as theft of American intellectual property and opening Chinese markets to American business.
But by giving the Chinese a long list of demands, that has encouraged Beijing to focus on those that are easiest to fulfill, said Jeremie Waterman, president of the China Center at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
"The administration, to a degree, has given the Chinese an off ramp," he said. "Giving the Chinese a choice is not an optimal negotiating approach."
China has also had difficulty figuring out whom to negotiate with, after tentative agreements reached with Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, fell through.
"I think they're coming to the conclusion that it doesn't matter whether Mnuchin or Ross or anybody is in the front of the line, that it's really going to be figuring out what Trump wants," said Claire Reade, senior counsel at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer.
In a sign of the impasse that the dialogue between China and the United States has reached, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a statement on Thursday arguing that it has been unfairly vilified with false claims about its trade practices.
"This is a distortion of facts, therefore groundless," the ministry said. "For the purpose of meeting domestic political needs and suppressing China's development, the U.S. has fabricated a set of policy arguments that distort the truth about Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations."
Mr. Mnuchin said on Thursday that Mr. Trump would not do anything to jeopardize economic growth. He insisted that he was going to help work with companies to get exemptions from tariffs and that he would try to persuade businesses such as Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle maker, not to move manufacturing abroad to mitigate the pain of retaliatory tariffs.
While Mr. Mnuchin was successful in staving off draconian new Chinese investment restrictions, the tariffs have kept coming and it remains unclear how much influence he really has with Mr. Trump. Despite his private reservations, Mr. Mnuchin continues to defend the administration's trade policies.
"I can assure you that the president listens to my advice," Mr. Mnuchin said in response to a question from Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York. "He is the president. Sometimes he follows my advice, and sometimes he doesn't, which I respect."
Unimpressed, Mr. Meeks mocked Mr. Trump for describing himself for the second time on Thursday as a "very stable genius" and asked the Treasury secretary if he saw himself the same way.
"I am stable," Mr. Mnuchin said with a chuckle.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The administration's trade fight with China may soon be fought in the aisles of Walmart, Best Buy, REI and Costco.
President Trump's latest round of proposed tariffs on Chinese goods would finally pull American consumers into an escalating trade war that they have, thus far, mostly watched from a distance.
Administration officials took pains in their first batch of Chinese tariffs to largely shield consumers from seeing immediate price increases on products they buy. The $34 billion round imposed on July 6 focused largely on goods that businesses purchase, which do not typically appear on store shelves, such as aircraft parts and industrial machinery.
But the list of $200 billion worth of products administration officials proposed hitting with tariffs on Tuesday would push up prices at many American retailers. The tariffs would be lower than the previous round -- 10 percent instead of 25 percent -- and they still mostly avoid apparel, one of the most visible product lines that Americans buy heavily from China. But they include electronics, food, tools, housewares and a wide range of other consumer goods. The tariffs would not go into effect for several months and may not happen at all if the United States and China are able to resolve their differences.
Economists say that expansion will drive inflation higher and erode Americans' purchasing power, potentially hurting economic growth. Inflation is already rising, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, driven largely by energy prices. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent in June from a year ago, its highest rate of the last six years.
The rate is lower -- 2.3 percent -- for core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices. Home furnishing prices have barely risen at all over the last year, and prices for information technology hardware and services have fallen by 2.3 percent in that time.
But retail groups say a prolonged trade war could accelerate price increases on a wide range of consumer goods, giving Americans sticker shock on some of their favorite items.
"You keep adding tariffs upon tariffs," said Alex Boian, vice president for government affairs at the Outdoor Industry Association, whose members include such recreation titans as North Face and Patagonia, "and it really is difficult to see a way that this does not hit retail prices."
The latest tariff list includes several mainstay products of the outdoor industry, such as travel bags, backpacks and the knit fabric used in fleece vests. It also includes dog collars, sledgehammers, saw blades, baseball mitts, ski gloves, toilet paper, art supplies, ceramic tiles, windshield glass and antiques that are more than 100 years old.
There are also seemingly random -- and likely not household -- products on the list, like bovine semen and horsehair.
More than 1,000 of the 6,000 items on the list are chemicals, according to an analysis by Panjiva. Nearly 1,000 more are food products, including vegetables like cabbage, kale, carrots and beets and hundreds of types of fish. Many of those fish, such as Alaskan pollock, are caught elsewhere and processed in China.
In dollar terms, the items most likely to rattle American consumers are computers and couches. The Panjiva analysis shows that $50 billion worth of goods subject to tariffs are electronics, including $17.4 billion in PC components and $5.2 billion in desktop computers. Nearly $30 billion worth of the products are furniture. In addition, the administration will soon begin imposing 25 percent tariffs on more than $3 billion worth of semiconductors, potentially driving up computer prices even more.
Buying a new PC or sofa is a major purchase for most Americans, and a 10 percent tariff could force many consumers to seek out cheaper brands or delay the purchase. It seems unlikely that stores will absorb the import taxes by accepting lower profit margins. But American consumers might not have much choice but to pay them: For nearly $100 billion of the products targeted, Panjiva estimates, China supplies more than half of the imports that Americans buy.
As the tariffs expand to cover roughly half of all Chinese goods exported to the United States, consumers will start seeing price increases on store shelves, said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"It is possible that they can scoot around some of the effect on consumers, but it gets increasingly difficult," she said. "It also gets further and further away from the stated rationale of the tariffs, which is to hit high-tech products."
The National Retail Federation said in a statement on Tuesday that the threat posed by tariffs to the American economy "is less about a question of 'if' and more about 'when' and 'how bad."'
The trade group said that the sheer scope of the tariffs "make it inconceivable that American consumers will dodge this tax increase as prices of everyday products will be forced to rise."
Anyone who has tried to buy a washing machine this year knows how fast tariffs can translate to price hikes. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on imported washing machines, of up to 50 percent, in January. Since then, laundry equipment prices have jumped 17 percent, according to Labor Department data.
Economists warn that a batch of similar price spikes could complicate the Federal Reserve's efforts to maintain a gradual pace of interest rate increases, by juicing inflation more than economists had expected. Rising prices would cut into Americans' purchasing power, which has remained an engine of growth in the recovery from the great recession.
"Tariffs are just a real income hit to consumers," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics. "There's no question that these tariffs will dampen growth."

Full text: Global stock indexes sank Wednesday after the Trump administration released a list of $200 billion in goods that could be hit with tariffs and China said it would retaliate. The dollar spiked and big exporters plunged.
Companies that sell computer chips, oil, basic materials and heavy machinery dropped after the Trump administration proposed a 10 percent tax on a wide list of imports. It is scheduled to make a decision on the potential tariffs after Aug. 31.
China's government said it will take "firm and forceful measures" if the new tariffs are enacted. That response would likely include measures other than tariffs. Trump has threatened to put new taxes almost everything the U.S. imports from China.
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer for Cresset Wealth Advisors, said the tariffs can have big effects: a tariff on an import from one country can lead to broad price increases for similar items, and rising taxes and costs might can companies to change their supply lines in less efficient ways.
"When you start adding all of that together, you end up with typically higher inflation and low productivity," he said. "Higher inflation tends to rob consumers of their income and lower productivity tends to rob companies of their profits."
A four-day winning streak for the S&P 500 ended as the benchmark index lost 19.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,774.02. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 219.21 points, or 0.9 percent, to 24,700.75. The Nasdaq composite fell 42.59 points, or 0.5 percent, to 7,716.61. The Russell 2000, an index of smaller and more U.S.-focused companies, gave up 11.96 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,683.66.
The S&P 500 had closed at a five-month high Tuesday.
The new list of tariff targets from the U.S. Trade Representative includes vacuum cleaners, furniture and car and bicycle parts, but U.S.-branded smartphones and laptops were excluded. Still, chipmakers, which make large portions of their sales in China, slumped. Nvidia fell 2.3 percent to $247.53 and Micron Technology lost 2.8 percent to $54.18.
Construction equipment maker Caterpillar lost 3.2 percent to $136.76 and farm equipment maker Deere lost 2.2 percent to $141.42.
The ICE U.S. dollar index jumped 0.6 percent, a large move. The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese currency, increasing to 112.04 yen from 111.28 yen. The euro fell to $1.1674 from $1.1745.
The stronger dollar hurts exporters because it makes U.S. goods and commodities more expensive in other markets. Crude oil prices tumbled partly because of the rising dollar and partly because Libya said it will start exporting oil again, a move that will increase supplies.
Benchmark U.S. crude fell 5 percent to $70.38 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, plunged 6.9 percent to $73.40 a barrel in London.
On Friday the U.S. and China put 25 percent taxes on $34 billion in imports. China imported only $130 billion in goods from the U.S. last year, but it could retaliate against the U.S. through other means including regulatory moves and investigations of U.S. companies.
The trade dispute stems from Washington's complaint that Beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology and its concerns that plans for state-led development of Chinese companies in robotics and other fields might erode American industrial leadership.
Indexes in Europe and Asia took steeper losses as investors worried the worsening trade dispute will hamper the growth of the global economy. France's CAC 40 and the DAX in Germany both lost 1.5 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 index dropped 1.3 percent.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 percent and the South Korean Kospi lost 0.6 percent while Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.3 percent.
Airlines took sharp losses after American said it expects slower fare growth in the U.S. American Airlines slumped 8.1 percent to $35.96 and United Continental slid 3.4 percent to $68.88.
Twenty-First Century Fox raised its offer for European pay TV service Sky. Fox already owns 39 percent of Sky and wants to buy the rest, but rival Comcast has stepped in with its own bid. Fox says the new offer values Sky at $32.5 billion.
Fox lost 4 percent to $47.79. In the U.K., Sky stock fell 0.5 percent.
Bond prices moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.84 percent from 2.87 percent.
The dip in bond yields helped utility companies make small gains. Utility companies tend to pay large dividends, so investors who want income often buy them when bond yields fall.
In other commodities trading, gold lost 0.9 percent to $1,244.40 an ounce. Earlier this month gold hit its lowest price since early 2017. Silver fell 1.7 percent to $15.82 an ounce. Copper skidded 3.4 percent to $2.74 a pound.
Wholesale gasoline fell 4.6 percent to $2.06 a gallon. Heating oil sank 5.4 percent to $2.10 a gallon. Natural gas rose 1.5 percent to $2.83 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Full text: Voters in Ireland this spring struck down a 35-year-old constitutional ban on abortion, one of the strictest in Europe. In Poland, politicians are making a renewed push to restrict abortion. A bill to legalize abortion is narrowly advancing through Argentina's Congress.
And in the United States, the departure of Justice Anthony Kennedy and President Trump's selection to succeed him is expected to redraw the well-established legal battle lines over abortion rights.
Behind the roiling public debates are deeply personal experiences: an unintended pregnancy, rape, family influence, a medical crisis, feelings of loss.
Even in places where the practice is legal, abortion can still be hard to talk about. When we invited readers to share their own stories, more than 1,300 responded from over 30 countries, showing the vast range of reasons, means and outcomes for abortion.
We selected the 13 stories below from distant pockets of the globe. They reflect the spectrum of abortion laws and the important roles of money, technology, information and culture in dictating the safety and aftermath of the procedure. These accounts have been condensed and edited for clarity, and to protect the identities of those involved.
Money
Money can play a major role in access to a safe abortion, especially in countries where the procedure is illegal.
Tegucigalpa, Honduras
Under the Honduran penal code, abortion is illegal in all cases. The possible exception described in the country's Medical Code of Ethics is when an abortion would save the life of a pregnant woman, but that can be hard to determine and the ethics code does not rise to the level of national law.
GG: I was just 16 years old. My partner at the time wasn't the ideal person -- he was studying, wasn't financially stable -- and I have always feared motherhood.
I found a doctor in my community. I told him about my situation and he decided to "help" me. It was a risky situation for him, and I didn't have the large sum of money he asked for.
He said he would reduce the price if I had sex with him. Scared, I accepted.
After I "paid" him, he inserted an injection and pills into my uterus. It was painful, like cramps, but worse. I couldn't tell anyone, and I was worried because through the course of the night I hadn't even bled. I was afraid it wouldn't work and that I'd wind up with a sick baby.
I went to the doctor first thing in the morning. He examined me and said that I was so early into the pregnancy that my body reabsorbed it [the embryo remnants].
My period returned some time after. It was heavy, and it smelled bad, but I haven't experienced any irregularities since. To date, I don't know the repercussions this may have had on my body.
Nobody aside from my partner knew. I had to go on with my life as if nothing happened.
Dublin, Ireland
Until this spring, abortion was illegal in Ireland except to save the woman's life.
Caoimhe: Both of us knew that there was no way we could afford to bring a child into the world. We knew what we had to do, so we booked an appointment for a surgical abortion at a clinic in Manchester [England].
The surgery itself was horrible, but my nurse held my hand through it. As we were leaving, she told me to rest and take my antibiotics that evening. I should expect to bleed heavily over the next few days, but this was normal.
After arriving at the hotel, I tried to sleep, when a sign on the hotel dresser caught my eye: "Soilage Charge: £150." I had been so brave until that moment, but I just couldn't hold it in anymore.
The hotel, the last-minute flights, the transport to and from the airport, the actual surgery -- my credit card was maxed out. I couldn't afford another £150 ($200).
My boyfriend was already asleep in the bed, so I made my way into the bathroom, rolled my jacket into a pillow and slept in the bathtub, crying myself to sleep.
Feelings of Loss
For some women, abortion encompasses irreparable heartbreak, especially when coupled with other traumas like an abusive partner.
Kuje, Nigeria
Abortion is illegal in Nigeria except to save the woman's life.
RL: My boyfriend wanted to have sex with me, but I was not in the mood. He tried penetrating me. I struggled to resist him.
A few weeks later, I got ill. I went to the hospital and was told I was pregnant.
I confronted my boyfriend, but he denied the pregnancy. I thought, I will break the hearts of everyone who looked after me. I was so scared and all alone.
My boyfriend then took me to an unskilled provider who carried out a surgical procedure on me at 12 weeks. It was quite painful and was done in a dirty environment. I was scared that I would lose my life.
Two months later I was ill again and went back to the hospital; a scan revealed that I was 20 weeks pregnant. I continued to carry the pregnancy but had a stillbirth at 37 weeks.
It took me a long time to recover after the death of my child. I still somehow feel responsible that the failed abortion exposed my baby to infection.
Lexington, Mass., United States
Abortion is legal in the United States. Individual states have restrictions on the procedure, including waiting periods and limits on timing, generally to before 20 to 24 weeks of gestation.
GR: We already had three children, all daughters, when we had an unexpected pregnancy. My husband repeated that he only wanted a son for a fourth. He suggested I take a gender test, at 11 weeks. When I told him I would not take such a test, he raised getting an abortion.
On a frigid morning in January of 2009, my now-ex husband drove me to a now-closed clinic, off Route 9 in Boston. I recall sitting behind him in the car ride down -- rather than beside him -- because this abortion was his idea.
We entered the waiting room, where my husband paid for the abortion. For over an hour I wept in a chair beside him. I could not complete the intake form. I could not check off the small box in the lower corner of the page asking about coercion.
I was shaking, weeping and frightened. At one point, a silver-haired security worker approached me and said, "You should not be here."
With great reluctance, I signed the form and waited my turn.
For years following, I have heard the cries of newborns -- at the grocery store, in the airport on my way to a business trip, in parks, on sidewalks -- and it triggers that frigid day in January.
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
Australian abortion laws vary by state. In Queensland, it is illegal except to protect a woman's mental or physical health.
S: Following six rounds of IVF, we conceived a baby. During our first trimester testing, we discovered a chromosomal disorder. I have a sibling with the same disability, for whom I will have to care when my parents no longer can.
We decided mostly based on that factor, and out of not wanting our child to endure a lifetime of hardship and pain.
Despite it being a criminal offense in my state, my obstetrician and a colleague of his arranged the paperwork for exemption for a surgical abortion, done at 12 weeks. My care was all very streamlined, and I did not feel judged. Our total out of pocket was about $500 (300 USD).
It was a traumatic experience that's forever changed me. I was always pro-choice, but just didn't think it would be my choice.
Portsmouth, United Kingdom
Since 1967, abortion has been widely legal in England, Scotland and Wales for pregnancies not exceeding 24 weeks. An abortion must be provided by a doctor and also requires signoff from two other doctors.
GD: Nobody told me how bad I would feel afterward. I contemplated suicide. A Christian friend supported me through healing. It was a long process, and I still miss my baby.
The Internet
The internet has spread information about abortions as well as access to the procedure. Websites, like the Netherlands-based Women on Web, provide the pills necessary for an early medical abortion. Each woman is given an online consultation with a licensed doctor before she is mailed the medications, typically mifepristone and misoprostol pills, that induce a miscarriage.
Lusake, Zambia
Abortion is broadly legal for health and socioeconomic reasons in Zambia, but it requires the consent of three doctors and must be performed in a hospital. Violations of those rules have penalties of up to seven years in prison for the provider and 14 for the patient.
SN: I was in a committed, two-year relationship with my boyfriend and was on birth control. I accidentally missed a few days, took the pills as soon as I remembered, but found myself pregnant.
I was working full-time and studying for my master's -- I could not have a baby. In fact, I don't like children and never wanted any.
The process of seeking an abortion through the government system was harrowing. Every step seems like a deterrent. They require several counseling sessions with providers who are very quick to make snide remarks to shame and belittle your circumstances and choice.
In the end, I decided to forgo the entire legal system in favor of purchasing misoprostol pills from a pharmacist I knew who was willing to sell them without a prescription.
I was eight weeks pregnant, and I was not sure of my eligibility, the right dosage or the proper instructions for administration. None of the pharmacists I tried consulting could help me. I finally stumbled across several websites that offered instructions.
I took the pills according to the online directions and waited. I felt severe cramping and nausea but otherwise no other symptoms.
I have encouraged all my friends to go this route should they ever find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy.
Eastern Poland
In Poland, abortion is legal when the woman's life is at risk, or in cases of rape, incest or severe prenatal defects.
K: My contraception pills didn't work for some reason. I'm over 40 and have two children. Our financial situation wasn't clear. Another child wasn't part of the plan.
I contacted Women on Web and got medicine for an abortion.
The most stressful part was waiting for delivery because Polish customs officials are checking packages like this.
During the abortion I was alone but had a lot of help from other women online. That was very important and made me feel I wasn't alone.
Only my husband knows, I didn't tell anyone else. Making a confession about abortion is almost a suicide here.
Feelings of Liberation
Some women remember their abortions as a defining act of self-determination.
Oklahoma City, United States
Oklahoma is one of many states that require a doctor's physical presence for a medical abortion.
Ashley: I was in an emotionally abusive marriage, and I had two young children. I was already depressed. A third child would make me even more so, rendering me incapable of being a good mother to the two children I had.
Fortunately, I had discovered the pregnancy early enough that I was able to induce the abortion through medication from Planned Parenthood.
Then I went to my in-laws' house, where they could help me watch my children. I spent most of the day resting in the bathtub alone and suffered heavy bleeding for some time after.
I was not sad about this abortion. On the contrary, I recognized it as a necessary process to protect my children. My now ex-husband was becoming scarier to us all.
I haven't told many people about it because I don't want to have to argue with family members. It's easier to spend time around each other without their judgment.
Calgary, Alberta, Canada
There are no federal laws restricting abortion in Canada, but provincial laws vary. In Alberta, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks.
JT: I had a free, surgical abortion at a clinic in the city where I live. It was both the easiest and one of the most significant choices I've made.
The morning of my procedure, I wasn't allowed food or drink. I had to bring a friend to the clinic to wait for me and take me home. Once we got through the security entrance, I was admitted and brought to the waiting room. Then, I left my friend, got into my gown and waited in a common room with other patients.
After the ultrasound, which I was not required to look at, and another waiting area, I was taken for my surgery. I gave my consent, and was put under.
When I woke up, I thought I'd slept through and missed my procedure, but it was done. At the clinic, I felt safe, and relieved. My ability to have an abortion will forever be something for which I feel gratitude.
Ripple Effects
The aftermath of an abortion can vary widely. In countries where the procedure is illegal, patients may suffer health risks and social stigma. In places with open access, women often get supplementary care such as birth control and testing for sexually transmitted diseases.
Baguio City, Philippines
Abortion is permitted to save a woman's life, but the law does not state this explicitly. Poor women often turn to herbalists for abortion elixirs, and the Guttmacher Institute, a global authority on reproductive health research, estimates that roughly 1,000 Filipino women die each year from abortion complications.
After a woman has an abortion, even one as early as 10 weeks, she may experience leaking colostrum, an early form of lactation.
Mia: It was 1998, and I was 20 years old. I found out I was pregnant on the eve of Father's Day. I greeted my boyfriend the next day with a happy Father's Day card. He was happy.
The next day I went to have an ultrasound. I found out that I was two months pregnant. I was dumbstruck. I had been seeing my boyfriend since March, but we only had sex in May. The baby wasn't his.
When he got home that evening, it was raining hard, the power was out, yet I decided to tell him. He was understandably upset. After some time, he said that the choice was mine. I decided to get an abortion.
Abortion is not legal in my country, so the abortion was in secret. The abortionist charged us 10,000 pesos (roughly $500, adjusted for inflation), a thousand for every week I was along -- a steep sum for a young couple.
The night of the abortion, my boyfriend dropped me at a designated spot. A boy, about 12, met me, and we walked a few minutes until we reached a clapboard house in one of the poorer parts of the city.
The "abortionista" brought me to a dimly lit room. She had instructed me to bring a nightgown. I was told to change into it. She then brought some pills for me to take and a glass of water. This was sometime around 8 p.m. She then pointed to the bed and told me to sleep until the time came.
At about midnight I woke up to pain from contractions. I called out for the abortionist, and she immediately came. The pain escalated fast, up to the point where she instructed me to push, and so I did. It was over quickly.
She asked if I wanted to know the sex of the baby. I said, "Hindi." (No.) She still answered that it was a boy, just in case my boyfriend would like to know.
She proceeded to clean me, then said it was time for me to go. So in the wee hours of the morning, I walked back to the roadside with the same boy. My boyfriend was waiting, and we went home.
The next day, my breasts started leaking colostrum. I didn't know what to do. I applied warm compresses, not knowing this would enhance the milk production.
I ended up with a severe case of mastitis requiring an operation. I had to tell my surgeon what happened, but I begged him not to tell my parents. On paper, it appeared I just had an infection.
Eventually, I withdrew from law school because I had to undergo surgery for the infection. I instead took up nursing.
Until now, my loved ones do not know of the abortion. It is still taboo to talk about. Do I regret having done it? No. I wasn't ready to be a mother, and of a child not born out of love.
Dublin, Ireland
Until this spring, abortion was illegal in Ireland except to save the woman's life.
Amy: Our much-wanted baby was diagnosed with anencephaly, a fatal condition. We had to arrange for a surgical abortion in a different country. We paid for it ourselves: for flights, hotels, the procedure.
We brought home our baby's remains in our hand luggage and buried them ourselves in secrecy.
Copenhagen, Denmark
Abortion is legal for any reason if the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks.
Stine: I found out I was pregnant, and I did not want to have a baby, so I got an abortion.
As soon as I saw the pregnancy test was positive, I called my doctor and told her my situation. With no judgment, she gave me the number for a clinic that does abortions 14 km (9 miles) from where I live, so it was very accessible.
I called the clinic, got an appointment two days later. The gynecologist checked me for STDs, cleared me, and told me about the procedure for my medical abortion.
I had a follow-up at the clinic a few weeks later, to make sure everything was O.K.
This cost me absolutely nothing, zero. I only paid for my painkillers.
I haven't told my parents, since I am quite young, but my friends have all been very supportive. It was never a big deal for me, though, so we don't really talk about it anymore.

Full text: YENIKOY, Turkey -- Looming like a fortress over the Black Sea, Istanbul's new airport has been engineered to provoke awe, underscoring Turkey's desire to reclaim its imperial glory.
The project is expected to cost nearly $12 billion and carve six runways across a swath of land as big as Manhattan. When completed in a decade, the complex is supposed to transport some 200 million people a year, dwarfing all rivals as the busiest airport on the planet.
But the airport has also become a symbol of a less savory aspect of Turkey's modern-day incarnation: its reckless disregard for arithmetic and the independence of critical government institutions. Together, they have placed the nation at growing risk of sliding into a financial crisis.
In a global economy increasingly plagued by worries -- from an unfolding trade war to higher oil prices -- Turkey may present the most immediate cause for alarm. The country's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has dominated national life for 15 years, was sworn in again on Monday following a re-election victory that came with extraordinary new powers. He has wielded his influence to deliver relentless economic growth through unrestrained borrowing, lifting debt levels to alarming heights. And the additional authority he has been granted is expected to further test the limits of economic reality.
In a conspicuous sign of unease among global investors, the value of Turkey's currency, the lira, has plunged by roughly one-fifth this year, raising prices for households and businesses alike. It dropped some more on Monday, as Mr. Erdogan handed the job of economic chief to his son-in-law, in what markets construed as a sign that he does not intend to adopt a more responsible mode of stewardship anytime soon.
The airport -- its first phase is to open in October -- has been brought to life with heaps of public money delivered to construction companies closely tied to Mr. Erdogan. The government has bestowed upon them guarantees against any losses. If, as many economists expect, the airport proves grander than the flow of passengers, the public will wind up with the bill.
To villagers who have been shoved off their land to make way for the new airport, the project has become a monument to their worst fears. "Erdogan is watching out for his own people," said Bora Dayilar, a farmer whose grazing land was subsumed by the project. "We are left with nothing."
Fears of disaster may seem out of place in an economy that remains one of the fastest growing on earth, expanding by 7.4 percent last year. But that growth has been fed by potentially unsustainable borrowing, both public and private.
The government has been subsidizing vast infrastructure projects like the airport and a $13 billion, 28-mile-long canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. And many businesses have borrowed in foreign currencies, which means their debt burdens have risen as the lira surrenders value.
Major Turkish companies are now trying to persuade banks and other creditors to extend relief, perhaps portending a wave of bankruptcies that could leave financial institutions and taxpayers staring at untold losses. As of the end of April, Turkish private sector companies owed more than $245 billion in foreign debt, or nearly one-third the size of the country's overall economy.
"That's a huge number," said Selva Demiralp, an economist who previously worked at the Federal Reserve bank in Washington and now teaches at Koc University in Istanbul. "And the government is encouraging them to borrow more."
Staying current on that debt requires that foreign investors continue to entrust funds to Turkey -- an increasingly questionable proposition.
Turkey can court money by continuing to lift interest rates, already at 17.75 percent. But that would depress economic growth and end the festivities for the real estate and construction industries.
Or Turkey can continue the growth party while watching inflation mount as the lira sinks further. That may condemn crucial corporations to insolvency, and perhaps force the government to seek a rescue from the International Monetary Fund, a course that would surely entail painful spending cuts.
"Turkey could be the next country to disintegrate," said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. "It has all the ingredients of the beginning of a failed state."
Some of Turkey's problems reflect the troubles assailing emerging markets in general.
As the Fed raises interest rates in the United States, investors have been pulling money out of developing nations like Argentina, Mexico and Turkey while betting on the dollar. That has pushed down the value of emerging market currencies.
But Turkey stands out as a uniquely vulnerable economy given its unorthodox financial stewardship.
Ever since a failed coup d'état that sought to topple him two years ago, Mr. Erdogan has opened the credit taps to ensure continued economic growth. The central bank has sought to restrain growth, lifting rates to stabilize the lira and contain inflation. This has provoked the wrath of the president.
Mr. Erdogan has claimed that inflation is actually the result of high interest rates, which is not unlike asserting that chemotherapy causes cancer. Before the elections, he threatened to assume control of Turkey's central bank and to abolish high rates. Investors took that as further impetus to flee, pushing the lira down to record lows.
The central bank halted the rout by lifting rates yet again. By then, though, its integrity had been severely damaged.
"Everyone is in crisis right now," said Can Oz, owner of a book and magazine publishing house in Istanbul, Can Publishing. "It's all around us. Everyone who has the slightest intellect and knowledge of the economy knows this. But the government is hiding it."
Can Publishing's profits have dropped as the fall in the lira has forced the company to pay more for paper from Finland and glue from Germany. "Our margins have been cut dramatically," Mr. Oz said.
Inside Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, a labyrinth of shops selling jewelry, carpets and antiques, merchants complain that they must pay rent in dollars or euros even as they collect lira for their sales. Their rent is effectively going up while sales decline, in part because of a severe dip in tourism after a spate of terrorist attacks.
"The Turkish lira is like ice in hot weather," said Zeki Uckardes, who sells cashmere, pashmina and silk scarves from a stall inside the bazaar. "The second you take it out, it starts to melt."
The most vulnerable companies are those that have borrowed in foreign currencies.
Four years ago, Makro, a national chain of supermarkets, decided to pursue an aggressive expansion. It borrowed 200 million lira (then worth about $88 million) from seven Turkish banks, agreeing to interest rates of about 18 percent. In a bid to limit its debt burden, it borrowed an additional $12 million in the American currency, taking advantage of dollar loans at only 5 percent interest.
The company began opening new stores and hiring more workers. But by the middle of 2017, the lira had lost more than one-third its value and Turkish interest rates were climbing. The company's monthly debt payments had risen by almost 50 percent, to 6 million lira. At the same time, Makro's revenue plunged as discount grocery chains entered the market.
With its debt payments on track to spike this year to nearly 9 million lira per month, Makro filed for a court-supervised debt restructuring. It recently emerged with an agreement that has it paying off its bank debts by selling real estate assets, while gaining debt forgiveness from suppliers.
How business will fare may depend on what they learned the last time Turkey faced such challenges.
In 2001, when Turkey absorbed a crisis so severe that it sought help from the International Monetary Fund, Vural Ak nearly lost his company, Intercity, which supplies leased cars. In those days, Mr. Ak, Intercity's founder and chief executive, paid for European cars in European currencies, while collecting his revenues in lira. When the lira plunged, he was nearly wiped out.
The lesson stuck. In recent years, as Mr. Ak has expanded Intercity into a company with a fleet of 50,000 vehicles, he has insisted on pricing his leases in euros to match the loans he takes out to buy new models.
His competitors have borrowed in dollars and euros, too, but take in lira. Many have come knocking, he said, in hopes that he will buy them and spare them from their unavoidable fate: liquidation.
In an office the size of an airport lounge, the floor-to-ceiling windows lined with toy trucks, Mr. Ak exuded the satisfaction of someone seemingly inoculated against the chaos around him.
Still, his company is not unscathed. Some 60 percent of his revenue comes from selling used cars after leases are complete. With inflation rampant and anxiety pervasive, Mr. Ak must discount the vehicles to find buyers. Last year, Intercity lost money.
In Yenikoy, a village near the new airport, the sense of crisis has been building since Mr. Erdogan unleashed the project, chasing the dream of turning the city into a global air hub to rival London and Dubai.
It is not madness: Istanbul is a city of 15 million people at the crossroads of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Its primary airport, Ataturk, can barely accommodate its current teeming masses.
Earth movers now tear at the pale soil alongside the Black Sea, constructing the bigger airport. Mr. Dayilar and the other villagers of Yenikoy sit in the way.
Mr. Dayilar's grandfather farmed this land. So did his father, and so has he, growing peas, watermelons and tomatoes, before shifting in recent years to raising cows.
To build the airport, the state appropriated their pasture, paying them modest compensation.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Dayilar, 32, sat waiting for a truck that would take away his last 28 cows. He had sold them to a trader.
Inflation has ravaged his livelihood. The village markets have raised prices for food. Hay, imported from Romania and Bulgaria, is 50 percent more expensive than it was a few months ago. Barley has skyrocketed in price, as has the cost of fuel for his tractor.
"I can't make any money," Mr. Dayilar said. "The costs are very high. Farming is dead."
He has no income, leaving him worried about how to support his wife and 2-year-old son.
He applied for a security job at the new airport, but was turned down for not having completed middle school. He applied for a cleaning job but had heard nothing.
"God help us," Mr. Dayilar said. "I'm unemployed. I don't know what I'm going to do."

Full text: According to early indications, recent U.S. economic growth was full of beans.
No, seriously. More than half of America's soybean exports typically go to China, but Chinese tariffs will shift much of that demand to Brazil, and countries that normally get their soybeans from Brazil have raced to replace them with U.S. beans. The perverse result is that the prospect of tariffs has temporarily led to a remarkably large surge in U.S. exports, which independent estimates suggest will add around 0.6 percentage points to the U.S. economy's growth rate in the second quarter.
Unfortunately, we'll give all that growth back and more in the months ahead. Thanks to the looming trade war, U.S. soybean prices have plummeted, and the farmers of Iowa are facing a rude awakening.
Why am I telling you this story? Partly as a reminder of the unintended consequences of Donald Trump's trade war, which is going to hurt a lot of people, like Iowa farmers, who supported him in 2016. In fact, it looks as if the trade war is in general going to hurt Trump's supporters more than his opponents.
Meanwhile, Trump's trade war will benefit some unexpected parties. Was making Brazil great again part of his agenda?
But mainly I offer the parable of the soybeans as a warning against what's going to happen later this month, when the advance estimate of second-quarter G.D.P. comes in. The headline number is probably going to look good, possibly over 4 percent growth. If so, Trump will trumpet the news as proof that his economic policies are working -- and some gullible journalists may go along with his claim.
So what you need to know is that (a) quarterly fluctuations in growth are mainly noise, telling you very little about long-term economic prospects, and (b) more fundamental indicators show that Trump's main policy achievement to date, last year's tax cut, is basically delivering none of what its backers promised.
About those quarterly growth rates: By historical standards, the economic recovery since the end of the global financial crisis has been remarkably consistent. If you look at job growth you see a steady upward trend, seemingly unaffected by political events. Quarterly G.D.P. growth has, however, fluctuated wildly, with a couple of negative quarters and a high of 5.2 percent in the third quarter of 2014.
The moral is clear: Pay little or no attention to short-term growth wobbles, which can be driven by transitory stuff like the reshuffling of world soybean trade.
But in that case, how can we evaluate Trump's economic policies? The answer is, by looking at how those policies were supposed to work, and comparing that with what's actually happening.
Let me damn the 2017 tax cut with some faint praise: While the logic of the Trump trade war is completely muddled -- never mind how it's supposed to work, it's not even clear what it's supposed to achieve -- the drafters of the tax bill did have a theory of the case. The story went like this: Lower taxes on corporations would lead to a huge surge of investment, which would raise productivity, which would eventually be passed on to workers in higher wages.
By the way, the idea that workers would see an immediate benefit was always obvious nonsense, and sure enough, they didn't. In fact, adjusted for inflation, the hourly wages of ordinary workers were slightly lower in May than they were a year earlier.
Anyway, when I say a huge surge in investment, I mean huge. Last year I looked at estimates from the Tax Foundation, the only independent institution (well, supposedly independent, anyway) willing to endorse highly optimistic assessments of the tax cut. Those estimates, it turned out, implied a boost in business investment of around $600 billion a year, or 3 percent of G.D.P.
Nothing like that is happening, and leading indicators of business investment, like orders of capital goods, show no sign of an investment boom ahead. Corporations have gotten a really big tax cut: The tax take on corporate profits has fallen off a cliff since the tax cut was enacted. But they're using the extra money for stock buybacks and higher dividends, not investment.
As a result, there's no reason to believe that the U.S. economy's potential growth -- the rate of growth it can achieve on a sustained basis -- will rise from the 2 percent or less expected by most analysts. The tax cut has been good for stockholders -- about a third of whom are foreigners, by the way. Working Americans, not so much.
So how is the Trump economic policy doing? The tax cut is utterly failing to deliver on its advocates' promises. It's early days in the trade war, but the administration's strategy seems designed to inflict maximum self-harm, and first reports suggest that trade conflict is leading to reduced, not increased, investment.
Against that background, how much should we care about whatever headlines are generated by the next set of growth numbers? Very little, if at all. (To be clear, this statement also applies if the quarterly numbers come in worse than expected.) Short-term growth is noise, signifying nothing.

Media and tech moguls gather to discuss deals.
Some of the biggest moguls in technology and media -- including Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Timothy Cook of Apple and Rupert Murdoch of 21st Century Fox -- are expected to be in Sun Valley, Idaho, this week for an annual conference run by the investment bank Allen & Company. The gathering, which starts on Tuesday, is expected to focus on the intensifying consolidation in the media sector, and it could be the hatching ground for the next big takeover, conceived in the hallways of the resort between panel discussions.

E.U.'s treaty with Japan to counterbalance U.S. protectionism.
Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, will visit Brussels on Wednesday to sign an agreement with the European Union to lower trade barriers. The treaty is the latest example of how the European Union is aggressively signing free trade agreements as a counterweight to American protectionism, and it follows similar accords with Canada and South Korea. The agreement is expected to be benefit, among other industries, European wine and cheese makers, whose products will no longer be subject to tariffs when entering Japan.

Economy
Inflation probably picked up in June.
Friday's jobs report showed that hiring was strong in June but that wage growth remained sluggish. That's bad news for workers hoping for a raise, but it should ease fears that low unemployment will lead to faster inflation. Still, investors and policymakers will be watching closely on Thursday when the Labor Department releases data on consumer prices in June. Economists surveyed by FactSet expect the report to show that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.9 percent from a year earlier, which would represent the fastest growth since 2012. Setting aside volatile food and energy prices, however, consumer prices probably rose a more modest 2.3 percent.

European Central Bank will release an account of June's meeting.
The European Central Bank on Thursday will publish an account of its June monetary policy meeting, shedding light on the thinking behind the decision to end its main stimulus program after the end of the year. The European economy boomed in 2017, though growth has slowed in recent months and a number of problems lurk in the region. Investors and analysts will also be looking for clues about when the central bank may start to raise key interest rates from record low levels. The bank said last month that it wouldn't raise rates before the end of next summer, but was vague about how it defined "summer."

Chinese trade numbers may show effect of fight with the U.S.
Monthly figures from the Chinese government could provide a hint of whether the trade fight with the United States is beginning to take a toll. The data from June, to be released on Friday, will reflect the period before President Trump officially began a trade war last week by imposing tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese-made goods. So far, China's exports to the United States have risen despite the escalating rhetoric between Washington and Beijing. That reflects the strength of the American economy, though stockpiling by American buyers may also be a factor.

Banking
Banks to report earnings on the heels of stress tests.
Banks will begin reporting second-quarter earnings this week, with Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo set to report results on Friday. Fresh from winning regulatory approval to give 17 percent more cash back to their shareholders this year than last year, the country's biggest banks may reveal another stellar quarter -- if they've managed to stay ahead of rising interest rates.

Full text: Based on current life expectancy tables, a typical girl born in the United States today will most likely live until she is almost 87 years old -- nearly four years longer than a typical boy born in 2018.
But if current trends remain in place, she will probably earn less than he will, thanks in part, to a career that may be delayed or interrupted by bouts of caregiving, including motherhood.
That's what the statistics show. And those longer life spans and lower earnings help to explain why women are generally poorer than men in their retirement -- and why many women would benefit even more than men from working a bit longer.
In a column last month, I pointed out that the simple strategy of delaying retirement a few years -- optimally, until at least age 70, when maximum Social Security benefits kick in -- will produce extra monthly income that most people can't match with investment, savings and cost-cutting alone.
With pensions disappearing and the stock market gyrating, Social Security -- even with all of its problems -- remains the most stable retirement pillar for perhaps 85 percent of the population. For those able and willing to work longer, the financial rewards from delaying retirement can be substantial.
But I didn't discuss retirement gender issues in that column. That was a big omission.
While many men and women can benefit from the simple strategy of working longer, that approach tends to be even more useful for women. Yet relatively few women are actually making use of it: Women have, in fact, been retiring earlier than men, though that is generally not in their financial interest.
Those are the key insights of an important new research paper by Nicole Maestas, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. Her study, "The Return to Work and Women's Employment Decisions," is available as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper.
In her study, Professor Maestas focused mainly on married heterosexual couples, although many of her findings apply to others in the population, including women who have never married or have divorced.
She found that husbands and wives "tend to retire at around the same time" but that "because women tend to marry men older than they, the joint retirement of married couples means that married women retire at younger ages than their husbands do."
Married women tend to be two to three years younger than their husbands, and retire two to three years earlier, the data suggests. That earlier retirement age "seems counterintuitive," she said, "since women have longer life expectancies and have shorter careers due to delayed or interrupted labor force participation while raising children."
Optimally, she said, women should retire at "older ages than men."
The standard reason for retiring at older ages -- given in "The Power of Working Longer," the paper I cited in the previous column -- is that monthly Social Security benefits rise appreciably if you wait longer to claim them. In one case on the official Social Security website, for example, monthly benefits rise 76 percent through delaying retirement from age 62 to 70.
But the greater monthly benefits that come from delayed retirement are based on the actuarial expectation that you will have fewer months left in your life to collect those larger Social Security checks. On average, for the population as a whole, total lifetime benefits are expected to be the same, regardless of when an individual starts to receive them.
That is true for the population as a whole, yet there is a fundamental problem: For men and women, all things are not equal.
Women generally earn less than men -- about 81 cents on the dollar in 2016 for the median woman, according to the Census Bureau. That not only means lower lifetime income, but also lower monthly Social Security benefits. In 2016 filings, Social Security data show, women received $1,216.62 in monthly benefits, on average, compared with $1,592.43 for men -- a difference of $375.81 per month.
With lower lifetime earnings, less in savings and lower Social Security benefits, retired women are 80 percent more likely to live in poverty than men, a recent study by the nonprofit National Institute on Retirement Security found. (Widows and widowers receive benefits based on their spouses' earnings, if they are higher than what they would otherwise receive. But that doesn't entirely erase the disparity for women.)
For those healthy enough to work longer and able to find suitable employment, delayed retirement can ease financial strain. "Working longer can provide more financial resources," Professor Maestas said in a phone interview. "And it so happens that women right now tend to benefit more than men from working longer."
It isn't simply that more women need the extra money. It is subtler, and the details matter.
Childbirth and bouts of caregiving have helped to make women's careers shorter than men's, and their peak earnings years have tended to be later. When they retire earlier than men, many women miss out on some of those higher earning years, Professor Maestas said.
That is significant because of the way Social Security is structured: More peak earnings years bring greater benefits. And when benefits are calculated, additional years of work at higher earning levels offset the less lucrative years -- or replace the non-working years -- that many women had earlier in their lives.
Her estimates show that for baby boomers, the inflation-adjusted, lifetime Social Security benefits for women -- married, never married and divorced alike -- rise between 9 percent and 10 percent when they work until 70 instead of 62, while lifetime (not monthly) benefits for men generally decline slightly if they delay retirement the same way. Furthermore, despite the gender wage gap, when both men and women work until 70, men's advantage over women in lifetime Social Security benefits declines to just 4 percent, from 13 percent when they retire at age 62.
From a purely financial standpoint, then many women should retire later than men, yet the opposite is more commonly happening. Why? One reason is that couples often want to spend time together -- and to retire together. Especially when the older partner has higher earnings, his preferred timing -- and in today's world, it usually is his, not hers -- often prevails.
But the world is changing. Fewer heterosexual Americans are marrying, gays have begun to do so, women and transgender people are playing important roles in the workplace and demanding wage and benefit equality.
A couple of decades from now, Professor Maestas said, "If I did a study like this, I don't think I'd be focusing on married heterosexual couples. I'd be looking at people, generally, and their partners, and their wage and benefit patterns."
In the world we live in now, though, it may help to know that there is a retirement strategy that can help many hard-pressed people, especially working women.

Full text: SHANGHAI -- Accusing the United States of "typical trade bullying," China on Friday imposed $34 billion in retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans, cars and other products, suggesting dim prospects for resolving a potentially bruising trade war between the two economic powerhouses.
Beijing said on Friday that its levies had kicked in immediately after the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect, just past midnight in Washington. The 545 goods targeted by China for tariffs, which include beef, seafood, dairy and other farm goods in addition to automobiles, were chosen to hit President Trump's supporters in the agricultural and industrial parts of the Midwest.
As it has in the past, China used the moment to cast itself as a defender of the global trade order. Beijing officials have portrayed Mr. Trump's threats to tax as much as $450 billion worth of Chinese goods as a threat to global prosperity.
"The wrong actions of the U.S. have brazenly violated the rules of the World Trade Organization, attacked the whole world's economic sustainability and obstructed the global economy's recovery," Lu Kang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said in a daily news briefing. "It will bring disaster to multinational corporations, small and medium businesses and normal consumers across the world."
China's state-controlled news media echoed the sentiment.
"As the American side has gradually closed in on China, it has aroused the ire of Chinese society, and made Chinese people more clearheaded, more united," said an editorial on the website of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid owned by the Communist Party. "Washington has obviously underestimated the giant force that the world's opposition and China's retaliation can produce."
But Chinese news outlets have stopped short of language that would suggest appetite for a major escalation, such as a consumer boycott of American brands.
China has become a key market for brands such as Apple, Nike, Starbucks and General Motors. Consumer boycotts have proven effective in Beijing's earlier disputes with South Korea, Japan and the Philippines. But targeting American goods could be trickier. The iPhones, Chevrolets and other goods that American companies sell in China are often made in China, and by Chinese workers.
Still, some consumers said they could imagine making do without iPhones or American cars as a way to strike back against Washington.
"Of course I want China to fight back," said Cathy Yuan, 32, who was shopping at an upscale Shanghai supermarket on Friday. "We are defending our rights as a nation."
Other shoppers sounded warier. Fresh American beef and other high-end imports -- goods that are likely to become more expensive as more tariffs are imposed -- lined the shelves.
"High-quality fresh food is already quite expensive, and with tariffs, prices will go up even further," said Wan Yang, a 27-year-old seafood dealer who imports black cod and king crab from Alaska.
Health and hygiene concerns have led China's increasingly well-off shoppers to prefer food imported from the United States or elsewhere.
"We buy imported goods because we feel they are safer to eat," said Mike Zheng, 30, who was browsing the aisles with his 2-year-old son. "If there were domestic substitutes, then tariffs would be O.K. But domestic products can't keep up, so we'll just have to accept higher prices."
That could become a problem for Chinese leaders. Inflation is an economic gauge that is of paramount, constant concern. In the past, rising prices have contributed to political instability. The Chinese government has used price controls and subsidies to tamp down inflation, but that could get expensive quickly.
It may not just be buyers of American steaks who get hurt. Soybeans are the highest-value farm import from the United States that is affected by Friday's tariffs. American growers supplied one-third of the soy that China shipped in last year, mainly to produce cooking oil and animal feed.
"Global soybean supply and demand is tightly balanced right now," said Gong Yanhai, a senior analyst in Shanghai with Huatai Asset Management. Taxing American soy, Mr. Gong said, also means that China will pay more to buy beans from its biggest supplier, Brazil, where premiums per bushel have already risen in anticipation of the tariffs.
Around China, the trade war is being watched with a mix of worry, ire at the United States -- and frank curiosity about it all.
On the social media platform Weibo, word went around on Friday of a ship speeding toward China to beat the tariffs on its precious cargo: American soybeans. News of the vessel's race against the clock was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
The trade war could have equally important effects on the $2 trillion worth of goods that the country sells to the rest of the world, said Hua Min, an economist at Fudan University in Shanghai. A decade ago, in the wake of the global financial crisis, China's exports cratered, and consumers and businesses at home could not spend enough to keep factories humming.
"The driving force of the Chinese economy is mainly exports," Mr. Hua said. "If there are no exports, there will be manufacturing overcapacity. Manufacturing overcapacity will lead to debt. And debt will affect companies' balance sheets. Then it will be 2008 all over again."
At a Tesla dealership in downtown Shanghai on Friday, there was not much love for the idea of paying even more for the premium electric vehicles.
"The trade war won't last forever," said Charlie Lin, 25, who works in real estate and was looking at cars. "China and the U.S. definitely have ways of resolving it. After all, an endless fight would be bad for both countries. These are just temporary measures."
Still, "China must accept this challenge," Mr. Lin said. "We have enough stamina to fight back. We will find out what America is made of."

Full text: Despite sharpening trade tensions, a hefty rise in payrolls has provided the latest evidence that the American economy is strong enough to keep pulling benched workers back into action.
Six hundred thousand people joined the work force in June and started actively hunting for a job, the Labor Department said Friday in its monthly report. Of those who found one, three-quarters had been outside the pool of those officially ranked as unemployed.
The number of Americans working part time because of their inability to find a full-time position fell -- as did the number of those too discouraged to bother searching.
"I'm really excited to see that the labor force is growing," said Catherine Barrera, chief economist of the online job site ZipRecruiter.
Over all, the economy added 213,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent, but Ms. Barrera was unruffled, saying, "There were some people who weren't participating in the labor force who are now being encouraged to return."
For workers, the modest 2.7 percent increase in the average hourly wage over the past year was disappointing; pay raises are a nose behind some measures of inflation. But the slow pace does undercut arguments that the economy is in danger of revving too fast.
"This should take a little bit of pressure off the Federal Reserve to step up the pace of tightening," said Jim O'Sullivan, chief economist of High Frequency Economics, referring to the debate over how quickly to raise benchmark interest rates.
The jobs report caps a string of encouraging economic readings. Some estimates for growth in the second quarter are bouncing above 4 percent. The manufacturing sector buzzed with activity last month, and spending on construction rose. New jobless claims are at historically low levels. And many consumers displayed their confidence in the economy by kicking off the summer with a new car purchase.
"JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!" President Trump said Friday on Twitter after the Labor Department's data for June was released.
Anxieties over the fallout from a trade war, however, continue to cast shadows as $34 billion in additional tariffs on China went into effect on Friday, and the Chinese vowed to retaliate. "They're playing with fire, really," Mr. O'Sullivan said of the Trump administration's trade policies, echoing warnings from companies and trade groups about the potential impact on business and jobs.
For employers, the more immediate challenge has been finding qualified, reliable workers at the going wage rate. In addition to the growing ranks of new job hunters, the quickening competition is giving more employees the confidence to quit in search of a better deal. But the share of prime-age workers participating in the labor force is below the level that prevailed a decade ago. And the number of job openings is striding ahead of the number of workers ready to fill them.
"There's more jobs than there are people available for jobs -- at every level," from the factory floor to the executive suite, said Joe Galvin, chief research officer of Vistage, an association of small-business owners and executives.
Employers surveyed by Vistage last month said they were increasing pay, sweetening benefits packages and trying to create an appealing work culture to retain workers as well as attract new ones -- including candidates not previously looking.
Still, as this latest jobs report shows, the lengthening list of help-wanted postings has had only a modest effect on hourly earnings. Several employers said their reluctance to raise prices limited the wages they could offer.
Gigi Schweikert, the president and chief operating officer Lightbridge Academy, which operates child care facilities, said the company was moving toward a $15-an-hour minimum over three years, but had to keep its fees affordable.
"We are always looking for job candidates," she said, acknowledging that her industry is known for high turnover rates, low pay and a predominance of female workers. "We want to be more aggressive, but we can't price parents out of the market."
And despite the demand for workers, many of the available jobs, particularly in lower-wage sectors, are short on appeal. Many employers limit hours to avoid paying benefits like health insurance. Work shifts frequently change with little notice, and wage increases are still insufficient to cover living costs. Stability and security are often scarce.
Laid off 11 months ago in Philadelphia, Jim Stallard said he turned down four jobs because "they were all extremely low paid and didn't have any benefits." Mr. Stallard, 57, eventually went to work at a large-format printer for $18 an hour -- far less than the $30 an hour and ample health and retirement benefits he earned previously managing the print and copy shop at Drexel University.
Better-skilled workers are generally in a stronger bargaining position. DocuSign, an electronic-signature company with more than $500 million in annual revenue, added 100 sales, engineering and technical workers last month and intends to hire another 500 over the next six months, said Joan Burke, the company's chief people officer.
"You just cannot be in this game without being competitive," Ms. Burke said of salaries.
The Labor Department's report provides only a temporary and incomplete snapshot of the economy. Updates to the April and May reports registered an additional 37,000 jobs. June's estimates will be revised twice. For the moment, though, it showed the manufacturing sector continued its hiring surge, with 36,000 jobs added. Business and professional services as well as health care also had strong showings, while the retail sector slumped, losing 22,000 jobs and erasing nearly all the gains made in May. More job losses, from the demise of Toys "R" Us, could show up in July.
The unemployment rate for blacks also worsened in June from the previous month, rising to 6.5 percent, while the rate among Hispanics improved, falling to 4.6 percent. (Among whites, the jobless rate is 3.5 percent.)
Fears of a trade war are keeping employers on edge. Recent surveys of business owners have reflected dismay with the uncertainty generated by tariffs, whether already imposed or threatened.
As the newly released minutes from the Fed's meeting last month noted, intensifying anxiety about trade policy could "eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending."
The United States Chamber of Commerce also stepped up its warnings that escalating tariffs could result in "lost sales and ultimately lost jobs here at home," publishing a state-by-state breakdown of exports and jobs at risk.
Last week, General Motors said that tariffs could lead to "less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages." The motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, based in Wisconsin, announced it would shift some production overseas to sidestep retaliatory tariffs imposed by European countries.
Heightening trade tensions are not the only risks over the longer term.
As Oxford Economics, an economic research firm, noted in its newsletter, "While it may feel like a party in the U.S.A., several risks are building," including growing consumer debt.
Most economists continue to warn that the economic high has been pumped up in part by deep tax cuts financed by ballooning debt.
At the moment, though, "the trends are strong," Mr. O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics noted, and "the unemployment rate is going to keep falling."

Full text: The trade dispute between the United States and China escalated on Friday, but Wall Street focused on a solid jobs report instead.
After a wobbly start, stocks mounted a broad rally, shaking off two consecutive weekly losses.
Growing jitters in recent weeks over a stepped-up trading dispute between the world's two largest economies had weighed on the markets well ahead of Friday, when Beijing and Washington launched dueling tariffs on billions in goods.
"The markets had already sold off the prior two weeks," said Dan Heckman, national investment consultant at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. "The market probably had built that expectation in already and today we're seeing a nice rebound."
A solid pickup in hiring last month also helped keep investors in a buying mood.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.21 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,759.82. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 99.74 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,456.48. The Nasdaq composite added 101.96 points, or 1.3 percent, to 7,688.39. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks picked up 14.57 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,694.05.
Investors welcomed new data Friday from the government showing that employers kept up a brisk pace of hiring last month, adding 213,000 jobs, without having to raise wages much. Markets have been watching to see if tight labor market conditions would force wages higher, a sign of inflation.
Health care stocks posted the biggest gains, led by the drugmaker Biogen. Its stock soared 19.6 percent to $357.48 on encouraging results from an Alzheimer's therapy.
Technology companies also notched solid gains. Advanced Micro Devices shares rose 5.6 percent to $16.36.
United States crude oil prices reversed an early slide. Benchmark United States crude gained 86 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $73.80 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 28 cents to close at $77.11 a barrel in London.
Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.82 percent from 2.83 percent late Thursday.
The dollar fell to 110.41 yen from 110.62 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.1741 from $1.1691.
Gold dropped $2.90 to $1,254.40 an ounce. Silver slipped 3 cents to $16.07 an ounce. Copper was little changed at $2.82 a pound.
In other energy futures trading, heating oil slipped 1 cent to $2.17 a gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $2.86 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Major indexes in Europe finished higher. Asian markets erased earlier losses to finish mostly higher.

Full text: When the top policymakers at the Federal Reserve met three weeks ago to set the course for monetary policy in the United States, they spent substantial time discussing the risks that a trade war posed to the economy, according to minutes of the meeting released Thursday.
Most Fed officials at the table "noted that uncertainty and risks had intensified," and that tariffs and other trade measures "could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending." They reported that some of their business contacts "indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy."
What they didn't discuss, at least as far as one can tell from the newly published minutes, was any strategy for the Fed to come to the rescue if trade wars began to act as a meaningful drag on the overall economy. Indeed, at that meeting, Fed officials "generally judged that, with the economy already very strong" and inflation running at about 2 percent, "it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising" interest rates.
There was no hint in the minutes that the Fed intended to use its power over interest rates in reaction to rising economic risks from trade wars.
That reflects a particular economic challenge as the United States imposes tariffs on major trading partners and as those partners retaliate with tariffs of their own -- a cycle set to escalate with $34 billion of Chinese imports to go into effect at midnight.
It's not just that a multi-front trade war could slow economic growth. It's that it would do so in a way the Fed would not be able to easily offset. The usual economic shock absorber is particularly ill-suited to a trade-induced slump.
That's because a trade war simultaneously risks pulling growth rates down while pushing prices up. Anything the Fed seeks to do to cushion the blow on one side of that equation would tend to make things worse on the other side. So if, for example, the Fed held off on further interest rate increases to cushion a slump in investment spending, it would be doing so just as inflation was accelerating above the 2 percent the Fed aims for.
Prices for washing machines, for example, have risen in recent months amid new tariffs on washing machine imports. Tariffs on steel and aluminum have already driven up domestic prices of the materials, which could flow through in the form of higher inflation even for American-made goods that use the metals.
"I think of this as a standard supply shock," said Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon. "Tariffs are going to constrict the productive capacity of the United States, which means lower growth and higher prices. The Fed operates on the demand side. They don't have the right tools for dealing with it."
For the Fed, the nearest parallel may be an oil price shock caused by some geopolitical event, such as those that took place in the 1970s, or a food price spike caused by a drought. What those events have in common is that they are caused not by economic fundamentals -- such as when oil prices rise because the global economy is booming -- but by some external shock. They are bad for growth, yet inflationary.
In those cases, monetary policy orthodoxy tends to emphasize looking past a one-time bump in inflation caused by the shock, while paying more attention to whether higher prices -- whether for oil or corn or aluminum -- are leading people to expect continually rising prices. A couple of years ago, with the Fed struggling to achieve the 2 percent inflation level it targets and with prices consistently rising more slowly, that might have been welcome.
Now, though, the Fed is pretty much achieving its inflation goal already, and with the unemployment rate at a very low level by historical standards, there's reason to think higher prices may be on the way soon even before the impact of tariffs. In projections released at the mid-June policy meeting, the median Fed official expected that inflation would be 2.1 percent this year and next.
That calculus could change if a trade war starts doing major damage to the financial system, such as by causing steep losses in stock and bond markets or by causing financial stress for banks. But while the stock market is down a bit in recent weeks as the war of words over trade has escalated, so far the pain from trade wars has been limited to specific companies and their workers and customers. It has not been a systemic crisis.
For the last 11 years, from the housing downturn in 2007 that turned into the global financial crisis in 2008 and a prolonged, sluggish expansion after that, the Fed's tools were reasonably well suited to the challenges that presented themselves. The central bank became even more central than usual to every economic discussion.
But this time, the economic risks are different, and if conflict over trade practices starts to cause damage to the broader economy, we shouldn't count on the Fed to bail us out.

A Norm-Breaking White House Keeps Its Eye on a Hawkish Fed

Full text: Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines -- and the power-brokers who shape them.__________
The Federal Reserve, the powerful entity that steers the United States economy, has plenty of critics in Washington, but the White House typically holds its tongue.
Is that now changing?
When asked last week if the Fed might undermine the economy with too many interest rate increases, Larry Kudlow, the director of President Trump's National Economic Council, said he hoped the central bank would "move very slowly."
Last month, Fed policymakers signaled that they may make four interest rate increases this year, up from the three they previously expected. That means the Fed could raise rates two more times this year, and three next, according to the policymakers' indications. Mr. Kudlow's remarks could be construed as a signal that the White House does not want those increases to come quickly.
That the president's top economic adviser expressed an opinion on monetary policy might not seem controversial, especially when so many other economic matters are up for discussion. But it had become something of a norm for the White House to refrain from questioning the Fed.
The central bank has the power to influence the economy like no other government entity. Presidents in the past leaned on the Fed to rev up growth ahead of elections, sometimes causing havoc later. Such messes persuaded White House officials to back off, and in the last two decades they have largely left the Fed to do its job. But now, with President Trump questioning so much of the existing economic order and sometimes breaking protocol, as he did last month when signaling strong jobs numbers before their release, investors and others are on the lookout for any encroachment on the Fed's autonomy.
But in a phone interview, Mr. Kudlow said he merely was expressing his personal opinions. "I respect the Fed's independence. In no way would I ever seek to undermine it," he said. "I happen to approve of the Fed's policy."
Still, evidence is accumulating that the Trump administration might be more willing to question the central bank's actions. "The Fed's going to do what it has to do, but I hope they don't overdo it," Mr. Kudlow said in March, after it was announced that he was joining the White House.
Mr. Trump has made comments on interest rates, too. "I do like a low-interest-rate policy, I must be honest with you," he told The Wall Street Journal last year.
In April, Mr. Trump made an indirect reference to the Fed's recent conduct of monetary policy. In a tweet on the dollar's value, he noted that "the U.S. keeps raising interest rates."
Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who was a candidate to be the Fed's chairman, came away from his interview last year with Mr. Trump with the impression that the president was not particularly mindful of central bank independence.
"In some sense the broader notion of an independent agency, that's probably not an obvious feature to the president," Mr. Warsh told Politico. Jerome H. Powell got the chairman's job.
Investors, who watch interest rates closely, do not yet appear to believe that the Trump administration has crossed the line. But if Trump administration officials made a habit of questioning the Fed's moves, investors would become unsettled, said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial.
"The market can tolerate boundary skirmishes on monetary policy," he said, "but it will not welcome constant skirmishes."
The Fed's so-called dual mandate is to foster the economic conditions that will lead to maximum employment and stable prices. It cuts interest rates to stimulate economic activity and raises them to cool the economy if there are signs that prices are rising too fast.
But the Fed's rate increases have in the past caused growth to slow markedly, and even tipped the economy into recession. And a lackluster economy with weak jobs growth is the last thing politicians want in the lead-up to a re-election battle. That is why President George Bush in 1992 called on the Fed to cut interest rates.
Still, there is a chance that the Fed will be able to raise interest rates this year and next without causing a full-blown recession. If that happens, the Fed most likely will be able to go about its business without interference.
"Respect for Fed independence is nearly always conditional on the shape of the economy," said Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University who co-wrote a book on Congress's relations with the Fed.
The Fed may be able to avoid slamming on the brakes because the economy could be less prone to inflation than it was. Changes in the economy and the United States work force appear to have weakened the relationship between unemployment and prices.
Mr. Kudlow contends that Mr. Trump's economic policies, like tax cuts and deregulation, are lowering costs for businesses and creating incentives for them to invest. These so-called supply-side changes, he asserts, are starting to enable the economy to grow with less risk of inflation.
This was his basis for his comments last week on the pace of rate increases, which were made in an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business. "My hope is that they understand that, and they will move very slowly," Mr. Kudlow said, referring to the Fed.
But some economists say the tax cuts will help stoke inflation because they were enacted just as the economy was picking up steam.
The big question is how the Trump administration might react if the Fed does cause the economy to slow considerably. To apply real influence over the Fed, past administrations have gone beyond jawboning, said Sebastian Mallaby, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a biography of Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman. Past presidents have tried to put people on the Fed's board who share their views on monetary policy or other matters. There are currently four open spots on the Fed's board. Two of them could be filled soon.
"I'd say the Trump team is the first time in a quarter of a century when you've had a direct threat from a president or an administration to the independence of the Fed," Mr. Mallaby said.
Mr. Kudlow, however, said he agreed with the Fed's current monetary policy, because, in his view, Mr. Powell is also likely to be wary of raising interest rates too quickly. "This is what they're doing, basically, as I understand it from Jay's comments, public comments," Mr. Kudlow said, referring to Mr. Powell.

Full text: Every three months, a select group of Federal Reserve officials gets together to guess where the federal funds rate is headed. That's the interest rate banks charge one another for overnight loans. It's important because it's an economic cue ball, creating a knock-on effect for other interest rates.
The Fed forecasters' median prediction is that the federal funds rate is headed to 3.4 percent by the end of 2020 from the current 1.9 percent. This means you'll be paying more to get a mortgage, a new-car loan or to carry a balance on your credit card. How much more? Possibly enough to absorb whatever extra income you might be enjoying from lower tax rates or higher wages.
The Fed is picking our pockets because, to prevent the economy from overheating, it is legally required to keep inflation in check by raising rates. But the task has been made more urgent by the Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, which effectively threw gasoline onto a very hot barbecue.
"It makes the Fed's job more difficult all around because what you're getting is a stimulus at the very wrong moment," a noted former Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said in a recent appearance at the American Enterprise Institute. Economists at the Fed would never have chosen such a policy. But in the G.O.P., tax cuts aren't so much science as they are theology, even if the faithful have to be sacrificed.
Trump supporters who benefited the least from the Republican tax cut -- wage workers, farmers and anyone else not in the top 10 percent of earners -- will now have to pay the bulk of the bill to mitigate the damage it caused to the economy.
You can see this in credit card debt, which has crested at $1 trillion, now at an average interest rate of about 16.8 percent. Credit card interest rates are tied to the prime rate, which is tied to -- you guessed it -- the federal funds rate. Chase, for instance, adds from 11.74 percent to 20.49 percent to the prime rate, creating a maximum credit card rate of 29.99 percent. For those consumers who carry a balance (about a third don't), and a card that automatically adjusts (not all do), the difference can mean hundreds of dollars in extra interest costs annually. In one 2016 study, the credit reporting company TransUnion said rising rates affect 92 million consumers, 9.3 million of them severely.
And now rates are now rising at time when household debt reached a record $13.21 trillion in the first quarter. Household debt service payments as a percentage of disposable income hit 5.9 percent in the first quarter, according to the Federal Reserve, a figure not reached since just before the Great Recession. Average credit card debt per borrower is about $5,700 and growing at a rate of 4.7 percent while wages are growing at about 3 percent. That can't continue forever.
There's an anomaly in an economy that is supposedly running flat out: Many families still haven't recovered the wealth they lost in the financial collapse. A sobering analysis by Deutsche Bank concludes that more families than ever have zero or negative wealth, excluding their homes. (Home ownership has fallen to 64.2 percent of households, from a peak of 69 percent in 2004.) Despite high stock prices and record home prices, household net worth since 2007 has decreased for all income groups -- except the top 10 percent. Net worth for the richest Americans is up an average of 27 percent. For the middle class, what remains of it, wealth has decreased 20 percent to 30 percent in real terms -- their share of the pie has shrunk.
Similarly, a recent St. Louis Fed study of generational wealth concluded that the very families whose wealth should be growing are falling behind. "We believe many families in the youngest cohort we studied here -- respondents born in the 1980s -- are at substantial risk of accumulating less wealth over their life spans than the members of previous generations," the report said.
That's an astonishing conclusion in an economy that, as President Trump insists, has never been better. Certainly, it's never been better for the wealthiest 10 percent of families, who now own about 75 percent of the nation's total household wealth, as opposed to less than 35 percent in the 1970s. Or for the nation's richest 0.1 percent, who now own as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, according to Deutsche Bank. For the other 90 percent, the ability to build wealth rests on the ability to save, which they can't do if interest rates are rising and eating into their earnings. The personal savings rate, at 2.8 percent, is heading in the wrong direction.
Raising rates now, perversely, gives the Fed a monetary tool with which they would be able to fight the next recession -- by cutting those rates. And that may come sooner than expected. By 2020, when Mr. Bernanke believes any stimulative effect of the tax cuts will have run its course, we will be facing what he called a Wile E. Coyote economy, after that overeager cartoon character.
The overstimulated American economy will run off the cliff on its own momentum, Mr. Bernanke fears. That will leave the nation with an enormous federal deficit and not much fiscal room to maneuver. Having been essentially made to pay for the tax cuts for the richest Americans, the rest of the nation will be staring down the abyss, too.

Full text: With the Supreme Court striking down laws that require government workers to pay union fees, one thing is clear: Most public-sector unions in more than 20 states with such laws are going to get smaller and poorer in the coming years.
Though it is difficult to predict with precision, experts and union officials say they could lose 10 percent to one-third of their members, or more, in the states affected, as conservative groups seek to persuade workers to drop out.
The court's decision is the latest evidence that moves to weaken unions are exacting a major toll. Beyond the dropout campaigns aimed at members, conservatives are bringing lawsuits to retroactively recover fees collected by unions from nonmembers.
[Read more about the justices' ruling and their reasoning.]
In May, President Trump signed three executive orders making it easier to fire government workers and reining in the role of unions representing federal workers.
Dropping out of a union is a more attractive proposition now that workers no longer have to pay a so-called agency fee, typically about 80 percent of union dues, if they choose not to belong to a union. (Those doing so generally account for a small fraction of the workers whom public-sector unions represent.)
In the five years after Michigan passed a law ending mandatory union fees in 2012, the number of active members of the Michigan Education Association dropped by about 25 percent, according to government filings, a much faster attrition rate than before. Its annual receipts fell by more than 10 percent, adjusting for inflation.
Still, the more interesting question is whether the unions, whatever the blow to their ranks and finances, will be substantially weaker.
Union leaders insist that they won't -- that the crisis posed by the case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, has brought more cohesion and energy to their ranks.
"No one wanted this case," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "But the gestalt around the country has been to turn an existential threat into an opportunity to engage with our members like never before."
There are reasons to believe that the claim is not merely desperate bravado.
One parallel to the current development is a 2014 Supreme Court ruling known as Harris v. Quinn, which struck down mandatory union fees for home-based workers who serve private individuals but are paid through government programs like Medicaid.
As of late 2013, the Service Employees International Union represented about 60,000 public-sector home care and child-care workers in Illinois, about 40 percent of whom were union members. (The rest paid agency fees.)
Receipts for the service employees union local representing home-based workers in Illinois dropped significantly in the four years after the decision. But an aggressive membership campaign largely offset the loss of members.
It also built and reinforced personal relationships with members, who could be summoned to make demands of politicians in nearly every legislative district.
"Our members go and meet Sam McCann," said Keith Kelleher, who until last year was president of the local representing these home-based workers, referring to a Republican state senator. "He says yes most of time because he's got hundreds of members in his district."
Public home-based workers in Illinois, a state with a notably anti-union Republican governor, continue to notch victories as a result. Last summer, home care workers won a 48-cent-an-hour wage increase from the state, up from an average wage of $13, in a budget that the legislature passed by overriding the governor's veto. This spring, home child-care workers won more than a 4 percent raise.
In anticipation of the Janus ruling, major public-sector unions have invested heavily in recent years in reaching out to current members -- an effort known as internal organizing -- and to prospective members to keep their numbers from dropping precipitously and to create a more activist culture. They plan to continue funding these initiatives even if it requires cutting spending elsewhere.
Mary Kay Henry, the international president of the service employees union, said the union used projections derived from its experience after the Harris decision to cut its budget by 30 percent shortly after Mr. Trump was elected. She said the union, which represents about two million workers, roughly half of them in the public sector, was focusing its spending on recruiting members and mobilizing workers to face down employers and elect pro-labor politicians.
"We intend to prioritize the political and organizing work," she said.
Government filings show that the union has cut contributions to organizations that it had traditionally supported, including the Children's Defense Fund, People for the American Way, and the National Immigration Law Center. (The union says it provides nonmonetary support to some of these groups.)
At the same time, the union is investing tens of millions of dollars in a door-to-door canvassing initiative for the midterm elections, intended to turn out people who don't normally vote.
Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said that his union's two highest priorities going forward would be its internal outreach and helping to organize nonunionized workplaces, and that the union would probably "have to make adjustments" to fund these programs. The union spent more than $15 million during the 2016 campaign cycle supporting political candidates, parties and committees.
Mr. Saunders said the union, which represents over 1.2 million workers, had held one-on-one conversations with nearly 900,000 members since 2013. Among the goals of these conversations, he said, is to inoculate members against campaigns by conservative groups to urge them to quit.
"If someone knocks on their door talking about how you can get out of the union -- 'it would be so easy, you don't have to pay union dues' -- our folks are prepared to tell them to get the hell off their doorstep," he said.
Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia University who studies corporate and conservative efforts to weaken labor, said organized interest groups had traditionally had the greatest impact on elections by educating members about candidates and through on-the-ground canvassing rather than large campaign contributions. "It's doubly so for unions," he said, adding that the focus "seems like a wise decision, but the effectiveness has to be weighed against what happens to membership and overall revenues."
The unions enjoy certain advantages. States like California and New Jersey have tried to ease the blow from Janus pre-emptively by passing legislation that, for example, guarantees public-sector unions access to new hires and their personal contact information to help in recruiting.
There is also a substantial wind at their back: a rising energy on the left during the Trump era. Workers in particular appear more willing to take to the streets and state capitols, including tens of thousands of teachers who walked off their jobs this year in conservative states to protest the underfunding of public education.
When the Supreme Court ruled last month that employment contracts could prohibit workers from bringing class-action lawsuits, activists in states like New York, Vermont and Oregon escalated their efforts to pass so-called private attorneys general legislation, allowing workers to bring cases on the state's behalf that could benefit all affected workers, the same way litigation by an attorney general would.
"We've had many, many folks calling: 'I heard about this legislation you helped design. How do we make this happen?"' said Deborah Axt, co-executive director of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group pushing the measure. Ms. Axt said the group planned to campaign for the legislation's enactment this summer.
That kind of energy appears to be benefiting unions. A Gallup poll last summer showed labor's approval at its highest level since 2003, and unions in West Virginia and several other states where teachers walked off the job this year report gains in members.
"We've seen a 13 percent jump in membership because of the walkout," said Ed Allen, president of the Oklahoma City American Federation of Teachers. "We have over 300 people signed up to work in political campaigns. We've never seen those kinds of numbers before."

Full text: Global stock markets on Wednesday shifted course again as investors chased mixed signals on global trade tensions, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index erased an early-morning jump to drop to its lowest closing level in nearly a month.
One of the day's few market certainties was oil's continued rise, and benchmark United States crude hit its highest price since 2014. That helped lift energy stocks, but other areas of the market zigged, zagged and zigged again as the day progressed.
Early on, Asian stocks slumped on concerns about the heated talk on trade between the United States and its partners. European stocks later flipped from losses to gains on hopes that a move by the Trump administration indicated a less combative stance with China. United States stocks opened higher, but the gains evaporated after a White House adviser said the move did not necessarily signal a softer stance.
By the end of the day, the S.&.P 500 fell 23.43 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,699.63 after being up as much as 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 165.52, or 0.7 percent, to 24,117.59; the Nasdaq composite gave up 116.54, or 1.5 percent, to 7,445.09; and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks fell 28.07, or 1.7 percent, to 1,640.45.
Stocks have swung in recent weeks, even by the hour, on worries about global trade. Investors were feeling less nervous about it in the morning after the Trump administration indicated it was shifting away from a plan to impose limits on Chinese investment in American technology companies and high-tech exports to China. Instead, the administration is calling on Congress to enhance an existing review process.
Markets took it as a positive sign, but the gains vanished in the afternoon after Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said told Fox Business that it should not necessarily be seen as a softer stance.
In another pressure point on the market, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates. More important, according to Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel, interest rates after accounting for inflation are set to cross important thresholds. That is putting pressure on stock prices, and he said the bull market that began in 2009 may end by the first quarter of 2020.
In the United States market, Conagra Brands had the biggest loss among stocks in the S.&P. 500 after it agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods, the company behind Duncan Hines and Hungry-Man, in a deal that would create a frozen-food giant. Conagra dropped $2.78, or 7.3 percent, to $35.45.
The market's strongest area was the energy sector. Crude jumped after a report showed that United States oil inventories dropped more sharply last week. Crude's rise helped drive energy stocks in the S.&P. 500 up 1.3 percent, more than double the gain for any of the other 10 sectors that make up the index.
Concho Resources, which looks for oil and gas in New Mexico and west Texas, jumped $6.09, or 4.6 percent, to $137.78 for the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. Benchmark United States crude rose $2.23 to settle at $72.76 per barrel. Brent crude, the global standard, rose $1.31 to $77.62 a barrel.
The dollar edged up to 110.25 Japanese yen from 110.11 yen Tuesday, and the euro fell to $1.1552 from $1.1642. Gold fell $3.80 to $1,252.80 per ounce.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 2.83 percent from 2.88 percent late Tuesday.

A Recession Signal Is Flashing Yellow

Full text: You can try to play down a trade war with China. You can brush off the impact of rising oil prices on corporate earnings.
But if you're in the business of making economic predictions, it has become very difficult to disregard an important signal from the bond market.
The so-called yield curve is perilously close to predicting a recession -- something it has done before with surprising accuracy -- and it's become a big topic on Wall Street.
Terms like "yield curve" can be mind-numbing if you're not a bond trader, but the mechanics, practical impact and psychology of it are fairly straightforward. Here's what the fuss is all about.
First, the mechanics.
The yield curve is basically the difference between interest rates on short-term United States government bonds, say, two-year Treasury notes, and long-term government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes.
Typically, when an economy seems in good health, the rate on the longer-term bonds will be higher than short-term ones. The extra interest is to compensate, in part, for the risk that strong economic growth could set off a broad rise in prices, known as inflation. Lately, though, long-term bond yields have been stubbornly slow to rise -- which suggests traders are concerned about long-term growth -- even as the economy shows plenty of vitality.
At the same time, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, so the yield curve has been "flattening." In other words, the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates is shrinking.
The gap between two-year and 10-year United States Treasury notes is roughly 0.34 percentage points. It was last at these levels in 2007 when the United States economy was heading into what was arguably the worst recession in almost 80 years.
As scary as references to the financial crisis sound, flattening alone does not mean that the United States is doomed to slip into another recession. But if it keeps moving in this direction, eventually long-term interest rates will fall below short-term rates.
When that happens, the yield curve has "inverted." An inversion is seen as "a powerful signal of recessions," as the president of the New York Fed, John Williams, said this year, and that's what everyone is watching for.
Every recession of the past 60 years has been preceded by an inverted yield curve, according to research from the San Francisco Fed. Curve inversions have "correctly signaled all nine recessions since 1955 and had only one false positive, in the mid-1960s, when an inversion was followed by an economic slowdown but not an official recession," the bank's researchers wrote in March.
Even if it hasn't happened yet, the move in that direction has Wall Street's attention.
"For economists, of course it's always been traditionally a very good signal of directionality of the economy," said Sonja Gibbs, senior director of capital markets at the Institute of International Finance. "That's why everyone is bemoaning the flattening of the yield curve."
Recession? Really?
Sure, it seems like a strange time to be worried about recession. Unemployment is at an 18-year low, corporate investment is picking up steam, and consumer spending shows signs of rebounding.
Some economists on Wall Street think the economy could be growing at around a nearly 5 percent annualized clip this quarter. But if the current economic vigor is only reflecting a short-term stimulus coming from the Trump administration's tax cut, then some kind of slowdown is to be expected.
"It's very hard to see what's going to goose the economy further from these levels," Ms. Gibbs said.
And the financial markets can sometimes sniff out problems with the economy before they show up in the official economic snapshots published on G.D.P. and unemployment. Another notable yield curve inversion occurred in February 2000, just before the stock market's dot-com bubble burst.
In that sense, the government bond market isn't alone. Stocks have been in a sideways struggle since the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index last peaked on Jan. 26. Returns on corporate bonds are negative, as are some key commodities tied to industrial activity.
An important caveat to the predictive power of the yield curve is that it can't predict precisely when a recession will begin. In the past the recession has come in as little as six months, or as long as two years, after the inversion, the San Francisco Fed's researchers note.
In other words, there's a reason to look at the yield curve skeptically, despite its prowess at predicting recessions.
The new fear gauge.
As in all market moves, perceptions of its significance mean the yield curve can sometimes become a feedback loop.
If enough investors begin to grow concerned about a recession, they will most likely put more and more money into the safety of long-term government bonds. That buying binge would likely help flatten, or invert, the yield curve.
Then people will write articles about the curve's sending a stronger signal on recession. And that could, in turn, drive even more people to buy into long-term bonds. Rinse. Repeat.
There's also a practical impact.

But it's not just psychology. The yield curve helps determine some of the decisions that are the most crucial to the health of the American economy.
Specifically, the flattening yield curve makes banking, which is basically the business of borrowing money at short-term rates and lending it at long-term rates, less profitable. And if the yield curve inverts, it means lending money becomes a losing proposition.
Either way, the flow of lending is likely to be curtailed. And in the United States, where borrowed money is the lifeblood of economic activity, that can slam the brakes on economic growth.
The Fed's hand.
There is an argument to be made against reading too much into the yield curve's moves -- and it hangs on the idea that, rather than the free market, central banks have had a big influence on both the long-term and short-term rates.
Since the last recession, central banks bought trillions of dollars of government bonds as they tried to push long-term interest rates lower in order to lend a helping hand to the economy.
Even though they're reversing course now, central banks still own massive amounts of those bonds, and that may be keeping long-term interest rates lower than they would otherwise be.
Also, the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term interest rates since December 2015 and has indicated it will keep doing so this year.
So if long-term rates were pushed lower by central bank bond buying, and now short-term rates are being pushed higher as the Fed tightens its monetary policy, the yield curve has nowhere to go but flatter.
"In the current environment, I think it's a less reliable indicator than it has been in the past," said Matthew Luzzetti, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank.

After His Win in Turkey, a Long and Daunting To-Do List Awaits Erdogan

Full text: ANKARA, Turkey -- With his victory in Sunday's elections, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has taken his place among the world's emerging class of strongman rulers, nailing down the sweeping powers he has insisted he needs to address Turkey's numerous challenges, at home and abroad.
Now, all he needs to do is deliver.
"He won on a knife-edge," said Ugur Gurses, a former banker who writes for the daily newspaper Hurriyet. "But now he has in his lap all the problems."
Mr. Erdogan is contending with an array of economic troubles, an increasingly disgruntled populace and deteriorating relations with Turkey's Western allies. Among the many problems Mr. Erdogan faces is one fundamental roadblock: His foreign policy is fighting with his economic needs.
His increasingly authoritarian, nationalist and anti-Western bent is alienating foreign investors, which is hurting the Turkish lira. As the currency plunges, domestic capital flees. And he is newly reliant on a nationalist party that enabled him to maintain his majority in Parliament but promises to reinforce all those tendencies, as well as his hard line against the Kurdish minority.
The lira briefly rose with the news of Mr. Erdogan's re-election, and his most senior economic adviser posted a message on Twitter on Sunday night: "This sets the stage for speeding up #reforms."
The economy is Mr. Erdogan's most pressing problem, but analysts express doubt that he will be able to perform the necessary surgery and introduce needed austerity measures with municipal elections looming in March 2019.
"Now the first challenge is the deterioration of the economy, and he has no means, no perspective to change the course of events," said Kadri Gursel, a columnist for the newspaper Cumhuriyet, who was imprisoned by Mr. Erdogan for 11 months.
Mr. Gursel said Mr. Erdogan offered no ideas during his campaign to explain how he would lift the economy, except more of the same. "He could not offer a vision for the future," Mr. Gursel said. "All he could offer was infrastructure projects and a bad representation of the past."
After years of strong growth, the economy is languishing in recession, economists say, with rising foreign debt levels, double-digit inflation, the sagging lira and paltry levels of foreign investment, compared with past years. An increasing government role in the economy has led to charges of cronyism and corruption, with critics complaining of insiders becoming fabulously wealthy on government contracts and sweetheart deals.
Many economists also blame the dismal economic performance on Mr. Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule, following a failed coup attempt two years ago.
In the aftermath, he declared a state of emergency and began a widespread crackdown against his political opponents, confiscating businesses in the process and prompting many wealthy Turks to shift their companies and capital out of the country. And he spooked foreign investors with his anti-Western belligerence and meddling with the central bank to keep interest rates artificially low.
As the election results underscored, Mr. Erdogan still maintains the strong backing of the newly prosperous Islamists who were long marginalized under the secular republic founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk; people who, like Mr. Erdogan, as the historian Soner Cagaptay has written, were "born on the wrong side of the tracks."
The transfer of power and wealth to those newcomers over the past 15 years represents a transfer of capital that is permanently changing Turkey, said Bekir Agirdir, director of the polling firm Konda.
"The government subsidizes them and they come up and become so successful," Mr. Agirdir said of the newcomers. "It is social and political engineering."
And while ordinary Turkish citizens are hurting financially, they evidently still trust Mr. Erdogan. Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States said in an interview, "There is this worry that, 'What would happen if Erdogan goes?' "
"The economy is suffering, there is an issue of performance in some areas, but those were not reflected in the vote," he added.
Economists say Mr. Erdogan needs to cut public spending, including expensive subsidies for gasoline and electricity. Turkey borrowed heavily in recent years on international markets, and now faces a bill of $250 billion a year to finance the debt and the country's current account, which is also deteriorating. This could force it to seek help from the International Monetary Fund.
But few say they think he will take the necessary measures. "Erdogan must do a surgical operation on the economy," Mr. Gurses, the Hurriyet correspondent, said. "I don't think he will be able to do it since municipal elections are coming in March 2019, but Turkey cannot sustain the situation any longer."
"The Turkish economy cannot stay on hold," he added.
In light of the growing economic gloom, it would seemingly behoove Mr. Erdogan to moderate his foreign policy, dialing back the anti-Western policies and language. But he comes across as a prideful man and seems reluctant to back down, especially now that he is relying to some extent on the Nationalist Movement Party, or M.H.P., which preserved Mr. Erdogan's majority in the Parliament.
The leader of that party, Devlet Bahceli, has made it clear that he will demand concessions for his support, and that he will push an agenda that is anti-Syrian, anti-Kurd and anti-Western, at least rhetorically. He has indicated he would not agree to Mr. Erdogan reaching out to any of the opposition parties after the election.
According to a post on Twitter by Mr. Unluhisarcikli, the Marshall Fund director, "The weight of M.H.P. not only on domestic but also foreign policy will likely increase in the upcoming period, which is not a good sign for Turkey trans-Atlantic relations."
Mr. Bahceli's party is strongly opposed to the presence of over three million Syrian refugees in Turkey, and Mr. Bahceli has said he will push for policies to make them return home. Mr. Bahceli has also supported further operations against Kurdish militants inside Turkey and in neighboring Iraq and Syria.
On that issue, Mr. Erdogan promised in his victory speech that he would act decisively against terrorist organizations and work toward liberating more Syrian land from Kurdish militants so that Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home.
That is likely to lead to more demands from Turkey for the United States to end its cooperation with Kurdish militias in Syria that it has been using in the fight against the Islamic State.
And it bodes ill for the Kurdish minority in Turkey. Even as the pro-Kurdish People's Democratic Party won representation in the Parliament, crossing the 10 percent threshold, nine party members from the last Parliament remain in jail along with dozens of local political officials and student activists.
For now, Turkey's Western allies seem prepared to give Mr. Erdogan the benefit of the doubt. Going into the NATO summit next month, "at least there will be clarity about the political situation in Turkey," said Amanda Sloat, who dealt with the country for the State Department during the Obama administration.
Mr. Erdogan's warming relations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia remain a potential point of contention, particularly the negotiations with Russia over the S-400 air defense system, problematic for a NATO member.
But the Trump administration will not regard the sale as complete until it "physically takes place," Ms. Sloat said, and the Turks emphasize that they are also negotiating with an Italian-French military consortium.
The NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has already congratulated Mr. Erdogan on his victory, and Ms. Sloat said she expected Washington quickly to follow suit.
Mr. Erdogan's drift toward authoritarianism so strained relations with Europe that he was not welcomed in any European country to campaign among Turkish expatriates, except in Bosnia. And the process for Turkey to become a member of the European Union is at a standstill.
Nevertheless, Sweden's foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, said that while the state of Turkey's democracy had to improve, Mr. Erdogan should be given the chance to do that. At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday, she also said that the issues with Turkey's large Kurdish minority and the country's economic development were "huge challenges."
Analysts held out the meager hope that despite an unfair campaign, Turks did vote freely and enthusiastically on Sunday. "With a turnout of more than 90 percent, and the very high mobilization of the opposition, Turkish society still holds its dynamism," Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. "It gives hope for the future."

Full text: HICKSVILLE, Ohio -- For Anthony Nighswander, rock-bottom unemployment is both a headache and an opportunity. For businesses and workers, it could be the key to reversing one of the country's most vexing economic problems: slow productivity growth.
Mr. Nighswander is president of APT Manufacturing Solutions, which builds and installs robotic equipment to help other manufacturers automate their assembly lines. Lately, business has been booming: With the unemployment rate now below 4 percent, he says he gets calls every day from companies looking for robots to help ease their labor crunch.
The problem is that Mr. Nighswander faces a hiring challenge in his own business, especially because, in this town of fewer than 4,000 people near the Indiana border, the pool of skilled workers is shallow. But rather than turn to robots himself, he has adopted a lower-tech solution: training. APT has begun offering apprenticeships, covering the cost of college for its workers, and three years ago it started teaching manufacturing skills to high school students.
"I never thought that I would be training high school students in our facilities," Mr. Nighswander said. "What I knew was that I was in survival mode. I knew the orders for robots and for automation were coming in faster than I could get the jobs out."
That kind of urgency could prove to be a powerful economic force. The investments in training and automation by Mr. Nighswander and his customers should, over time, make their companies more productive. Multiplied across thousands of companies, those decisions could have benefits for companies and workers that endure even after today's hot economy inevitably cools.
Productivity -- how much value the economy generates in an average hour of work -- gets less public attention than more intuitive economic concepts such as employment and wages, but it may be even more fundamental.
Rising productivity -- whether through better technology, more educated workers or smarter business strategies -- is why people's economic fortunes, on average, improve over time. When productivity growth is strong, companies can afford to pay workers more without eating into their own profit margins, letting a rising tide lift all boats.
Since the end of the Great Recession, however -- and, to a lesser extent, even during the stronger economic times that preceded it -- productivity growth has been confoundingly weak, forcing business owners and workers to compete over a relatively meager sliver of economic growth. There have been peaks and valleys, but not since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s has the American economy consistently delivered productivity growth above 2 percent a year.
Now some economists think a rebound could be on the way. For most of the recovery, wage growth has been anemic, suggesting companies faced relatively little pressure to invest in automation or to find other ways to squeeze more production out of workers. But as the labor market tightens, companies' incentives could be changing.
"You could meet demand for a while by hiring workers, but with the unemployment rate at 3.8 percent, eventually you're going to run out of easy-to-find workers," said John G. Fernald, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and an expert on productivity. "Because workers have other opportunities, you end up having to pay them. And once you see wages going up, you say, 'We have to become more productive to cover our costs."'
That cycle could already be underway. Wage growth has crept up over the past two years. One measure preferred by many economists, the Employment Cost Index, posted its strongest year-over-year growth since the recession in the first three months of the year. And there are other indications that companies are struggling to find workers. Applications for disability insurance, for example, have begun to fall, a sign that companies may be more willing to look outside the standard labor pool to find employees. And while productivity has yet to rebound, corporate investment -- historically a prelude to productivity growth -- has been rising.
David Maletto, who runs a small packaging company in Eau Claire, Wis., said it had become increasingly difficult to find workers with the local unemployment rate below 3 percent. The company, which specializes in putting together variety packs of beers for Miller and other brewers, has had a particularly hard time holding on to unskilled laborers, who pack bottles into boxes and load them onto pallets. Turnover at those positions is constant, Mr. Maletto said, and the workers he finds to fill vacancies are often unreliable, showing up late, playing on their phones while on the clock or sometimes not showing up at all.
"We have customers continually coming to us and they're needing packaging done, and we'll have to say, 'We can't do that for you,"' Mr. Maletto said. "There were days when we might have to shut a line down."
Mr. Maletto tried raising pay, first by 25 percent and then by an additional 20 percent. He now offers up to $12 an hour for unskilled jobs and has tried offering signing bonuses. But workers can earn as much as $5 an hour more elsewhere, a wage Mr. Maletto says he can't afford, in part because multiyear contracts with some customers make it hard for him to raise prices.
So Mr. Maletto is turning to automation. Late last year, he installed a machine that loads filled boxes onto pallets; more sophisticated robots from APT, Mr. Nighswander's firm, are set to arrive in August. Mr. Maletto took out a $1 million loan to pay for the equipment, a big gamble for a family-owned company. But with the labor pool shrinking, he said he had little doubt it was the right decision.
"If we don't get things automated and we don't start moving things forward, we're going to be the ones who get left behind," Mr. Maletto said.
Decisions like Mr. Maletto's aren't the way economists have historically thought about productivity growth. In traditional economic models, productivity is determined by technological advances and business innovations that aren't tied to the ebb and flow of recessions and recoveries. The economic boom of the 1920s, according to the standard narrative, was enabled in part by the spread of electric power. A similar pattern played out in the 1990s with the rise of personal computers. In both cases, technology paved the way for productivity, which in turn led to higher pay and faster growth.
But in recent years, some economists have begun to wonder if the conventional models might get the relationship backward. Perhaps periods of strong economic growth are what put pressure on companies to innovate, or at least to figure out how to use new technologies to make themselves more efficient. Maybe it isn't a coincidence, in other words, that the last period of strong productivity growth also coincided with the last time the unemployment rate fell below 4 percent.
Gavin Wright, an economic historian at Stanford University who has studied the 1990s, argued that advances in information technology predated that productivity surge by a decade or more. What changed in the 1990s, he said, is that the labor market tightened.
"Right around the middle of that decade, you did start to get rising real wages for the first time in quite a long time," Mr. Wright said. "Employers will be driven to, or be more likely to, think about ways to economize if the labor's more expensive."
If Mr. Wright is correct, it could have significant implications for economic policy. If productivity growth is essentially fixed in the short term, as traditional models assume, then rising wages will most likely lead to faster inflation, as companies pass on higher costs to customers. That would most likely force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively to prevent the economy from overheating.
But if companies instead respond to the tight labor market by taking steps to increase productivity, then wages could rise without causing inflation. Under that approach, raising rates too quickly could be a costly mistake for the Fed, snuffing out the recovery before companies can make productivity-enhancing investments. That would be a particularly costly mistake because those investments carry long-term benefits -- robots installed during a boom can keep running even when the economy slows.
"The cost of running policy too tight is not just what we don't produce this year, it's all the lost production and lost income for many years ahead," said J. W. Mason, an economist for the Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank.
Not all economists are convinced that the tight labor market will lead to a productivity surge. Mr. Fernald, the San Francisco Fed economist, said that the low unemployment rate should stimulate investment, but that a more meaningful acceleration in productivity growth would require innovation. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, in a speech this month discussed the possibility that the strong economy could spur productivity growth but called the evidence for such an idea "sparse and inconclusive."
For now, the Fed appears to be sticking with the standard approach of gradually raising rates to ward off inflation. But the United States may be about to run an experiment on the effects of a high-pressure economy whether Mr. Powell wants to or not. The combination of tax cuts and government spending increases is adding fuel to an economy already burning hot. The Fed's most recent projections estimate that the unemployment rate will fall to 3.5 percent next year.
If that happens, the beneficiaries could be people like Mike Steffel. Mr. Steffel, 39, grew up near here and never went to college, instead finding work in various low-paying factory jobs. In one position at a local manufacturer, he found himself drawn to the work done by skilled toolmakers.
"I saw what the journeymen were doing there, and I thought that was something that I'd like to be doing as a career," Mr. Steffel said. "You have this raw stock of steel that's just sitting there, and making it into something useful, I like the thought of that."
Eventually, Mr. Steffel saw an ad from APT saying it was hiring and would pay for classes at the local community college. Mr. Steffel works at APT as an apprentice during the two-year certificate program, and is committed to staying a year after it ends. In return, he gets training as a toolmaker, a skill that could ultimately earn him more than $70,000 a year with overtime. And the skills he is gaining are less easily replaced by robots.
"This is the career that I have chosen," Mr. Steffel said. "I'm not going to get rich off it, but hopefully in the end I'll do well."
For Mr. Nighswander, training people like Mr. Steffel is an investment. For years, he said, he complained that the people graduating from local high schools and colleges didn't have the skills needed. But eventually he realized that he had to tackle the problem himself.
In 2015, APT opened a training center inside its 75,000-square-foot headquarters. Every afternoon during the school year, eight to 10 students from the local high school spend two hours taking hands-on classes in electrical engineering, machining, practical math and other subjects. The students earn school credit, and many also work at APT after hours.
Mr. Nighswander acknowledged that many trainees would never work at APT after graduation. Some may even work for his competitors. But when skilled labor is scarce, he said, companies have to start taking matters into their own hands.
"There's a whole bunch of gearheads out there, and there always have been, and they're smart," Mr. Nighswander said. "If manufacturers are not willing to invest in education, then the only thing they can do is steal an employee from another employer."

Full text: Against a backdrop of widespread repression and a weakened economy, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was re-elected on Sunday, while his alliance won a majority in parliament.
Formerly prime minister, Mr. Erdogan was elected president in 2014 and, after a failed coup in 2016, persuaded voters to change the Constitution to transform the once-ceremonial job into a position with executive control of the government. Sunday's election signaled a new era for Turkey, a pivotal country straddling Europe and the Middle East.
Here is where Turkey stands the day after the election.
Mr. Erdogan's grip on executive power is now official
In theory, Mr. Erdogan's re-election as president gives him sweeping powers that he has never wielded before. Because of changes to the Turkish constitution made last year, the president -- not the prime minister -- will now be the formal head of the Turkish government. Mr. Erdogan can now appoint ministers himself, issue decrees, make crucial appointments in the judiciary, and authorize investigations of individual civil servants.
In practice, however, the nature of Mr. Erdogan's role will change little, since he already informally exerted far more power than his position had technically allowed, said Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey specialist at St. Lawrence University.
For instance, Mr. Erdogan has led cabinet meetings since 2015, even though that is usually the prerogative of the prime minister. And few judges have dared to issue judgments unfavorable to Mr. Erdogan, particularly since the start of a purge of the judiciary that has led to the dismissal of around a quarter of all judges since 2016.
"I don't see this as revolutionary," said Mr. Eissenstat. "It codifies and solidifies something that's been underway for a decade."
Voting is free -- but the election was not fair
With more than 86 percent of Turks participating, the vote was considered free. But international observers said it took place in circumstances that had clearly favored Mr. Erdogan.
His control of state media and his influence over most private outlets gave him "a notable advantage," according to election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Most opposition candidates were afforded just a few minutes of coverage by state broadcasters, compared to hundreds of hours for Mr. Erdogan.
One of Mr. Erdogan's leading challengers, Selahattin Demirtas, was forced to conduct his campaign from prison because he had been jailed on politicized charges nearly two years ago, along with several of his lawmakers.
And since the election took place under a state of emergency, severe restrictions impinged on the opposition's ability to hold rallies and protests.
With more than 100,000 alleged dissidents arrested in the past two years, and a similar number dismissed or suspended from their state jobs, the campaign took place in what Amnesty International described as "a climate of fear" amid a crackdown following the failed military coup of 2016.
Turkey's economy may weaken further
Mr. Erdogan's recent economic interventions helped to cause a loss in the lira's value -- and the currency problem could worsen now that he has been returned to office.
For most of his time in power, Mr. Erdogan had a reputation for strong economic management, partly because of spectacular economic growth under his watch during the 2000s.
But his economic reputation weakened in May, when Mr. Erdogan threatened to take greater control of Turkey's central bank if he won re-election, a move that frightened investors, and caused the lira to plummet, and the price of food to rise.
Since voters failed to punish him for his intervention, Mr. Erdogan may now feel emboldened to follow through on his promise -- which would be "a disaster for the lira, inflation and those invested in debt," said Emre Deliveli, a financial consultant and former columnist for the English-language Hurriyet Daily News. "We are going to have a huge economic crisis one way or another."
Turkey may move even closer to Russia
Mr. Erdogan's victory is problematic for Turkey's allies in Europe and the United States.
When he first came to power in 2003, Mr. Erdogan brought Turkey closer to Europe -- by accelerating membership negotiations with the European Union -- and sought a historic settlement with the country's Kurdish minority. But to maintain the support of nationalist voters in recent years, he has increasingly picked fights with European politicians, led a campaign of repression in Kurdish areas, and -- to the frustration of the United States, drawn increasingly close to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
These dynamics are likely to be compounded by the election result, said Marc Pierini, a former European Union ambassador to Turkey.
Mr. Erdogan's victory was partly the outcome of his alliance with a far-right party, the Nationalist Movement Party, with anti-Western and anti-Kurdish views Mr. Erdogan must continue to accommodate.
"All of this plays into the hands of Putin," said Mr. Pierini, now a fellow at Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based research group.
Mr. Erdogan's victory is also bad news for the American-backed Syrian Kurdish forces that have carved out an independent enclave in northern Syria, along Turkey's southern border, which Mr. Erdogan regards as a threat to Turkish security. Emboldened by his victory, Mr. Erdogan may see no reason to abandon his strategy of chasing the Syrian Kurds away from key areas of northern Syria, said Mr. Pierini.
The opposition is stuck between a rock and a hard place
The unusually spirited performance of the opposition in such tough circumstances either bodes well for them in the future -- or highlights the futility of running against Mr. Erdogan in such biased circumstances.
Muharrem Ince, Mr. Erdogan's closest rival in the presidential race, won plaudits for engaging in an inclusive and feisty campaign -- and may now have enough momentum to start a new movement, said Halil Karaveli, a Turkey analyst and author of the book "Why Turkey is Authoritarian."
"Turkey is heavily polarized, but he is interested in reaching out the Kurds and the religious conservatives," Mr. Karaveli said. "If he plays his cards well he is the man for the future."
But other analysts were more pessimistic, and questioned whether the opposition should continue to legitimize a rigged system by taking part in elections.
"If basic civil liberties and basic rules of law are not being respected, they should not contribute to the illusion that Turkey is a real democracy," said Mr. Eisensstat. "It's time for them to consider whether they want to continue to facilitate the status quo in the hopes that at some point new realities emerge -- or call attention to the way that those democratic norms have been hollowed out."

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Dino-mite? Not quite. But "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom" arrived to a still-huge $150 million in ticket sales at domestic theaters over the weekend.
"Fallen Kingdom," which cost Universal Pictures at least $300 million to make and market worldwide, had the impossible task of living up to its franchise predecessor, "Jurassic World," which arrived to almost $225 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in 2015, after adjusting for inflation. "Jurassic World," which benefited from pent-up demand and generally positive reviews, went on to collect roughly $1.8 billion worldwide.
"Fallen Kingdom," which received mixed-to-negative reviews, is holding its own, however. It received an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. ("Jurassic World" got an A.) And "Fallen Kingdom" has already taken in about $561.5 million overseas, where it has been playing for weeks, in part because Universal wanted to get ahead of World Cup fever. Ticket sales in China for "Fallen Kingdom" have been particularly strong.
Produced by Universal and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment -- Mr. Spielberg introduced the five-film "Jurassic Park" series 25 years ago this month -- "Fallen Kingdom" was directed by J. A. Bayona ("A Monster Calls") and stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt.
Despite some high-profile misfires, including the recent "Solo: A Star Wars Story," the North American box office has bounced back from an alarming downturn last summer. For the year so far, ticket sales in the United States and Canada stand at $5.9 billion, an 8.5 percent increase from the same period last year, according to comScore. Still to come this summer are expected hits like "Skyscraper," "The First Purge" and "Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again!" -- all from Universal.
Second place for the weekend went to "Incredibles 2" (Disney), which collected a stout $80.9 million, for a two-week domestic total of $350.3 million, according to comScore.
The star-studded "Ocean's 8" (Warner Bros.) showed ongoing strength in third place, taking in an estimated $11.7 million, for a three-week domestic total of $100.4 million.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: ACTOPAN, Mexico -- In this arid farming town in central Mexico, a crowd packed the plaza under a punishing sun to hear the leftist presidential hopeful Andrés Manuel López Obrador promise to end the corruption that plagues the nation.
"They have even said that corruption is part of Mexican culture," he said to a chorus of supportive shouts. "That is a falsehood. A big lie. In our people, there is a great reserve of values, cultural, moral, spiritual, in the families, in the pueblos, in the communities." He pointed upward. "The problem is above. The rulers always set a bad example."
Mr. López Obrador went on to promise cuts in government expenditures, including a reduction in the president's salary and the selling of the executive air fleet. He said he would redirect money to the poor through pensions, scholarships, apprenticeships and free fertilizer for small farmers, a vow greeted with raucous cheers.
His message -- that he will overturn what he calls "the mafia of power" and replace it with an austere bureaucracy that invests in communities -- is proving appealing as the July 1 election nears. According to the Bloomberg Poll tracker, Mr. López Obrador has the support of over 50 percent of voters, twice that of his rival Ricardo Anaya, of the center-right National Action Party. If these numbers translate to votes, it will give Mr. López Obrador, 64, the most decisive victory in a Mexican presidential election since 1982.
The colossal lead comes as a surprise, considering that in his previous two bids for president, in 2006 and 2012, Mr. López Obrador won no more than 35 percent of the vote. His message has changed little over the years -- some of the phrases I hear at his rallies are almost identical to ones that I wrote down when I covered his speeches 12 years ago. What has changed are his expressions: He looks happier, more relaxed, less angry.
Back in the 2000s, leftist politicians were sweeping Latin America. Now, conservative-leaning leaders have made a comeback in countries like Argentina and Peru. Mr. López Obrador appears to be bucking the trend.
So why is he finally surging? The main reason is that confidence in Mexico's established parties has nosedived in the last five years amid rising prices and brutal crime alongside horrendous corruption scandals. In this environment, his message resonates louder. For many who are struggling, his words promise hope.
"We are tired of the same people in power, the same dinosaurs -- we want them out," José Sampedro, a 52-year-old builder, said at the Actopan rally. "We want it so Mexican citizens don't have to go to the United States to work, so they don't have to be mistreated" by the Trump administration's policies. Mr. Sampedro, like many in this area, has traveled north for work -- in his case, construction jobs in Florida.
Anger against the Mexican establishment is especially focused on the ideologically nebulous Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the P.R.I., which ran the country for most of the 20th century and is the party of the current president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The P.R.I. has been plagued by dishonesty, with a handful of its former state governors facing criminal charges. In the highest-profile case, the former governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte, is in jail, accused of skimming up to $3 billion of public money. In the meantime, Mr. Peña Nieto was himself caught in a conflict-of-interest scandal when journalists discovered his wife in a $7 million mansion provided by a company with government contracts.
Mr. Peña Nieto oversaw a series of reforms aimed at modernizing the economy, including opening up the oil industry to private foreign investment. But while these moves were hailed by investors, they produced only minor short-term growth in a time of soaring prices; inflation was officially 6.8 percent last year, with the cost of fruit and vegetables rising 18.6 percent. Mr. Peña Nieto's approval rating plummeted and the P.R.I.'s presidential candidate is languishing in third place, polling at 21 percent.
In these circumstances, promises of more government help for the poor are applauded. A huge chunk of P.R.I. voters -- especially in poorer states like Hidalgo, where this town is situated -- appear to have migrated directly to Mr. López Obrador. They are the biggest bloc of voters pushing him into the lead.
Mr. López Obrador has also made inroads in wealthier northern states, where the center-right National Action Party, known as the P.A.N., has historically been strong. A likely reason is that former President Felipe Calderón, of the P.A.N., waged a military crackdown on drug cartels during his tenure, from 2006 to 2012, which led to an explosion of violence in the north. The bloodshed has continued under Mr. Peña Nieto, with 2017 being Mexico's most homicidal year in decades.
Mr. López Obrador blames both parties for the violence, and has pledged that he will bring peace to Mexico, even floating the idea of an amnesty for some criminals and inviting the pope to oversee a reconciliation process. His rivals denounce these proposals, but many here find it hard to see how violence could get any worse and are open to new ideas.
The rise of President Trump could also be helping Mr. López Obrador, convincing people that a stronger, more nationalist figure could better defend their interests against threats from the north. But this is probably a minor factor; most people I talk to at rallies are far angrier with their own rulers than those over the river in the United States.
Critics retort that Mr. López Obrador is himself a member of the establishment he rails against. He began his career in the P.R.I. in the 1970s, then left to help found the Democratic Revolution Party in 1989; he founded his new party, National Regeneration Movement, or Morena, in 2014. When he was mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005, his minister of finance was caught on camera as a regular in a Las Vegas casino and subsequently imprisoned for embezzlement and money laundering. Many P.R.I. and P.A.N. politicians are switching to Morena as it surges in the polls.
But while Mr. López Obrador may indeed be another career politician, his style and discourse contrasts with those who have governed this nation the last few decades. This is enough of a signal of change to attract the votes of millions of people who are struggling to provide for their families, to escape violent gangs, or to recover from being deported from the United States. Time will tell if it is enough to really solve Mexico's fundamental problems.

Economic Surge Gives President More Firepower in Trade Battle

Full text: The American economy has picked up speed and is now on course to expand this year at the fastest rate in more than a decade. That acceleration gives President Trump a stronger hand as he contemplates more tariffs and takes an increasingly confrontational approach with China, Canada, Mexico and other trading partners.
Economists have raised their growth estimates for the second quarter to an annualized rate of nearly 5 percent, more than double the pace of the previous period. Some economists say the figure could hit 3 percent for the full year, a level last reached in 2005.
As growth slows in Europe, China, Japan and elsewhere, the United States finds itself at the top of the global economy. The United States is also less exposed to the fallout from an escalating trade war since it does not rely on exports as much as other countries. It all gives Mr. Trump leverage with world leaders, potentially forcing them to make concessions.
But his threats could also backfire. Economists warn that the president's clout is limited and that his attacks on the trading system could dampen the outlook not just in other countries but also domestically.
"If you have the strongest economy in years, then the trade shock appears manageable," said Gregory Daco, head of United States economics at Oxford Economics. "However, with growth peaking, the trade shock will become more intense. With a global backdrop that is not improving anymore, we have to be careful about the back half of 2018 and 2019."
In July, the recovery will reach the nine-year mark, making it one of the longest in modern history. But for much of that time, the engines of the economy were rarely synchronized. When consumers were spending at a healthy clip in 2015 and 2016, business investment lagged as energy companies scaled back or abandoned projects in response to a sharp drop in oil prices.
All that has changed in recent months. Now, the different parts of the economy appear to be operating as one well-oiled machine. Consumer spending rebounded after a soft start to the year, with retail sales in May rising by a robust 0.8 percent, double what analysts had forecast.
"We have a very strong economy, and if the trade negotiations are successful, it'll be even stronger," said Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. He added that the president was "impatient to fix broken policies," with trade at the top of the list after last year's tax overhaul and deregulation effort.
The trade deficit, often cited by the White House as a vulnerability, narrowed in April, further bolstering economic activity in the second quarter. Strong April orders for fabricated metal, computers and other goods used in production also helped, as did a buildup in inventory as businesses restocked shelves. Such additions to inventory barely had an impact on growth in the first three months of the year, but could contribute nearly a full percentage point in the second quarter.
Increased government spending is providing added propulsion. The two-year budget deal reached in Congress in February added $300 billion in new government spending that is starting to flow into the economy. "It's something of a sugar high, but it feels good," said Diane Swonk, an economist with Grant Thornton in Chicago.
Taken together, these factors have compelled economists to re-evaluate the economy's tempo. At the beginning of May, Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm based in St. Louis, estimated growth of 3 percent in the second quarter. By mid-June, it was putting the figure at 4.5 percent. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow model is even more upbeat at 4.7 percent.
But the good news may not last. While Ms. Swonk expects a 3 percent expansion for the full year, she added, "This likely will be the peak growth for this cycle."
Contributing to that view is the rise in interest rates as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws the easy credit that persisted for much of the recovery. "The headwinds are mounting," Ms. Swonk said.
And then there are fears of an expanding trade war. Tariffs could hurt the American economy by stoking inflation without increasing wages.
Trade wars won't sharply curtail economic activity, unless they cause businesses to lose confidence, said Spencer Dale, chief economist for BP, the energy giant. The bigger problem, he said, is that trade wars could "eat away at trend growth" by reducing G.D.P. by a fraction of a percent a year. That might not seem meaningful in any given year, but compounded over a decade or two, it could leave the economy noticeably short of what it might otherwise have achieved.
The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has also noted those risks. "Changes in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook," he said on Wednesday at a European Central Bank conference in Portugal.
Still, the United States remains more insulated from a trade shock than other countries. Exports account for just 12 percent of American gross domestic product. That's the lowest share among the 35 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized countries. By contrast, the figure is 31 percent in Canada, 37 percent in Mexico and 44 percent in the European Union.
In the United States, consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of G.D.P. And recent surveys and other data show that people are bullish about the economy's trajectory, according to Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics. Owners of small businesses are also confident -- about their own prospects and about the overall economy.
When Mr. Shepherdson put out a note to clients on May 14 highlighting the possibility of 5 percent growth in the quarter, he was quick to add that his forecast looked outlandish. "I was being tongue in cheek, looking at what would happen if everything goes right," he said. "But it's become more like the base case."
Despite the improving consensus, Mr. Shepherdson said the quarter's pace "is not sustainable," but he does expect consumer spending to be solid in the second half of the year.
Sean McCartney, an executive vice president at Radial, a fulfillment and logistics business, agrees, and he's putting his money to work. Radial will hire about 24,000 temporary workers later this year for the company's fulfillment centers, call centers and warehouses to prepare for back-to-school demand and the holiday shopping season. That's up by roughly 1,000 from last year.
"This year is shaping up to be strong, the strongest since the recovery began," Mr. McCartney said. E-commerce companies represent most of Radial's business, and the company has expanded its footprint to ensure faster deliveries.
Many of its operations are in the middle of the country, in states like Ohio and Kentucky, with plentiful transportation links enabling them to reach both coasts.
To attract new workers and keep existing ones, Radial has been offering spot raises of $1 an hour for temporary positions in some cities, on top of the typical $12-an-hour average for Radial's network of sites.
"We have hundreds of open positions," Mr. McCartney said. "We definitely could hire more than we have."

Full text: Wither Pixar? Not on Elastigirl's watch.
"Incredibles 2" arrived to a jaw-dropping $180 million in ticket sales at North American theaters over the weekend -- roughly 30 percent more than box-office analysts had predicted early last week -- giving Pixar a confidence boost following the forced departure of its creative chief, John Lasseter, earlier this month. "Incredibles 2" received an A-plus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls.
The opening total set a box-office record for an animated release. The touting of sales records by movie studios is usually meaningless spin; they don't take inflation into account. But not in this case: Even after accounting for higher ticket prices, "Incredibles 2" beat Hollywood's previous record-holder, "Shrek the Third" (DreamWorks Animation), which collected an adjusted $151 million in 2007, according to comScore data.
The thundering turnout for "Incredibles 2" reflected pent-up demand. The film returns the superheroic Mr. Incredible and his quick-thinking wife, Elastigirl, to big screens after a 14-year hiatus -- this time with her in the forefront. Animated movies have also been in short supply, in part because of an ongoing retrenchment at DreamWorks, which was sold to NBCUniversal in 2016. The last animated blockbuster was Pixar's "Coco," which arrived in November and took in $807 million worldwide.
"Incredibles 2," which cost Pixar's corporate parent, the Walt Disney Company, at least $300 million to make and market worldwide, played more like a broad action film than a PG-rated cartoon. About 25 percent of the audience was over the age of 35, according to Disney, which is planning more "Incredibles" installments as part of an ongoing franchise.
"The 'Avengers' crowd went to see this movie -- it wasn't just 7-year-old kids," Greg Foster, the filmed entertainment chief of Imax, the large-format theater chain, said by telephone on Sunday morning. Mr. Foster said that "Incredibles 2" sold about $14.1 million in tickets at Imax theaters in the United States and Canada over the weekend, setting an all-time Imax animation record.
Mr. Foster credited the movie's writer-director, Brad Bird, for delivering a sequel that received a rapturous response from critics and positive word of mouth on social media. Mr. Foster also noted that the "Incredibles" characters are now favorites for multiple generations: People who saw the original film as children are now parents.
The original "Incredibles," also directed and written by Mr. Bird, arrived in 2004 to about $96 million in today's dollars and generated $860 million total. It won the 2005 Oscar for best animated feature.
Disney needed "Incredibles 2" to succeed. Although it has dominated the box office in recent years, Disney suffered a major setback last month, when its expensive "Solo: A Star Wars Story" crashed and burned. After four weeks of release, "Solo" has taken in about $193 million -- not chump change, but the equivalent of a bomb by "Star Wars" standards.
Then Disney announced on June 8 that Mr. Lasseter would not return from a "sabbatical" that started in October, when he stepped down citing unspecified "missteps" that made some staffers feel "disrespected or uncomfortable." Mr. Lasseter co-founded Pixar and has been the creative force behind the billion-dollar "Toy Story," "Cars" and "Frozen" franchises.
"Incredibles 2" had little competition at the domestic box office over the weekend. (It collected a promising $51.5 million in limited release overseas, according to comScore.) Second place went to "Ocean's 8" (Warner), which collected about $20 million, for a two-week total in North America of $79.2 million. Warner also had the third-place film, "Tag," which arrived to $14.6 million in estimated ticket sales.
An R-rated comedy with an ensemble cast, "Tag" cost about $28 million to make and at least $30 million to market. Warner hopes the film will perform like "Game Night," which arrived to a muted $17 million in February but quietly generated nearly $70 million over its run. Like that movie, "Tag" received a B-plus CinemaScore.
Also of box-office note: Another superhero, at least to octogenarians and the political left, has breathed life into the documentary marketplace: "RBG," a Participant Media and Magnolia Pictures film about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, crossed the $10 million mark, one of the best results for a film of its kind in years. Participant supported "RBG" with an aggressive effort to tie the filmabout the Supreme Court justice to social issues including gender parity, ultimately engaging more than 400 organizations.
"RBG" is the first of two films about Justice Ginsburg that Participant has planned for this year. The second, a biographical drama called "On the Basis of Sex," will arrive via Focus Features in November. It stars Felicity Jones.

Wall Street Is Taking Trade Jitters In Stride

Full text: At a conference held by a top investment bank in Manhattan last week, attendees were asked to submit what they thought was the biggest risk to the global economy. When their concerns showed up on the conference screen, these words were the most popular: Trump, trade war and protectionism.
Outside, meanwhile, the stock market was having another up day.
In recent weeks, against the expectations of many on Wall Street, investors have not run for the exits as President Trump has stepped up trade brawls with China, Canada and the European Union. On Friday, when the Trump administration and China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on $50 billion of goods from each country, the Standard & Poor's 500 index finished barely lower. The index has gained 2 percent since the end of February, when Mr. Trump began to take action on trade in earnest, and it remains up 30 percent since his election in November 2016.
Why have the markets held up when the prospect of a trade war unnerves many on Wall Street? The United States economy appears to be a picture of health and corporate earnings are surging. That seems to have investors betting that the collateral damage will be manageable.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta predicted that the United States economy could grow at 4.8 percent rate in the second quarter, which would be the second-highest quarterly growth rate in the past decade. Unemployment is at multiyear lows, retail sales are strong, consumer confidence is high and the inflation rate remains relatively subdued. This strong run could continue if tax cuts for businesses and consumers prompt higher spending.
And, most important to investors, companies' earnings are set to rise at their fastest pace since the years immediately following the financial crisis. Wall Street analysts expect the profits of companies in the S.&P. 500 to surge 26 percent this year, after a 17 percent rise last year.
Rising profits might explain why investors are putting more money in the United States stock market while getting out of other countries. In the past six weeks, a net $29 billion has poured into funds that invest in United States stocks, while $13 billion flowed out of those focused on European stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. At the start of this year, analysts expected solid growth around the world, but now Europe's economy is showing signs of weakness, and turbulence has returned to the markets of some developing countries.
But there are few signs in the United States that anxiety about trade is causing a significant pullback in business spending. "We really don't see it in the numbers," Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week. "It's just not there."
Economists are not forecasting big hits to the United States economy from the trade policies either in effect or imminent. Goldman Sachs's economists predicted that the $50 billion of tariffs against China would shave no more than two-tenths of a percentage point off gross domestic product after two years.
Investors may also believe that this period of high tension and tariff threats are the prelude to some sort of deal. The decision to extend a lifeline to ZTE, the Chinese electronics firm subject to United States penalties, showed that the Trump administration and its Chinese counterparts are capable of agreement.
Of course, the trade battles could escalate instead. Mr. Trump has threatened to impose an additional $100 billion of tariffs on China, which would most likely retaliate with its own tariffs. That would do more economic damage and cause some nervy days in the stock market, but not necessarily calamity, said Brad W. Setser, a fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Countries, he said, have ways to soften the blow. "You would start to see some real disruption and higher short-term costs but not the sort of costs that would trigger a recession" in either the United States or China, he said.
Still, there are signs of fear lurking in the stock market.
The S.&P. 500 remains below its peak hit in January, and some analysts say the trade tensions may be holding it back. "Why hasn't the overall market made a new high considering all the fiscal stimulus?" David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said. Stocks of technology companies and smaller companies have done particularly well in recent weeks, indicating that investors right now are drawn to companies that are less vulnerable to trade wars, Mr. Rosenberg added.
Also, it is too early to conclude that the United States can mostly shrug off trade battles. Many American businesses have operations abroad or get a large share of their revenue from foreign markets. The retaliation by other countries has barely begun.
Tariffs push up the costs for businesses, which in turns crimps their profits. If companies start to warn that profits will come in below expectations because of trade, the stock markets in the United States could decline sharply.
Home-building companies provide an example of what might happen. United States homebuilders face a range of rising costs. One of them is they have to pay more for Canadian softwood lumber after the Trump administration imposed tariffs of 20 percent on that product last year. The Standard & Poor's index for stocks in home-building companies is more than 10 percent below its recent peak.
The United States economy could start to disappoint. Interest rates are rising, in part, because the United States federal government is borrowing large sums to cover the fiscal shortfall that resulted from the recent tax cuts. Higher interest rates can quickly crimp growth. This may happen as the economies in Europe are wobbling and those of several large developing countries are showing signs of stress. "There is reason to suspect that we slow the pace of growth in the second half," said James W. Paulsen, a stock market strategist at the Leuthold Group.

Full text: Decades from now, we may look back at the first weeks of June 2018 as a turning point in world history: the end of the liberal order.
At a summit in Canada, the president of the United States rejected associating the country with "the rules-based international order" that America had built after World War II, and threatened the country's closest allies with a trade war. He insulted the Canadian prime minister, and then, just a few days later, lavished praise on Kim Jong-un, the world's most repressive dictator. Without consulting America's allies in the region, he even reiterated his desire to withdraw American troops from South Korea.
Such reckless disregard for the security concerns of America's allies, hostility to mutually beneficial trade and willful isolation of the United States is unprecedented. Yet this is the foreign policy of the Trump administration. Quite explicitly, the leader of the free world wants to destroy the alliances, trading relationships and international institutions that have characterized the American-led order for 70 years.
The administration's alternative vision for the international order is a bare-knuckled assertion of unilateral power that some call America First; more colorfully, a White House official characterized it to The Atlantic as the "We're America, Bitch" doctrine. This aggressive disregard for the interests of like-minded countries, indifference to democracy and human rights and cultivation of dictators is the new world Mr. Trump is creating. He and his closest advisers would pull down the liberal order, with America at its helm, that remains the best guarantor of world peace humanity has ever known. We are entering a new, terrifying era.
According to the president, the liberal world order is a con job -- he insists America is paying too much and being swindled by its friends. He wants the United States to pull back from its alliances and let its partners fend for themselves, and devote its money to its domestic needs.
Those criticisms resonate in a time when Americans are fearful of how the world is changing, and when the country's leaders have done a poor job of explaining those changes and easing their impact on workers and their families.
Widening disparity of outcomes and fewer avenues of opportunity call the fundamental fairness of the current system into question. Terrible, costly mistakes like the Iraq war and the 2008 financial crisis destroyed the credibility of experts who are culpable for the failures but insulated from the consequences. And America's allies celebrate the generosity of their social welfare systems and disparage ours, while spending less than America does to defend their countries.
These are all fair points, and they help explain the rise of Mr. Trump and the declining appreciation for a liberal order. But none of these things invalidates the importance of sustaining a system in which America benefits more than other geometries of order will permit.
Let's review what, exactly, that order is. Beginning in the wreckage of World War II, America established a set of global norms that solidified its position atop a rules-based international system. These included promoting democracy, making enduring commitments to countries that share its values, protecting allies, advancing free trade and building institutions and patterns of behavior that legitimize American power by giving less powerful countries a say.
That last point is critical, and it is the genius of the system. America benefits from supporting others. The American security umbrella enables friendly governments to attract investment and grow peacefully. It encourages cooperation. The system allows America and other countries to share the costs of preserving common defense and the free movement of goods and people (although sometimes others put in less than Americans would like).
The world has never seen anything like this -- a superpower constraining itself to such a degree -- or the peace and stability it brings. America doesn't always get it right; often it's clumsy, fails to live up to its ideology, and breaks its own rules.
But the results speak for themselves. It has been over 70 years since the last great-power conflict. Democracies fight lots of wars, but they do not fight other democracies. The wars they fight are about enlarging the perimeter of security and prosperity, expanding and consolidating the liberal order.
The global economy has grown about sevenfold since 1960, adjusted for inflation. Free people and free markets have produced most of the strongest and most prosperous states in the international order, and those states have linked themselves through alliances, institutions and trade regimes that are mutually beneficial.
Contrary to the president's core complaint, the American-led order isn't that expensive, especially as compared with the alternatives. About 40 percent of America's gross domestic product was allocated to the military during World War II. It now stands at less than 4 percent -- not an unreasonable price for a tried-and-true insurance policy.
The president and his fellow critics argue that if America does less, others will do more -- that its largess facilitates free riders. That hasn't proved true with its closest friends: Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, the United States has reduced its military forces in Europe by about 85 percent. But Europeans have even more significantly cut their defense spending, and become more tentative about the use of military force. Far from emboldening allies, the American drawdown has made them less likely to act.
And if others do more, they may not be the right others, and what they do may not serve America's interests. Russia has been doing more in Europe since the United States drew down, and more in Syria as a result of America's doing so little.
China is doing more in the South and East China Seas, and its activities will greatly complicate American military operations in defense of allies, in preserving the free flow of commerce and even in protecting its own territory.
The Islamic State in part grew out of the United States doing too little to consolidate the gains of the surge in Iraq and caring too little about the Syrian government's depredations against its people. None of these are outcomes that advance American interests.
Now imagine the longer term. China is already demonstrating that not only will it not play by the rules of the American-led order, but it also intends to write and enforce new rules. Absent American opposition, it will continue to force smaller, weaker states in East Asia into submission and expand its control over sea traffic. It will use technology to monitor, restrain and penalize critics worldwide. A Chinese-led world order would be one of privileges rather than rights, power rather than law, tribute rather than alliance.
That's a very costly peace -- if it even succeeds at sustaining peace. More likely, if the United States does not sustain the order, a rising power will eventually force it to defend its interests or succumb. That is what happened in every power transition except the one between Britain and the United States -- an exception born of their democratic similarities, and one unlikely to be repeated with the United States and China.
Mr. Trump's attack on the liberal world order is not just about the price America pays for it. He seems bent on destroying the friendships and respect that bind America and its allies. If he succeeds, America will be seen as -- and may even become -- no different from Russia and China, and countries will have no reason to assist America's efforts rather than theirs.
America has been dominant for so long that it takes for granted outcomes that support its policies and interests, and undervalues the systemic advantages of institutions and norms. Yet Mr. Trump may end up proving an illiberal preserver of the liberal international order. By calling into question so many fundamental elements of the system that the United States built in the devastated aftermath of World War II, he is forcing Americans to imagine a world in which the United States does not tend the garden of international order, as George Shultz describes foreign policy.
Americans want an international order that makes them safe and prosperous. And no doubt this fall, when Mr. Trump gets his military parade in Washington, we will hear no end of boasts about American power. And during the midterm elections, we will hear all sorts of talk about how the president has made America great again.
But those boasts will ring hollow if, at the same time, America lets go of the world order that is its greatest achievement. Tending the garden that the hard men who fought World War II labored to create is a much less expensive undertaking than allowing it to fall into disrepair and having to recreate it.

Full text: In the first year of the Trump administration, the president's threats to upend the global trade system seemed like mostly bluster -- lots of threats, not much action.
Not anymore.
The administration moved forward Friday with a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of Chinese imports. In recent weeks, it imposed taxes on imported steel and aluminum, including that from close allies like the European Union and Canada. And those actions both follow earlier measures on washing machines and solar panels.
All of which prompts some important questions: Is the United States engaged in what should be classified as a trade war? And what are the economic consequences likely to be?
Is this a trade war?
Definitely maybe.
A "trade war" refers to measures and countermeasures on import restriction that escalate over time, causing trade between two countries to break down.
But it is more a term of art than something with a specific definition. Everyone would agree that the Depression-era period of escalating tariffs was a trade war. Everyone would agree that, say, George W. Bush's 2002 steel tariffs and the retaliation by Europe was not. But the exact line between trade skirmish and trade war is subjective.
"Yes, we are now in a trade war," said Mary Lovely, an economist at Syracuse who studies trade. She emphasizes two factors. First, the Trump administration is signaling that it will meet Chinese retaliation with further retaliation, and second, "the two sides are no longer engaged in productive talks to defuse tensions."
Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, is more cautious. Is this a trade war? "In my view not yet," he said. "My view of a trade war is when all countries start responding unilaterally, and without respect to international rules in terms of the levels of tariff retaliation that they engage in."
So far, China, the European Union and other trading partners have responded within the confines of World Trade Organization rules.
What's the logic behind the administration's action?
For many years, American companies have complained of being treated shabbily as they try to do business in China. They often must partner with Chinese companies to be allowed to do business in the country, and frequently complain that their most advanced technologies are being stolen, among other concerns.
The Trump administration's list of goods to be subjected to the tariffs is aimed at these high-tech sectors, including aerospace, telecommunications equipment and robotics.
China has said it will place tariffs on $50 billion worth of American imports in retaliation. That's where things get interesting. The Trump administration is threatening to escalate things further if China retaliates, pulling another $100 billion of goods into the mix. This increases the possibility that the dispute will spiral to encompass ever larger swaths of goods.
Will it work?
China views development of its high-tech industries as core to its economic strategy of the future and won't want to give up advantages in those sectors lightly. On the other hand, the substantial U.S. trade deficit with China means the American side has more potential Chinese imports on which to slap punitive tariffs than the Chinese do, a potential source of leverage.
The Trump administration's negotiating strategy has been erratic. At one point last month, there seemed to be progress toward an accord in which China would buy more American agriculture and energy products. That would have helped reduce the United States' trade deficit with China, one of the president's major goals. But it wouldn't have done much of anything about the longer-term issues around technology theft, and those talks fell apart.
The United States might have a stronger negotiating position if it were joined by allies like Canada, Japan and the European Union. But given the steel and aluminum tariffs and tensions with Canada, the United States finds itself on its own in talks with China.
Is this going to crash the U.S. economy?
Probably not.
The United States has gross domestic product of nearly $20 trillion, so a new tax on $50 billion (or, eventually, $150 billion or more) of Chinese imports is a rounding error. Even when you count the costs of steel and aluminum and other tariffs that have resulted from the president's aggressive trade, it's hard to get to numbers that move the dial much on overall growth.
As countries retaliate, they can certainly cause damage for individual American industries that export, but the reality is most of the economic activity in the United States is for domestic consumption. Exports constitute about 12 percent of G.D.P.
That's not to play down the potentially heavy damage in the industries caught in the middle. Soybean futures prices fell Friday, as commodities traders predicted China would buy fewer soybeans in retaliation. Some major industries that use steel and aluminum are complaining of sharply higher prices, which in turn makes them less competitive against global competitors.
"The questions are does this escalate from here, is this part of a much bigger process, and how do business confidence and financial markets respond?" said Lewis Alexander, chief U.S. economist at Nomura. "With these relatively modest first-round things, it's hard to make the case that it's material" to the overall economy.
The risk comes if things spiral out of control in ways that crater the stock market or lead businesses to pull back significantly on their investment spending. Keep in mind the way that trade disputes can cause economic damage without triggering a recession. Gary Cohn, the former White House economic adviser, said this week that tariffs could wipe out economic gains from the tax cut passed late last year. Still, with the economy in relatively strong shape, there is a big difference between "not growing as fast as it would without a trade war" and outright recession.
Will this mean higher prices?
The initial tariffs on Chinese goods are not focused on consumer products. They are to be levied on products mainly purchased by businesses, such as industrial equipment. That could mean upward pressure on inflation eventually, but in subtle ways.
Even if the dispute spreads to consumer goods, the actual amount American consumers will pay depends on many factors, including the availability of domestic substitutes and the competitiveness of the industry. For any given product, it is hard to predict how much of a 25 percent tariff will be passed through to consumers versus absorbed by producers and retailers.
Still, consumers ultimately pay the bill for trade barriers in one way or another. At the start of the year, the administration put a 20 percent tariff on imported washing machines; the price of laundry equipment is up 17 percent since then.

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Friday escalated a trade war between the world's two largest economies, moving ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods and provoking an immediate tit-for-tat response from Beijing.
The president is battling on a global front, taking aim at allies and adversaries alike. The United States has levied global tariffs on metal imports that include those from Europe, Canada and Mexico, while threatening to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement.
These countries are fighting back, drawing up retaliatory measures that go after products in Mr. Trump's political base. China's response was swift on Friday, focusing on $50 billion worth of American goods including beef, poultry, tobacco and cars.
The trade actions could ripple through the global economy, fracturing supply chains and costing jobs at American companies that will be forced to absorb higher prices. Although the United States economy is especially strong, the tariffs are expected to drive up prices for American consumers as well as for businesses that depend on China for parts.
Things could get worse if the United States and China ratchet up their actions. Mr. Trump has already promised more tariffs in response to China's retaliation. China, in turn, is likely to back away from an agreement to buy $70 billion worth of American agricultural and energy products -- a deal that was conditional on the United States lifting its threat of tariffs.
"China's proportionate and targeted tariffs on U.S. imports are meant to send a strong signal that it will not capitulate to U.S. demands," said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University. "It will be challenging for both sides to find a way to de-escalate these tensions."
The penalties make good on a campaign promise by Mr. Trump to crack down on Chinese trade practices that he says have cost American jobs. On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a statement that trade between the countries had been "very unfair, for a very long time."
Mr. Trump added, "These tariffs are essential to preventing further unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China, which will protect American jobs."
But the White House has lately vacillated between taking a tough stance on Chinese trade practices and declaring that the trade war was "on hold."
In recent weeks, the administration had tried to defuse tensions with China ahead of a summit meeting with the North Korean leader. Mr. Trump extended a lifeline to the Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE, at the request of President Xi Jinping.
Some advisers, including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, had feared the economic consequences of a trade war and pushed for a negotiated solution instead. The latest action appears to be a victory for the more hard-line faction of the Trump administration, including the president's trade advisers, Robert E. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, who have pushed for a protectionist approach.
"This is not about a policy," said Mickey Kantor, the former commerce secretary and a chief trade negotiator for the Clinton administration. "This is not about asserting U.S. leadership. It's about the president having an impulse that if he does this, he will strengthen his base, send a signal to China, and be able to say he's been strong and tough."
Tariffs of 25 percent on roughly $34 billion of Chinese products -- drawn from a list that the administration published in April that has since been refined -- will go into effect on July 6, the office of the United States trade representative said. The administration is also proposing tariffs on roughly $16 billion of new products, which it said would undergo further review, including public hearings.
In total, the tariffs will fall on 1,102 categories of Chinese goods, including nuclear reactors, aircraft engine parts, bulldozers, ball bearings, motorcycles and industrial and agricultural machinery. The list generally focuses on industrial sectors that relate to the country's Made in China 2025 plan for dominating high-tech industries, like aerospace, automobiles, information technology and robotics, the administration said.
The revised list dropped some products purchased directly by American consumers, including flat-screen televisions and printer accessories, while adding semiconductors, machinery and plastics, according to an analysis by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
In a call with reporters Friday, a senior official said the administration would soon roll out a process for companies to apply for exclusions to the tariffs for products they cannot get from another source.
China said it would hit back with additional tariffs of 25 percent on about $50 billion of American-made products, the country's Commerce Ministry said in a release. These will also come in two rounds, with penalties on about $34 billion of goods, including agricultural products, automobiles and seafood, scheduled to take effect the same day as the United States tariffs. Tariffs on another $16 billion worth of American goods, including medical equipment, chemical products and energy products, will be announced later, the ministry said.
The ministry said in a separate statement Friday that all other recent trade terms negotiated by the United States and China would also be declared invalid.
Tensions could escalate further in the coming weeks. The White House is formulating a plan for restricting Chinese investments in the United States and putting stricter limitations on the types of advanced technology that can be exported to the country. It has said those restrictions will go into effect shortly after they are announced by June 30.
The White House says its measures are necessary to reset the trade relationship with China, a country Trump administration officials accuse of manipulating economic rules and costing millions of American jobs.
The moves could damp economic growth that has been stoked by the administration's tax cuts -- though the overall effects are likely to be limited because of the small size of the tariffs relative to the American economy. But in a few industries that are heavily affected, the pain could be substantial. Economists say the tariffs will drive up prices for American consumers purchasing products at retail stores as well as for businesses that depend on China for parts used to make other goods in the United States.
Goldman Sachs economists said Friday that the initial tariffs on $34 billion of products would have a minimal effect on growth and inflation, in part because it was concentrated on industrial rather than consumer goods. But they cautioned that the president's moves raised the odds that other measures, including more tariffs from the United States and China and restrictions on investment, would follow.
In another analysis, the Tax Foundation, a conservative nonprofit organization, found that tariffs on China and steel and aluminum would have a minimal impact on growth and wages, but that it could lower American employment by more than 45,000 full-time jobs in the long run.
"Imposing tariffs places the cost of China's unfair trade practices squarely on the shoulders of American consumers, manufacturers, farmers and ranchers," said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "This is not the right approach."
The National Retail Federation, which represents grocers, chain restaurants and other stores, said the tariffs would not combat China's abusive trade practices, but only "strain the budgets of working families by raising consumer prices."
But the tariffs received commendation from others, including lawmakers across the political spectrum who have urged the president to remain tough on China. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, called the announcement an "excellent move," while Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said the tariffs were "right on target."
"China is our real trade enemy, and their theft of intellectual property and their refusal to let our companies compete fairly threatens millions of future American jobs," Mr. Schumer said.

Full text: Stocks in the United States mostly rose Thursday, as markets get accustomed to the idea of investing with less of a safety net from central banks around the world.
The European Central Bank laid out its plan to pull back from the stimulus it has pumped into markets, but it also said it plans to hold off on raising interest rates for longer than some investors expected. More evidence arrived that the American economy is improving, meanwhile, which helped send the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its fourth gain in the last five days.
The S.&P. 500 rose 6.86 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,782.49. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 25.89, or 0.1 percent, to 25,175.31, and the Nasdaq composite rose 65.34, or 0.8 percent, to 7,761.04, a record. Roughly four stocks rose for every three that fell.
For years since the Great Recession, central banks around the world have thrown massive amounts of stimulus at markets, chiefly through the purchase of billions of dollars of bonds each month. That era neared its end after Europe's central bank said it will begin phasing out its bond-buying program in the autumn before ceasing it after December.
The European Central Bank also said it will hold off on raising interest rates until at least the summer of 2019, which was more accommodative than some investors had expected.
Its American counterpart, the Federal Reserve, has already halted bond purchases and has increased interest rates seven times since late 2015. Its latest move came Wednesday, when it raised its benchmark rate by another quarter of a percentage point and indicated two more increases may come this year thanks to the improving economy. Higher rates can stave off inflation, but they can also hinder economic growth.
"It is momentous because you're moving to something more normal," said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. "At the same time, you're moving grudgingly toward that. Central banks around the world are going to err toward being more accommodative, and they don't want to cause a market shock."
Both the Fed and the E.C.B. have said that their next moves will depend on what the economic data says, and if growth is strong enough, they will raise rates more quickly.
On Thursday, the data for the United States economy were nearly uniformly encouraging.
Retail sales jumped in May after shoppers spent more at home-and-garden stores, gas stations and restaurants. It was the strongest gain in six months, and it fits with economists' projections that economic growth is picking up following a slowdown during the first quarter of the year.
A separate report showed that fewer American workers filed for unemployment claims last week than expected, an encouraging sign for the labor market.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.94 percent from 2.97 percent late Wednesday. It gave up gains from the prior day, when the Federal Reserve surprised some investors by speeding up its timetable for rate increases.
Lower interest rates can hurt banks by crimping the profit they make from making loans. Financial stocks in the S.&P. 500 fell 0.9 percent for the biggest loss among the index's 11 sectors.
On the winning side were dividend-paying stocks, whose payouts look more attractive when interest rates are falling. Utilities, telecom stocks and real-estate investment trusts were among the top-performing sectors in the S.&P. 500.
The dollar rose to 110.59 Japanese yen from 110.55 yen late Wednesday. The euro fell to $1.1584 from $1.1788, and the British pound fell to $1.3280 from $1.3358.
In the commodities markets, benchmark United States crude rose 25 cents to settle at $66.89 per barrel.
Gold rose $7.10 to settle at $1,304.00 per ounce.

Full text: EL TIGRE, Venezuela -- Thousands of workers are fleeing Venezuela's state-owned oil company, abandoning once-coveted jobs made worthless by the worst inflation in the world. And now the hemorrhaging is threatening the nation's chances of overcoming its long economic collapse.
Desperate oil workers and criminals are also stripping the oil company of vital equipment, vehicles, pumps and copper wiring, carrying off whatever they can to make money. The double drain -- of people and hardware -- is further crippling a company that has been teetering for years yet remains the country's most important source of income.
The timing could not be worse for Venezuela's increasingly authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, who was re-elected last month in a vote that has been widely condemned by leaders across the hemisphere. Prominent opposition politicians were either barred from competing in the election, imprisoned or in exile.
But while Mr. Maduro has firm control over the country, Venezuela is on its knees economically, buckled by hyperinflation and a history of mismanagement. Widespread hunger, political strife, devastating shortages of medicine and an exodus of well over a million people in recent years have turned this country, once the economic envy of many of its neighbors, into a crisis that is spilling over international borders.
If Mr. Maduro is going to find a way out of the mess, the key will be oil: virtually the only source of hard currency for a nation with the world's largest estimated petroleum reserves.
But each month Venezuela produces less of it.
Offices at the state oil company are emptying out, crews in the field are at half strength, pickup trucks are stolen and vital materials vanish. All of this is adding to the severe problems at the company that were already acute because of corruption, poor maintenance, crippling debts, the loss of professionals and even a lack of spare parts.
Now workers at all levels are walking away in large numbers, sometimes literally taking pieces of the company with them, union leaders, oil executives and workers say.
A job with Petróleos de Venezuela, known as Pdvsa, used to be a ticket to the Venezuelan Dream.
No more.
Carlos Navas, 37, worked on a drilling crew outside of this oil city, El Tigre. He had a house here, with air-conditioning, and a car. He never imagined he might not make enough money to buy food for his wife and three children.
But he quit his job late last year, he said, because he couldn't live on what had become starvation wages.
On a recent evening, with the sun slanting low over the plains, Mr. Navas prepared to leave. He was boarding a bus to the malaria-infested gold mines to the east, where he hoped to scrape out enough money to buy food for his family and, eventually, finance an even longer journey: to Ecuador or Peru, where he would follow a stampede of his fellow Venezuelans fleeing the country's economic cataclysm.
"Before, you worked and you were rich," Mr. Navas said of his oil company job. "Your salary bought anything you needed. Now you can't buy anything, not even food."
Inflation in Venezuela is projected to reach an astounding 13,000 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. When The New York Times interviewed Mr. Navas in May, the monthly salary for a worker like him was barely enough to buy a whole chicken or two pounds of beef. But with prices going up so quickly, it buys even less now.
The state oil company is not faring much better. Output is at its lowest level in 30 years, and there is no sign that the sustained descent is over.
The company and the Venezuelan government are in default on more than $50 billion in bonds after failing to make interest payments since late last year. China has refused to continue lending Venezuela money in return for future payments in oil.
Venezuela's oil exports are being interrupted by legal action as well. In recent weeks, courts have ruled that ConocoPhillips, an American oil company, could seize Venezuelan shipments at refineries and export terminals in several Dutch Caribbean islands. The action stemmed from Venezuela's decision to nationalize foreign oil assets a decade ago.
And at home, Venezuela has had so many troubles with refineries and other oil installations that it has had to import gasoline for the domestic market, spending dollars it can hardly afford.
Mr. Maduro has ordered the arrest of dozens of the state oil company's managers, including the company's former president, in what he describes as a corruption crackdown.
But the effort has the hallmarks of a battle for control and access to oil revenue. Last November, Mr. Maduro installed a National Guard general, Manuel Quevedo, with no oil experience to lead the company.
All of that adds up to a company in a free fall.
In a speech last month after his re-election, Mr. Maduro said that oil production this year must increase by one million barrels a day, a seemingly impossible task, suggesting that he might seek more investment from friendly governments like Russia's and China's.
"We have to increase by a million barrels!" he shouted. "Who's going to do it? Maduro?" " His answer: Pdvsa workers.
In the area around El Tigre, many of the operations are run by the state oil company in joint ventures with foreign entities, including Western companies like Chevron and Repsol of Spain, as well as state companies like the China National Petroleum Corporation and Rosneft of Russia.
Oil executives cite the difficulty of working in Venezuela as social conditions decline.
"People are starving," said Eldar Saetre, chief executive of Equinor, the Norwegian oil giant that works with Pdvsa.
Interviews with more than a dozen current and former oil workers revealed deep anger. The workers, many of whom asked not to be named because they feared retaliation, said that while Venezuela's oil company had been sliding for years, its deterioration had accelerated.
"This was a golden cup," said one worker. "Not silver, gold. Now, it's a plastic cup."
Workers said that lifelong health insurance was now worth little, because the state oil company had largely stopped paying private clinics. Field workers complained that lunches sometimes failed to show up because the company did not pay the provider.
Then there is the theft of essential equipment. A tour of oil installations around El Tigre showed a devastating toll.
At several pumping stations and tank facilities, thieves had torn apart electrical installations to strip out the copper cable. At one site, nine electrical transformers had been torn from posts, their copper parts gutted, disabling vital control systems.
Many pump jacks were idle. At one well, the motor had been stolen, shutting it down.
There were gaps in fences and gates left open, leaving facilities unprotected. An employee said that a National Guard unit assigned to patrol the area had been sidelined for months because its vehicle broke down and there were no spare parts to fix it.
The facilities showed deep neglect. Many had oil spills caused by damaged tanks, pipes or valves. At one site, two large tanks were surrounded by a large black lake of crude oil that had seeped out.
Workers said they did not know who was behind the thefts. They said criminal gangs might be to blame, but some acknowledged that dismantling live electrical systems required a knowledge that workers or former workers would possess.
Ali Moshiri, Chevron's top executive for Latin America until last year, said that theft in Venezuela's oil fields had been a fact of life for 20 years.
"But the stealing has accelerated," he said, citing theft as a prime reason that oil production is plummeting. "They'll steal your car, they'll steal your wellhead if they can. They will melt it, take parts out of it and sell it."
"People are so desperate," Mr. Moshiri added. "They can sell the copper to feed their families."
Workers and supervisors in El Tigre said that production from existing wells was down and that the drilling of new wells was largely paralyzed by the lack of equipment, chemicals, spare parts and basics, like food for workers.
One supervisor listed the many destinations to which his co-workers had fled: the United States, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Spain.
Many leave without giving notice. Often, they are not replaced. When they are, the new workers frequently have little or no experience.
Junior Martínez, 28, who has worked in the oil industry for eight years, is assembling papers, including his diploma as a chemical engineer. His wife and her daughter left three months ago to earn money in Brazil.
"I get 1,400,000 bolívars a week and it isn't even enough to buy a carton of eggs or a tube of toothpaste," Mr. Martínez said of his salary in bolívars, Venezuela's currency.
Mr. Martínez's father, Ovidio Martínez, 55, recalled growing up here when the oil boom began, with wells sprouting down the block. He cried as he spoke of his son's determination to leave the country.
"You watch your children leave and you can't stop them," the elder Mr. Martínez said, fighting back tears. "In this country, they don't have a future."
Here in El Tigre, hundreds of people stood in line one recent morning outside a supermarket, many waiting since the evening before to buy whatever food they could.
Carlos Antonio Ortega, 31, walked along the line in his red Pdvsa coveralls, selling loose cigarettes. He said he had been a maintenance worker for the oil company but quit eight months ago.
"I couldn't buy anything with what I was making," he said. "You have to make the food stretch."
One Pdvsa worker with more than 30 years experience, who recently retired from her job arranging oil exports and shipments, said that when she started she made the equivalent of about $1,750 a month. The company even paid for her to study abroad and receive graduate degrees.
When she retired, she said, her monthly salary couldn't buy two cartons of eggs.
"You want to go into a corner and cry," she said. "It's a time bomb. I would sit in meetings and think to myself: Ticktock, ticktock."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- Two senators have asked President Trump's Council of Economic Advisers to turn over an analysis that shows the administration's tariffs would slow economic growth.
The internal analysis, which was first reported by The New York Times last week, contradicts the public statements of several Trump administration officials who have said that Mr. Trump's plan to impose tariffs on aluminum, steel and a broad array of Chinese products will not dampen economic growth. The existence of such a study has raised questions about whether the Trump administration is pursuing policies that its own experts know is at odds with economic reality.
Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, and Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, sent a letter to Kevin Hassett, chairman of the council, asking him to hand over any research on tariffs by June 27. The two senators, who sent the letter on Wednesday, lead the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
"To better understand the potential consequences of the administration's trade policies, we respectfully request that you produce the C.E.A. economic analysis relating to the administration's steel and aluminum tariffs and all supporting data and documents," they wrote.
The council does not publicly release all of its research and it is not clear how much damage it estimates the tariffs and potential retaliation from other countries would do to the administration's economic growth projections. Mr. Trump has made achieving sustainable 3 percent economic growth a centerpiece of his agenda.
Mr. Hassett has dodged the question when asked about it in public settings, suggesting that the threat of tariffs will encourage other countries to lower their trade barriers and therefore boost global economic growth.
"If you model a future where everybody else reduces their trade barriers to ours, then that's massively good for the global economy and massively good for the U.S. economy," Mr. Hassett said last week.
Gary D. Cohn, the former director of Mr. Trump's National Economic Council, said at an event hosted by The Washington Post on Thursday that he was already seeing signs that companies were holding back on investment out of fears of a trade war. He said that tit-for-tat tariffs could negate the economic benefits of Mr. Trump's tax cuts.
"If you end up with a tariff battle, you will end up with price inflation, you could end up with more consumer debt, those are all historic ingredients for an economic slowdown," Mr. Cohn said.
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell acknowledged anecdotal concern about business investment slowing as a result of the tariffs but said, so far, the Fed had no data to support that.
"We really don't see it in the numbers," he said. "I would put it down as more of a risk."
A C.E.A. spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Senate request.

Full text: RIGA, Latvia -- A trade war with the United States looms. Populists have taken power in Italy, posing a new threat to the euro. Growth is sluggish, and there is even talk of another banking crisis.
It would not seem the ideal time to put the brakes on Europe's economy. But that is what the European Central Bank is preparing to do.
For more than a decade, the central bank unleashed a wave of cash to stimulate growth, effectively saving Europe from the wrenching consequences of its debt crisis. The bank said Thursday that the era of easy money was over, and outlined plans to completely remove its support by December.
In essence, the bank is declaring the region cured, or at least strong enough to stand on its own. It is signaling that it doesn't want to be in the business of saving politicians from themselves or responding to every dip in growth with a new dose of stimulus. And it is under pressure to remain in sync with a crucial trading partner after the United States Federal Reserve raised its main interest rate on Wednesday.
What will happen next is uncertain, because the European Central Bank has pumped unprecedented amounts of money into the economy. There may be unpleasant surprises: think real estate bubbles, more wobbling banks or a surge in bankruptcies.
"It's not the right time," said Zsolt Darvas, a monetary policy expert at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. "If you look at what happened in the last few quarters, everything became more disappointing."
That may be an understatement. In addition to a slowdown in growth, Italy is gripped by political turmoil after populists took power on an anti-euro platform. Trade relations with the United States are at their poorest in decades, and most likely will get worse as Europe plans punitive duties on an array of American products as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum. And Deutsche Bank, one of the region's most important lenders, is in crisis.
In countries like Italy, there lurk an unknown number of so-called zombie companies -- businesses that have avoided bankruptcy only because of low interest rates and tolerant banks. A rise in interest rates could prompt a mass collapse of those weak companies.
Some economists are even resurrecting the word "stagflation" -- a dreaded condition in which inflation rises at the same time that growth stagnates. The region's residents would face the prospect of paying more for everyday goods even as their wages stayed the same.
The European Central Bank's Governing Council, which met in the Latvian capital of Riga on Thursday, largely dismissed those concerns. The council set out a timetable for ending the most important element of its stimulus efforts by the end of the year.
The central bank will cut stimulus in half after September, and end it altogether after December. In a concession to those who think it is being too hasty, the council said it would not raise its benchmark interest rates until after the summer of 2019. By historical standards, money will remain cheap.
Still, those decisions mark a clear change of direction.
Since 2015, the European Central Bank has been handing money around in a way possible only for an organization that has a license to print it.
It bought almost 2.5 trillion euros, or $3 trillion, in debt that had been issued by not just governments, but all manner of public utilities, breweries, grocery chains, consumer goods conglomerates and automakers. In effect, the bank became the world's biggest bond fund.
The point was to flood financial markets with so much cash that companies and governments would have to pay little or no interest to raise money. And the strategy worked.
Interest rates fell so low that, for a time, blue-chip companies could borrow money essentially for free. Real estate prices recovered. In countries like Germany and the Netherlands, shops and restaurants are desperately trying to find workers because the labor market has bounced back so strongly. Growth in the eurozone in 2017 was the best since 2007, before the financial crisis.
But early this year, warning signs started to appear. Factories reported fewer orders, and Mr. Trump issued a threat -- since carried out -- to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from Europe. On Thursday, the European Union's member states unanimously backed a plan to impose import duties on €2.8 billion worth of American products.
The new disruptions to trade have unsettled businesses. Companies like ABB, a supplier of power equipment based in Zurich, or Voestalpine, an Austrian maker of steel components for the auto industry, have had to pay more to deliver special steel alloys to their American subsidiaries. The specialized steel is not available from United States suppliers, they say.
Now, the 19 countries that share the euro must face these challenges with substantially less central bank support.
Economists at the Swiss bank UBS estimated that the bond-buying program has added 0.75 percentage points per year to economic growth since 2015. Put another way, that means the central bank was responsible for about a third of the growth rate last year.
The central bank's own estimates are more modest, but not by much. That means vulnerable countries could be in for a shock when the bank takes the money away.
One of the biggest risks is Italy. Its national debt is among the highest in the world. Italy's new government includes leaders who have talked of leaving the euro. Growth is meager, and unemployment is 11.2 percent, more than three times the rate in Germany.
Central bank support has provided reassurance to investors that Italian government bonds are a safe bet. But that confidence is fickle. The market interest rates on Italian debt spiked during chaotic attempts in recent months to form a government of two populist parties. They fell only after leaders tempered their rhetoric about resurrecting the lira.
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is no stranger to Italy's issues -- earlier in his career, he was the highest-ranking civil servant in the Italian Finance Ministry. He indicated on Thursday that the bank would take action only if there were signs that problems in Italy were spreading to other countries.
"We certainly monitor financial markets carefully, but so far we haven't seen contagion," Mr. Draghi said during a news conference in Riga.
Mr. Draghi also acknowledged that trade tensions with the United States had worsened considerably. Disruption of the world trade order could "create very serious damage," he said.
As insurance against such risks, the central bank kept its options open. The end of quantitative easing depends on "incoming data," the central bank said in a statement. Mr. Draghi suggested that bond purchases could be ramped up again if needed.
But his clear message was that the European Central Bank will not be thrown off course by the machinations of populist politicians, a few months of unsettling economic data or threats by Mr. Trump to impose duties on German cars.
"We have taken these decisions knowing that the economy is in a better situation," Mr. Draghi said.
In the same breath, though, he betrayed a trace of doubt. There is also, he added, "increasing uncertainty."

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and signaled that two additional increases were on the way this year, as officials expressed confidence that the United States economy was strong enough for borrowing costs to rise without choking off economic growth.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, speaking in unusually blunt terms at a news conference on Wednesday, said the economy had strengthened significantly since the 2008 financial crisis and was approaching a "normal" level that could allow the Fed to soon step back and play less of a hands-on role in encouraging economic activity.
The Fed's optimism about the state of the economy is likely to translate into higher borrowing costs for cars, home mortgages and credit cards over the next year as the central bank raises interest rates more quickly than was anticipated.
Wednesday's rate increase was the second this year and the seventh since the end of the Great Recession and brings the Fed's benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. The last time the rate topped 2 percent was in late summer 2008, when the economy was contracting and the Fed was cutting rates toward zero, where they would remain for years after the financial crisis.
"The decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape," Mr. Powell said after the Fed's two-day policy meeting. "Most people who want to find jobs are finding them."
[During a news conference, Mr. Powell said he wants to "start with a plain English summary of how the economy is doing." He certainly did that.]
The increases this year are part of a gradual series of steps to return rates to historically normal levels, and they reflect both the Fed's confidence in America's economic strength and its commitment to bring the inflation rate to its target of 2 percent.
But the march toward higher interest rates comes as much of America's work force continues to experience slow wage growth, despite a tight labor market that should, in theory, translate into higher wages as businesses compete for workers.
The rise in consumer prices over the last year has effectively wiped out any wage increases for nonsupervisory workers, the latest Consumer Price Index data suggests.
That is odd for an economy with a tight labor market, with unemployment running at a 3.8 percent. And some analysts say it is a reason for officials to slow their pace of rate increases, since the benefits of a hot economy have not yet translated into a significant wage increase for workers.
At a comparable time of low unemployment, in 2000, "wages were growing at near 4 percent year over year and the Fed's preferred measure of inflation was 2.5 percent," both above today's levels, Tara Sinclair, a senior fellow at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in a research note. "Too many increases too quickly could choke the economy before we really see how good it could get."
Mr. Powell played down concerns about slow wage growth, acknowledging it is "a bit of a puzzle" but suggesting that it would normalize as the economy continued to strengthen.
The Fed chairman said growth was being lifted, at least in the short term, by tax cuts and government spending increases signed into law by President Trump last year. And he dismissed, for now, concerns that Mr. Trump's trade policies, including tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, were hurting growth, saying the Fed had yet to see any data indicating an impact.
"So right now, we don't see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong, the labor market is strong, growth is strong," he said, adding, "I would put it down as more of a risk."
In a statement released at the end of the two-day meeting, Fed officials noted that economic activity had been rising "at a solid rate" -- a change from their May statement, when they called the rate "moderate." Fed officials now expect the economy to grow at a 2.8 percent rate this year, up from a 2.7 percent forecast in March. The unemployment rate is now projected to fall to 3.6 percent by year's end, down from a forecast of 3.8 percent in March.
"The changes from the Fed today should not come as a surprise, given recent economic developments, but they nonetheless signal a more hawkish outlook for the next few quarters," Eric Winograd, a senior economist at AllianceBernstein, said in a research note.
The Fed now faces a tricky balancing act as it tries to calibrate how to keep the economy chugging along. Raising rates too quickly could snuff out the economic recovery, which has finally begun to gain steam after years of sluggish growth. But not raising rates fast enough could allow inflation to spiral out of control, driving up prices and potentially plunging the economy back into a recession.
A few Fed officials have raised concerns that the inflation trend could accelerate rapidly, forcing the Fed to raise rates faster than expected to keep the economy from overheating. They appeared to have won a convert in Wednesday's projections, which now show that a majority of officials expect rates to rise to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent by the end of this year.
Officials continue to project three additional increases in 2019, but reduced the number of forecast increases for 2020 from two to one.
A faster pace of rate increases could slow economic growth, potentially frustrating Mr. Trump. But Fed officials signaled a willingness to allow inflation to remain slightly above their 2 percent target for several years -- which would be accommodative for growth.
Officials raised their headline inflation rate forecast for the year as well, to 2.1 percent from 1.9 percent. The Fed now predicts inflation will run slightly above its target rate of 2 percent through 2020, at 2.1 percent each year, a slight overshoot that Fed officials have roundly indicated they are comfortable with, in part because of slow wage growth.
Financial markets had been widely expecting the Fed to raise the benchmark rate, and the reaction among investors was muted, even as the official monetary policy statement struck some as signaling growing confidence that rate increases would continue, and might even proceed at a faster pace.
The stock market, which had been modestly positive for most of the day, turned slightly negative after the rate decision was announced at 2 p.m. Short-term Treasury bond yields, closely tied to monetary policy, rose faster than yields on longer-term bonds which take their cues from forecasts for economic growth and inflation, suggesting that investors in the bond market see economic growth continuing but not picking up sharply.
It was the second news conference for Mr. Powell, who succeeded Janet L. Yellen in the job this year. But this was the meeting where Mr. Powell made several clear breaks from his predecessors, in a series of changes around process and communication that could ultimately have big implications for monetary policy and the economy.
He began his session with the news media with what he called a "plain English" description of what the Fed had done and why, a contrast with the practice of Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, both Ph.D. economists who prefaced their appearances with long prepared statement loaded with monetary policy jargon.
And he stood before reporters, in contrast to Ms. Yellen and Mr. Bernanke, who both chose to sit at a desk for their post-meeting news conferences.
Mr. Powell announced that he would begin holding a news conference after every Fed policy meeting starting in January; currently such a session is held only after four of eight annual meetings.
While he insisted that this was not meant to signal any change in the direction of policy, it opens up more flexibility for the Fed as it sets interest rate policies. Financial markets currently expect interest rate increases only in meetings with a news conference; now the Fed will have the option of making more than four policy moves a year without unnecessarily surprising markets.
"The June communication really ushered in the Powell Fed," said Julia Coronado, an economist and president of MacroPolicy Perspectives. "He stood at a lectern instead of sitting at a desk, he is moving toward more frequent communication, and the communication style from the statement to the press conference is direct and pragmatic."
And the Federal Open Market Committee, which Mr. Powell leads, changed its statement describing its rate increase in a way that removed a mainstay of its monetary policy of recent years. Dating to the Bernanke era, the Fed has used "forward guidance" to signal the future direction of interest rates.
For example, at the March policy meeting, the committee said its interest rate target was "likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run." That language was excised from the policy statement released on Wednesday, saying only that the "timing and size" of future rate increases will be determined by many factors.

Wall Street Skips a Beat as the Fed Raises Interest Rates Again

Full text: U.S. stocks slipped Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and said it expects to increase rates two more times by the end of the year. Investors bet that several huge deals are more likely to happen after a federal court cleared AT&T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warner.
Wall Street was already certain the Fed would raise interest rates Wednesday. The central bank's decision makers also said they plan to raise rates two more times later this year for a total of four increases. Investors had debated all year if rates would rise three or four times, and some are concerned that if rates rise that quickly, it could stifle economic growth because consumers and businesses will have to pay more to borrow money.
The Fed's projections might have been unwelcome, but they weren't a shock: for months there have been signs the economy is getting stronger. Another came on Wednesday, when the Labor Department said wholesale prices climbed at a faster pace in May. The Fed says inflation is likely to increase and projects unemployment will hit a 50-year low in a few months, and it wants to keep inflation under control.
"There was nothing terribly surprising in the announcement," said Jeremy Zirin, head of investment strategy for UBS' global wealth management business. He said the Fed's new forecasts "appeared largely to simply reflect the economic reality of the last two or three months."
He added that the Fed didn't have a big change of heart either: the Fed's projections changed because one additional policymaker forecast four rate increases instead of three.
The ruling in the AT&T-Time Warner trial sent ripples through the media and telecommunications industries. Shares of Twenty-First Century Fox jumped as investors anticipated Comcast's offer for Fox's entertainment businesses. It came just after trading ended, as Comcast announced a $65 billion bid. The ruling also gave investors more confidence that two big takeovers in the health care field will now go through.
The S&P 500 index fell 11.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,775.63 after it closed at a four-month high Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 119.53 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,201.20.
The Nasdaq composite slipped 8.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,695.70. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks shed 5.76 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,676.54.points. Both indexes finished at record highs Tuesday.
Judge Richard Leon said AT&T can buy Time Warner and rejected the government's argument that the deal would stifle competition and lead to higher cable bills. The purchase will give the wireless and cable giant control of CNN, HBO and the Warner Bros. movie studio. Time Warner climbed 1.8 percent to $97.95 while AT&T lost 6.2 percent to $32.22.
Media companies rallied. Netflix gained 4.4 percent to $379.93 and CBS gained 3.6 percent to $54.26.
Comcast had said it was preparing to make an offer for Fox's entertainment divisions, but was waiting for the judge's ruling. Fox jumped 7.7 percent to $43.66 Wednesday and was little changed in late trading. Comcast fell 0.2 percent to $32.32.
Fox has agreed to sell those businesses to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock, setting up the possibility that Disney will have to raise its offer. However Disney added 1.9 percent to $106.31.
Investors now view CVS's effort to buy health insurer Aetna as more likely to go through, and they felt similarly about Cigna's offer for pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts. T-Mobile USA and Sprint made smaller gains. Investors have been skeptical the government would allow the third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers to combine.
Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the ruling is probably a good sign for the two health care deals because, like AT&T and Time Warner, those acquisitions won't reduce the number of companies competing in an industry, unlike a Sprint-T-Mobile merger. But investors might be drawing overly broad conclusions from Leon's ruling, Gordon said.
"The judge's decision is based on some very particular facts of the AT&T-Time Warner case," he said, including the growing popularity of streaming services and greater competition for advertising revenue. "This isn't a case that's about a big sweeping legal philosophy."
Bond prices turned lower as investors expected interest rates to rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.97 percent from 2.96 percent late Tuesday.
The dollar rose to 110.55 yen from 110.33 yen. The euro rose to $1.1773 from $1.1750.
Benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.4 percent to $66.64 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 1.1 percent to $76.74 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline added 1.7 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Heating oil picked up 1.1 percent to $2.19 a gallon. Natural gas advanced 0.8 percent to $2.97 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold added 0.1 percent to $1,301.30 an ounce. Silver gained 0.6 percent to $16.99 an ounce. Copper inched up 0.1 percent to $3.25 a pound.
Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent. France's CAC 40 and the FTSE 100 in Britain took tiny losses.
The Nikkei 225 in Japan rose 0.4 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell less than 0.1 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 1.2 percent.

Indexes Rise as Investors Keep Their Eyes on the Fed

Full text: Stocks mostly rose in a quiet Tuesday session, as investors reacted calmly to the outcome of a meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and turned their attentions to this week's trio of central bank meetings.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 4.85 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,786.85, closing at its highest level since February 1. The Nasdaq composite added 43.87 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,703.79 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.58 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 25,320.73. The Russell 2000, an index that makes up mostly small companies, rose 7.62 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,682.30.
Both the Russell and the Nasdaq set new record highs.
Trump and Kim concluded their summit by committing to working "toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and to "build a lasting and stable peace regime" on the Korean Peninsula.
The broad promises largely reiterated past agreements, while many of the details were left vague and there was no agreement on ending the technical state of war between North and South Korea. A potential deal has the chance of lowering geopolitical tensions in a region surrounded by three of the world's largest economies: Japan, China and South Korea.
"Deal or no deal? Just don't ask what comprises a 'deal' and we are fine. At the risk of sounding a tad frivolous, that appears to be the truth of the matter," said Vishnu Varathan of Mizuho Bank in Singapore of the Trump-Kim summit.
Following the Trump-Kim summit, shares of weapons makers and defense contractors were among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500. Raytheon lost nearly 3 percent to $206.61, Lockheed Martin fell 1.3 percent to $315.16 and Northrop Grumman fell 1.5 percent to $329.35.
With geopolitical issues set aside, investors turned their attention toward the current health of the U.S. economy.
The Federal Reserve started a two-day meeting on interest rates on Tuesday. Investors expect the central bank to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75-2 percent. However investors' attention will focus more on how many additional rate hikes Fed officials may do this year.
The government said that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in May, with surging gasoline costs driving much of the increase. The Labor Department said Tuesday that the consumer price index climbed 2.8 percent last month from a year earlier, putting inflation on its fastest annual pace since February 2012. But core prices -- which exclude the volatile food and energy categories -- have risen a milder 2.2 percent over the past 12 months.
Fed officials have been closely watching inflation data, since they have a target of inflation being roughly 2 percent per year. Since core inflation is still tame likely means that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates only gradually.
On Thursday, the European Central Bank will meet and could outline an end to its stimulus program, while on Friday the Bank of Japan is due to give its latest policy update.
After the market close, investors welcomed news that the $85 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner will be allowed to go through. The Trump administration had sued to block the proposed merger and a rejection likely would have chilled possible multi-billion dollar deals between 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney; Verizon and CBS; and T-Mobile and Sprint.
Following the judge's decision, shares of Time Warner rose 4 percent and AT&T shares fell 2 percent
Shares of electrical car company Tesla rose $10.67, or 3 percent, to $342.77 after the company announced it would lay off 9 percent of its work force in order to boost profitability. The layoffs target white collar staff, not production workers.
Benchmark U.S. crude closed up 26 cents to $66.36 a barrel. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 69 cents to $75.77 per barrel in London.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.96 percent. The dollar strengthened versus the Japanese yen, the euro and the British pound.
Gold prices fell $3.80 to $1,295.10 an ounce, silver fell 6 cents to $16.89 an ounce and copper fell less than a penny to $3.2495 a pound.

Full text: Unemployment is sinking and businesses are churning out more goods and services. Yet even with the economy standing on tippy toes, prices and wages are climbing a lot more slowly than anyone has expected.
Now a growing body of research is putting the blame more pointedly on e-commerce. The spectacular growth in online shopping, it turns out, is not only tamping down inflation more than previously thought, but also distorting the way it is measured.
The studies reinforce the views of Federal Reserve officials who see the internet's increasing influence as a leading suspect in a continuing mystery: why inflation routinely falls short of their 2 percent target, considered the sweet spot for keeping the economy humming without overheating.
The caution is unlikely to prevent the Fed from raising benchmark interest rates at its meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington. Central bankers are engaged in a methodical effort to return rates to levels that prevailed before they were pushed near zero to fuel growth during and after the Great Recession. Some officials have raised concerns that the Fed may need to speed up that process, to prevent inflation from accelerating rapidly as the economy heats up even more.
But some of the latest findings suggest that those fears could be unfounded -- and that the official statistics are overstating inflation.
"We don't have as good measures of the economy as we should, in part because there are many new digital goods and new online channels," said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. "At the same time, digitization of more and more of commerce creates a huge opportunity for much better measurement."
One opportunity has come from the Digital Price Index, a compilation of data scraped from the web that Adobe Systems recently started collecting.
An analysis of that information by Austan Goolsbee of the University of Chicago and Peter Klenow of Stanford found that prices for goods sold on the internet rose much more slowly from 2014 to 2017 than indicated by barometers like the Consumer Price Index, or C.P.I.
Online prices of personal computers fell by 12.3 percent, for example, but the C.P.I. showed just a 6.9 percent drop. Toy prices online slumped 12 percent, while the C.P.I. put the drop at just 7.8 percent. Online prices for photographic equipment and supplies fell 9.2 percent compared with the 0.6 percent decline registered by the official measure.
The government will publish the C.P.I. data for May on Tuesday; in April, the index showed a 12-month increase of 2.1 percent. The monthly figures are based on a sampling of 140,000 products sold both in stores and online. Adobe's digital index solely includes internet sales, but the range of products covered is much bigger: 2.1 million transactions every month.
"A lot of what's in the C.P.I. is not bought on the internet, like health care and housing," said Mr. Goolsbee, who was also an adviser to former President Barack Obama. But if you compare the same set of goods, he said, "there is massively more deflation" online -- by as much as 2.5 percentage points.
"Prices are going down a whole lot faster than the C.P.I. shows for the same things," he said.
After all, as bargain hunters know, comparison shopping is a cinch online. The result is that merchants are leery of raising prices. The ease of entering the marketplace, regardless of location, further ratchets up the competition. At the same time, internet retailers can often operate at a lower cost than their brick-and-mortar competitors.
Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, has called it "the Amazon effect story."
Research into online commerce in Europe also suggests that comparison shopping -- even across national borders -- keeps prices low. This work helps explain "why firms might be less able to change prices," said Brent Neiman of the University of Chicago, one of the authors of the research.
New online research offers more evidence that "the more efficient method of selling through e-commerce is holding inflation down compared to what it would have been otherwise," said Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University.
Figuring out just how much of an impact online shopping has had on inflation, however, remains a challenge.
There are several measures of inflation -- like the C.P.I., used to calculate cost-of-living increases in Social Security, and personal consumption expenditures (P.C.E.), an index favored by the Fed -- and they all try to take account of buying and selling on the web.
The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which calculate those two measures, look at a typical basket of goods and sample prices, at times adding or eliminating items, like food and energy, that can vary widely from one month to the next.
Those agencies are constantly refining those calculations, but they inevitably have shortcomings. And as e-commerce grows and new products proliferate, some economists argue, the traditional measures have a harder time capturing the full scale of price changes online.
Even with thousands of price inspectors, the government can sample only a tiny portion of goods and services sold across the country. The traditional measures are also not well suited to take account of the constant introduction of new and upgraded products -- like Instapots and athleisure yoga pants.
Cellphones, for example, were not included in the C.P.I. until 1996, when about 40 million Americans, or 15 percent of the population at the time, were already using them. In many cases, prices for those new goods -- like computers -- plunge over time, but price indexes fail to capture the change.
Mr. Goolsbee and Mr. Klenow discovered that new and updated products -- from the iPhone X and digital assistant devices to electric bikes and toy monkey Fingerlings -- were flooding online marketplaces much faster than estimated.
Putting aside apparel, where designers offer new fashions every season, the research found that 44 percent of the products sold online did not exist in the previous year. And nearly a quarter disappeared from one year to the next.
"What we have never had before is the quantity of stuff online," Mr. Goolsbee said. Online spending now accounts for 10 percent of all retail spending, and in some categories 50 percent.
This isn't the first time innovations in shopping have upended pricing structures. Over time, the introduction of the Sears catalog similarly held down prices compared with the small, local stores where people had always shopped, said Mr. Gordon, the Northwestern economist.
And more than two decades ago, when Amazon was just beginning to make its name as an online bookseller, a blue-ribbon commission appointed by the Senate Finance Committee -- on which Mr. Gordon served -- concluded that flaws in how the government measured prices had caused the C.P.I. to overstate inflation.
Recognition of measuring problems may be one reason that Fed officials said at their last meeting that they would be willing to let inflation at least temporarily rise above the 2 percent target.
Stephen Reed, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that "we constantly re-evaluate our methods and consider new research."

Full text: The Trump administration has become downright boastful about the state of the economy.
"In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America," the president tweeted recently. After I analyzed the May employment data by consulting a thesaurus and writing a cheeky article using a lot of near-synonyms for "good," the Trump administration blasted it out approvingly to the White House press list and through a presidential tweet.
But I also received some blowback from liberals. There were some similarly good months for job growth in the Obama administration, they noted. And my analysis was not nearly so effusive then.
So which is it? Is the economy doing exceptionally well, or performing only about as well as it did in the late years of the Obama administration?
The answer depends on precisely how you phrase the question, which in turn hinges on a crucial distinction that people often fail to make when talking about the economy. There's a big difference between the level of economic performance; the direction of change in the economy; and the pace of change.
Think of the economy as a bathtub. The level of the water in the tub -- how much economic activity there is -- is one useful, interesting question. Whether the water level is rising or falling -- is this an economic expansion or recession? -- is a separate question. And how fast the water level is changing -- what is the pace of growth? -- is a third question.
All might be useful information, but they capture different things. And too much of the debate over how the economy is doing conflates them.
So how good is the Trump economy? It depends on which of these approaches you take.
The economy looks strongest if you look only at the level of economic activity, not the rate of change. For example, per-person gross domestic product adjusted for inflation is at its highest level on record, as are other similar measures of output.
That isn't very surprising. Over time, workers tend to become more productive thanks to improving technology and the nation's stock of machinery and other capital increases. So we expect G.D.P. to rise most of the time, and to fall only during the occasional recession. By this measure, 60 percent of the time since modern G.D.P. statistics began in 1947, a president could accurately claim that the economy is the best it has ever been.
Other measures of the level of economic performance are also quite good, though not historically so. The 3.8 percent unemployment level is the lowest in 18 years, but it was lower in 1969. The lowest on record was 2.5 percent in 1953.
And the very low jobless rate masks some weakness in the labor market. Among adults in their prime working years, 79.2 percent were working in May, which is still below that statistic's 80.3 percent recent high in early 2007 and its record high of 81.9 percent in 2000.
Still, if you look only at the level at which the economy is performing, the Trump administration does have plenty to be excited about.
Similarly, the direction of the economy looks to be positive by almost every measure. Employers are adding jobs; output is rising, as are incomes. Another term for a shrinking economy would be an economy in recession, and there is no reason to believe that a recession is currently underway.
Then there's the growth rate. This is the measure by which the Trump economy looks very much like a simple, straightforward continuation of President Obama's second term.
In 2016, for example, Mr. Obama's last year in office, employers added an average of 195,000 jobs a month. In the first 17 months of the Trump administration, the average has been 190,000.
It shows up in G.D.P. numbers, too. What may look like a nice smooth line of steady improvement in per-capita G.D.P. growth in the chart above looks a lot more herky-jerky when you look at the same data in terms of percent change over the previous year.
And looking at the growth rate instead of the level shows that the 2.09 percent improvement in the first year of the Trump administration is below a couple of the peaks of the Obama second term, including a 3 percent reading in the year ending in the first quarter of 2015.
In talking about the economy, the level, direction and rate of change all matter. They just matter in different ways.
The late 1990s, for example, featured both strong levels of economic activity and fast growth. In the aftermath of a steep recession in 1982, there was a different combination: a weak level of economic activity paired with fast growth. The 2010-2011 time frame featured weak economic activity paired with slow growth, a nasty combination.
The reason my analysis was more effusive about the recent economic results than it was about similar growth numbers during the Obama administration is that strong growth numbers are more impressive -- and unexpected -- at a time when the level of economic activity is already high. When the jobless rate was, say, 7 percent, we needed strong job growth just to put the unemployed back to work. To get similar job growth rates with an unemployment rate below 4 percent is reason for a little more giddiness.
So what is the most honest way of talking about the Trump economy? It goes like this: The president inherited an economy that had come a long way toward healing. During his administration, the economy has continued growing at about the same rate it did before he took office, pushing incomes, employment and output to yet higher levels.
There are plenty of problems that remain in the United States, economic and otherwise, and the degree of credit the president deserves for the state of the economy is an open debate. But this is a bathtub that is already pretty full, and the water's rising nicely.

Technology
Rules barring priority lanes on the internet will go away.
Federal internet rules known as net neutrality will officially disappear on Monday. The rules, dating from the Obama administration, require internet providers to give consumers equal access to all content online. The Federal Communications Commission voted to repeal the rules in December. The repeal is expected to draw online protests.

Media
Judge to rule on the AT&T bid for Time Warner.
A federal judge on Tuesday will decide AT&T's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner, a deal that would create a media and telecommunications powerhouse and help set a path for mergers for years to come. The Justice Department sued in November to block the deal, saying the merger would raise prices and hurt competition by allowing AT&T to charge competitors higher licensing fees for Time Warner content. Judge Richard Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia will announce his opinion from the bench at 4 p.m. on Tuesday following a six-week trial earlier this year.

Economy
Gas prices may contribute to an increase in inflation.
Inflation in recent years has been like a horror movie villain: feared, but not seen. But with retail gasoline prices now topping $3 a gallon in many parts of the country, inflation may finally be picking up. A report on Tuesday from the Labor Department is expected to show that consumer prices rose 2.7 percent in May from a year earlier, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, representing the fastest growth in over a year. Take gas prices out of the mix, however, and economists expect the core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, to show just a 2.2 percent rise, more or less in line with the trend over the past six years.

______
Economy
Interest rates and views on trade and inflation on Fed agenda.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, bringing its benchmark rate to a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. It would be the seventh time the Fed has raised rates since the 2008 financial crisis, with the last increase in March. Investors will closely watch the news conference after the announcement by the Fed's new chairman, Jerome H. Powell, for any signs of new worries over inflation or about the Trump administration's trade policies.

Economy
European Central Bank to discuss tapering stimulus.
The European Central Bank will discuss a timetable for winding down its eurozone stimulus program when it meets on Thursday in Riga, Latvia. The bank has been buying government and corporate bonds since early 2015 as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy. But inflation has been picking up, putting pressure on the central bank to dial back the de facto money printing. Top officials of the bank have signaled that the program will be the main topic at the meeting of the policy-setting Governing Council, which is making one of its periodic forays outside Frankfurt. A definitive announcement on the future of the stimulus measures may not come until July, however.

Trade
White House plans to publish list of tariffs against China.
The Trump administration plans to release by Friday the final list of the roughly $50 billion in Chinese products that would be subject to tariffs under the president's trade plan. The release is likely to escalate the already-brewing trade war with China. White House officials have said that the tariffs will go into effect shortly after Friday, though that may be delayed to give negotiators from the two countries, who have been continuing trade talks through recent weeks, time to come up with a solution. Companies and trade organizations have been given the opportunity to weigh in on what effect of the tariffs could have since early April, when the administration released an initial list of 1,300 Chinese products that would be taxed.

Full text: In the United States in the years after the Great Recession, pessimists had a lot of material to work with. Economic doomsayers looked at the stubbornly elevated unemployment rate and discerned a depressing new normal, in which technological and social change had rendered many Americans simply unemployable, and stagnation and sclerosis loomed ahead. Social pessimists looked at the disarray in working-class culture, the retreat from marriage and child rearing and civic and religious life, the spread of loneliness and depression and addiction, and saw a society where ordinary forms of flourishing were slipping out of reach.
Five years ago it was easy to tell a story where these two problems were straightforwardly conjoined, with economic disappointment driving social dysfunction and vice versa.
More recently, though, the problems have partially decoupled. The deepest economic pessimists have turned out to be wrong, for now at least, about how fast the 21st-century American economy can grow and how many jobs it can create. But as the economic picture has improved, the social picture hasn't. The birthrate keeps declining, the opioid epidemic is dragging down American life expectancy, young people's mental health seems to be worsening, and new data showing a rising suicide rate offered a grim accompaniment this week to the tragedies of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain.
Since this column sometimes inclines to grim readings of our situation, it's important to stress how genuinely good recent economic trends have been. Yes, structural problems are still present -- wage growth should be faster, work-force participation should be higher. But a lot of commentary circa 2012 seemed to assume that unemployment might never get down below 4 percent, either because Obamacare was killing jobs and a debt crisis was looming, or because Republican obstruction was sabotaging the economy, or because technological change was automating too many jobs and dooming the less-skilled to the dole.
Most of this looks wrong now. Deficits haven't crushed growth and Obamacare hasn't kept people from going back to work. Economic inequality isn't throttling the economy; indeed, as Michael Strain pointed out for Bloomberg News this week, inequality has stopped rising over the last decade or so, and if you include government transfers it's going down. The robots may take all our jobs eventually, but not just yet. The idea that only some truly radical move -- a federal job guarantee, some sort of libertarian shock therapy -- could deliver us back to full employment looks less persuasive than it did five years ago.
And yet: The hope that material growth would heal our social problems hasn't been vindicated so far. And as long as that's the case, the improved economy shouldn't be treated just as an end unto itself, but as an opportunity to look for social cures as well.
For policymakers, that quest for healing starts with not doing any harm. If the economy is really cooking for the first time in almost 20 years, well, then let it cook. Don't freak out about deficits in the absence of inflation; don't draw up plans to nationalize the labor force; don't start an ill-conceived trade war; don't revive centrist dreams about cutting Social Security or suddenly increasing low-wage immigration.
Instead, see how far this expansion can go and how high it can lift people before making any sweeping, ideologically driven moves. And to the extent that you do make moves, design them for the social crisis -- whether that means wage subsidies or a larger child tax credit or opioid-related interventions or something else that might shore up Middle America's crumbling foundations.
Then, beyond the realm of legislation, there are various ways our civic institutions can take the grimmer social trends more seriously. For instance, instead of just letting themselves be carried along by information-age propaganda, our schools and colleges should look harder at the ways in which the smartphone era might be making social life worse among the young -- increasing isolation, worsening depression and anxiety and suicidal ideation, bringing up a generation that's well behaved in certain ways but strangely ill equipped to befriend and mate and marry.
Likewise America's churches, whose weakening is part of the story of growing anomie, should recognize the new mission fields that social disintegration has created here at home -- in once-pious working-class neighborhoods, or among the lonely late-middle aged and isolated elderly. (Pursuing these new missions would also be easier if liberals could recognize that their post-Obergefell culture war against conservative religious institutions does its own kind of damage to the social fabric.)
Of course, the wall-to-wall frenzy of the Trump era, in which everyone is constantly being asked to take sides in a battle to the death, makes these kinds of cultural efforts harder to formulate and pursue. But they're what our moment, with its partially regained prosperity and ongoing cultural crisis, may be asking of us -- because this welcome growth won't last forever, and social problems unsolved now will be that much worse when it is gone.

Full text: AMMAN, Jordan -- The government of Jordan announced on Thursday that it would withdraw a divisive tax bill after nationwide protests rocked the country, leading to the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet.
The newly appointed prime minister, Omar Razzaz, said in a statement that he had consulted members of both houses of Parliament, and that there was a consensus that the tax bill should be withdrawn.
"This is a law that impacts all Jordanians," Mr. Razzaz said. "It will be withdrawn and re-examined through national dialogue."
The tax proposal was the latest in a series of measures Jordan took after securing a $723 million, three-year line of credit from the International Monetary Fund in 2016. The changes aimed to lower the country's public debt, which totals $35 billion, to advance economic overhauls and to enhance growth.
The decision to withdraw the bill, which proposed increasing the tax rate on workers by at least five percentage points and on businesses by 20 to 40 percentage points, was lauded by many in Jordan, where the official unemployment rate is 18 percent and poverty rates are even higher. Inflation rates grew 50 percent from 2006 to 2017, yet incomes are hardly budging.
Jordan, an important ally in the region for the United States, is largely deprived of natural resources. It has depended on regular foreign aid, and its economic pressures have been compounded by a huge influx of refugees, including hundreds of thousands from war-torn Syria.
Last week, thousands of Jordanians began taking to the streets, in the largest protests in the country since the Arab Spring in 2011. They have drawn diverse crowds, including engineers, doctors, taxi drivers, university students and unemployed young people, and they spread nationwide when more than 30 labor unions staged the largest strike in years.
Even after the prime minister resigned on Monday, demonstrators kept up the pressure, protesting daily, calling for the tax law to be withdrawn and for an end to what they perceive as endemic corruption and a lack of accountability.
Maintaining stability in Jordan is a top American priority in the region. In 2015, the Obama administration and Jordan signed a three-year agreement in which the United States pledged $1 billion in assistance annually, subject to the approval of Congress. More recently, Washington pledged $6.3 billion in aid through 2022, making Jordan one of the top recipients of American foreign assistance.
Mr. Razzaz, who is expected to announce his cabinet in the coming days, said on Twitter on Wednesday that he wanted more dialogue with all stakeholders in order to agree on a comprehensive economic plan and to regain the trust of the people.

Market Keeps Climbing As Trade Worries Ease

Publication info: New York Times , Late Edition (East Coast); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]07 June 2018: B.5.

Full text: U.S. stocks rallied for their fourth gain in a row Wednesday as banks climbed along with bond yields. On Wall Street there were signs investors were getting a bit less nervous about trade tensions.
Some of the biggest gains went to industries that have lagged the market in the last few months, including financial companies. Interest rates rose as bond prices in the U.S. and Europe fell. That can signal higher rates on mortgages and other consumer loans. Bank of America gained more than 3 percent.
Multinational companies such as Boeing and McDonald's also rose. That helped the Dow Jones industrial average make its biggest gain in almost two months.
Worries about international trade disputes have been affecting the market since late February, but Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management, said investors might have started focusing on the strength of the U.S. economy and continued global growth instead.
"It's refreshing to see that investors are realizing this is an incredibly good economic backdrop and it's an incredibly good environment for companies to make money," she said. "We're in a sweet spot where we have some growth and low inflation and investors just don't want to believe it."
The S&P 500 index added 23.55 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,772.35. The Dow rose 346.61 points, or 1.4 percent, to 25,146.39. The Nasdaq composite rose 51.38 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,689.24. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks gained 11.32 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,675.95. The Nasdaq and Russell have set all-time highs each of the last few days.
Electric car maker Tesla surged to its biggest gain in two and a half years as investors grow more confident it will meet its production targets for the Model 3 sedan. Tesla rose 9.7 percent to $319.50.
Chairman and CEO Elon Musk said he expects the company will be able to produce 5,000 Model 3s in a single week by the end of this month. The Model 3 is Tesla's attempt to reach the mass market with a less expensive car. Tesla has struggled to reach that target, and doing so would help the company stem its long-term losses.
Bond prices slipped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.78 percent from 2.93 percent, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 2.3 percent to $110.36 and Wells Fargo added 2 percent to $55.58.
Banks have fallen over the last few months even though long-term interest rates have reached their highest levels in years. Health care and basic materials companies, which are essentially flat over the same period, did better than the rest of the market Wednesday. CVS Health rose 2.8 percent to $65.08 and chemical maker DowDuPont jumped 3.2 percent to $70.04.
That didn't mean investors were ready to overlook trade issues altogether. Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel's and other liquors, slumped 6.1 percent to $52.47. The company said it has concerns about how trade tensions might affect its business. On Tuesday, Mexico announced tariffs on bourbon and other U.S. products, and the European Union may place duties on Kentucky bourbon. The duties are in response to the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that President Trump imposed last week.
Brown-Forman's sales fell short of analyst projections while costs connected with the creation of a charitable foundation affected its earnings.
Devon Energy climbed after it said it will sell its interest in two companies for a total of $3.13 billion. Global Infrastructure Partners will buy its stakes in EnLink Midstream Partners and EnLink Midstream LLC. Devon increased its stock buyback authorization and the stock gained 5.6 percent to $41.51.
Signet Jewelers soared after the company had a stronger first quarter than Wall Street expected and said there are signs its sales are stabilizing. The company also maintained its annual forecasts. Signet traded as high as $75 a share in November. Since then it's reported weak sales, announced more store closings, and dealt with complications from the sale of its credit portfolio. The stock rose 18.4 percent to $52.27 Wednesday.
Athenahealth, a medical billing software company, climbed after it said it is exploring a possible sale. Investor Elliott Management recently offered about $6.5 billion to take Athenahealth private and said it had grown frustrated with the company's performance.
The company also said CEO Jonathan Bush resigned effective immediately. A few days earlier the New York Post reported that Bush settled a sexual harassment claim with a former employee several years ago. The stock advanced 4.2 percent to $157.44.
Benchmark U.S. crude shed 1.2 percent to $64.73 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, inched down to $75.36 per barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline fell 1.7 percent to $2.07 a gallon. Heating oil slid 0.7 percent to $2.13 a gallon. Natural gas rose 0.2 percent to $2.90 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Gold fell 0.1 percent to $1,301.40 an ounce. Silver rose 0.9 percent to $16.69 an ounce. Copper gained 2 percent to $3.26 a pound.
The dollar rose to 110.19 yen from 109.76 yen. The euro rose to $1.1768 from $1.1715.
The DAX in Germany rose 0.3 percent, as did the FTSE 100 in Britain. France's CAC 40 lost 0.1 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rose 0.4 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent. South Korean markets were closed for a holiday.

Full text: Jean M. Twenge Professor of psychology, San Diego State University; author of "iGen: Why Today's Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy -- and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood"
Not that long ago, the biggest distractions for college students were alcohol, sex, and parties. Now, there's another reason they aren't reading their textbooks and aren't paying attention in class: the siren song of the smartphone. Traditional-age college students are now iGen, the post-1995 generation who were the first to spend their entire adolescence with smartphones.
They are spending an extraordinary amount of time on electronic devices -- according to Common Sense Media, nine hours a day. Perhaps as a result, many students have a difficult time focusing, are distracted by devices during class and are sleep-deprived. As with many things, however, the solution is education.
To help them focus while studying, we can tell students about the truth of "multitasking" -- it doesn't exist, because the human brain can only consciously focus on one thing at a time. Advise students to try setting aside their devices and reading their course materials for 10 minutes straight before doing anything else. The next day, it can be 15 minutes, and then 30, and then an hour.
To improve classroom engagement, tell students about the research showing that students who take notes longhand, on paper, do better on exams than those who take notes on laptops. Consider having them put their laptops away during class time -- laptops, with their temptations of social media sites and web surfing, are a distraction much more often than they are useful.
Tell students to shut down their phones an hour before bedtime. In addition to being psychologically stimulating, phones are also physiologically stimulating. The blue light they emit inhibits the sleep hormone melatonin, making sleep significantly more elusive. Not sleeping enough is linked to not just the inability to focus but to unhappiness, depression, and poor physical health. None of this means giving up our technology -- it just means using it for what it's good for, and then putting it away.
John Hechinger A senior editor at Bloomberg News and the author of "True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America's Fraternities"
America's colleges must bring together students of all races and backgrounds "if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized," the United States Supreme Court ruled in its 2003 defense of affirmative action. Yet, from the moment freshmen set foot on a college campus, this mission confronts a powerful barrier: fraternities and sororities.
Historically white Greek-letter organizations typically have few minority members, and some chapters have none at all. It's a legacy of their civil rights-era resistance to integration. This is no small matter. At many universities, these organizations offer grand houses -- in some cases, on public land -- that dominate the social scene. The rich returns on this social capital include student-college presidencies, internships and success in business and politics.
African-American and other minority Greek organizations -- separate and unequal -- generally don't have houses of their own.
Two episodes in April reveal how these divisions can create a toxic culture. At Syracuse University, members of the Theta Tau engineering fraternity posted videos of themselves pledging "to always have hatred in my heart" for African Americans, Hispanics and Jews, using a slur for each group. During a California Polytechnic State University multicultural weekend, white members of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity dressed as gang members -- one in blackface.
A 2014 study of F.B.I. hate-crime statistics from 349 colleges found that campuses with large populations of historically white fraternities are more likely to report verbal and physical assaults involving bias against blacks and other minorities. Another study found that Greek life inhibits friendship across racial lines and promotes opposition to policies promoting diversity.
Still, colleges often embrace fraternities and sororities for their philanthropy and leadership. There needs to be more oversight. Deans should require each chapter to demonstrate its openness by disclosing its demographics, including race and socioeconomic background. The resulting public pressure on segregated fraternities and sororities could help achieve the vision of inclusion enshrined in law and the Constitution.

President, Pennsylvania State University
Society's benefits from the innovations of higher education are priceless. The research, both fundamental and applied, holds great promise for everything -- promoting economic vitality, protecting life and property and improving the quality of life.
Yet universities today are operating in a relentlessly difficult fiscal environment. Public universities have experienced a decade of weak state support, and more tuition increases are in direct conflict with our mission of access and affordability. Major research universities are facing a huge issue with aging research infrastructure because many of our buildings were built as part of our nation's competitive posture more than 50 years ago.
Continual belt-tightening is creating a number of negative outcomes. Harry Houdini was never bound this tightly.
The challenge for colleges and universities, private and public, is to find funding for innovation in such a constrained fiscal environment.
First, innovation has to be a core priority, as important as paying for salaries, health insurance, deferred maintenance and unfunded mandates.
Second, we need to ensure that innovation deliberately drives job creation, economic development and student career success by bringing research discoveries to the marketplace. We must develop a culture that nurtures and rewards entrepreneurship -- not just in STEM, but in the arts, health and human development, education and more.
Third, we need to foster the power of partnership -- with local government leaders, legislative representatives, communities, business leaders, faculty and students.
Innovation is inspiring. It's also a wise investment with an even better return. Economists at Deloitte found that technology has been a "great job-creating machine," increasing spending, creating a new demand and boosting jobs in knowledge-intensive sectors.
Research and education have always opened doors that benefit the nation we serve. This is a challenge we are well equipped to conquer.
Michael R. Bloomberg
Founder, Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies; mayor of New York City, 2002-13
One of the biggest challenges in education today is an ideological disagreement over whether we should focus on getting every student accepted to a four-year college, or whether we should place far more emphasis on career preparation.
The truth is, we need to do both -- and the problem is, we're not doing either one very well.
Right now, too many students are not prepared to enter either college or the work force -- and too often, those who are ready for college don't go to competitive schools that match their abilities. Less than half of 1 percent of students from the poorest 20 percent of families attend a selective college, even though many have the grades to do so. At the same time, about four in 10 teenagers do not enter college immediately after high school, and many are left with few career choices and nowhere to turn for help.
We need to do better for our kids, and our foundation is working to deliver for them.
Bloomberg Philanthropies is supporting local leaders around the country who are adopting changes that have proven to raise student achievement and put more students on track for college. We have also launched the American Talent Initiative, a coalition of 100 of the most selective colleges and universities that are committed to increasing the number of lower-income, high-achieving students that they accept and graduate.
Our goal is to have an additional 50,000 students at these schools by 2025. And through a second initiative we created called CollegePoint, which guides students through the application and financial aid processes, we're helping ensure they apply to and enroll in the kinds of schools they have earned the right to attend.
Career and technical education is an even more difficult challenge. Many vocational programs across the country are trapped in the 1960s and '70s. We need states and districts to invest in new, higher-quality programs that train students for a wide variety of industries -- from construction and advanced manufacturing to health care and information technology. Creating pathways to careers also requires forming partnerships with local employers, who can provide training and skill development in growing fields.
Hopefully, more political leaders will step up to support these kinds of changes that will prepare students for college and careers, and we will support those that do.

Fueled from the top and fed by social media, anti-intellectualism challenges the core of higher education.
And somehow, the fuel and fire have become indistinguishable. Social media honors the quick opinion, the lightning-fast response, the emotionally charged declaration. Every millisecond, anyone can weigh in on any conceivable matter. The writer, often anonymous, is inconsequential. Expertise is meaningless. Thoughtfulness, considered and informed opinion, hard-earned by those who have studied, debated, read and written, is suspect. Where is this feared hotbed of intellectualism? At today's colleges and universities.
Of course, anti-intellectualism has been brewing before tweets; well before the days when my 12-year-old nephew and the president joined forces to weigh in on crucial world issues. Nor are we in a unique time and place where intellectuals have become the enemy of the people. So what can we do to honor the intellect ... to tamp down the notion that intellectual rigor is detrimental to society?
While we accept excellence and, dare I say, elitism in our athletes, and artists, so must we learn to honor, and not be afraid of intellectual excellence. These are lessons we learn young: paying homage to an extraordinary soccer player or a talented singer, while the exceptional thinkers and learners toil in obscurity, often ridiculed as socially inept.
The hyped-up dichotomies of conservative vs. liberal and STEM vs. humanities in higher education obfuscates the commonality of those entrusted to educate the populace. They are all intellectuals -- learned thinkers. Instead of running from the label, we need honor and embrace it. Celebrate the intellect and we will, once again, celebrate higher education.
Sara Goldrick-Rab
Professor of higher education policy and sociology at Temple University
As colleges and universities try to raise graduation rates, college presidents, policymakers and philanthropists often focus on what students know when they enter college, how they perform on tests and what courses and majors they choose. Rarely do they consider whether their students have enough to eat or a safe place to sleep.
Higher education neglects Abraham Maslow's lessons at its peril. Without their basic needs secured, large numbers of today's undergraduates are struggling to learn. Sleepless nights and empty stomachs distract them from going to class and passing their courses, prolonging or even preventing degree completion.
Food and housing insecurity are not the personal problems of a few low-income or first-generation students. They stem from systemic failures of both policy and practice and affect millions. Surveys conducted at community colleges and four-year colleges and universities around the country indicate that at least one-third of students at bachelor's degree-granting institutions and between 40 and 50 percent of community college students are dealing with food and/or housing insecurity.
Sizable numbers of students are also coping with homelessness. Two recent national studies suggest that 12 to 14 percent of community college students experienced homelessness in the last year.
The good news is that we can solve these problems without turning colleges and universities into social service agencies. We are trying to change the work requirement of public benefits programs so that college counts as work, and full-time students can access benefits like subsidized housing and nutrition assistance programs. Creating productive partnerships with community partners, including private businesses, can provide new resources and even affordable housing opportunities.
Delivering emergency aid to students in small amounts just when they need it can help keep them in school and connected to their institutions. These efforts yield strong returns on investments for both colleges and their partners -- a housing dollar spent helping a displaced worker complete a technical certificate and obtain a job improves his or her earning potential and reduces the likelihood of needing public benefits in the future.
College has always been a challenge for people without substantial resources, but now even students from middle-class families are struggling. Work opportunities are scarce, the value of the minimum wage is down, and college prices are higher than ever and continuing to rise.
Colleges that want students to not only enroll but also graduate need to acknowledge this hidden crisis and take the lead in addressing it.

Affordability is the most significant challenge facing higher education. Year after year, tuition increases outpace the cost of inflation and growth in most sectors of the economy. Higher tuition means fewer people can afford to go to college. This isn't just a problem at the most elite, private universities: At every type of school, from community colleges to state universities, rising costs not only raise barriers to entry but decrease completion rates.
Getting into college is one thing, but experiencing college at the precipice of financial insolvency is another. For too many middle- and low-income students, coming up short a few hundred dollars can send them over the cliff.
In an economy of unprecedented wealth inequality, the affordability crisis further exacerbates social and racial stratification. Affluent white families leverage their resources, networks and legacy status on behalf of their children. Privilege begets privilege.
Poorer families have few of these advantages, especially among historically marginalized populations. These students are at the mercy of debt schemes, too few scholarships, and poor-performing for-profit schools. More and more, where you go to school is becoming as predictive of your future as your ZIP code is.
With globalization and automation, college is not just about a decent job. Despite widespread anti-intellectualism and state legislative divestment policies, higher education should be the foundation of a universal experience of civic participation that promotes cultural literacy, a fairer distribution of wealth and the common good. The very health of our democracy is at stake.
What to do?
Higher education leaders can fix affordability by building advocacy networks among alumni and mobilizing them to pressure state legislatures to reinvest in public higher education for all. This is an untapped reservoir of political muscle.
Likewise, the heads of private colleges and universities can redirect wealthy donors away from naming opportunities to fully endow scholarships that level the financial and racial playing field. In all, leaders who care about the cost of higher education must intentionally make the case, on campus and off, for a more just society in the 21st century.
Wes Moore
Chief executive, Robin Hood Foundation
I can't overstate how important my college education was to changing my trajectory. Raised by a single mom in Baltimore and the Bronx in the '80s and '90s, I joined the Army at 17, and enrolled in junior college on a journey that would take me to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Today, families across the country know what my family knew: College can change lives.
The data bears this out. A study highlighted in The New York Times shows that college graduates earn 71 percent more than Americans who only graduate high school.
But while this path to prosperity may still exist in America, it is far more precarious than many realize. We're promising too many young Americans a pathway to success, and instead setting them up for failure.
Today, most students don't finish college in a traditional fashion. This is the untold college crisis in America -- the college completion crisis. In today's America, the majority of college students do not graduate on time, racking up debt, and undermining the investment and potential that college is designed to offer. At the majority of public universities, just 19 percent of students earn a four-year degree in four years.
This crisis constitutes a collective and systemic failure of our academic institutions. High schools, while graduating historic numbers of students, are not equipping them with the skills they'll need in college. Every year, 1.7 million students need remedial courses as they enter college. Just one in 10 of these students will ever graduate. Tuition costs raise at a rate far higher than inflation and wages, and throw families seeking opportunity into debt. Too many colleges are unprepared for the nontraditional students filling their classrooms.
Addressing this collective breakdown will require a collective buildup with how we approach postsecondary education. We must do a better job preparing students for college in high school. We must also provide wraparound supports for students in their first years of college so they don't fall through gaps that are deceptively wide. We must make it easy to receive financial aid, as every year, nearly $3 billion in federal financial aid is left unclaimed because people don't fill out the paperwork correctly. And we must offer effective trade schools and training programs for those students for whom traditional college is not the right fit.
We're promising too many young Americans a pathway to success, and instead setting them up for failure. We can and we must fix this.

When it comes to accountability in education, we're losing ground. After nearly three decades of bipartisan work, the effort to close achievement gaps and push for steady improvement in school performance has stalled.
This drift away from accountability is hurting our most vulnerable students -- those most in need of a strong education. And it's already eroding trust in our schools and universities.
There's no question that measuring educational progress is complicated. But the only thing worse than imperfect accountability is none at all.
Past administrations helped build a broad coalition of business leaders, civil rights advocates and policymakers from across the ideological spectrum to support high standards for all students. There was a shared recognition that honest assessment is needed for real progress. No more hiding underserved populations within statistical averages; no more acceptance of inequity as inevitable.
My experience as a university president these past few years underscores the need to align policies and expectations. In a state, like all others, where minority college completion lags, where rural students are underrepresented and where low-income students graduate at far lower rates than their wealthier peers, our universities had excellent intentions but poor incentives.
Only through straightforward accountability measures can we focus on our greatest challenges. In North Carolina, that's meant brokering performance agreements with each of the U.N.C. System's chancellors to outline goals that are measured publicly and tied back to our state's Strategic Plan.
Accountability must come from every level, and it's the role of the federal government -- of good policymakers everywhere -- to make certain all students benefit from the enormous investment we all make in education. Without accountability, there is no equity.
Ralph Reed
Chairman, Faith and Freedom Coalition
Higher education faces many daunting challenges: relevance to millennials seeking opportunity in a global, high-tech economy; rising costs and exploding student debt; big-money athletics crowding out the core educational mission. But the greatest challenge may be the need to inculcate character.
The financial crisis of 2008-9 painfully reminded us that great wealth without integrity always goes up in smoke. The easy credit that fueled massive profits on Wall Street led to a loss of $8 trillion held by U.S. households. The same could be said for the privacy and advertising scandals that have lopped billions off the market cap of Facebook and other social media companies. When greed comes before character and the common good, we are all the losers.
If colleges and universities teach the young people that are their charge how to think well but not how to act ethically, how to grow a business but not how to do so with moral standards, if they shape the intellect but fail to inculcate integrity, they fail in their ultimate mission.
How best to do this? Universities should integrate instruction on ethics and morality into business and other curriculums. In most cases -- though not all -- these ethics derive from a faith tradition. The joint M.B.A. degree program between the Yale Divinity School and the Yale School of Management provides a good model. Man does not live by bread alone.
That is as true today as it was when Jesus of Nazareth taught it 2,000 years ago.
Theodore Roosevelt, who graduated from Harvard, once observed, "A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth more than a college education." The pioneers of American higher education understood this fact. Roughly two-thirds of American colleges founded in the 18th and 19th centuries were affiliated with a religious denomination and undergraduate curriculums for much of our nation's history included instruction in the Bible as well as the ancient languages of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew in which it was originally written.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text: American teachers are angry.
They have taken to the streets in West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Arizona, Colorado -- and more recently in North Carolina. Dissent is building in Louisiana and Nevada, too.
But while the protests are spreading this year, the underlying conflict between public school employees and policymakers has roots in decisions made during the last recession, when states and local districts short of cash curtailed education spending for the first time in decades.
This had a pronounced effect on school staffing, with layoffs hitting many states. Districts cut support staff as well as regular classroom teachers. In North Carolina, the number of teachers is down 5 percent since peaking in 2009, while the number of teaching assistants is 28 percent lower. And teacher pay stagnated nonetheless.
Moreover, the recovery that has lifted the private economy has not quite restored school spending to pre-recession levels, especially in states run by fiscal conservatives determined to hold the line on government spending.
For a system that had experienced nothing but spending growth for a quarter century, the past few years have been a major shock. K-12 spending per pupil rose 26 out of 29 years before 2010, only to tumble three consecutive years at the beginning of this decade.
"Per-pupil spending went up forever," says Matthew Chingos, director of the Urban Institute's education policy program.
One reason for the consistent rise was a movement in education to reduce class sizes by adding teachers, and to provide more social services beyond basic instruction. These efforts picked up steam in the 1990s in part in reaction to publication of Jonathan Kozol's "Savage Inequalities," which documented the vast disparities in school spending between wealthy and poor school districts, spurring lawsuits and education reform movements in many states to equalize funding by enlarging the overall pot of education money.
"The book highlighted these hideous inequalities in schooling, where there were 50 kids in a class with pipes that were broken and stuff like that, and there was a very good, earnest push toward increasing equity," said Marguerite Roza, a research professor and director of the Edunomics Lab at Georgetown University.
Then came a one-two punch to the growth in education spending: The recession worsened financial problems already widespread in many states, and voters began electing conservative governors and legislatures that promised to rein in budget woes with spending cuts.
Almost every state reduced education spending during the recession. But as the national economy recovered, education spending did not return to the historical pattern of steady growth across all states. By 2016, more than half of states controlled by Democrats had restored education spending per pupil to 2009 levels, but the same was true in only 5 of 22 states controlled by Republicans.
Some red states have seen slower growth in state and local revenues, in part because of economic factors but also because of tax cuts. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, notes that seven states with school funding controversies -- Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina and Oklahoma -- cut taxes in recent years.
In Kansas, where conservatives had been particularly aggressive in cutting the size of government, the state Supreme Court recently ruled the school funding system there unconstitutional because it failed to meet state requirements to finance education adequately. Republican lawmakers were further shocked when their handpicked consultant's report tied increased funding to improved outcomes and recommended billions in additional education spending.
On top of fiscal policy decisions, a more fundamental concern is the increasing volatility of state tax revenues, says Bruce Baker, a professor of education at Rutgers University who studies school finance.
States cover about 47 cents of every dollar spent on public education, with a further 45 cents raised locally, mostly through property taxes, and 8 cents coming from the federal government.
Real estate values swing more wildly now than in the past, and traditional wage income has become a decreasing share of the income tax base, making revenue streams less reliable and harder to predict.
The political climate has also made it tougher to overhaul the tax system in any way that could be perceived as a tax increase, whether in good economic times or bad.
It's easy to see why teachers are in the vanguard of the protest. Teacher salaries make up the bulk of education spending -- so when education spending stagnates or is cut, teachers feel the pain most directly.
In many of the states spending less on education, average teacher pay has fallen sharply. Nationwide, pay is down 5 percent this decade, to an average of $58,950 from $61,804.
But this doesn't necessarily mean administrators are cutting teacher pay. It also, in some states, signifies high teacher turnover, with older, higher-paid teachers retiring and being replaced by younger, lower-paid ones.
Over all, however, the American teaching force is growing more experienced, not less. And federal data shows that teacher pay nationally has fallen in inflation-adjusted terms. Compared with 2007-2008, starting teacher pay is lower, as is average pay for more experienced teachers.
Protests over these cuts have been directed mostly at state capitols, where overall education policy is administered.
Yet in states that have struggled with education funding, local revenues have also played a role, especially in red states. Census data shows that while reductions in state aid were universal during the recession, many blue states -- which tend to be wealthier to begin with -- still experienced local revenue growth that somewhat mitigated the losses.
Not so in many red states, where schools saw reductions in both state and local funding.
"Many states will cut state aid for schools and then impose limits on property tax increases as part of a broader package pushing for austerity in spending," Mr. Baker said.
Property taxes to fund education have been attacked by both small-government conservatives and by liberals who note the wide disparity in tax bases in wealthy and poorer communities.
Despite the inequity, "local money was the most relatively stable and healthy" revenue source for education, Ms. Roza said, "and so closing that spigot meant it was much harder to fund education from the statehouse."
"Inevitably, state budgets were competing with Medicaid and pensions and higher ed funding," she said, "and so that money could not grow as fast as local money could grow."
The nation's chief educator, Betsy DeVos, recently tweeted a chart depicting the huge increase in education spending plotted against a less than stellar trend line showing student performance: "Test scores continue to stagnate. This is not something we're going to spend our way out of."
Ms. DeVos's critics, however, say there are many factors that could be holding overall test performance down.
And recent studies have found that spending disparities matter. University of Pennsylvania researchers showed the impact of the recession was greater on low-income students, particularly in districts with major budget cuts.
Another paper, by a researcher at Northwestern University, found that students in districts that cut funding the most in the wake of the recession posted lower test scores than peers and were less likely to graduate from high school.
It now seems the pendulum is swinging toward spending growth in states that had been lagging.
Teachers in West Virginia and Oklahoma protested and won a pay raise. Pressure from educators spurred the Kentucky legislature to block the governor from vetoing the budget. And in Georgia, political pressure forced leaders to fully fund the state aid formula for the first time in years.
Attention has turned to North Carolina, where thousands of teachers protested at the opening of the state legislative session. North Carolina teachers once ranked 19th in the nation in pay, but now rank 37th.

Millionaires Are Fleeing. Maybe You Should, Too.

Full text: Tracking the rich has become a voyeuristic global industry, a form of celebrity worship. But it can also provide serious clues about where countries are headed.
When a country begins to fall into economic and political difficulty, wealthy people are often the first to ship their money to safer havens abroad. The rich don't always emigrate along with their money, but when they do, it is an even more telling sign of trouble.
Since 2013, New World Wealth, a research outfit based in South Africa, has been tracking millionaire migrations by culling property records, visa programs, news media reports and information from travel agents and others who cater to the wealthy. In a global population of 15 million people each worth more than $1 million in net assets, nearly 100,000 changed their country of residence last year.
In most countries it is fair to assume that any millionaire exodus is composed mainly of locals, and not foreign investors, because the wealthy classes will be dominated by citizens or longtime residents. In 2017, the largest exoduses came out of Turkey (where a stunning 12 percent of the millionaire population emigrated) and Venezuela. As if on cue, the Turkish lira is now in a free fall. There were also significant migrations out of India under the tightening grip of its overzealous tax authorities, and from Britain under the cloud of Brexit.
On the flip side, slowing outflows can be a welcome sign, and in 2017 the biggest shift for the better came in that caldron of anti-rich hostility, France.
Equally surprising was the lack of change in the United States, where the arrival of a billionaire president did not seem to attract or repel millionaires. A net total of 9,000 millionaires migrated to the United States last year, but they represent a drop in the ocean of five million American millionaires.
Just like the less wealthy, millionaires seemed unsure of America's direction under an unpredictable president who offers tax cuts and deregulation for the rich, but also bashes foreigners and occasionally talks like a pitchfork-waving populist.
Britain and France appeared to be trading places as magnets for wealth. For decades the rich had been drawn to Britain by circumspect banks, loose regulations and the comforts of London. Until 2016, Britain had a sizable influx of millionaires every year, but the flow suddenly reversed last year with a net exodus of 3,000, amid fears that as Britain exits the European Union, London will fade as a financial capital. It did not help that in 2017 the government raised taxes on foreigners who buy property.
France had long been seen as the anti-Britain, a left-leaning bastion of prying bureaucrats and high taxes that scared off the wealthy, despite the charms of Paris. But the growing exodus of millionaires peaked in 2016 with a net outflow of 12,000, then slowed sharply to just 4,000 last year. The most likely reason: the May election of Emmanuel Macron, the youngest president in French history, who promised a lighter-touch bureaucracy less hostile to business and lowered wealth and capital gains taxes.
Granted, displaced millionaires get little if any sympathy, but no country gains by losing the talent and capital of its wealthiest residents, particularly not emerging countries like India. Stunningly, India in 2017 suffered a net loss of 7,000 members, or 2 percent, of its millionaire population. That exodus came despite global optimism about India's growth prospects and matched the flight from the stagnant and sanction-battered economy of Russia, which also lost 2 percent of its millionaire population.
This unusual flight from India's high-growth economy may be driven by the elite's growing concerns about an official anticorruption drive and "tax terrorism" -- unlimited authority given to tax officials to target the rich. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government has lately begun catering to the nation's deep socialist streak, wielding state power to flush out and tax hidden pockets of wealth.
In the worst cases, bouts of capital flight can gain momentum until the value of the currency collapses, plunging the nation into crisis. Balance of payments records show that 10 of the last 12 major currency crises, dating back to the Mexican peso meltdown of 1994, began when residents started sending money abroad, which was typically two years before the currency collapsed. Often politicians blamed "evil" and "immoral" foreign speculators for these crises, but it was the locals who first saw trouble coming.
Right now, this forensic accounting offers clear evidence of looming financial difficulty in only one major country: Turkey. Starting early last year, affluent Turks began effectively moving large sums of money out of the country by exchanging their lira bank deposits for dollars and euros, while foreigners continued to buy Turkish assets.
The 12 percent decline in Turkey's millionaire population last year was by far the largest of any major economy, and second only to the 16 percent decline in Venezuela, with its small, hyperinflationary economy. Turkey's millionaires appear to be fleeing both deteriorating financial conditions marked by very high inflation, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on his critics, including those in business.
Millionaire migrations can be a positive sign for a nation's economy. The losses for India, Russia and Turkey were gains for havens like Canada and Australia, joined lately by the United Arab Emirates. Owing largely to the stability and glitter of the most famous emirate, Dubai, the United Arab Emirates in 2017 had a net inflow of 5,000 millionaires, increasing the size of its affluent population by 6 percent, the largest gain in the world. Britain was among the millionaire havens until 2016, but may continue losing ground until it can resolve the uncertainties raised by Brexit.
Savvy locals are also the first to return when a country's fortunes begin to turn for the better. In seven of the last 12 major currency crises, residents started bringing money back earlier than foreigners.
More broadly, economists and politicians might rethink the blame they heap on "immoral" foreigners in periods of capital flight. They assume global money managers are more sophisticated than provincial locals -- but those longtime residents are in fact quicker to spot and respond to trouble in their own backyards. They might also assume that residents are more loyal than foreigners. But the drive to protect one's assets often trumps patriotism.
Millionaires move money mainly out of self-interest, to find more rewarding or safer havens. There aren't a lot of them, but they can tell us a great deal about what is going wrong -- and right -- in a country's economic and political ecosystems. Leaders who create the right conditions to keep millionaires home will find that all of their residents -- not just the wealthy ones -- are richer for it.

Full text: Friday's jobs report was a blockbuster: Job growth rebounded after a recent dip, and the unemployment rate fell to a nearly two-decade low. But it's worth taking a step back and putting the latest numbers in some longer-run context.
The United States lost nearly 8.7 million jobs in the Great Recession and its aftermath. It has gained 18.9 million since then -- a powerful rebound that belied fears of another "jobless recovery." (Net growth was needed just to keep pace with the working-age population, which has increased by about 10 million during the same period.)
Politicians, investors and, yes, journalists love to obsess over the month-to-month swings in the job numbers. But the true story of the recovery is one of remarkable consistency. American employers have added jobs for 92 straight months -- far and away the longest streak on record -- and apart from a few blips, the gains have been steady.
The trend in job growth is easier to see by focusing on the year-over-year growth at any point, rather than the more volatile monthly figures. Looked at this way, hiring accelerated early in the recovery, peaking in early 2015 at a pace of more than three million jobs per year. Growth gradually tapered after that, which isn't surprising -- most economists expected the rate of job creation to keep falling as companies recovered from the downturn and the pool of available workers dried up.
More recently, though, job growth has experienced an unexpected uptick. Employers have added an average of 207,000 jobs per month so far in 2018, up from 172,000 in the same five months a year ago. It's too soon to say whether that acceleration is the start of a new trend or just a blip. But many economists expect the faster pace of growth to continue because of the tax cuts passed in December and the extra government spending approved by Congress in January.
All that hiring has gone a long way toward putting Americans back to work. The unemployment rate, now 3.8 percent, is the lowest since 2000. The progress is increasingly reaching groups that often face discrimination or other disadvantages in the job market: The unemployment rate for African-Americans hit its lowest level on record in May. The jobless rates for Hispanics, teenagers and those with less than a high school education are likewise at or near multidecade lows.
The unemployment rate doesn't tell the full story, however. Government statistics count people as unemployed only if they are looking for work, a definition that excludes people who are voluntarily or involuntarily out of the labor force entirely. During the recession and recovery, that distinction was crucial: The official unemployment rate ignored millions of people who had abandoned their job searches as hopeless. Eight years of job growth, however, have shrunk the pool of "discouraged" workers, and broader definitions of unemployment all show strong progress.
But while the labor market today is healthy, there are signs it still isn't booming the way it was in 1999 and 2000. The employment rate -- the share of adults who have jobs, a measure that avoids tricky questions about who should count as unemployed -- still hasn't returned to its prerecession level. That's largely because of the retirement of the baby boom generation. But even adjusted for the aging work force, the employment rate is below its peak in 2000.
Then there is the mystery that has loomed over the job market in recent years: lackluster wage growth. With unemployment low, companies are increasingly complaining about a shortage of qualified labor. Yet that hasn't translated into fat raises for workers.
It's important to note that wages are rising. Average hourly earnings were up 2.7 percent in May from a year earlier, faster than inflation. And while noisy and sometimes conflicting data make it hard to discern a clear trend, there are signs that the pace of growth is accelerating, especially for lower earners.
Still, many economists think wages should be rising faster given the tight labor market. Economists are divided over what explains the disconnect, with some seeing evidence of a long-term, structural shift in the economy, and others arguing that the slow wage growth suggests there is still room for the economy to improve.
Chart MONTHLY CHANGE IN JOBS (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) (A1); A Record Run: The current streak of 92 months of job gains is by far the longest on record. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics); Back Where We Started: Fewer Americans, as a share of the population, have a job today than before the recession. But that's largely because of the aging of the baby boom generation. Adjusted for demographic shifts, the employment rate is back where it was before the recession, but still well short of its peak in 2000. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics); Making Progress, by Any Measure: The official unemployment rate can be misleading because it ignores people who have given up looking for work. But recently, even broader measures of unemployment and underemployment show substantial improvement. (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) (A16)

Full text: The real question in analyzing the May jobs numbers released Friday is whether there are enough synonyms for "good" in an online thesaurus to describe them adequately.
So, for example, "splendid" and "excellent" fit the bill. Those are the kinds of terms that are appropriate when the United States economy adds 223,000 jobs in a month, despite being nine years into an expansion, and when the unemployment rate falls to 3.8 percent, a new 18-year low.
"Salubrious," "salutary" and "healthy" work as words to describe the 0.3 percent rise in average hourly earnings, which are up 2.7 percent over the last year -- a nice improvement but also not the kind of sharp increase that might lead the Federal Reserve to rethink its cautious path of interest rate increases.
And a broader definition of unemployment, which includes people who have given up looking for a job out of frustration, fell to 7.6 percent. The jobless rate for African-Americans fell to 5.9 percent, the lowest on record, which we would count as "great."
If anything, some of the thesaurus offerings don't really do these numbers justice. But some aspects of the report would be fairly described as "solid," "decent" or "benign," such as the uptick in the ratio of the adult population that is employed to 60.4 percent, which only matches its recent high of earlier in the year.
Then there are other thesaurus synonyms for "good" that we don't normally use in reference to employment numbers, but which are apropos this month. For example, "congruous," in the sense that the various pieces of the report align with each other: Employers are creating more jobs, leading more people to work and fewer people to be unemployed, and leading wages to rise.
And the numbers are "propitious" and "agreeable" in that they affirm that the United States economy is in basically sound shape, displaying neither the slightest warning signs of recession nor any clear evidence of overheating and inflation risks.
Not all of the thesaurus words for "good" work quite so well in describing the May jobs numbers. For example, I've never tried to eat the 39-page report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but I'm pretty sure "toothsome" and "palatable" are not adjectives I would use.
I would also argue against viewing economic data through the kind of philosophical lens that might lead a person to view employment data as "virtuous" or "righteous." Macroeconomics is more like a really unpredictable machine than it is a morality play in which one set of policies is inherently more righteous than the other. (German economists, with their fierce opposition to deficits and fear of inflation, might disagree.)
So in an era of geopolitical risks and potential trade wars, the thing to take away from the May numbers is that the United States economy just keeps humming along at a steady pace, putting more people to work and at gradually higher wages.
It isn't perfect -- wage growth remains unexceptional despite its growth spurt in May, and the ratio of prime-age adults working remains below its historical levels.
But it has been a strikingly durable and steady expansion, which is what the nation needed after the scars of the 2008 recession. And that's just plain "good."

Let's Rain on Trump's Parade

Full text: The inflation of presidential power over the last century would mystify James Madison. He predicted that the people would be more loyal to legislators than to the executive and that Congress would jealously protect its power. Yet Congress has repeatedly ceded its authority in recent decades, and Americans, who have become more intensely partisan, increasingly form political identities based on their loyalty or opposition to the president.
President Trump's order for an extravagant parade showcasing American strength -- which the House recently endorsed in its version of the National Defense Authorization Act but which the Senate Armed Services Committee did not -- suggests one explanation for the swollen presidency. Americans and their legislators, being human, are awed by the spectacle of power. That is why those who are suspicious of power should not love this parade, whether or not they like Mr. Trump. The best reason for concern about the parade may be that a president, and not merely this president, proposed it.
There are more pressing issues of military policy, but this one is an important constitutional symbol. There are, of course, occasions for military celebrations. Victory is usually the chief one. But the pageant of arms being prepared at Mr. Trump's direction has no particular cause. It is a show of might, plain and simple. As such, it cannot help but adulate the person of the president who will command all that he surveys.
After-the-fact justifications for the proposed Veterans Day parade included celebrating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I and the century of American power that followed. House Republicans resorted to the old fallback that opposing the parade would disrespect the troops, who for too long "have been victims of political discord." They have? The military is among the most respected institutions in society, will receive more than $700 billion over the next fiscal year and does not need the additional currency that contemporary politics prizes most: victimhood.
The reality is that Mr. Trump got the idea for the parade from Bastille Day festivities he observed in France. But such performances are better suited to the more ornate traditions of Old Europe -- where presidents live in self-described palaces rather than the comparatively modest residence once known as "the President's House" -- than to the republican simplicity to which early Americans inclined.
Of course, ample water has flowed under the constitutional bridge since Thomas Jefferson endorsed republican simplicity by arriving for his inauguration on foot in a frock coat. Mr. Trump is hardly the first president to treasure the grandiose. But as a symbol, the military parade he is organizing should be understood less as a celebration of imperial grandeur than as a ploy for expanding presidential power by advertising it.
Despite the widespread assumption among his supporters that Mr. Trump is restoring the Constitution, he, like all his recent predecessors, is in this sense the heir not of Jefferson or Madison but rather of Woodrow Wilson. Wilson argued that the president should occupy the center of the constitutional system and take on "the imagination of the country."
Wilson's vision of the presidency has prevailed in no small part because of the fact of global American power, which is necessarily, though not exclusively, concentrated in executive hands.
But this does not explain why such power has not inspired republican jealousy but rather has bred cults of personality around nearly all recent presidents. John Adams, who was the most systematic political theorist among the American founders in addition to serving a term as president, helps solve the mystery.
As the political scientist Luke Mayville has shown, Adams argued that wealth commands influence not by means of corruption but rather by awing those who behold it. Power works similarly. Human beings are fascinated by it, and neither Americans nor their legislators are immune. In Mr. Trump's case, the seduction of both wealth and power is combined.
It is difficult to explain Congress's long-term abdication of authority solely in terms of political interest, since legislators are emptying out the power of the offices they seek to retain and use. But politicians are human like the rest of us. They may defer to power because they are enthralled by it. The same is true of journalists and others who fixate on the presidency.
That is why burnishing the aura of power with gratuitous displays like a military parade with no obvious occasion are constitutionally ill advised. Mr. Trump's conflation of opposition to himself with "treason" suggests his underlying impulse is not republican simplicity, which he never promised, but rather the baroque declaration of Louis XIV: "L'état, c'est moi." The parade will further fuse the person of the president and the regime. In a republic, such symbols matter as much as formal limitations on power.
There is a solution. Rather than endorsing the parade, Congress can still disenthrall itself from the gravitational seduction of power long enough to prohibit the use of federal funds to stage such a display. That may be an initial step on the road to a restoration of republican government in which, as Madison wrote, the legislature "necessarily predominates." Diminishing the spectacle of the presidency would be a welcome precursor to reducing its power.

China Makes Peace Offer Over Trade

Full text: SHANGHAI -- China announced Thursday evening that it would cut tariffs sharply on July 1 for an eclectic array of imported goods, the latest in a series of moves by Beijing to dismantle steep trade barriers at a time of rising frictions with the United States.
The tariff cuts came less than two days before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is due in Beijing for wide-ranging talks aimed at addressing American frustrations with China's $375 billion bilateral trade surplus with the United States. But the categories the Chinese Finance Ministry selected for tariff cuts cover few American goods, and appeared to be targeted at China's goal of developing sophisticated industries rather than low-value mass manufacturing.
The moves came as China and the United States, the world's two biggest economies, continued their wide-ranging economic and diplomatic sparring. The countries have alternated between attacking each other over trade issues and working together on efforts to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons. At times, President Trump has praised his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at other times he has swiftly criticized Beijing for its trade practices, sometimes in quick succession.
In its latest action, China is making a modest peace offering, without really giving up much.
Some of the 1,449 categories of goods slated for tariff cuts involve food products from other countries, like fish, olives and grilled seaweed. Other categories include low-value manufactured goods like handbags and certain inexpensive garments, typically made in factories that have already been shifting from China to lower-wage competitors like Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Vietnam.
Chinese workers' wages have soared over the past 15 years, and Beijing is engaged in a broad effort to steer the economy toward high-wage industries like semiconductors and away from factories making garments and handbags.
"The goods seeing cuts are not relevant to trade with the U.S.," said Derek Scissors, a trade specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank. "For China, it fits the goal of moving up the value chain -- heavy subsidies for semiconductors and now less protection for textiles and consumer appliances."
Christopher Rogers, a trade analyst at Panjiva, an international commerce data firm recently acquired by S.&P. Global Market Intelligence, estimated that the tariff cuts would cover about 1.1 percent of China's $1.95 trillion in annual imports. "The cuts are more to do with keeping a lid on inflation and improving consumer spending power than to do with keeping President Trump happy," he said.
The Chinese move could nonetheless have political benefits for Beijing.
China is energetically trying to rally other governments to its side in its showdown with the United States. Beijing's latest move could assuage concerns from many European countries and developing nations about their own trade deficits with China as well as loss of manufacturing jobs. At the same time, trade ministers elsewhere have been deeply troubled by the Trump administration's moves to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from around the world.
The announcement came just before Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced in Washington that the United States would begin imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union at midnight on Thursday.
President Trump had issued a statement on Tuesday threatening further tariffs on Chinese goods and contending that China's average tariff on imports was more than three times as high as that of in the United States, an assertion supported by World Trade Organization data. And China's tariff average is nearly double that of the European Union.
But by cutting tariffs in more than 1,000 lightly traded categories, China could end up reducing its average tariff considerably without actually running the risk of a big surge in imports.
The announcement in Beijing on Thursday t followed a recent decision by China to cut its tariff on imported cars to 15 percent from 25 percent. President Trump also criticized the Chinese car tariff on Tuesday, noting that the American tariff on imported cars was just 2.5 percent.
Mr. Xi, China's president, had called during a speech in April for cuts in Chinese tariffs on imported cars and some consumer goods, as part of Beijing's long-term policy of gradually opening to international competition.

As Fears About Italy Ease, Banks and Energy Firms Lift the Market Back Up

Full text: Banks and energy companies surged Wednesday and smaller companies made huge gains as stocks got back almost all the ground they lost the day before. Investors reversed course as they hoped Italy would be able to avoid a new round of elections after all.
Financial companies rallied as bond yields turned higher and energy companies rose along with U.S. crude oil, which busted out of a five-day losing streak. The shift came after Carlo Cottarelli, nominated to be Italy's next prime minister, said there were "new possibilities" to form a government.
Stocks had plunged the previous day as investors expected gridlock to be resolved with new elections that could have turned into a yes-or-no referendum deciding whether Italy would continue to use the euro.
JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade, said the market often reacts irregularly to political events like the uncertainty in Italy or tensions between the U.S. and North Korea: stocks often fall fast and then recover in quick fashion. That process can sometimes repeat itself weeks or months later.
"If there's no follow-up news, they tend to come back near where they started," he said. "I wouldn't count on it being done for the summer."
The S&P 500 index jumped 34.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,724.01. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 306.33 points, or 1.3 percent, to 24,667.78. The Nasdaq composite gained 65.86 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,462.45.
While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recovered Tuesday's losses and then some, smaller and more U.S.-focused companies did ever better as investors continued to worry about trade. Small companies finished with minor losses Tuesday, and on Wednesday they made even bigger gains than larger multinationals did. The Russell 2000 index surged 24.34 points, or 1.5 percent, and closed at a record high of 1,647.99.
The Chinese government criticized the U.S., which had renewed a threat to raise duties on some imports from China. At the same time, officials from the U.S. and European Union held talks on the tariffs the Trump administration has proposed on European steel and aluminum. European Union negotiations seemed pessimistic and said they expected the U.S. to announce a final decision Thursday.
China and the EU have both said they will react to new tariffs imposed by the U.S. with duties of their own, which has raised the prospect of greater tensions and the possibility of trade wars. Kinahan, of TD Ameritrade, said investors feel smaller companies are less vulnerable.
Multinational companies have had a rough ride lately as investors reacted to trade tensions by shifting money into smaller and more U.S.-focused companies.
"Much of their business is done domestically, so the tariffs shouldn't affect them as badly," he said. "But even if the tariffs don't happen, many of those stocks are performing well."
Italy's FTSE MIB stock index climbed 2.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop a day earlier. Prices for Italian government bonds also rose, sending yields down following a huge surge the day before.
The euro rose to $1.1648 from $1.1531, which was its lowest level in almost a year. The dollar rose to 108.85 yen from 108.24 yen.
Germany's DAX climbed 0.9 percent while the FTSE 100 index in Britain rose 0.7 percent. The CAC 40 in France lost 0.2 percent.
Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.84 percent from 2.79 percent. Interest rates rose and bank stocks recovered about half of their losses from Tuesday. When rates rise, banks can make more money on mortgages and other types of loans.
Energy companies rose as U.S. crude oil climbed 2.2 percent to $68.21 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 2.8 percent to $77.50 a barrel in London.
Exxon Mobil rose 3.9 percent to $81.50. That was its biggest one-day gain since September 2016.
Oil prices fell 7.6 percent in five days following reports OPEC countries and Russia might start producing more oil soon. Those countries cut production at the start of 2017, which helped take U.S. crude from about $50 a barrel in late 2016 to more than $70 this month. They had agreed to keep production at its current levels until the end of this year, but upheaval in Venezuela and new sanctions on Iran could change their plans.
Wholesale gasoline rose 1.9 percent to $2.18 a gallon. Heating oil gained 2.1 percent to $2.23 a gallon. Natural gas slid 0.6 percent to $2.89 per 1,000 cubic feet.
Investors also reacted to more earnings from retailers. Dick's Sporting Goods soared 25.8 percent to $38.35 after it raised its annual profit forecast. Its first-quarter report was better than expected thanks in part to strong online sales. Its decision to stop selling assault rifles and cease selling guns to people under 21 didn't appear to affect its business.
Clothing company Chico's FAS plunged 18.2 percent to $8.17 after its profit fell short of expectations and luxury retailer Michael Kors dropped 11.4 percent to $60.41 following a disappointing forecast for the year.
Gold rose 0.2 percent to $1,301.50 an ounce. Silver added 1 percent to $16.54 an ounce. Copper gained 0.2 percent to $3.07 a pound.
Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index dropped 1.5 percent and the Kospi of South Korea dropped 2. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong slipped 1.4 percent.

Full text: Italian political dysfunction is nothing new. Italian political dysfunction that ripples through global financial markets and has the potential to upend Europe is something the world woke up to Tuesday morning.
What are markets really signaling, and how much danger is there for the global economy? To answer, it helps to tease apart the crosscurrents between Italian politics, European institutions, financial markets and economies worldwide.
The New Political Risk in Italy
The Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, rejected an anti-E.U. nominee for economy minister, setting the stage for elections later in the year that, if a recent pattern repeats, could put in place a parliamentary majority that is hostile to European institutions.
In effect, those events have made it more likely that there will be a showdown between authorities in Rome and officials in Brussels, Berlin and Frankfurt over deficit spending, with an unraveling of the European Union one potential outcome, even if not the most likely one.
New Italian elections would help decide whether that is the case. In the last elections, in March, populist parties skeptical of European institutions won a comfortable majority of seats in parliament, but included both right-wing and left-wing parties that have struggled since then to form a coalition.
If the populists maintain or expand their advantages in elections, it raises the prospect of serious friction between Italian politicians looking to increase spending and a European Commission, European Central Bank and German government that insist upon fiscal austerity as a condition for, among other things, continued E.C.B. purchases of Italian bonds.
As a result, the European Union is entering yet another perilous phase, after years of crises that started in Greece nine years ago. No one would confuse the latest events with the high drama of the eurozone crisis from 2010 to 2012. But the ultimate stakes are higher. Italy is a much more populous country than Greece, more at the core of the European Union, and with much higher public debt.
What the Markets Are Telling Us
The movements Tuesday -- a spike in Italian bond yields, and drops in the euro and stocks worldwide -- suggest that the risk of some calamitous outcome for Europe has risen after a weekend of political drama in Rome, but that it's still an unlikely outcome.
So far, there are few signs of "contagion effects," in which developments in Italy could create a self-fulfilling crisis in other countries with similar economic challenges. But Italy is the third-largest economy in the eurozone and has one of the largest piles of public debt in the world. A crisis there could endanger banks and investment portfolios everywhere.
The Italian government's borrowing costs for two years soared from 0.94 percent to 2.42 percent Tuesday, as investors demanded greater compensation against the risk that the Italian government might repay them not with the rock-solid euro but with less valuable newly issued currency.
Meanwhile, Spanish two-year bond yields rose only slightly Tuesday -- by 0.07 percentage points, not the 1.48 percentage points of Italian yields.
"The contagion has been really muted," said Megan Greene, global chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. "I think investors are correctly looking at this as an Italy-specific risk for now."
Bond investors seem pretty well persuaded that the issue here is not a broad a loss of confidence in South European nations' ability to pay their debts. Since 2012, the European Central Bank has instilled confidence that it is willing to do "whatever it takes" -- to use the memorable phrase of the E.C.B. president Mario Draghi -- to preserve the euro.
Europe's Dilemma
What is happening in Italy is more a political crisis than a financial one. Mr. Draghi's tools are helpful only when a country's elected leaders are trying to avoid crisis. They are of little use if a government truly wants to break away from the rest of Europe.
Other European countries, especially powerful Germany, will have little desire to subsidize what they view as fiscal profligacy in Italy. The push toward greater economic unity across Europe since the Greek crisis has included jointly guaranteeing the continent's banks and the E.C.B.'s purchase of government bonds.
If there is conflict, both sides have reason to work things out. Germany and European institutions certainly don't want a crackup of the eurozone. And within Italy, the economic consequences of peeling away from Europe -- high inflation and lost savings in the near term and the long-term growth consequences from being a less appealing place for investment -- are severe enough that there would be reason to strike a deal.
Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone Macro, puts the chance that Italy will exit the euro at only around 10 percent to 15 percent. He argues in a research note that European institutions will probably seek to de-escalate the tensions in the coming months.
The Risks for the U.S. and the World
So far the damage to markets outside Italy is mostly limited to a sell-off in global stock markets, including a 1.2 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 index Tuesday. As is often the case when the rest of the world looks risky, money flowed into Treasury bonds, lowering interest rates in the United States.
No doubt Italy has the most at risk economically, followed by the rest of Europe. But one thing that has become clear over the last decade is how effects can spread unpredictably in times of financial disruption.
For the last decade, the world has experienced a rolling series of crises, in which financial turmoil fuels economic despair which intensifies political dysfunction which -- through financial markets -- can spread across oceans and repeat the pattern.
No one would have thought that a crisis centered on home mortgages in the United States would prove the trigger for crises in Greece and across Europe all those years ago. If things go badly in Italy, there's no telling where the damage could end up.

Full text: MEMPHIS -- The view from the chief executive's office window at Memphis International Airport is as sweeping as it is dispiriting: On a recent afternoon, he could see 10 empty jet bridges and not a single airliner. Later, at the curb in front of the terminal, there were only three cars dropping off passengers, and inside, a pair of moving walkways carried just three people between them.
An empty airport may sound heavenly to anyone who has had to cope with the crowds and chaos at La Guardia or Hartsfield-Jackson or O'Hare. But it is a humbling reality for Memphis.
To walk the airport's deserted corridors now is to know that its glory days of just a decade ago are gone, a glaring casualty of an airline merger that transformed the American aviation industry but cost the Mid-South's most important city its status as a hub.
So now, while many airports are desperately trying to figure out how to add more gates, more destinations, more parking, more restaurants and, for goodness' sake, more bathrooms, Memphis is grappling with the opposite, much rarer riddle: how to shrink gracefully.
"We spend most of our careers trying to figure out how to grow passengers and grow facilities," said Scott A. Brockman, the president and chief executive of the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority. "To remove things, without a plan to rebuild them better, is really a painful thing for an airport guy."
Memphis used to be a regular transfer stop for business and leisure travelers, when Northwest Airlines was the dominant carrier and the airport was marketed as a "hassle-free" hub. But then Delta Air Lines gobbled up Northwest, and decided it only needed one hub in the South, its own base in Atlanta. The decision cost Memphis almost two-thirds of its passengers: From more than 11 million in 2007, the last full year before the merger announcement, the count fell to about four million last year.
That has sometimes left the spacious three-concourse terminal looking staggeringly deserted, with most of its gates unused. The airport's solution is to spend $219 million on what it is calling a modernization effort: closing and renovating Concourse B, and then consolidating operations there and essentially mothballing Concourses A and C.
The plan is as much a push toward the future as it is an admission that Memphis -- the sign at the entrance still calls it "America's Aerotropolis" -- is a lesser passenger magnet these days than Omaha or Columbus, Ohio, or even the second airport serving Dallas.
"It was death by a thousand cuts," said Mr. Brockman, who has worked at the airport long enough that he can recall when the terminal was "bustling," "crazy" and "kind of orchestrated mayhem."
Memphis had few role models to look to. The closest analogue, industry experts said, was Pittsburgh, which had to reimagine its airport after US Airways, which is now part of American Airlines, stopped using it as a hub.
But such demoralizing plans and strategies can only do so much, especially for now. In Memphis, there are direct flights to far fewer destinations than before, and only two to help justify the "international" in the name (Toronto and Cancún, Mexico). It takes no time at all to walk through the terminal's three ticketing areas or to zip through the security line. A gate may be crowded when a flight is about to board, but others nearby will be idle, and finding a place to sit is rarely a problem.
The airport is betting its future on Concourse B. Over the next three years or so, it will be rebuilt to feature wider corridors, more amenities, more natural light and even a stage for live entertainment. (After all, this is Memphis, where blues notes still pulse through the airport's parking garage, and the airport's logo is a reminder of the city's musical heritage.)
When Concourse B reopens, A and C will close, idling about 60 gates. The airport plans to keep a minimal level of heat and ventilation in each of them, Mr. Brockman said, and will test their equipment occasionally just in case they are needed again someday. That day may be a long time coming, or may never come.
Though Concourse B is already closed, demolition work won't start for a few months yet. There are still some signs there for Allegiant and Delta, and portraits of Elvis Presley and B.B. King still hang, reflected on the gleaming terrazzo floors. Every so often, the public address system booms out recorded announcements to no one.
The sprawling terminal may have become a bit of a white elephant with the falloff in passenger traffic, but not so the airport as a whole. Its runways are still busy, chiefly because Memphis is home to FedEx, whose purple, orange and white cargo jets roar morning and night through the western Tennessee sky. Among the world's cargo airports, Memphis is second only to Hong Kong.
Airport officials tend to toggle between offering optimism and consolation. A favorite statistic is the decline in airfares to and from Memphis since the merger. They averaged $389.81 last year, down nearly $70 from 2007 when adjusted for inflation.
Even so, residents lament the lost hub, and when you mention the airport in these parts, you will often get a shrug, a grimace or a sad stare.
"So sad to watch a booming airport turn into a ghost town," a letter to the editor of The Commercial Appeal said in January.
And the criticism used to be even harsher.
"Probably the biggest impact was the psychology on the community -- 'Oh, my God, we're not going to be a real city any more,"' Mr. Brockman said. "I think that now, the community has pretty much come to terms. The ones who grumble the most are the business travelers who now have to spend two-and-a-half hours laying over somewhere. Instead of a two-hour trip somewhere, it's now six or seven hours."

Full text: When Rebecca Wills pictures the home she would like to buy, it looks like the one she grew up in: Small house. Big backyard. Enough grass for the family to lie out on when the New Jersey summers cooperate.
"A place where you can come take your kids to swim, or do a barbecue," she said. "Somewhere where we can have people, have a lot of family, over."
She doesn't expect to live out that fantasy anytime soon. At 28, Ms. Wills has spent all of her adult years wrestling with student loans. She figures she has paid around $30,000 to the government and private lenders since she graduated from Rutgers University.
That has helped make a healthy dent in her loan bill. It has also sucked away all of the money she would have otherwise put into a savings account, earmarked for her big backyard.
Ms. Wills might already have a mortgage if she had gone to college a decade earlier, when it wasn't quite so expensive. Instead, she is stuck in limbo, like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans who have delayed buying a home because of the ever-growing cost of tuition.
Homeownership among Americans in their 20s and 30s is hovering near a three-decade low. Just 35 percent of households headed by someone younger than 35 owned a home in 2017, down from 41 percent in 1982, according to census data. Now, they are much more likely to be living at home with their parents or elders.
At the same time, the nation's student loan bill has soared to $1.4 trillion, surpassing credit cards to become the largest source of personal debt outside mortgages.
A broad set of headwinds is holding millennials back from buying homes. Underwriting standards have become stricter in the last decade, making it more difficult to get a mortgage. Many young people are moving to cities where they can only afford to rent -- a problem that has been compounded as home prices have soared while wages have barely outpaced inflation.
And recent research suggests that the explosion in tuition costs and student debt is another significant force keeping many millennials out of the home buying market. An analysis published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year suggests that student debt was responsible for up to 35 percent of the decline in homeownership among people between the ages of 28 and 30 from 2007 to 2015. (Homeownership for people under 28 tends to be low.)
If student debt levels had stayed where they were in 2001, more than 360,000 people in that age group would have owned a home in 2015, according to those findings.
"If people had the same levels of student debt as about 20 years ago, they probably would be buying a lot more homes than they are buying now," said Wilbert van der Klaauw, an economist at the New York Federal Reserve and an author of the study.
In an alternate universe where Ms. Wills might have graduated without much debt, and where the financial crisis had never happened, her father would never have been laid off and he would have kept chipping in to help pay her tuition bill. She wonders about who she would be if that had been her life.
"I don't know if I would have been the kind of person who would save every penny so I could own a home," she said. She might have traveled, or frittered her paycheck away on other things that tempt you in your twenties. "I might have chosen a completely different lifestyle if I had been free of this debt."
Of course, Ms. Wills's father did lose his job as a financial manager. Ms. Wills dropped out of the University of Massachusetts Amherst after a semester, moved back home, and took classes at a local community college before moving on to Rutgers.
She had some debt from her first undergraduate stint, and collected more the second time. During college, she waited tables at Ruby Tuesday, then at an Italian restaurant and then at a diner. She sent a hundred dollars here and there to her creditors. When she got her diploma, her loan bill was $60,000.
It is not as if she is scared of all kinds of borrowing. She knows that she can pay things off. She has a steady job as an analyst at the New Jersey Department of Education. She has been sinking more than $600 into paying off her loans every month since graduating. To improve her credit, she bought a new Hyundai Accent and paid it off in six years.
But a home loan comes with more zeros. And Ms. Wills said she is not exactly jumping at the prospect of "taking out another massive amount of debt and being trapped forever."
Her boyfriend proposed to her about a month ago. She giggles when she talks about it. They rent a one-bedroom in Jersey City for $1,350 a month.
"We want to start making our own kind of home, where we would stay for a while," she said. "But coming up with a plan where that's feasible has been pretty difficult."
For most people, college is still a relatively good bet. About half of the people who went to college own a home by the age of 33, compared to about a quarter of people who didn't go to college, according to data compiled by the New York Fed.
But student debt is one compelling reason that many millennials have stopped buying homes. Those who graduate with debt are less likely to own a home by age 33 than those who get away debt-free, the New York Fed data show. And thirty-somethings with more than $25,000 in debt fare worse than people with smaller bills.
Adrienne Naylor turned 34 this month. She has a stable job at a university in Cambridge, Mass., where she lives. She has a girlfriend she loves. But she does not feel like she is getting any closer to buying a home.
Ms. Naylor remembers her guidance counselors in high school going on about how much she would make if she went to college (a lot) versus what she would earn if she didn't (much less). So she borrowed. And then changed colleges. And borrowed some more. Then she got a master's degree in history, with a focus on managing archives and records. Now she has close to $300,000 in debt.
Eventually she fell behind on her payments and went into default, wrecking her credit score. No one wanted to hire her as an archivist, the focus of her graduate education. Before she got the university job, she made money however she could. She painted herself white and stood like a statue on a crate in Harvard Square, waiting for people to give her change. She worked the box office at a local theater. She collected garbage in Northampton for a stretch.
She now lives in a three-bedroom with two college students who sometimes have trouble remembering to replace the toilet paper.
"I would love to have a place that was just mine, but I don't let myself want that too much," she said. The university where she works recently offered employees a free seminar on home buying. A representative from Coldwell Banker rattled off the average price of a single-family home in the area ($2.7 million) and a condo ($800,000).
"I'm just like, 'Oh my God, is this guy for real?"' said Ms. Naylor, who pays $550 a month for her room. "It really brought home how incredibly out of reach this is for me."
Ms. Naylor's girlfriend is a preschool teacher -- "she's going to be poor forever"-- who lives nearby, with her own roommates. The couple would like to live together eventually. "I do have fantasies about buying a duplex that my girlfriend and I can live in and only see each other when we want to," she said.
Surveys that ask people about their student loans are hard to trust, as many people do not seem to know how much debt they have, research shows, let alone how interest works. But they reveal one thing: College loans have made mortgages a pipe dream.
More than 80 percent of millennials surveyed by the National Association of Realtors and the nonprofit group American Student Assistance said that student debt had forced them to shelve their plans to buy a home. And people who did not own homes estimated that the debt had forced them to put off buying by seven years.
The delay feels like it could be more open-ended for Matthew McCabe, who is staring down age 40 and long odds on ever owning property. He has paid about $25,000 back to the government for his student loans, yet he still owes $86,000 for the Ph.D. in music composition that he received in 2010.
"It's stifling," he said. "I feel like I am moving in the wrong direction."
Mr. McCabe expected to own a little place by now. "Maybe I am pulling too much on my middle-class expectations, but that's what you're supposed to do," he said.
He grew up in New Jersey, and lived in a house in the suburbs that his parents owned. His parents paid for him to go to a private high school, and for most of college. But Mr. McCabe had to take out loans for his doctoral degree in music. He makes $55,000 a year teaching at the Columbus State University, in Georgia, and earns an extra couple thousand by giving summer classes.
He pines after the cute little houses in historic Columbus that he walks by on the way to work. The town's quaint vibe suits him. It is relatively cheap to live there. His neighbors have told him they would prefer to have more owners in the area. There is no way he could pull together a down payment right now, though.
"I am not in a financial position to think about buying a house," he said. "I don't have a piece of land to build up on, a home base."
In contrast, Mr. McCabe's brother didn't take out loans for graduate school. He started working right after college, and now he has two children and owns his home. Mr. McCabe could have gone that route, but he loves teaching music, and he offers that he has already paid plenty back to Uncle Sam.
He has made payments "like clockwork" every month, he said, because he thought he would qualify for a loan forgiveness program the government provides to public service employees. But he found out last summer that he would not be able to get a break on the debt.
Still, whenever he walks by a house on his block with a "for sale" sign, he can't help gazing longingly at it.

Full text: In the last 16 years, parts of Louisiana have been struck by six hurricanes. Areas near San Diego were devastated by three particularly vicious wildfire seasons. And a town in eastern Kentucky has been pummeled by at least nine storms severe enough to warrant federal assistance.
These places are part of a small fraction of the United States that has sustained most of the damage from major natural disasters, forming a pattern of destruction concentrated in specific areas.
About 90 percent of the total losses across the United States occurred in ZIP codes that contain less than 20 percent of the national population, according to an analysis of data from the Small Business Administration.
The federal government, through disaster relief programs and flood insurance, subsidizes the cost of rebuilding in areas hit repeatedly by storms, floods and fires.
Critics say that encourages too much development in those regions, wasting tens of billions of dollars in tax money and endangering lives.
Christina DeConcini, the director of government affairs at the World Resources Institute, said that federal programs do not adequately emphasize adapting to the risks posed by climate change. She said that instead of just being responsive, the government should stress building for resilience against disasters.
Some residents continue living in disaster-stricken areas because they cannot afford to leave. Others rebuff appeals to resettle, citing deep family ties or a sense of fatalism. Rather than move the town, "it's easier to throw your hands up and say, 'Forget it,"' said Linda Lowe, the president of a historical society in flood-prone Olive Hill, Ky.
"Abandoning a location and moving a city makes sense from a scientific, risk point of view, but the fact is that to get to a place culturally and psychologically where that conversation can be tolerated is a difficult thing to imagine," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. "It's not all that rational -- but I guess a lot of these things are not really rational."
As hurricane season begins, residents of Slidell, La., near New Orleans, are planning ahead. Susan McClamroch, who works at a museum there, said that locals joke that they "start eating everything in the freezer" this time of year because of the likelihood of a power failure after a hurricane.
Brian Smith, who runs a print shop in Slidell, said the business flooded in 1995 and again during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. So when Hurricane Isaac hit in 2012, flooding his shop once more, he moved it away from the vulnerable downtown area.
"I'm not going to take that chance again," Mr. Smith said.
Eastern Kentucky is similarly susceptible to disaster. Almost yearly, it is hit with severe storms.
Susan Thomas, who owns a bookstore and coffee shop in Morehead, Ky., said that the store flooded once when her parents owned it. When it flooded again in 2010, she had to throw away 3,000 books.
"Honestly, there was a moment where I was, like, can we recover from this?" she said, adding that she returned to check on the store every time it rained. The business moved to a new location in town the next year.
Three Brothers Bakery in Houston has flooded five times since 2001, most recently during Hurricane Harvey. But its owners, Robert and Janice Jucker, the self-proclaimed "king and queen of disaster," are not moving -- and Ms. Jucker, who anticipates more storms, is unafraid.
The Juckers received low-interest disaster loans from the Small Business Administration to rebuild their business after Hurricanes Ike and Harvey. Officials verified the damage and estimated the amount of their property loss.
The agency tracks properties nationwide whose owners or renters applied for disaster loans. Data about these loans provide a window into the geographic pattern of destruction that disasters cause each year.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration attempts to calculate the full cost of major disasters, namely those that cause more than a billion dollars in damages. It estimates that 2017 was the costliest year on record, with 16 billion-dollar disasters that together cost the United States more than $300 billion.
While natural disasters are unpredictable, the annual losses from billion-dollar disasters, adjusted for inflation, have increased over the last 40 years.
In the first three months of 2018, billion-dollar storms hit the United States three times. By contrast, in the first three months of an average year, just one disaster that causes more than a billion dollars in damages occurs, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records dating back to 1980.
Climate change is making some kinds of disasters more frequent. Studies show that large wildfires have become more common in the western United States because global warming has made Western forests drier.
But rising damage costs are partly because of demographic shifts and development decisions that make natural disasters more destructive.
Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University, said that the rise in population and wealth near the coast was contributing to most of the increase in destruction caused by hurricanes.
In the last century, there has been no clear trend in the frequency of hurricanes that made landfall in the continental United States.
Over the same period, the number of buildings has ballooned in parts of the country susceptible to tropical storms as the population in those places has also increased. In 2016, there were more than 3.6 times as many homes in states that border the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean as in 1940, according to the Census Bureau.
The effects of global warming on individual storms have been difficult to determine, scientists say, because there are only about a dozen observed even in an active season.
But scientists also contend that climate change is expected to lead to stronger, wetter hurricanes over all. It has also made them more destructive, Dr. Klotzbach said. Because global sea levels have risen, hurricanes create storm surges that go further inland, flooding homes and businesses.
"You can build your house to withstand pretty much any wind, but the surge is what will get you," he said.
Only about 4 percent of all hurricanes that make landfall globally hit the United States, said Robert Mendelsohn, an economist at Yale University who studies the damage caused by hurricanes. Yet 60 percent of worldwide damage from hurricanes happens in the United States.
Dr. Mendelsohn attributed this partly to federal government programs that discourage citizens and local governments from building walls to protect housing near the coast. Only in the United States do relief programs and subsidized insurance make it attractive for people to move toward disaster-prone areas, he said.

Full text: NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks turned higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve indicated it's not in a hurry to raise interest rates too quickly. Retailers and technology companies led the way as the market erased some early losses.
Stocks opened lower after a business survey suggested that the eurozone economy might remain weak for longer than experts had expected. Investors bought U.S. and European government bonds, which sent yields and interest rates lower and hurt banks. The S&P 500 index fell as much as 14 points early on.
The market turned higher after the Fed released minutes from its meeting in early May. Officials concluded that the Fed should be on track to keep raising interest rates gradually, and some said it wouldn't be a problem if inflation briefly went past the Fed's target rate of 2 percent. That suggests the Fed won't raise interest rates too quickly, a development that worries investors because it would slow down economic growth.
"Investors are sort of nervous around an overly aggressive Fed at this point in the cycle maybe throwing us into a recession," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management.
The S&P 500 index rose 8.85 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,733.29. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 52.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,886.81. The Nasdaq composite climbed 47.50 points, or 0.6 percent, to 7,425.96. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 2.37 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,627.61.
Federal Reserve officials left interest rates unchanged in early May and investors expect they will raise them in mid-June. The central bank's members discussed concerns such as rising wage pressures and possible negative reactions to the Trump administration's trade policies, but didn't change their overall views.
The central bank has said it expects to raise rates a total of three times this year and some experts believe it will raise rates as many as four times. Nixon, of Northern Trust, said she expects only two rate increases: she said the Fed might leave rates alone after June if it sees signs the economy is slowing down a bit as the effects of last year's tax cuts fade.
Tiffany sparkled in the first quarter as the jewelry company's earnings and sales blew past Wall Street projections. The company also said it's planning to buy back $1 billion in its own stock. The stock jumped 23.3 percent to $126.05. Also rising after its quarterly report was Ralph Lauren, which jumped 14.3 percent to $133.33.
Target slumped after its first-quarter profit fell short of expectations. The big box retailer said more customers came to its stores and sales improved, but it's spending a lot of money to try to reinvent itself to better compete with Amazon. Target plans to spend $7 billion through 2020 to update stores and open smaller locations in urban markets. The stock sank 5.7 percent to $71.17.
Home improvement retailer Lowe's had a mostly disappointing first quarter as harsh winter weather cut into the traditional spring sales season, but the company forecast stronger sales growth for the rest of the year. The stock surged 10.4 percent to $94.69. Lowe's stock and its sales have lagged behind Home Depot, but it made up ground on Wednesday.
The IHS Market purchasing managers' index, a broad gauge of business activity in Europe, fell to its lowest level in 18 months in May. While the European economy is still growing, investors had hoped for signs the doldrums were clearing.
Germany's DAX gave up 1.5 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 1.3 percent while the British FTSE 100 lost 1.1 percent. Investors bought European government bonds, pushing prices higher and yields lower in Germany, Spain, France and the U.K.
Bond prices climbed in the U.S. as well. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.99 percent from 3.06 percent. With interest rates in decline, banks lost ground.
Banks climbed Tuesday before Congress passed a bill that eases some of the regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. Real estate investment trusts, utilities, and other stocks that pay large dividends rose. Those stocks are often considered alternatives to bonds, and investors who want income often buy them when bond yields decrease.
Comcast said it is preparing an all-cash offer for Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment divisions, and said it plans to bid more than the $52.4 billion Disney offered. Comcast didn't disclose other details about its plans. Fox rose 1.6 percent to $38.77 while Comcast fell 1.9 percent to $31.88, and Disney slid 1.1 percent to $102.89
Benchmark U.S. crude lost 0.5 percent to $71.84 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 0.3 percent to $79.80 a barrel in London.
Wholesale gasoline lost 0.4 percent to $2.26 a gallon. Heating oil rose 0.4 percent to $2.29 a gallon. Natural gas added 0.2 percent to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet.
The dollar dropped to 110.07 yen from 111.02 yen. The euro fell to $1.698 from $1.1779.
Gold lost 0.2 percent to $1,289.60 an ounce. Silver fell 1 percent to $16.41 an ounce. Copper plunged 2 percent to $3.07 a pound.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.2 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.3 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.8 percent.
