Full text:   A Double Dose of Comfort
TO THE EDITOR:
Re "Oversize Expectations" (Aug. 10), which described how many airlines -- especially those in the United States -- were hesitating to add the huge, double-decker Airbus A380 to their fleets:
I recently flew in business class on a Lufthansa A380 from Kennedy Airport in New York to Frankfurt. Greeted at the door by name, I was ushered to my seat and later invited to a thorough wine degustation with my meal. That superior inflight service, along with the amazing qualities of the plane itself, made this journey more than memorable.
The culture of flying is what is in question here, and airlines like Emirates and Lufthansa that fly the A380 see clearly what it should be. The notion that this plane may be ill-fated is preposterous.
Within the United States, long-distance routes are now often served by narrow-body aircraft that don't offer such amenities, whether in coach or so-called premium classes. But the resulting savings may be temporary as premium travelers -- and that's where the money is -- tire of the absence of true comfort and choose foreign carriers for international travel.
To be true partners in the global market, United States carriers would be wise to make the improvements needed for the 21st century, and local decision makers should work to accommodate the A380 at more airports.

The Trucker Shortage
"Where Have All the Truckers Gone?," the Upshot feature in Sunday Business last week, examined how trucking companies were complaining of a growing shortage of drivers, even as truckers' average pay, adjusted for inflation, has declined in the last decade.
The following reader comments have been drawn from those on nytimes.com. They have been edited and condensed.
I think the driver shortage can be explained by a quick look at the picture of parked trucks that accompanied the article. How would you like to spend your working life having to sleep in one of those trucks -- and making less than $50,000 a year?
JIM MC, SAVANNAH
It's not just the trucking industry. How long did you wait in line at the grocery store last time you shopped? How about the omnipresent "help wanted" signs at fast-food shops?
One doesn't have to be skilled to be underpaid, and the economy suffers when customers cannot get what they want, when they want it. Much of this is solely due to companies' continued reluctance to pay wages that will attract potential employees.
DOROTHY STIEFEL, SPENCER, NY
Dramatic advances, meanwhile, are being made in self-driving vehicles. I fear that a rise in wages will not defer the demise of the trucker.
MARK, HARTFORD
You can already see the cracks appearing: the use of signing bonuses to poach workers. The best workers are the ones poached, leaving the company that is the "poachee" to underperform. I see the same thing in the tech sector.
MH, NY
What about the drag on the overall economy caused by this lack of drivers? When goods from supplier company A are not moving to customer company B, both are being harmed.
GRAVESENDER, BROOKLYN
Truckers' pay is very low when you consider the lifestyle. They are often away from home and miss their children's soccer games and school events. And I don't know how they could maintain good physical health since they eat out all the time and would have little time to exercise. Plus, it's dangerous work.
It seems that truckers are not afforded the pay and respect they are due.

Full text:   It's hard to believe, but almost six years have passed since the fall of Lehman Brothers ushered in the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Many people, myself included, would like to move on to other subjects. But we can't, because the crisis is by no means over. Recovery is far from complete, and the wrong policies could still turn economic weakness into a more or less permanent depression.
In fact, that's what seems to be happening in Europe as we speak. And the rest of us should learn from Europe's experience.
Before I get to the latest bad news, let's talk about the great policy argument that has raged for more than five years. It's easy to get bogged down in the details, but basically it has been a debate between the too-muchers and the not-enoughers.
The too-muchers have warned incessantly that the things governments and central banks are doing to limit the depth of the slump are setting the stage for something even worse. Deficit spending, they suggested, could provoke a Greek-style crisis any day now -- within two years, declared Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles some three and a half years ago. Asset purchases by the Federal Reserve would "risk currency debasement and inflation," declared a who's who of Republican economists, investors, and pundits in a 2010 open letter to Ben Bernanke.
The not-enoughers -- a group that includes yours truly -- have argued all along that the clear and present danger is Japanification rather than Hellenization. That is, they have warned that inadequate fiscal stimulus and a premature turn to austerity could lead to a lost decade or more of economic depression, that the Fed should be doing even more to boost the economy, that deflation, not inflation, was the great risk facing the Western world.
To say the obvious, none of the predictions and warnings of the too-muchers have come to pass. America never experienced a Greek-type crisis of soaring borrowing costs. In fact, even within Europe the debt crisis largely faded away once the European Central Bank began doing its job as lender of last resort. Meanwhile, inflation has stayed low.
However, while the not-enoughers were right to dismiss warnings about interest rates and inflation, our concerns about actual deflation haven't yet come to pass. This has provoked a fair bit of rethinking about the inflation process (if there has been any rethinking on the other side of this argument, I haven't seen it), but not-enoughers continue to worry about the risks of a Japan-type quasi-permanent slump.
Which brings me to Europe's woes.
On the whole, the too-muchers have had much more influence in Europe than in the United States, while the not-enoughers have had no influence at all. European officials eagerly embraced now-discredited doctrines that allegedly justified fiscal austerity even in depressed economies (although America has de facto done a lot of austerity, too, thanks to the sequester and cuts at the state and local level). And the European Central Bank, or E.C.B., not only failed to match the Fed's asset purchases, it actually raised interest rates back in 2011 to head off the imaginary risk of inflation.
The E.C.B. reversed course when Europe slid back into recession, and, as I've already mentioned, under Mario Draghi's leadership, it did a lot to alleviate the European debt crisis. But this wasn't enough. The European economy did start growing again last year, but not enough to make more than a small dent in the unemployment rate.
And now growth has stalled, while inflation has fallen far below the E.C.B.'s target of 2 percent, and prices are actually falling in debtor nations. It's really a dismal picture. Mr. Draghi & Co. need to do whatever they can to try to turn things around, but given the political and institutional constraints they face, Europe will arguably be lucky if all it experiences is one lost decade.
The good news is that things don't look that dire in America, where job creation seems finally to have picked up and the threat of deflation has receded, at least for now. But all it would take is a few bad shocks and/or policy missteps to send us down the same path.
The good news is that Janet Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, understands the danger; she has made it clear that she would rather take the chance of a temporary rise in the inflation rate than risk hitting the brakes too soon, the way the E.C.B. did in 2011. The bad news is that she and her colleagues are under a lot of pressure to do the wrong thing from the too-muchers, who seem to have learned nothing from being wrong year after year, and are still agitating for higher rates.
There's an old joke about the man who decides to cheer up, because things could be worse -- and sure enough, things get worse. That's more or less what happened to Europe, and we shouldn't let it happen here.

Full text:   PARIS -- This was supposed to be the year that the European economy decisively broke free of its shackles. But after a dismal round of economic growth reports on Thursday, the main question appears to be whether the eurozone will avoid tumbling back into recession.
Germany and Italy both contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with the first, official data showed, and the French economy stagnated yet again. The region was beginning to falter even before the latest round of tit-for-tat sanctions with Russia over Ukraine further clouded the outlook.
With the Continent's three main engines sputtering, the gross domestic product of the 18-nation eurozone did not expand at all from the first quarter of this year, when it grew only 0.2 percent. The latest figure from Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, equates to a meager 0.2 percent annual rate.
"It's fairly clear that the eurozone recovery is coming apart at the seams," said Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, as most of the bloc is either "in recession or flirting with it now."
The reports drew renewed calls for more aggressive stimulus from the European Central Bank to restore an economy that has been hobbled by millions of people out of work and price pressures so weak that deflation is a genuine threat.
Weakness in the European Union, with its more than 500 million consumers and one-quarter share of world G.D.P., bodes poorly for the already shaky global outlook. Credit is shrinking rapidly in China, while Japan's economy shrank 6.8 percent in the second quarter at an annual rate.
Even the United States, which reported last month that second-quarter growth rebounded to a 4 percent annual rate after a dismal start to the year, has been posting disappointing numbers of late.
The International Monetary Fund last month cut its forecast for 2014 global growth to 3.4 percent from the 3.7 percent it forecast in April.
Economists had been forecasting that the eurozone economy would grow as much as 2 percent this year after a 0.4 percent decline last year.
After the report on Thursday, many analysts were revisiting their outlooks for a possible downward revision.
Lena Komileva, chief economist at G Plus Economics in London, said that the figures showed there was a "real risk" that the eurozone was headed back into recession and that they added to pressure on the European Central Bank to adopt stronger monetary stimulus.
"Not only does this render the E.C.B.'s anemic growth forecast of 1 percent for 2014 unrealistic," she added, "but it is hard to see just what will keep the recovery growing."
Another cause for concern on Thursday was the specter of deflation: Eurozone consumer prices rose last month just 0.4 percent from a year ago, Eurostat said, confirming an earlier report.
And of the 18 nations in the bloc, prices rose on a monthly basis in only two -- Germany and the Netherlands -- and declined in 15 others; they were flat in Malta.
That added to fears that Japan-style deflation was becoming more likely. Investors piled into German sovereign debt, considered the safest asset in Europe, and the yield on the 10-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction to price, fell at one point below 1 percent for the first time.
"The current no-growth, negative-price reality in the eurozone already leaves little hope for restoring jobs, living standards or public debt sustainability," Ms. Komileva said.
Some positive signs did appear on Thursday.
Economic growth picked up in several so-called peripheral euro members: Spain grew 0.6 percent on a quarterly basis, up from 0.4 percent at the start of the year; Portugal, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden all returned to growth after contracting in the first quarter; and Cyprus and Greece moved closer to the break-even mark, suggesting that their steep declines might be nearing an end.
And the downturn in Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, followed by France and Italy, could prove to be temporary. Economists said the latest figures were skewed by unusually fair weather in the first quarter, which bolstered construction growth to a level that was not sustained in the second quarter.
But other indicators have pointed to a rough patch ahead for Germany, which remained relatively healthy through the worst of the economic crisis across the rest of Europe. The ZEW index of economic sentiment, released on Tuesday, showed morale among analysts and investors in the country plunging in August to its lowest level in more than 18 months.
And German businesses have warned that the European Union's economic sanctions against Russia could hurt the domestic economy.
The eurozone's most immediate problems are rooted in the need for households and businesses to cut debt and in a dearth of demand that has left more than 18 million people in the unemployment line.
After the sovereign debt crisis led Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek bailouts and raised fears about Spain and Italy's ability to remain in the euro bloc, governments agreed to a policy of fiscal austerity.
While the overhauls won a reprieve from the market, demand declined further as governments cut spending and raised taxes.
The data reported Thursday raised the likelihood that Europe was headed for a deflationary trap, as flat or declining G.D.P. would weigh further on the labor market and keep downward pressure on prices, said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
"There's no inflation anywhere in sight," he said.
Inevitably, considering the refusal of Germany and some other nations to weigh using the traditional lever of fiscal policy to stimulate growth, all eyes are now on Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.
At its meeting last week, the central bank left monetary policy intact, with its main interest rate at a record-low 0.15 percent and its deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent.
Mr. Draghi has pledged to provide banks with a new round of cheap loans to bolster lending to smaller businesses.
But many economists have also called for the bulk buying of debt on the open market -- a policy known as quantitative easing -- as a last-ditch attempt to restore credit and keep prices from the downward deflationary spiral that would further weaken borrowers and banks and sap investment.
Mr. Draghi has said the central bank is considering quantitative easing, but many analysts are skeptical that it can be done within the constraints the central bank faces.
"Q.E. is a political nonstarter," Mr. Spiro said, as "we don't believe Mr. Draghi will be able to get the support of German politicians."
Mr. Draghi, for his part, has sought to keep the spotlight on promises of structural changes made by the recalcitrant governments in France and Italy.
"It's pretty clear that the countries that have undertaken a convincing program of structural reforms are performing better -- much better -- than the countries that have not done so, or have done so to a limited extent," he said in a news briefing last week.
Mr. Weinberg said it was misleading even to speak of a recovery in the eurozone, considering that the bloc's G.D.P. remained more than 2 percent lower than its level in early 2008, before the global financial crisis.
"I think we're still in a depression that began six years ago," he said. "The difference between a recession and a depression is that you have a natural bounce-back from a recession, but a depression needs a policy response."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   Earl F. Cheit, an educator who in 1970 wrote a sobering, influential report saying that two-thirds of the colleges and universities in the United States were in or near grave financial difficulty, died on Aug. 2 at his home in Kensington, Calif. He was 87.
The University of California, Berkeley, where he was a longtime administrator and professor, announced the death, giving the cause as cancer.
Dr. Cheit's 250-page report, titled "The New Depression in Higher Education" and sponsored by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education, examined 41 private and public colleges and universities in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Based on research Dr. Cheit (pronounced "chite") directed, it found that 70 percent of these were either in financial difficulty or "headed for trouble."
The analysis was particularly jolting because it came as baby boomers were flocking to campuses, which had expanded to meet the demand. Research at universities had grown exponentially as course offerings and majors increased.
The reason for alarm, Dr. Cheit wrote, was that costs faced by colleges were rising at a faster rate than income. He said that if the institutions were to prosper, federal and state governments would have to contribute substantially more funds. At the same time, the report said, colleges and universities needed to cut costs and raise tuition.
The findings were the basis of a front-page article in The New York Times and the subject of dismay in a Times editorial. Academic papers still cite the study.
"The future capacity of higher education to serve the country's youth, and the nation itself, is in jeopardy at the very moment when its top priority ought to be the costly unfinished task of extending equal educational opportunities to the poor and deprived," the editorial in The Times said.
In a two-year follow-up study, in which Dr. Cheit participated, universities and colleges were said to have brought their finances into better balance and achieved "a fragile stability." But the study warned that they were still "living on borrowed time."
Over the next 40 years, pessimism proved more than justified. The cost of tuition, room, board and fees increased at greater than the rate of inflation at both public and private colleges. State-run institutions endured repeated cutbacks in funding by legislatures, while private ones had to discount the list price of tuition selectively for families who could not or would not pay it.
Part of the solution was round after round of cost-cutting. Colleges fired professors, hired part-time replacements and shut facilities. More recently, some have turned to online courses to reach more students more cheaply.
But a huge gap remained. That was filled by student loans, which the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent federal agency, estimates now exceed $1 trillion. In the years after the report, politicians debated whether to increase grants or loans to meet college students' needs, and loans won out.
"We rely on debt by default, as it is the only way to fill the gap between family resources, need-based grants and rising college prices," David W. Breneman, an economist at the University of Virginia, wrote in The Chronicle of Higher Education in 2002.
Earl Frank Cheit was born in Minneapolis on Aug. 6, 1926, but considered Hague, N.D., the wheat and cattle town where he grew up, his real birthplace. "My mother went to Minneapolis because there was no doctor in Hague," he told The Times in 1970.
He graduated from Hague High School in a class of eight and went on to earn undergraduate and law degrees, as well as a doctorate in economics, from the University of Minnesota. His thesis sought to disprove the commonly held belief that generous compensation for workers injured on the job would result in "malingering." While at the university, he supported himself as a copy boy for The Minneapolis Star, a short-order cook and a busboy at a hospital.
After getting his Ph.D. in 1954, he taught at St. Louis University in the mid-1950s, then joined Berkeley as a visiting associate professor of economics and a research economist at the university's Institute of Industrial Relations. He later became its director. His writing further explored compensation for occupational injuries and addressed social issues like increasing women's presence in the work force.
Dr. Cheit was twice dean of the Haas School of Business at Berkeley, from 1976 to 1982 and in the 1990-91 academic year. When the campus erupted in a so-called free speech protest in 1964, he was elected to an emergency committee of the academic senate. The next year, he was named executive vice chancellor of the campus.
In an interview with The Times in 1968, Dr. Cheit attributed the protest, a precursor to campus demonstrations around the country, to "underadministration." He said not enough money was available under the budget to establish channels for student and faculty advice to be heard.
Dr. Cheit is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former June Doris Andrews; his daughters, Danielle Cheit and Julie Ross; his sons, David and Ross; and three grandchildren.

Full text:   LOS ANGELES -- Peering through his camera at Robin Williams in 2012, the cinematographer John Bailey thought he glimpsed something not previously evident in the comedian's work. They were shooting the independent film "The Angriest Man in Brooklyn," and Mr. Williams was playing a New York lawyer who, facing death, goes on a rant against the injustice and banality of life.
His performance, Mr. Bailey said Tuesday, was a window into the "Swiftian darkness of Robin's heart." The actor, like his character, was raging against the storm.
That defiance gave way on Monday to the personal demons that had long tormented Mr. Williams. With his suicide at age 63, Mr. Williams forever shut the window on a complicated soul that was rarely visible through the cracks of an astonishingly intact career.
Given his well-publicized troubles with depression, addiction, alcoholism and a significant heart surgery in 2009, Mr. Williams should have had a résumé filled with mysterious gaps. Instead, he worked nonstop.
At the very least -- if his life had followed the familiar script of troubled actors -- there would have been whispers of on-set antics: lateness, forgotten lines, the occasional flared temper.
Not so with Mr. Williams. "He was ready to work, he was the first one on the set," said Mr. Bailey, speaking of Mr. Williams's contribution to "The Angriest Man in Brooklyn," of which he was the star.
"Robin was always 1,000 percent reliable," said a senior movie agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity to conform to the wishes of Mr. Williams's family. "He was almost impossibly high functioning."
As Hollywood struggled on Tuesday to understand how Mr. Williams -- effervescent in the extreme -- could take his own life, authorities released details of his death. A clothed Mr. Williams hanged himself with a belt from a door frame in his bedroom in Tiburon, Calif., according to Lt. Keith Boyd, assistant deputy chief coroner for Marin County.
Mr. Williams's wife, Susan Schneider, went to bed at 10:30 Sunday night and woke up on Monday believing her husband was still asleep in a separate bedroom. A personal assistant, concerned that he was not responding to knocks on his door, discovered the body, cool to the touch and with rigor mortis, at about 11:45 a.m. on Monday.
Mr. Williams, who had recently been treated for severe depression, was declared dead at 12:02 p.m. Officials found a pocketknife in the room, apparently with dried blood on it, and superficial wounds on Mr. Williams's left wrist, said Lieutenant Boyd, who declined to say whether there was a suicide note. Toxicology reports are still pending.
To a large degree, said studio executives and agents who worked with him, Mr. Williams seemed to use work as a way to keep his personal demons caged. At an age when most actors are slowing down, Mr. Williams was engaged with a half-dozen recent and planned projects. They ranged from stage work and low-budget films to an anticipated -- though still distant -- big-budget sequel to his biggest hit, "Mrs. Doubtfire," which took in about $728 million worldwide in 1993, after accounting for inflation.
Seeming to thrive on performance, despite the undertow of depression and substance abuse, Mr. Williams interrupted a live comedy tour for his heart surgery in 2009. But he quickly returned to finish his run. Stanley Wilson, a film producer who attended Juilliard with Mr. Williams and remained a close friend until the end, said a 2011 stint on Broadway left the actor "overwhelmed with joy."
"He was totally proud" of his recent work, Mr. Wilson said, speaking by telephone on Tuesday. But he acknowledged that Mr. Williams had long been a "melancholic guy."
Experts say that it is impossible to predict who will commit suicide. The act is so radical, individual and rare that it defies precise scientific analysis.
But there are factors that increase its likelihood, experts said, and many of them were Mr. Williams's longtime companions: drugs, alcohol, depression. After a cocaine-fueled early career, Mr. Williams quit cold turkey in the mid-1980s and strung together two decades of sobriety before returning to alcohol while shooting a movie in Alaska, according to his own public statements. He entered rehab in Oregon in 2006.
Mr. Williams was also a middle-aged white male facing career challenges -- his 2013 television series, "The Crazy Ones," was canceled by CBS after one season -- only a few years after the heart surgery. More than 70 percent of all suicides in the United States are white men, most of them in their middle years, and many take their lives in the wake of some loss, whether professional, personal or physical.
Charles J. Biederman, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented Mr. Williams in entertainment dealings, strongly refuted tabloid reports on Tuesday that the actor was in acute financial distress.
"No, no, he was doing fine," Mr. Biederman said. Other members of Mr. Williams's professional coterie also insisted that money problems were not an easy explanation for what happened. "He didn't have crazy money like before his divorces, but the coffers were still full," said a person who worked closely with Mr. Williams, who was currently on his third marriage.
Mr. Wilson said: "He was not broke. He got highly paid for the series, and he just did two movies."
Mr. Wilson did acknowledge that money had been an issue for his friend roughly two years ago. In an interview with Parade last year, Mr. Williams said as much, telling an interviewer that he had decided to do "The Crazy Ones," his first steady TV job in 30 years, because of the paycheck. Mr. Williams's salary for the show was reportedly between $150,000 and $200,000 an episode, which for a season of 22 episodes could have paid more than $4 million.
"There are bills to pay," Mr. Williams told Parade, adding that he had recently re-listed his Napa ranch for $29.9 million because "I just can't afford it." (The ranch, initially listed in 2012 for $35 million, is still for sale.)
Whether for emotional or financial reasons, Mr. Williams in recent years increased his workload, even taking on commercials. He played a football coach unhinged by hunger for Snickers and his voice was used in spots for iPad Air devices.
His 2006 relapse appeared related to concern about his ability to keep working. "It's fear," Mr. Williams said in a 2010 podcast interview with the comedian Marc Maron. "You're kind of going, 'What am I doing in my career? Where do you go next?"'
Mortality also appeared to weigh on him. While shooting "Boulevard," an indie drama that was filmed in Tennessee in the spring of 2013, Mr. Williams spoke pointedly about the recent death of another famous comedian -- his idol, Jonathan Winters.
"On set, Robin talked about losing Jonathan Winters in all his brilliance and goodness, like any other fan," said Dito Montiel, the director of "Boulevard."
For Mr. Bailey, Mr. Williams's little-seen performance in "The Angriest Man in Brooklyn" is the comedian's "defining role," revealing him for the tormented, if comic, soul that he really was.

Abstract: The American Trucking Associations has estimated that there was a shortage of 30,000 qualified drivers earlier this year, a number on track to rise to 200,000 over the next decade. Even as trucking companies and their trade association bemoan the driver shortage, truckers -- or as the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls them, heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers -- were paid 6 percent less, on average, in 2013 than a decade earlier, adjusted for inflation. [...]the trucking companies themselves are typically working on thin profit margins and serving customers on long-term contracts, which means that if they simply raised pay sharply to recruit more truckers, they could end up losing money.

Full text:   Swift Transportation's 20,000 workers haul goods in almost 14,000 big-rig trucks that travel the interstates and back roads of the United States every day. The company's performance is closely tied to the nation's economy, which has been looking increasingly sunny lately.
So it was surprising last month when Swift's stock plummeted nearly 18 percent in a single day. The tumble came for an odd reason. It wasn't because there was too little business -- but rather, too much.
"We were constrained by the challenging driver market," the company said in its quarterly earnings announcement. "Our driver turnover and unseated truck count were higher than anticipated."
In other words, Swift had plenty of customers wanting to ship goods. But in a time of elevated unemployment, it somehow couldn't find enough drivers to take those goods from Point A to Point B. How is that possible? The reasons for that conundrum tell us a great deal about what has been ailing American workers and why a full-throated economic recovery has been so slow in coming.
Consider this: The American Trucking Associations has estimated that there was a shortage of 30,000 qualified drivers earlier this year, a number on track to rise to 200,000 over the next decade. Trucking companies are turning down business for want of workers.
Yet the idea that there is a huge shortage of truck drivers flies in the face of a jobless rate of more than 6 percent, not to mention Economics 101. The most basic of economic theories would suggest that when supply isn't enough to meet demand, it's because the price -- in this case, truckers' wages -- is too low. Raise wages, and an ample supply of workers should follow.
But corporate America has become so parsimonious about paying workers outside the executive suite that meaningful wage increases may seem an unacceptable affront. In this environment, it may be easier to say "There is a shortage of skilled workers" than "We aren't paying our workers enough," even if, in economic terms, those come down to the same thing.
The numbers are revealing: Even as trucking companies and their trade association bemoan the driver shortage, truckers -- or as the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls them, heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers -- were paid 6 percent less, on average, in 2013 than a decade earlier, adjusted for inflation. It takes a peculiar form of logic to cut pay steadily and then be shocked that fewer people want to do the job.
Millions of able-bodied Americans need work, yet there aren't enough middle-income jobs for them. That is especially the case for men without advanced educations, who have seen their wages depressed over the last few decades. Trucking would seem to be an excellent option.
It's not an ideal job for everyone. There is no question that trucking is hard work, necessitating long hours and longer stretches away from family. But that's why it is well compensated, at least in comparison to other jobs not requiring college degrees. The average pay for a long-haul trucker is just shy of $50,000, according to the A.T.A., and an experienced trucker with a good safety record can make significantly more than that. The work typically offers lavish benefits that are increasingly rare for nonunion blue-collar employees.
The job can be learned fairly quickly. In some industries, companies complain of shortages of workers for jobs that require years of advanced training, like certain engineering specialties. Trucking is not one of those industries, however.
A person can get a commercial driver's license after a course that can be as brief as six weeks of intensive study. Moreover, there were actually fewer truckers working last year (1.585 million) than five years earlier (1.673 million). Some of the missing workers could presumably be coaxed back into the industry if the money were right.
To be sure, the trucker-shortage picture is more complex than this, notes Bob Costello, the A.T.A.'s chief economist. He says these complications make a straightforward story of truckers simply being underpaid not quite fair.
For example, new safety requirements mean that individual truckers drive fewer miles than a decade ago: An average long-haul truck can now cover 8,000 miles a month, down from almost 11,000 in 2007, according to the trade association. This helps account for downward wage pressure. And the trucking companies themselves are typically working on thin profit margins and serving customers on long-term contracts, which means that if they simply raised pay sharply to recruit more truckers, they could end up losing money.
But every industry has its special challenges, and the trucker shortage -- and falling inflation-adjusted wages over the last decade -- are part of a bigger story.
The reasons are the subject of endless debate, and you can pick the one you prefer to emphasize: technological change, globalization or a decline of union power. But wages of workers without advanced skills have been under downward pressure in the United States and across the developed world over the last generation. The deep recession and slow recovery have only made the trend more pronounced.
That has led to a mind-set in which executives sometimes think of line workers as merely resources to be tapped at the lowest price. Companies have been able to keep wages low: It's hard to demand a raise when your colleagues are being laid off or there is a long line of job seekers. Some corporations may have come to view this as a natural state of affairs.
By now, wage income is as low a percentage of gross domestic product as it has been since 1947, while corporate profits are at postwar highs. These are two sides of the same coin. Money that once accrued to workers now goes to shareholders.
Yet there are some indications that this state of affairs may not last: The shortage of truckers is one piece of evidence that the balance of power is shifting. In recent earnings calls, executives from companies as varied as JetBlue and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group have expressed worry about rising wage pressures.
The trucker shortage is already resulting in higher wages in parts of that industry. There have been $2,000 signing bonuses from companies looking to poach truckers and, as Kevin P. Knight of Knight Transportation mentioned in that trucking company's latest earnings call, per-mile pay increases have been working out to 5 to 10 percent jumps in driver pay.
Executives may bemoan higher pay for workers because it could cut profit margins. But after a generation in which the median American household has seen flat to declining inflation-adjusted income, wage increases are a welcome corrective. When workers begin to have more leverage in salary negotiations, it is a sign of an improving economy, not a liability that businesses should be complaining about.

Abstract: Dragged Back Into Iraq Following Mr. Obama's authorization of the first significant military operation in Iraq since he pulled American ground troops out in 2011, the Air Force reported on Friday that two United States F-18 fighter jets had dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs onto an artillery target near Erbil, the Kurdish capital.

Full text:   "The world is too much with us," wrote the poet, a sentiment President Obama most likely shared this past week as he reluctantly ordered warplanes back over Iraq. As he did so, another Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire ended in resumed bombardment, Vladimir V. Putin defiantly ordered his own sanctions against the West and a terrible virus spread farther through West Africa.
A president who has taken great pains to pull the United States out of the world's squabbles, Mr. Obama made no effort to conceal his distress at being pulled back in, for even a limited mission to protect minorities. "I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq," Mr. Obama said on Thursday night. But the old "slippery slope" cliché figured in more than one analysis of his decision.
Still, the markets somehow managed to find a hopeful note in a world that seemed totally out of tune. Though Russia was reported to be massing troops on the Ukrainian border, and the government imposed a ban on most food imports from the United States and its allies, American stocks rallied on Friday when the secretary of the Russian Security Council, Nikolai P. Patrushev, said in an interview that "Russia will continue to make all efforts for a very fast de-escalation of tensions."
That "continue" carried the dubious suggestion that Russia had been making such efforts all along, but the fact that the markets latched on to the secretary's statement testified 1) to the predominance of the Ukraine crisis over the Middle East in the minds of market strategists, and 2) that "the market is really tired of receiving one negative news item after another, and so is on the lookout for something positive," as the Citigroup economist Ivan Tchakarov told Bloomberg.
Dragged Back Into Iraq
Following Mr. Obama's authorization of the first significant military operation in Iraq since he pulled American ground troops out in 2011, the Air Force reported on Friday that two United States F-18 fighter jets had dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs onto an artillery target near Erbil, the Kurdish capital.
Mr. Obama's hand in Iraq was forced by ISIS, the fanatical Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and its advance in northern Iraq against the Kurds, reliable American allies who have maintained a modicum of order in their semiautonomous region. Thousands of Yazidis -- an oft-persecuted religious minority -- fled to remote Mount Sinjar, where they were stranded without food or water.
ISIS was left in control of a two-mile-wide hydroelectric dam on the Tigris River notorious for its structural instability. Even if ISIS did nothing, officials said, leaving the dam unattended could lead to its collapse, sending a 65-foot-high wall of water through Mosul.
Though Mr. Obama said he had ordered the strikes to protect American personnel, the fact that he did so only when the Kurds became threatened -- and not earlier in the year when ISIS seized FallujaH? and marched through Mosul and on toward Baghdad -- was bound to raise questions. One explanation was in Baghdad's Green Zone, where Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki continued to resist all demands that he go away. The failure of Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, to include Sunnis, Kurds and others in a government of national unity is widely blamed for the disarray that made it possible for ISIS to rout the Iraqi Army. Even his lieutenants have urged Mr. Maliki to step down. But having made innumerable enemies, he is said to be demanding immunity and a security detail paid for by the state.
Mr. Obama has insisted that there is "no American military solution" to the mess, and he no doubt hoped that limited strikes would enable Iraqis to turn the tables on ISIS. But what if they fail? Will he be forced to further action?
Israeli Fire, Russian Threat
Faith in military solutions, however, seemed to prevail in the fight between Israel and Hamas. No sooner had a 72-hour truce expired than rockets began to rain on southern Israel, and Israeli warplanes and naval vessels opened up on targets in Gaza. The pause in hostilities had been the longest since they broke out on July 8.
The Palestinians insist that the blockade of Gaza be lifted, and about 100 prisoners held by Israel be freed, if there is to be a truce. The Israelis insist that Hamas disarm. The Egyptians have been trying to get both sides to lower their demands, and to leave more complex issues for subsequent talks.
In the meantime, the Palestinian death toll stands at almost 1,900, mostly civilians, while Israel has lost 64 soldiers and three civilians.
On the Ukrainian front, forces loyal to Kiev continued tightening their ring around Donetsk, the seat of secessionists armed by Russia.
There was no evidence that Mr. Putin was prepared to back down. On the contrary, his prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, announced on Thursday, in retaliation against Western sanctions, a one-year ban on many food imports from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia and Norway -- a move that is likely to reduce food supplies and raise inflation in Russia. So far, his efforts to "de-escalate tensions," to use Mr. Patrushev's words, have consisted of insisting that Kiev stop attacking the rebels and that the West stop helping Kiev. And there remains the chilling possibility that Mr. Putin could send troops into eastern Ukraine on a "humanitarian mission" to the besieged denizens of Donetsk.
Ebola Spreads in Africa
Wars were not the only scourge making the news last week. With the death toll from an outbreak of the Ebola virus approaching 1,000 in West Africa, the World Health Organization on Friday declared an international public health emergency. And Doctors Without Borders called for a "massive deployment" of medical workers to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries hit worst by the outbreak.
The Ebola virus causes a severe and often fatal illness, and while some drugs are being tested, there is no vaccine or treatment yet available to prevent or cure the disease. The virus is caught through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected people or animals.
Because it is not "spread through the air," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the W.H.O.'s head of health security, it can be contained.

Full text:   YAMHILL, Ore. -- ONE delusion common among America's successful people is that they triumphed just because of hard work and intelligence.
In fact, their big break came when they were conceived in middle-class American families who loved them, read them stories, and nurtured them with Little League sports, library cards and music lessons. They were programmed for success by the time they were zygotes.
Yet many are oblivious of their own advantages, and of other people's disadvantages. The result is a meanspiritedness in the political world or, at best, a lack of empathy toward those struggling -- partly explaining the hostility to state expansion of Medicaid, to long-term unemployment benefits, or to raising the minimum wage to keep up with inflation.
This has been on my mind because I've been visiting my hometown of Yamhill, Ore., a farming community that's a window into the national crisis facing working-class men.
I love this little town, but the news is somber -- and so different from the world I now inhabit in a middle-class suburb. A neighbor here just died of a heroin overdose; a friend was beaten up last night by her boyfriend; another friend got into a fistfight with his dad; a few more young men have disappeared into the maw of prison.
One of my friends here, Rick Goff, 64, lean with a lined and weathered face and a short pigtail (maybe looking a bit like Willie Nelson), is representative of the travails of working-class America. Rick is immensely bright, and I suspect he could have been a lawyer, artist or university professor if his life had gotten off to a different start. But he grew up in a ramshackle home in a mire of disadvantage, and when he was 5 years old, his mom choked on a piece of bacon, staggered out to the yard and dropped dead.
"My dad just started walking down the driveway and kept walking," Rick remembers.
His three siblings and he were raised by a grandmother, but money was tight. The children held jobs, churned the family cow's milk into butter, and survived on what they could hunt and fish, without much regard for laws against poaching.
Despite having a first-class mind, Rick was fidgety and bored in school. "They said I was an overactive child," he recalls. "Now they have name for it, A.D.H.D."
A teacher or mentor could have made a positive difference with the right effort. Instead, when Rick was in the eighth grade, the principal decided to teach him that truancy was unacceptable -- by suspending him from school for six months.
"I was thinking I get to go fishing, hang out in the woods," he says. "That's when I kind of figured out the system didn't work."
In the 10th grade, Rick dropped out of school and began working in lumber mills and auto shops to make ends meet. He said his girlfriend skipped town and left him with a 2-year-old daughter and a 4-year-old son to raise on his own.
Rick acknowledges his vices and accepts responsibility for plenty of mistakes: He smoked, drank too much for a time and abused drugs. He sometimes hung out with shady people, and he says he has been arrested about 30 times but never convicted of a felony. Some of his arrests were for trying to help other people, especially to protect women, by using his fists against bullies.
In that respect, Rick can actually be quite endearing. For instance, he vows that if anyone messes with my mother, he'll kill that person.
A generation or two ago, Rick might have ended up with a stable family and in a well-paid union job, creating incentives for prudent behavior. Those jobs have evaporated, sometimes creating a vortex of hopelessness that leads to poor choices and becomes self-fulfilling.
There has been considerable progress in material standards over the decades. When I was a kid, there were still occasional neighbors living in shacks without electricity or plumbing, and that's no longer the case. But the drug, incarceration, job and family instability problems seem worse.
Rick survives on disability (his hand was mashed in an accident) and odd jobs (some for my family). His health is frail, for he has had heart problems and kidney cancer that almost killed him two years ago.
Millions of poorly educated working-class men like him are today facing educational failure, difficulty finding good jobs, self-medication with meth or heroin, prison records that make employment more difficult, hurdles forming stable families and, finally, early death.
Obviously, some people born into poverty manage to escape, and bravo to them. That tends to be easier when the constraint is just a low income, as opposed to other pathologies such as alcoholic, drug-addicted or indifferent parents or a neighborhood dominated by gangs (I would argue that the better index of disadvantage for a child is not family income, but how often the child is read to).
Too often wealthy people born on third base blithely criticize the poor for failing to hit home runs. The advantaged sometimes perceive empathy as a sign of muddle-headed weakness, rather than as a marker of civilization.
In effect, we have a class divide on top of a racial divide, creating a vastly uneven playing field, and one of its metrics is educational failure. High school dropouts are five times as likely as college graduates to earn the minimum wage or less, and 16.5 million workers would benefit directly from a raise in the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.
Yes, these men sometimes make bad choices. But just as wealthy Americans inherit opportunity, working-class men inherit adversity. As a result, they often miss out on three pillars of middle-class life: a job, marriage and a stable family, and seeing their children succeed.
ONE of Rick's biggest regrets is that his son is in prison on drug-related offenses, while a daughter is in a halfway house recovering from heroin addiction.
The son just had a daughter who was born to a woman who has three other children, fathered by three other men. The odds are already stacked against that baby girl, just as they were against Rick himself.
This crisis in working-class America doesn't get the attention it deserves, perhaps because most of us in the chattering class aren't a part of it.
There are steps that could help, including a higher minimum wage, early childhood programs, and a focus on education as an escalator to opportunity. But the essential starting point is empathy.

Abstract: The global economy remains sluggish; central banks continue to push down interest rates in hopes of stimulating their countries' economies; and, perhaps most important, geopolitical tensions have been rising. While global financial conditions are quite calm compared with those during the financial crisis, over the last month or so traders have nonetheless edged back toward a pattern of lower risk-taking that rewards assets deemed by the markets to be safe, according to a report last week by HSBC Global Research in London.

Full text:   The mantra in the bond market over the last several years has been that yields will inevitably rise. From time to time, that has even been true. But not lately, and especially not on Friday.
The 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 2.35 percent, its nadir since June 20, 2013, before settling at 2.42 percent, according to Bloomberg.
Yields have been falling with embarrassing consistency in 2014 despite forecasts to the contrary from most Wall Street analysts at the beginning of the year.
"Just about all of us were convinced that yields were rising," Kathy A. Jones, a fixed-income strategist at Schwab, said in a phone interview this week. "But the bond market didn't go along with that story."
Instead, the market has been responding to current events: The global economy remains sluggish; central banks continue to push down interest rates in hopes of stimulating their countries' economies; and, perhaps most important, geopolitical tensions have been rising. President Obama's decision to resume bombing in Iraq, the violence in Gaza and the threat of a wider war in Ukraine are the start of a long and worrisome list.
In response, investors worldwide have been curbing the risk in their portfolios and moving money into safer holdings. United States Treasuries remain high on the list of global safe havens. Demand for Treasuries has driven prices higher and pushed down yields.
The yields on a range of other bonds have been extraordinarily low, too. For example, the yield on 10-year German sovereign debt has fallen to 1.05 percent. And Japanese interest rates have gone even lower, with the yield on 10-year sovereign debt hovering at 0.495 percent.
In the Treasury market, the move downward has defied the expectations held by most bond analysts just a short time ago. On Jan. 1, for example, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note stood at 3 percent, and the Wall Street consensus was that yields would surely rise in 2014. Analysts on average predicted that it would increase to 3.5 percent this year.
In May, in a letter to clients, Ms. Jones noted that consensus projections had shifted downward, with most analysts calling for yields of 3 percent by the end of the year -- which would be where yields started on Jan. 1. They may well return to that level, but there is a long way to go.
The direction of bond yields may have bewildered market participants, but the confusion was understandable: There have been several false starts, with perhaps the biggest one coming last year.
In May 2013, when the Federal Reserve began to openly discuss tapering its monthly purchases of bonds -- a program known as quantitative easing -- Treasury yields began to rise from the rock-bottom levels to which they had fallen. Prices, which move in the opposite direction, fell sharply.
Those shifts resulted in a bad year for the bond market in 2013, with a drop in the Barclays Aggregate Bond index of 2 percent, only the third negative performance for that benchmark index in a calendar year since 1976. By the end of the year, the trend seemed clear on Wall Street: A long multidecade rally in the bond market was over, yields would keep rising, and prices would fall. Wall Street banks made big bets against Treasuries on that expectation.
But so far, at least, those predictions have been wrong: The bond rally has gained fresh legs this year while the rally in the stock market has, at least briefly, faltered.
Returns in the domestic bond market have been competitive with those in stocks so far this year, with the Barclays index rising 4.2 percent through Thursday. That compares with a decline, as of Friday, of 0.14 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year and a gain of 4.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Stocks climbed on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising 185.66 points, or 1.13 percent, to 16,553.93, while the S.&P. 500 increased 22.02 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,931.59. The Nasdaq composite index rose 35.93 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,370.90.
While global financial conditions are quite calm compared with those during the financial crisis, over the last month or so traders have nonetheless edged back toward a pattern of lower risk-taking that rewards assets deemed by the markets to be safe, according to a report last week by HSBC Global Research in London. Such assets include the sovereign debt of the United States, Britain, German, France and Canada, as well as high-grade corporate bonds, HSBC said, and all have been in favor lately. Conversely, assets like stocks have been giving up ground.
In such an environment, high-yield, or junk, bonds have been consigned to the riskier camp, behaving more like stocks than bonds, and the high-yield market in the United States has been punished. High-yield spreads -- the extra interest that investors are receiving for the risk of holding a junk bond -- have moved sharply higher since June 23, according to Michael Gambale, a senior financial analyst with Thomson Reuters/IFR. Compared with Treasuries of equivalent maturity, the average high-yield spread was 3.35 percentage points, or 335 basis points, on June 23, he said in an interview this week. That spread has now widened by about 90 basis points, one of the biggest moves in the last 15 years, he said.
"Much of it has to do with geopolitics, in my opinion," he said. "Ukraine, the Middle East, a lot of headlines have been worrying the market."
Those worries appear to be reflected in fund flows. For the week that ended Wednesday, investors pulled a net $7.068 billion from high-yield mutual funds, the largest weekly outflow on record, said Tom Roseen, senior analyst at Lipper. "It's been a huge reversal," he said. "People began pulling money out of high-yield funds about four weeks ago, when the mood changed very sharply."
The mood has been much more auspicious for Treasuries. Geopolitics are part of it, but in hindsight, other factors are contributing to the market's strength as well.
While the Fed has been tapering its monthly bond purchases, to $25 billion in August from a high of $85 billion, foreign central banks and individual purchasers have been buying voraciously, according to a report by PNC Financial Services.
Furthermore, with the decline in the United States deficit, there is less new debt to buy. And while the economy is expanding, in the United States and much of the world, according to recent data, it is doing so at a modest pace, with little indication that inflation remains a threat. Those factors may have contributed to low bond yields.
In the end, though, the best minds of Wall Street will need to grapple with an unpleasant truth: The market has not responded as they expected. We don't know how long the bond rally will continue, of course. But in the words of a sage, Yogi Berra: It ain't over till it's over.

Full text:   The stock market fell on Thursday as investors remained concerned about slowing global growth and the threat of rising tensions between Russia and the West.
While stocks slumped, government bond prices rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest level in more than a year.
The stock market has been under pressure in the last few weeks as investors worry that the rising tensions between Russia and the West will hurt global economic growth. The European Central Bank's president, Mario Draghi, cautioned on Thursday that the crisis in Ukraine could crimp the fragile recovery in the eurozone.
"You're getting some good earnings, but it's just not enough to overwhelm the geopolitical issues," said Drew Wilson, an equity analyst with Fenimore Asset Management.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.67 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,909.57. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.07 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,368.27. The Nasdaq composite fell 20 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,334.97.
Phone and Internet companies were among the day's biggest decliners. Windstream Holdings fell 39 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $11.16 after the company reported that its earnings fell 64 percent in the second quarter. The results missed analysts' expectations.
Eight of the 100 industry sectors in the S.&P. 500 fell. Health care and phone company stocks dropped the most, 1.2 percent for health care and 1 percent for phone companies. Utilities stocks rose 1.1 percent, making them the biggest gainers, as investors bought safer assets.
The market started the day higher as investors assessed the latest encouraging news from the job market.
Fewer people applied for unemployment benefits last week. Jobless claims remain at relatively low levels consistent with stronger economic growth. Weekly applications fell 14,000, to 289,000, the Labor Department said. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell 4,000, to 293,500. That is the lowest average since February 2006.
Also in economic news on Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported that consumers expanded their borrowing at a slower rate in June compared to the previous month. Overall consumer credit rose by $17.3 billion in June to a total of $3.21 trillion. The increase was smaller than a gain of $19.6 billion in May.
Some positive earnings reports also helped lift stocks early. Shares in 21st Century Fox rose $1.63, or 5 percent, to $33.96 after it reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday. The company got a boost from films including "X-Men: Days of Future Past," "Rio 2" and "The Fault in Our Stars." The stock added to gains made Wednesday after Fox underscored its abandonment of a bid for Time Warner and announced a stock buyback.
The gains for stocks were short-lived on Thursday. The market started to head lower by lunchtime, and as stocks declined, bond prices rose, pushing down interest rates.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 2.41 percent from 2.47 percent late Wednesday, while its price rose 16/32, to 100 25/32. The 10-year note's yield is now at its lowest level since June 2013.
At the start of this year, many investors and analysts had expected the price of the 10-year Treasury note to fall as the economy continued its recovery and the Federal Reserve wound down its economic stimulus program. Instead, the opposite has happened. Bonds have rallied as inflation has remained low and doubts have arisen on prospects for long-term growth.
United States Treasury securities also offer a higher yield than bonds issued elsewhere. The yield on the 10-year German government bond, for instance, is 1.06 percent, while French government bonds of the same maturity return 1.5 percent.
Investors are also buying Treasury securities as a safe haven as geopolitical tensions rise around the world.
"The Treasury market is going to continue to confound the bears," said Bill O'Donnell, chief Treasury strategist at RBS.

Full text:   The sad truth of the tit-for-tat sanctions that Russia has imposed against the West is that they will hurt Russians far more than they will hurt Westerners.
Acting on President Vladimir Putin's orders, Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev on Thursday ordered a ban on a wide range of food and agricultural products from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway. No doubt many producers in these countries will feel the loss of $30 billion in food exports to Russia, but the overall effect on their large and diversified economies will be marginal. Russia, by contrast, imports about 40 percent of its food needs in terms of value, and the Russian agriculture minister has acknowledged that the sanctions would cause a spike in inflation.
In effect, Russians will be getting another hefty bill for their president's arrogant efforts to batter Ukraine, and they will become more estranged from the global economy they need to develop their vast country.
Mr. Putin's readiness to impose hardships on his own people rather than back down in Ukraine is, unfortunately, not surprising. His entire adventure in Ukraine, from the annexation of Crimea to the active military support for secessionists in eastern Ukraine, reflects his view of a zero-sum contest between Russia and the West in which Ukraine is the central battlefield. Even as Russia ordered the retaliatory sanctions, NATO reported that Russian troops were again massing on the Ukrainian border, once again raising the dangerous possibility of a direct intervention in support of the rebels, who are under attack by Ukrainian troops.
Further, in addition to the ban on food imports, Mr. Medvedev indicated that Russia was also considering a ban on flights over Siberia, a measure that would add to the cost of Europe-Asia travel, but would also cost Russia millions in transit fees.
Polls show that Mr. Putin is hugely popular with Russians, and no doubt his latest show of defiance against the West will find applause. But that could begin to change once prices for basic needs begin to rise and jobs begin to vanish in a contracting economy. The new economic elite, already funneling their money abroad at high rates, will not welcome the loss of the fine European foods that fill Moscow supermarkets. Many in the middle class are already wondering what it is they're paying so huge a price for, and that question is bound to spread as Russians lower on the economic scale begin to feel the pain.
It is critical at this juncture for the Western allies to remain united, even if the cost of the sanctions -- their own and Russia's -- are not equally borne. The European Union has a fund to compensate farmers for lost production in times of crisis, and this is just such a time. Sanctions are a painful weapon, and Russia has been a lucrative market for Europe. But the alternatives to sanctions -- military action on one side, or doing nothing in the face of Mr. Putin's brazen challenge to the post-Soviet order -- are not really options.

Russia Responds to Western Sanctions With Import Bans of Its Own

Abstract: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister, announced that Russia would ban all beef, pork, fish, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway for one year.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Russia retaliated on Thursday for Western sanctions against Moscow, announcing that it was banning imports of a wide range of food and agricultural products from Europe and the United States, among others. The move raised the level of confrontation over Ukraine with measures that seemed likely to affect Russian consumers at least as much as European farming.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the prime minister, announced that Russia would ban all beef, pork, fish, fruit, vegetables and dairy products from the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and Norway for one year.
"We hoped until the very last that our foreign colleagues would realize that sanctions are a dead end and that nobody needs them," Mr. Medvedev said. "Things have turned out in such a way that we have to implement retaliatory measures."
Russia was still considering various measures involving aviation, including a ban on flights over Siberia, which would affect routes used by European and American airlines that fly to Asia, he told a cabinet meeting broadcast live on state-run satellite news channels.
But while Russians rich enough to savor fine European food at home may lament, at least in private, the gradual disappearance of such fare from shelves after Thursday's announcement, Europe's farmers and food producers, at least initially, suggested the effect of the ban was likely to be limited.
The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, indicated that the greatest impact to Europe might be the atmosphere of uncertainty that the tensions over Ukraine have generated. "Our risks to the recovery were on the downside to begin with, and certainly one of these risks will be the geopolitical developments," he said at a news conference in Berlin on Thursday. "The recovery remains weak, fragile and uneven."
After the United States, Russia is the biggest market for European agricultural exports, worth about 11.8 billion euros last year, or roughly $15.7 billion, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency. That is about 10 percent of European agricultural trade; the vast majority of that commerce stays within the 28-nation bloc.
In the past two years, myriad bans imposed by Russia -- usually citing health and hygiene problems with European and North American products -- have already driven food trade with Russia from peak levels. German pork exports, for instance, totaled 83,000 tons in the first four months of 2013, but fell "drastically," to just 9,000 tons over the same period this year, the German Farmers' Association said.
A blanket ban on European pork imports last February has driven prices in Russia "significantly higher," the association added in a statement, meaning that the Russian consumer is bearing the brunt of the move.
Economic analysts suggested that the additional measures announced by Moscow on Thursday could have an immediate but moderate impact on the Russian economy while the country seeks alternative suppliers in Latin America, Africa and Turkey.
"Even if Russia says it will try to find additional sources of supply, it will be difficult in the short term," said Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist at Citibank for Russia. "Consumers will feel some pinch but I don't think it will be a massive impact."
"The key question is what the effect on inflation will be," he added. The bank is estimating that price increases could add one or two points to the inflation rate for 2014, currently running around 6.5 percent.
In announcing the likely ban on Wednesday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seemed keenly aware of the danger of price rises, saying that they should be avoided if possible. But no matter the fallout on the urban, Brie-eating elite -- who do not like Mr. Putin much anyway -- the Kremlin move was viewed as another way for the president to enhance his already substantial support base.
In an opinion poll conducted Aug. 1 to 4 by the Levada Center, Mr. Putin's approval rating hit 87 percent, having risen steadily since the annexation of Crimea last March. The last boost in support appears to be fueled by his confrontation with the West, with the idea that he is restoring Russia to its rightful place in the world.
Analysts considered the choice of food and agriculture products an obvious one after Western nations imposed three rounds of sanctions and ordinary Russians were waiting to hear what the Kremlin's response would be.
"The consensus of 80 percent of Russians is that we have to reply, that we will fight," said Igor Yurgens, the economist who runs the Institute of Contemporary Development, noting it was part of a patriotic wave rolling over the country.
In addition, people living in rural areas who make their living from agriculture or food processing or some related industry make up about 30 percent of Russia's population, he said. They are an important support base for Mr. Putin and have been pushing the substitution of local products for imported ones.
Giant supermarket chains and restaurants scrambled to line up new supplies, and consumers dependent on goods like lactose-free milk imported from Finland worried about whether it could be produced locally. Some products, including baby food and wine, were purposely left out of the ban.
But nationalist Russian leaders crowed that another victory over Western products was at hand.
"We should have started to protect the market much earlier," said Gennadi Zuganov, the head of the Communist Party, now part of the loyal opposition. "We have everything we need to make it."
Western experts read Thursday's blanket ban as an alarming signal that hard-liners close to Mr. Putin were gaining influence.
"It is a complete mystery to me what Putin is thinking with this move," said Wolfram Schrettl, professor of economics at the Free University in Berlin and an expert on Russia and Eastern Europe. "It is an own goal," he said, using the soccer term for when a team scores for its opponent by putting the ball in its own net. "Western agriculture can certainly bear the effects."
In Russia, he predicted, "it will look soon like the Soviet Safeway -- empty shelves." Brazil, for instance, may be ready to increase deliveries of chicken to make up for the absence of such supplies from the United States. "But it is awkward, and requires extreme efforts."
In Europe, the effect may be the opposite. Albert Jan Maat, chairman of the Dutch Federation of Agriculture and Horticulture, warned that the Russian ban could spur a glut of farm products in Europe, causing prices to drop. "We're thinking of either removing products from the market or temporarily storing them," he said.
In other quarters, the Russian ban was met less with alarm than derision. In Poland, after Russia announced its first ban on some fruit and vegetable imports last week, a campaign for Poles to "eat apples" and "drink cider," drew an immediate and immense response with journalists, celebrities and even President Bronislaw Komorowski signing up and posting selfies eating apples on social media.
Apple eating aside, reactions in Poland to Russia's retaliatory actions have been increasingly critical. "All of this might be just a part of Putin's game," the agriculture minister, Marek Sawicki, told reporters. "He will try to divide Europe."
Mr. Sawicki confirmed that Poland would seek compensation in Brussels, as might Finland and perhaps the Baltic nations, where ports, for instance, might suffer as a result of the ban.
Any such compensation would most likely come as emergency payments from the vast well of joint European Union funding known as the Common Agricultural Policy. But Frédéric Vincent, a spokesman for the European Commission, said it was "way too early" to make such payments.
The most noticeable American food import to Russia is chicken. But even there, Russian currently accounts for just 7 percent of United States poultry export volume, compared with 40 percent of the total in the mid-1990s, according to the National Chicken Council. But the council said the sanctions would not have much of an impact. "As its domestic poultry industry has expanded, Russia has in recent years become less important as an export market," the council said in a statement.
Echoing the German farm association, it added, "The biggest impact, we believe, will be on Russian citizens who will be burdened by higher prices for all food products, especially meat and poultry."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- The president of the European Central Bank said on Thursday that the Ukraine crisis posed a risk to the eurozone economy, but that the impact was not yet severe enough to warrant a shift in monetary policy.
"If geopolitical risks materialize, it's quite clear that the next two quarters will show lower growth," the bank president, Mario Draghi, said at a news conference on Thursday.
Given the anemic growth in the eurozone, and the prospect that other countries could slip back into recession, as Italy has just done, the central bank might eventually need to take further action.
But the bank left interest rates unchanged on Thursday as it waited to gauge the effects of earlier measures to stimulate the economy and get a clearer picture of the impact of deteriorating relations with Russia -- including an embargo against agricultural imports that Moscow announced on Thursday.
"It's difficult now to define 'what are the options in the future,' especially if the conflict escalates," Mr. Draghi said. But he said the central bank was ready to take further action if necessary, including quantitative easing -- the same kind of big purchases of financial assets that the Federal Reserve used to stimulate the United States economy.
The central bank left its benchmark interest rate at 0.15 percent, the low it was cut to in June as part of a series of measures intended to encourage bank lending and push the worrisomely low inflation rate closer to the central bank's target of about 2 percent. It would have been a surprise if the central bank had taken further action Thursday before giving the measures a chance to gain traction.
Mr. Draghi said that the steps taken in June had already contributed to a decline in market interest rates, and that he was optimistic that commercial banks would take advantage of cheap loans that the central bank would begin offering in September. The so-called targeted lending program is intended to funnel credit to countries like Italy, where many small businesses have been unable to hire or invest because they cannot get loans.
Mr. Draghi quoted estimates that banks would draw at least 450 billion euros and perhaps as much as 850 billion euros, or $1.14 trillion, under the program, which obligates lenders to pass the money on to businesses and individuals in the form of credit.
"We do expect a sizable pickup," he said.
But the conflict in Ukraine, the still unknowable impact of the agricultural trade sanctions that Russia announced on Thursday, and the severe tensions across the Middle East add to the worries of the eurozone, which is still far from reaching levels of employment and economic output that the region had achieved before the financial crisis began in 2008.
Inflation in the eurozone in July was 0.4 percent, according to an official estimate, far below the level of about 2 percent that the central bank considers healthy for the economy. Some economists warn that the eurozone could be drawn into a destructive downward price spiral known as deflation that would destroy jobs and incomes.
"Mario Draghi remained undisturbed" by growing risks to growth, Peter Vanden Houte, an analyst at ING Bank, said in a note to clients. "Having already decided upon a comprehensive set of measures in June to ward off deflationary pressures, the E.C.B.'s aim was to sit back and wait."
Recent data has dented optimism about eurozone growth. German industrial production rose 0.3 percent in June compared with May, according to data released on Thursday, far below expectations. Many economists now expect data due next week to show that the German economy, the largest in the eurozone, shrank in the second quarter after growing for a year.
On Wednesday, Italy reported that its gross domestic product unexpectedly shrank 0.2 percent in the second quarter, dragging the economy back into recession. Some analysts saw the decline in output as an early sign that an escalating sanctions war with Russia could be hurting eurozone growth, but Mr. Draghi suggested Thursday that it was more a result of Italy's failure to remove impediments to entrepreneurship, investment and hiring.
"There are stories of investors that would like to build plants and equipment and create jobs, but it takes months for them to get authorization to do so," he said. "That has nothing to do with monetary policy. It's mostly the lack of structural reforms."
The countries that are growing are the ones that had introduced overhauls like lowering taxes and making labor markets more competitive, Mr. Draghi said. He did not name any, but eurozone countries that have taken those steps toward growth include Germany, Portugal and Spain.
Mr. Draghi said that trade and financial links with Russia were modest, but acknowledged that the impact of tensions could be greater than expected, especially if they led to an increase in energy prices.
"If one looks at the figures for trade and financial flows, they would by and large reveal a picture of very limited interconnections," Mr. Draghi said. However, he added that wider effects could occur if Russia and the West continued to add sanctions.
In addition, Mr. Draghi said that subsidiaries of Russian banks in the eurozone would have to provide assurances that money they borrowed from the European Central Bank would not be used to evade sanctions that had been imposed by the European Union and the United States.
"Banks will have to explain why they need the money, and the national central bank inspectors and supervisors will assess their statements," he said.
The Bank of England also decided on Thursday to keep its benchmark interest rate at a low 0.5 percent, where it has been since 2009. Britain's robust economic growth, however, has raised speculation that policy makers will have to raise interest rates sooner than expected, perhaps this year.
Britain's central bank also left unchanged its stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $632 billion, in government bonds that it has bought over the last five years.
Britain and the United States are moving gradually toward raising interest rates to prevent inflation, while the European Central Bank is more focused on the risks from very low inflation.
Mr. Draghi noted that the eurozone monetary policy had decoupled from the United States. But if anything, he sounded pleased that the divergence had reduced the value of the euro against the dollar. A lower exchange rate helps exporters by making their products cheaper in foreign markets.
The central bank's news conference came only days after the failure of Banco Espírito Santo in Portugal and the announcement Sunday and early Monday of a rescue plan by the Bank of Portugal, the Portuguese central bank, and the European Commission. Mr. Draghi praised what he said was "swift and effective" action by the government authorities, which prevented turmoil on financial markets.
The European Central Bank is in the midst of a comprehensive review of the health of eurozone banks, with the results due in late October. Mr. Draghi suggested that Banco Espírito Santo was an example of how the increased scrutiny was forcing banks to come clean about their problems.
The review has already prompted "dramatic changes in the corporate structure of banks," Mr. Draghi said.
"We have seen banks raising significant amounts of capital," he said. "That is a very important element that should not be underestimated because it's so crucial to repairing the bank lending channel in the euro area."

Full text:   DONETSK, Ukraine -- Searching for ways to hit back at Western sanctions without causing Russian consumers too much pain, President Vladimir V. Putin gave his government a broad mandate Wednesday to issue one-year bans on food and agricultural imports. But he included a proviso that the bans be lifted if they drive up prices or cause undue dependence on a single source.
"They are searching for some way to respond, and so far have not found a way," Sergei M. Guriev, a respected Russian economist who moved to Paris last year, said of the Kremlin. He and others noted the spread of popular jokes in Russia about the country tending to shoot itself in the foot with retaliatory measures.
The move by Mr. Putin came as fighting continued to flare in eastern Ukraine between government troops and separatist rebels, whom Russia has been accused of supporting. The United States, the European Union and other countries have hit Russia with sanctions, citing its seizure and annexation of Crimea this year and accusing Russia of supplying the missiles that rebels used to shoot down a Malaysian jetliner on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard.
As the Ukrainian forces pressed their offensive on Wednesday, more alarms were raised in the West over about 20,000 Russian troops massing near the Ukrainian border. In Stuttgart, Germany, the American secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel, said of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, "It's a threat, it's a possibility, absolutely."
The Kremlin rejected claims that it was preparing to send its troops across the border. Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Western officials seemed to be trying to top one another with exaggerated claims.
The trade-ban decree that Mr. Putin signed on Wednesday did not name specific products or countries to be banned, but Natalya Timakova, the spokeswoman for Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, said in a statement that a full list would be released on Thursday. It will include fruits, vegetables and meat, she said, but not wine or baby food.
Russia has used trade restrictions to make political and diplomatic points before, and in recent weeks it has banned Ukrainian dairy products, Polish apples, Australian beef, pork from various neighbors and Moldovan fruit, among other products. Beef and cattle from Romania were added to the list on Wednesday, and the Russian news media have suggested that American chicken might be next. Technical pretexts were offered for many of those bans, but the new decree on Wednesday allows them to be imposed simply because a country has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Analysts suggested that applying the new decree broadly could lead to shortages and drive food prices up sharply, as banned imports from European neighbors are replaced on store shelves with products from much farther afield. Inflation was already a concern in Russia; Lilia Shevtsova, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said that last year's rate of 6.5 percent was "bearable," but that a rise to 9 or 10 percent would be disastrous.
Still, there was a sense that Mr. Putin wanted to respond in some way to the more sweeping sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union last week, as well as measures by Australia, Japan and other countries, without doing anything that might rebound on Russia's crucial energy industry or its high-profile deals with companies like ExxonMobil.
"It started with a warning," Ms. Shevtsova said. "They will start with agriculture products and then go further."
In Ukraine, intensified fighting near Donetsk, the main rebel stronghold, caused a Dutch team of investigators working at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 to withdraw on Wednesday, saying the area had become too dangerous.
Government forces bombed Donetsk from the air for the first time overnight, jangling the already badly frayed nerves of the city's residents. The roar of jets and the crack of explosions could be heard as the bombs dug a line of large craters across a district of warehouses and auto repair shops. It was not clear what the intended target was.
One of the bombs failed to explode. Two grim-faced members of a bomb squad took turns Wednesday morning digging it out of a hole in the pavement.
While many residents in eastern Ukraine have cheered the advance of government troops after the arbitrary arrests and raw brutality of the separatist forces, they are also terrified by the artillery and heavy weapons the army is using, and baffled by denials from the Ukrainian military that it is firing into residential areas.
After the bombs fell on Wednesday, a military spokesman in Kiev, Andriy Lysenko, said the Ukrainian air force had not struck Donetsk. "The Ukrainian aviation does not bomb" populated areas, he told reporters. If a warplane was heard over the city, he insisted, it must have been a reconnaissance and communications flight.
But Tamara Matuznaya, a retiree whose house in Donetsk was narrowly missed by a bomb, said that at the first roar of jets overhead, her son "picked me up and threw me in the basement," and they cowered there as explosions echoed outside.
Ukrainian government forces have been working to tighten their encirclement of Donetsk and to cut off supply routes from the Russian border or the other main rebel stronghold, Luhansk. As the fighting creeps closer to Donetsk, the army has aimed artillery fire at rebel positions in the city but has not yet moved in with ground troops.
Civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday in a report on the conflict here. And emergency workers have been thwarted by separatists who commandeer ambulances to move fighters about the city, the report said.

Full text:   As voters and lawmakers in more states decide to legalize marijuana, policy makers will have to answer a fresh and difficult question: How should governments regulate the production and sale of the drug?
Beyond keeping marijuana out of the hands of minors, a good regulatory system has to limit the increase in drug abuse that is likely to accompany lower prices and greater availability after legalization. It should protect consumers from both dangerous and counterfeit products, reducing the physical risk from a psychoactive substance. And a well-regulated system should undermine and eventually eliminate the black market for marijuana, which has done great damage to society.
The experiences of Colorado and Washington, where sales of recreational marijuana started this year, will prove instructive. While there are important differences in their approaches, both states have licensed businesses to grow, process and sell marijuana while imposing strict rules and high taxes on them. Other states that legalize will probably adopt a similar model, because it resembles how the federal and state governments regulate tobacco and alcohol.
A Better Way to Tax Policy makers trying to regulate the drug will face challenges similar to the ones American lawmakers faced at the end of Prohibition in 1933. Like alcohol during Prohibition, marijuana is widely available across the United States today. But it will become much more accessible after legalization, when businesses engaged in its production and sale no longer operate in the black market nor engage in violence. The pretax price of the drug could fall by 90 percent after legalization, according to Robert MacCoun, a law professor at Stanford, and fellow researchers. Moreover, marijuana businesses will have a financial incentive to get a broad population to use the drug regularly. A recent report prepared for the Colorado Department of Revenue concluded that nearly 90 percent of the demand for marijuana in the state this year would come from only 30 percent of users, those who use the drug 21 to 31 days a month.
Regulators will have to design policies that allow licensed businesses to undercut the illegal market but keep prices high enough so dependence on the drug does not increase a lot. One important way to curb use is to tax marijuana heavily, following the post-Prohibition template of replacing criminalization with regulation and taxes. Colorado and Washington have imposed high tax rates that are based on price, much like existing sales taxes. But Mark Kleiman, a public policy professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, rightly warns that those taxes will lose their bite when prices inevitably decline as marijuana businesses become more efficient at production. A better approach would be to tax the drug based on its potency -- which can be measured in various ways, including by the amount of the component THC in a batch -- and increase the rate over time to keep up with inflation.
Lawmakers should not repeat the mistakes they made on alcohol in recent years, taxing it too lightly and allowing the industry to become highly concentrated. (Just two companies control about 75 percent of the American beer market today.) Federal excise taxes on alcohol are levied at fixed rates by volume; there are different rates for liquor, wine and beer. For example, the tax on a 31-gallon barrel of beer is $18, or 5 cents per 12-ounce can. But those tax rates were last increased in 1991, even though the Consumer Price Index has increased 75 percent since then. Most states have also kept their excise taxes steady in recent years, in part because of the heavy lobbying and big money of the beverage industry. The median state excise tax on beer is 20 cents per gallon, or about 2 cents per 12-ounce can.
States with an existing medical marijuana market will also have to make sure that users are not abusing it to evade taxes. In Colorado, for example, there are more than 111,000 people with medical marijuana cards. Those users can buy the drug at much lower tax rates than people buying recreational marijuana; in Denver, cardholders pay combined city and state taxes of 7.62 percent, compared with the 21.12 percent in taxes paid by recreational users.
The problem is that almost anyone can get a card on a doctor's recommendation. Regulators need to tighten access to cards and penalize doctors who churn out recommendations by the hundreds. Otherwise, tax rates on recreational marijuana will be easily subverted.
Don't Market to Minors One of the most important lessons from the country's long battle with the tobacco industry is advertising's outsize role in creating and sustaining an addiction to nicotine, particularly among teenagers and young adults. Though marijuana is far less addictive than tobacco, states that choose to legalize it must impose limits on the promotional activities of marijuana businesses. The controls should emulate the restrictions on targeting young people, banning outdoor advertising and product placements that the tobacco industry accepted as part of its settlement with state attorneys general in 1998.
States must require proper labeling and packaging of products that contain mind-altering substances. Beau Kilmer, a drug policy expert at the RAND Corporation, said regulators can restrict the sale of foods like candies, beverages and cookies made with marijuana or limit how much of the drug's active ingredients are in each serving. The ingredients should also be distributed evenly throughout the product, and regulators must test samples for harmful levels of pesticides, mold and other impurities often found in illicit cannabis.
To discourage the use of marijuana with alcohol, states can require that they be sold in different places and ban the use of cannabis at bars and restaurants. Experts say using marijuana and alcohol together is much more dangerous than using them separately. One study on the effects of marijuana use on driving published in the American Journal on Addictions in 2009 found that combining the two drugs "results in impairment even at doses which would be insignificant were they of either drug alone."
Growers Shouldn't Be Sellers States should keep the production and retail sales of marijuana separate to ensure that the industry does not evolve into a group of politically and financially powerful vertically integrated businesses. After Prohibition, American lawmakers adopted a three-tier system for the alcohol industry to make sure the country did not see the return of "tied houses," or bars that were either owned or beholden to brewers through loans and other financial arrangements. Tied houses had encouraged excessive drinking by their customers, which helped to galvanize the temperance movement. Colorado initially required growers to also be retailers in the interest of getting the legal market going quickly but has since allowed them to specialize.
Over time, the state should consider dividing production and sales, as Washington has done. But states should not blindly copy-and-paste alcohol regulations onto marijuana, either. State beer distribution rules, for example, have unfairly prevented craft brewers from selling their products in many places, a situation that shouldn't be replicated in the marijuana business.
For each level of the industry, licensing systems ought to discourage the concentration of market power in the hands of a few businesses. It's important for regulators to recall the American experience with the tobacco industry, which is dominated by a handful of large corporations. For decades, those big cigarette companies undermined scientific research into the damage their products were causing and blocked sensible regulations. If states allow marijuana businesses to become too big, they could face corporate juggernauts that may be hard to regulate.
States should also monitor each level of the industry closely, including tracking how drugs move through the system. This should help to keep legal marijuana from being diverted to other states or countries that have not legalized the drug.
Whatever states decide to do, it is important that they stand ready to modify policies as legal marijuana markets evolve. Policy makers have little experience regulating a fully commercial market in this drug. It makes sense for states to proceed with caution and reserve the right to change course as they learn more.

Full text:   Two decades ago the notion of a Goldilocks economy was very much in vogue. It was a snappy way of saying that the economy was growing at a nice, steady pace -- fast enough to create jobs but not so rapidly that it would lead to runaway inflation.
As Robert B. Reich, then the secretary of labor, put it in a White House news conference in 1995, the United States at that moment was enjoying a Goldilocks recovery that was "not too hot, not too cold." Wall Street loved that formula and the stock market boomed.
Much the same could have been said these days, though Goldilocks hasn't been invoked all that often to describe the recent environment. That may be because the Federal Reserve has been such a commanding presence that it has overshadowed everything else, Seth J. Masters, the chief investment officer of Bernstein Global Wealth Management, said in a telephone interview.
"It's as though Goldilocks entered the house of the three bears and found the porridge was being heated in a big microwave oven," he said. "Sure, it's just the right temperature inside but there's a reason for it. It's hard not to focus on the microwave."
For several years now, Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, has been calling the current setup the "Bernanke-locks economy," because, in his view, stimulative policies begun under Ben S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, created a pleasant environment for stock investors. And Mr. Hickey said last week that Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting showed that those policies haven't changed under the current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
"If anything, she's more dovish than Bernanke," he said. "The Fed is still on the same track."
Whatever you call it, the benign economic environment has supported a bull market since 2009, and though there were a few rocky days last week, the main market ingredients seemed to remain in place.
For example, on Wednesday a government report on gross domestic product in the second quarter showed that the economy was growing smartly, even rapidly, at a 4 percent annualized rate; yet the Federal Reserve declared that inflation was low enough to allow the slowly moderating pace of its expansive monetary policy to remain on track.
In a statement on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee said the central bank would continue to ratchet down its bond purchases as planned, yet it also said its policies would "maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative." The Fed already holds more than $4 trillion in bonds, up from less than $1 billion when the financial crisis started, and it's still buying more.
"The Fed remains a very big player in the bond market, and it will continue to pull down interest rates for a long time," Bill Stone, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management in Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview.
The Fed also indicated that it expects to hold short-term rates near zero for "a considerable time," even if the jobs picture improves. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that 209,000 positions were created in July -- the sixth consecutive month in which the figure topped 200,000. That hadn't happened since 1997.
In addition, although it's been rising lately, inflation remains within the 2 percent range that the Fed desires. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- it's cursed with the bureaucratic name of "the core personal consumption expenditure deflator" -- rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, up from only 1.2 percent and 1.3 percent in the two previous quarters.
Furthermore, despite some disappointments, overall corporate earnings continue to outpace the domestic economy as well as most Wall Street expectations. As of Thursday, with 71 percent of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reporting, more than 68 percent beat Wall Street estimates for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which projected that earnings per share grew at a 7 percent rate.
Put all of that together and despite a 2 percent drop in the S.&P. 500 on Thursday, many analysts like the chances that the bull market in stocks will keep running. "We're cautiously optimistic," KC Mathews, chief investment officer of UMB Bank in Kansas City, Mo., said in an interview.
While a market correction -- a drop of 10 percent or more -- wouldn't be a surprise, he said, he expects the market to keep climbing. "Earnings are strong, interest rates are low, the economy is growing," he said. "There are problems, to be sure, but it seems likely that they can be managed."
Among those problems are stock valuations. One commonly used measure, the price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the S.&P. 500, based on consensus earnings expectations, stands at 15.6, said Mr. Masters of Bernstein Global Wealth Management. Another common measure, the trailing 12-month P/E ratio, is 17.8, according to Bloomberg. Either way, those values are higher than they were five years ago, when stocks were something of a bargain, and the Fed said in mid-July that in certain pockets -- biotech and small-cap stocks, for example -- valuations are somewhat "stretched."
Mr. Masters said that stocks are "fairly valued," especially with interest rates so low. Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction of interest rates, are, conversely, extraordinarily high, he said, and stocks look comparatively good.
"Stocks are extremely appealing because of bond yields and prices," he said.
An unexpectedly sharp rise in inflation would upset this balance, however. To combat an inflation surge, the Fed would presumably need to raise interest rates abruptly, and the potential for stock market disruption would be high. In its statement last week, however, the Fed said, "There remains significant underutilization of labor resources" in the economy -- an indication that it believes that wage inflation is unlikely for some time.
Then there's the ever-present possibility of a big external shock -- say, a spiraling of oil prices set off by conflict in the Middle East, or a recession arising from a violent conflict of major proportions. "We can't predict the occurrence of things like that, of course," said Mr. Stone of PNC Wealth Management. "That's the definition of a 'black swan' event. You don't know it's coming. You want to be diversified and safe in your investments in any case. But at the moment, we don't see anything like that on the horizon."
What are visible now are continuing global conditions that by historical standards are highly abnormal, and largely favorable for stocks. Interest rates aren't just low in the United States. They remain extraordinarily low in many parts of the world, thanks in part to the Fed and to central banks in Europe, Japan and other regions. In a note to clients last week, Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, said that fears of sharply rising interest rates in the United States are misplaced when 10-year government notes in Germany remain near 1 percent. With further turmoil around the world, interest rates in the United States could even move lower. And that could provide further steam for the American stock market.
From this perspective, it's not just the Federal Reserve that has engineered a latter-day Goldilocks economy: It's a global phenomenon. And while conditions are far from perfect and surely won't last forever, they've been awfully good for stock investors for a very long time.

Full text:   Little to rave or rant about.
That was the view among economists of Friday's jobs report, in which the Labor Department estimated that the economy added 209,000 jobs in July, continuing a string of sturdy monthly advances above 200,000 but lower than in recent months and less than analysts had expected.
And while the numbers didn't soar to new heights, they completed the strongest pace of job creation over a six-month period since the prerecession year of 2006, while helping to calm concerns on Wall Street that the economy was about to accelerate to a point where the Federal Reserve would be under pressure to start raising interest rates earlier than anticipated.
"This report is consistent with a moderation in economic growth in the second half of the year," said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. "This is a labor market that is growing solidly, just not quite as fast as in prior months."
The Labor Department, using a different method of measuring the job market, said Friday that unemployment increased to 6.2 percent from 6.1 percent in June. Many economists viewed the slight rise in the official jobless rate as a modestly encouraging sign, in part because more people reported that they were looking for work, suggesting that many of them were seeing greater job opportunities.
On Wall Street, stocks fell only a little after their sharp decline on Thursday, while the bond market improved slightly as interest rates softened.
The latest economic data reinforced the view that inflation and wages remain bound by a fairly tight straitjacket, suggesting that the Federal Reserve will see little need to retreat more quickly from its stimulus campaign. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies argued in recent months that the declining unemployment rate overstated the economy's progress, because more people would start looking for work as the recovery continued. The uptick in the unemployment rate in July lent credence to that view.
Inflation also remained sluggish. The Fed's preferred measure, which the government also updated Friday, rose just 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, remaining below the central bank's preferred pace of 2 percent a year.
The Fed affirmed on Wednesday that it planned to keep interest rates low as long as unemployment remained elevated and inflation remained under control. The sole dissenter, Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said on Friday that the Fed still should be moving more quickly toward raising rates. In an unusual statement explaining his decision, he noted that inflation had increased over the last year, while unemployment declined, so conditions were moving closer to the Fed's stated goals.
On the jobs numbers, the July figure was well below the revised 298,000 surge reported in June and lower than the 229,000 figure now reported for May.
The figures for July confirmed that a gradual healing of the job market remained on track, even as it underscored just how much more needs to be done to reach a level where most people who want to work can find a job relatively easily. It showed, for example, that over the last year employers added 2.57 million jobs, the steepest rate of job creation for any 12-month period in the five-year expansion. But the proportion of the country's population that reported having a job in July was unchanged at 59 percent, a number that was up only barely from its 58.7 percent level of a year ago, and still near its lowest levels since the late 1970s.
"The economy still has a huge amount of headwind out there from the popping of the credit bubble," said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., in an interview before the labor market numbers were released Friday. "We're not through that by any means."
The Hamilton Project, a Washington group affiliated with the Brookings Institution, calculated that the economy had a "jobs gap" at the end of July of 5.7 million jobs, the number needed to return to prerecession employment levels while absorbing the people who enter the labor force each month.
For all the shortcomings, the economy nonetheless appears to be in better shape than at any time since the recession hit in late 2007. So far this year, for example, the economy has added an average of 230,000 jobs a month, compared with 194,000 last year, 174,000 in 2011 and only 88,000 in 2010.
"This is another solid report that shows we are sustaining the momentum of broad-based growth in the economy," said Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, in a telephone interview. He cited the growth in well-paying professional and business services jobs as evidence that the economy is not creating just low-paid jobs. The retail and manufacturing sectors also added jobs.
General optimism about the economy was supported on Wednesday when the Commerce Department, in its initial estimate of the economy's overall output for the second quarter, reported that the gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 percent for the spring, rebounding from a 2.1 percent decline during the harsh winter quarter.
Adding to the more upbeat view was a report from the Institute for Supply Management showing its manufacturing index rose to 57.1 in July, from 55.3 in June. It was the highest reading in three years, bolstered by improvements in the index of new orders, production, employment and supplier deliveries.
The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 81.8 in the last July reading, up from the initial July reading of 81.3. The index was on track with moderate consumer spending growth.
But Friday's data from the Labor Department showed that in July wages barely moved, inching up by just a penny and leaving wages only 2 percent higher than a year ago, a rate that barely outpaced inflation.
"People's standards of living are still stuck in the mud," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economics, who called the government's report otherwise "close to perfect" because job growth increased across nearly all industries and all pay scales.
The news that wages remained flat contrasted with an Employment Cost Index report Thursday that American labor costs recorded their biggest gain since the third quarter of 2008. The notion that wages might be rising helped prompt the sell-off among investors Thursday, highlighting the divergent views between some on Wall Street and those held by many economists who view rising wages as essential to sustaining an expanding economy.
Higher wages have been "a key missing ingredient from the recovery," Jared Bernstein, an economist at the left-of-center Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a blog post.
In Rochester, at least one company was looking to hire young people. Neal P. Elli, chief executive of Empire Precision Plastics, said he had openings for about a dozen workers for his company, which makes molds for plastic parts used in electronics and medical devices.
Most workers in his industry are older and will be retiring soon, Mr. Elli said. A new employee with four years of training could make $50,000 a year. "I can't think of a better career than mold-making," he said.

Abstract: Based on these estimates, I calculate that the "fiscal gap" -- a yardstick of total government indebtedness that I've worked on with the economists Alan J. Auerbach and Jagadeesh Gokhale -- was $210 trillion last year, up from $205 trillion the previous year. [...]5 trillion was the true deficit. The fiscal gap -- the difference between our government's projected financial obligations and the present value of all projected future tax and other receipts -- is, effectively, our nation's credit card bill.

Full text:   BOSTON -- HOUSEHOLDS can't spend, on a continuing basis, more than they earn. Countries can't either, at least not over the long run. But countries can certainly leave the bill for their current spending to the young and to future generations. Official borrowing is the old-fashioned way to do this: Sell Treasury bonds, and other securities, and spend the proceeds. But borrowing in broad daylight has a drawback: The more you do it, the more lenders worry about repayment, and the more interest they charge for their loans.
So there's a different way to borrow -- one that's more subtle, harder to see and, therefore, cheaper to do. You still take in money, pledge to return it, and leave future generations on the hook. But you call the money you take in "taxes," not "borrowing." And you promise repayment in the form of pension, health care and other benefits, but you don't record the present value of those promises as official debt.
Social Security is a prime example. It takes in money, via payroll taxes, while promising hefty retirement benefits in return. Dig deep into the appendix of the most recent Social Security Trustees Report, released on Monday, and you'll find that the program's unfunded obligation is $24.9 trillion "through the infinite horizon" (or a mere $10.6 trillion, as calculated through 2088). That's nearly twice the $12.6 trillion in public debt held by the United States government.
Social Security is backed by something perhaps even more powerful than the full faith and credit of the government: the political power of some 100 million Americans 50 and older.
My 94-year-old mom is in this demographic. She's collecting Social Security retirement benefits based on her 35 years of payroll tax payments, first as a university administrator and then as a printing broker. She's also receiving widow's benefits based on my dad's 30-year work history at Kotlikoff's, the department store in Camden, N.J., that he owned with his brothers.
Every month, my mom receives a yellow and green benefit check for $1,600 from the Treasury. I expect she'll keep collecting those Social Security checks for a long time. She's crushing 50-year-olds at bridge and doing yoga. Apart from their amount, the checks look identical to the $400 checks she receives every six months on her small remaining holdings of Treasury bonds. Yet Uncle Sam's obligation to send her the $400 checks is recorded on its books, whereas his obligation to send her the $1,600 checks is not. (I'm 63, but not collecting benefits yet.)
True, Social Security benefits could be cut by Congress and the president. But so can official debt, as Argentina's likely default reminds us. The prospect of formal default by the United States is remote. Informal default via the inflationary, easy-money policies of the Federal Reserve since 2007, is more likely. (Social Security is pegged to inflation, so while inflation would help with our official debts to creditors, like China, it is far from a panacea.)
Social Security's hidden debt is just a small part of the story. Two weeks ago, the Congressional Budget Office released its annual long-term budget outlook. The good news: This year's deficit -- about 3 percent of gross domestic product -- is the smallest since 2007 and way down from the peak of almost 10 percent in 2009. The bad: Without action, the deficit will grow "notably larger" starting in about four years, a result of our aging population, rising health costs and the new subsidies for health insurance.
Even worse, the budget office raised what's called the alternative fiscal scenario, the most realistic projection of fiscal outcomes absent major policy changes. Based on these estimates, I calculate that the "fiscal gap" -- a yardstick of total government indebtedness that I've worked on with the economists Alan J. Auerbach and Jagadeesh Gokhale -- was $210 trillion last year, up from $205 trillion the previous year. Thus $5 trillion was the true deficit.
The fiscal gap -- the difference between our government's projected financial obligations and the present value of all projected future tax and other receipts -- is, effectively, our nation's credit card bill. Eliminating it, would require an immediate, permanent 59 percent increase in federal tax revenue. An immediate, permanent 38 percent cut in federal spending would also suffice. The longer we wait, the worse the pain. If, for example, we do nothing for 20 years, the requisite federal tax increase would be 70 percent, or the requisite spending cut, 43 percent.
Even if we do nothing -- which, given Washington, is the likeliest outcome these days -- we should at least be transparent about our insolvency. A bill introduced last year by the Democratic senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Chris Coons of Delaware and the Republican senators Rob Portman of Ohio and John Thune of South Dakota would require the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget to conduct such "generational accounting."
Former government officials from both parties, and more than 1,200 economists, including 17 Nobel laureates, have endorsed the legislation, known as the Inform Act. It would keep our government honest, and sound an alarm.
What we confront is not just an economics problem. It's a moral issue. Will we continue to hide most of the bills we are bequeathing our children? Or will we, at long last, systematically measure all the bills and set about reducing them?

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve affirmed its commitment to stimulate the economy on Wednesday in a policy statement that said labor market conditions remained well below the level that most of the central bank's officials consider healthy.
The Fed announced, as expected, that it would reduce its monthly bond purchases to $25 billion, but it gave little indication that recent signs of stronger growth had altered its determination to hold short-term interest rates near zero into 2015.
Instead, the Fed emphasized its concern about the millions of Americans who still cannot find jobs. "A range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources" even as the unemployment rate is falling back toward normal levels, the Fed said in a statement released after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.
The emphasis on unemployment was particularly striking as it came just hours after the government reported stronger economic growth in the second quarter. The Fed's statement acknowledged that growth had "rebounded," but its tone was measured. It described the chances of faster growth as roughly balanced against the chances that the expansion would slow down.
The statement also gave little ground to critics who worry that the Fed is ignoring signs of rising inflation, although it said Fed officials had become less concerned that inflation would continue to run below their desired annual pace of 2 percent.
In effect, the Fed concluded that recent data was consistent with its expectations -- neither more nor less -- and so it held to its course.
"This dovish message about slack in labor markets was balanced by a somewhat more hawkish message on inflation," Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients. On balance, he said the Fed was "acknowledging the improvement in the economic data and labor markets, but not signaling that it is in any hurry to move to rate hikes."
The Fed has already said that it plans to stop buying more bonds in October after making a penultimate purchase in September. The looming question is how long it will then wait to start raising interest rates.
Officials are struggling to reconcile the slow pace of growth with continued declines in unemployment. The government estimated on Wednesday that the economy expanded at a 1 percent annual rate in the first half of 2014, as stronger growth in the second quarter offset a brief contraction in the first quarter. The unemployment rate, however, fell by half a percentage point over the same period -- and by 1.4 percentage points over the last year.
Some Fed officials see evidence that the economy is settling into a new pattern of modest growth, and that monetary policy has substantially exhausted its power to improve the situation. They want the Fed to retreat more quickly from its stimulus campaign, fearing that holding down interest rates will result in higher inflation, or that it will encourage excessive risk-taking by investors.
"I believe we are at risk of doing what the Fed has too often done: overstaying our welcome by staying too loose, too long," Richard W. Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in an op-ed article published this week in The Wall Street Journal. Fed officials normally avoid public comment leading up to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington.
Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, dissented Wednesday, citing his concern about the Fed's intent to maintain short-term rates near zero for "a considerable time" after the end of the bond-buying program. Mr. Fisher, despite his remarks, was one of nine votes in favor.
The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies have taken a more cautious view, arguing that the decline in the unemployment rate appears to overstate the improvement in the labor market, because it counts only people who are looking for work. Ms. Yellen has said she expects some people who dropped out of the labor force to return as the economy continues to improve, and she has pointed to tepid wage growth as evidence that it remains easy to find workers.
"The recovery is not yet complete," she told Congress this month.
The statement suggested that the committee continued to back Ms. Yellen's view, said Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon.
"The committee as a whole is still willing to give Yellen the benefit of the doubt," Mr. Duy said. "And honestly they have good reason. Until you get upward pressure on wages, it is terribly difficult to say that she's wrong."
In recent conversations with Oregon businesses, Mr. Duy said, he heard repeatedly that it was becoming harder to hire workers, but also that businesses were unwilling to offer higher wages as an inducement, because they doubted their ability to recoup the cost through increased sales or higher prices.
The Fed also continues to grapple with the details of how to raise interest rates. It must decide on a role for the federal funds rate, the Fed's primary tool before the financial crisis, which has lost much of its practical significance but remains a familiar benchmark for investors and the public. The International Monetary Fund said in a recent report "there seems to be no clear benefit" to changing horses, noting its use in many financial contracts.

Full text:   The United States economy rebounded strongly in the second quarter of the year, shaking off the negative effects of an unusually harsh winter and stirring hopes that it might finally be establishing a solid enough footing to put the lingering effects of the recession squarely in the past.
The Commerce Department, in its initial estimate for April, May and June, reported on Wednesday that the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 percent, surpassing expectations.
During the first quarter, output shrank at a rate of 2.1 percent, less than had been reported. The department had earlier said that first-quarter output fell 2.9 percent.
Some experts, citing a range of indicators including an improving job market, were encouraged by the signs of healthy business investment and consumer spending, but others cautioned that the economy had yet to break out of an underlying pattern of steady but relatively sluggish growth that has plagued the nation since the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009.
President Obama heralded the positive economic news on a visit to Kansas City, Mo.
Federal Reserve policy makers, meeting this week in Washington, said they were taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the latest data, emphasizing concern about the millions of Americans who still cannot find jobs.
In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, the Fed acknowledged that growth had "rebounded," but its tone was measured and it made clear that it had no plans to raise interest rates anytime soon. It described the chances of faster growth as roughly even with the chances that the expansion would slow down.
"The recovery so far has been unspectacular," said Ben Herzon, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm based in St. Louis. "With the exception of a few wiggles here and there, it's been on this steady growth path, which is not great but it's been good enough."
Democrats are hoping to use the signs of an improving economy as a selling point in the run-up to midterm elections as proof their policies are working. Mr. Obama seemed energized by the report, though even his take was muted. He said a healthy jobs market was the real measure of whether the economy was working.
"I'm glad that G.D.P. is growing, and I'm glad that corporate profits are high, and I'm glad that the stock market is booming," the president told a boisterous crowd in Kansas City. "But what I really want to see is a guy working 9 to 5, and then working some overtime. I want that guy making more than the minimum wage."
Consumer spending on automobiles, furniture and recreational goods helped bolster G.D.P. for the second quarter, as did an increase in state and local government expenditures that offset a modest decline in federal spending. But the biggest factor in the quarterly expansion was a sharp increase in the stocks of goods in warehouses and on store shelves as businesses anticipated that consumers were developing a greater urge to shop.
The rate at which businesses stock their shelves can be volatile, and the second-quarter gains could falter if consumers do not continue to spend freely in the second half of the year. For all the exuberance over Wednesday's news, at least one economist chalked up the latest numbers mostly to "payback" for the poor showing in the first quarter.
Looking back over the last 12 months, the overall inflation-adjusted output of goods and services for the second quarter was 2.4 percent higher than the same quarter a year earlier, barely ahead of the average pace of 2.2 percent growth since the recession ended.
Still, most economists say that -- little by little -- the economy is returning to a healthier state.
"It isn't something people are going to get excited about, but it does represent honest, real progress," said Michael Gapen, a senior economist for Barclays, which predicted more of the same for the rest of the year.
Perhaps the biggest factor holding back the economy has been slow wage growth, as the high number of people out of work means that businesses see little need to pay much more to attract new employees. Housing has partly recovered from the depths it fell to during the recession but has not significantly helped power the economy forward as it did in the early stages of past expansions.
Second-quarter earnings for many companies have been mixed. Labor conditions continue to be underwhelming, contributing to the belief of many jobless Americans that the economy is leaving them behind.
"We made up some of the ground lost in the first three months of this year, but there's nothing in today's data to indicate that the economy is growing more strongly than it has for the past couple of years," the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning nonprofit group focused on low- and middle-income workers, said in a release on Wednesday.
The White House Council of Economic Advisers said in a statement that the economy could perform even better if Congress makes sure infrastructure improvements such as road and bridge work do not stall.
Bob Baur, chief global economist for Principal Global Investors, made up a name for what he thinks has been holding back both consumers and businesses from the more exuberant kind of spending that would help close the gap of as much as $1 trillion between the economy's current level and its larger capacity for generating goods and services without setting off a significant rise in inflation.
He called it "post-crisis relapse disorder," which he defined as behavior based on the expectation that the economic outlook will be grim merely because it has been so grim for months before.
Still, another positive sign for the economy came this week when the Conference Board said consumers were more upbeat about the economy than they had been in the last seven years. On Wednesday, ADP, the payroll processing company, said private employers added 218,000 jobs in the last month, down from 281,000 in June. It was the fourth straight month of job gains above 200,000.
But the company's figures cover only private businesses and often do not track with the government's jobs report, which will be released Friday morning.

Full text:   Barring a last-minute deal, Argentina will default on billions of dollars of bonds on Wednesday.
It would be Argentina's second default in 13 years. But unlike the last time, when scores of unhappy Argentines took to the street as unemployment rose to 25 percent and inflation soared, this default would look decidedly different.
Argentina's equity, bond and currency markets, which have been volatile in recent days, would certainly feel a jolt. The government and Argentine companies, which have been largely locked out of global markets since the last default in 2001, would find it even harder to raise money. And the economy, which has struggled with stagflation for years, would most likely slow further.
But the reaction will probably be muted because this default is not a surprise.
"This is kind of a chronicle of a default foretold," said Arturo Porzecanski, director of the international economic relations program at American University, referring to the novella by the Colombian writer Gabriel García Márquez, "Chronicle of a Death Foretold."
A default has been in the making since a group of New York hedge funds gained significant victories in American courts, where they are demanding that Argentina pay them in full on government bonds that defaulted in 2001.
As in Mr. García Márquez's books, the hedge funds' battle against Argentina is full of unusual twists.
In a pivotal ruling, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court in Manhattan said that Argentina could not continue to make regular payments on its main class of bonds -- whose investors had agreed to accept a lower amount than they were owed -- without paying the hedge funds. A payment is scheduled for the main class of bondholders on Wednesday. Argentina, however, has insisted that it will not cave into the demands of the hedge funds, which it has called vultures.
"It would be a shocking surprise," Mr. Porzecanski said, "if Argentina pulled out their pocketbook and paid" the hedge funds.
But even as it fights the hedge funds, which are led by Paul E. Singer's NML Capital, Argentina also risks angering its main debt holders and prolonging its legal and financial woes.
The country's predicament today is inextricably linked to its default in 2001 and events after it. Argentina's economy in 2001 was in dire straits after four years of recession. Unable to continue making payments on loans from foreign creditors, it was engulfed in debt before it declared a formal default.
Through two restructurings, the government eventually struck a deal with a majority of its bond investors, who are now called exchange bondholders because they exchanged their bonds for ones that were worth as little as a fourth of the value of the original securities. The hedge funds, known as the holdouts, declined to participate in the restructurings. Instead, they are seeking $1.5 billion in repayment, including interest.
Judge Griesa's ruling in 2012 was later upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Then in June, the United States Supreme Court refused to consider Argentina's last appeal. Judge Griesa gave Argentina a 30-day grace period on a scheduled June 30 payment to its main exchange bondholders.
Yet after a series of unsuccessful and hurried last-minute mediated talks between representatives of the Argentine government and the holdouts, both sides appear to have failed to settle their differences.
In defiance of Judge Griesa's ruling, Argentina in June deposited $539 million into the Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee handling the bond payments, in an attempt to meet its exchange bond payment.
But Judge Griesa ruled that if Bank of New York Mellon made the payment, it would be in contempt of court.
Argentina has also asked the judge for a stay on his 2012 ruling, arguing that a delay would help it to negotiate a deal. On Tuesday, a group of investors of Argentina's euro-denominated exchange bonds urged the judge to issue an emergency stay on his ruling. But this is unlikely to be granted unless the holdouts request it, analysts said, or the court-appointed mediator, Daniel Pollack, recommends it.
In depositing the next installment of bond payments, the Argentine government has said that a default would not be its fault, a claim that has gained it political mileage. In a speech last week, the country's president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, conveyed this belief. "They're going to have to come up with a new name," she told an audience, referring to the word default, "a new term that reflects the fact that the debtor paid and someone blocked it."
Also last week, Judge Griesa ordered the Argentine delegation and the holdouts to meet with Mr. Pollack and talk "continuously" until an agreement was reached.
The response from Argentina was tepid; the delegation met twice with Mr. Pollack last week before returning home to Buenos Aires for the weekend to consult with the government.
When a group of lawyers returned to Mr. Pollack's offices on Tuesday, they arrived more than 15 minutes late. And despite Mr. Pollack's insistence that they engage in "face-to-face conversations with the bondholders," as of Tuesday evening, the Argentines had yet to sit down across the table from the holdouts.
Argentina's lack of enthusiasm has prompted some lawyers and analysts watching the case to question whether Argentina actually wants to avert a default.
"If you're picking a default as a rational avenue, it is because you have decided two things," said Marco E. Schnabl, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom who is not directly involved in the case. "One, that picking a fight with the American legal system is politically convenient, and two, that the cost of settling with holdouts and everyone else who still has unpaid bonds is vastly greater than the costs of having to take a default."
But even with that thinking, the picture is anything but clear because some of the legal theories behind the contracts governing Argentina's debt have not been tested.
Argentina has said, for example, that if it agreed to a settlement, it could be on the line for as much as $15 billion in holdout investors' claims. That is because any deal would have to include all holdouts, even those not represented in the case.
In such a case, bondholders who exchanged their defaulted bonds for discounted ones might also have the right to demand the same compensation terms, according to a clause in the bond restructuring terms that expires at the end of this year.
On the other hand, if Argentina does default, it runs the risk of more lawsuits, said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies. In many ways, this is perhaps the most significant implication of a default.
If enough bondholders from one class of exchange bondholders agree, they have the right to "accelerate" their bonds after Argentina misses its July 30 payment. They could then pressure the government to pay the full amount of their discounted bonds quickly, Ms. Morden added. This could mean a payment of as much as $28.7 billion to those bondholders, according to estimates by JPMorgan.
"With acceleration, you know everyone has a gun," said Anna Gelpern, a law professor at Georgetown University. "The question is. Will they shoot?" But, she added, if Argentina agreed on a settlement with the holdouts, that could prompt lawsuits from exchange bondholders seeking the same terms. In that case, she said, "You don't know if there is a gun, but if there is, it is a bazooka."

Abstract: Deutsche Bank -- has chosen to stop lending money and serving as a prime broker to Point72 after SAC's guilty plea.

Full text:   Updated, 8:38 p.m. | Three months after his once-powerful hedge fund entered a guilty plea to insider trading charges, Steven A. Cohen is doing quite well.
This summer, Mr. Cohen and his family rented a yacht off the Greek islands for a vacation. An avid art collector, Mr. Cohen attended Art Basel in Switzerland in June. And last weekend, he and his wife, Alexandra, were guests at a charitable event at the Hamptons home of the comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his wife, Jessica.
Most of all, Mr. Cohen, 58, is continuing to do what he has done best for more than two decades: make an astounding amount of money from trading stocks and bonds.
His renamed firm, Point72 Asset Management, which manages $9 billion to $10 billion of his personal fortune, is proving to be nearly as profitable as his former hedge fund.
Over the first six months of this year, the firm generated a profit of nearly $1 billion, said two people briefed on the matter. In 2013, SAC's last year as a hedge fund, Mr. Cohen personally made about $2.3 billion.
The profits generated to date at Point72 are nearly equal to the $1.2 billion penalty that SAC paid to the federal government as part of its guilty plea. Mr. Cohen's new firm, which is prohibited from managing money for outside investors, is making money even as more than a dozen top portfolio managers or traders have left for jobs with other hedge funds.
Despite those departures, the stain on his reputation and a still unresolved civil action against him, little has changed for Mr. Cohen.
His new firm employs nearly 850 people, just 150 fewer than SAC did last summer when the then-$14 billion hedge fund was indicted and Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, called the fund a "magnet for market cheaters." Only one Wall Street firm -- Deutsche Bank -- has chosen to stop lending money and serving as a prime broker to Point72 after SAC's guilty plea.
Mr. Cohen's firm even plans to continue an annual Thanksgiving tradition begun by SAC -- it will again sponsor a giant balloon inflation celebration and parade in downtown Stamford, Conn., on Nov. 22.
There is a new sign outside the firm's 98,900-square-foot headquarters at 72 Cummings Point Road in Stamford and employees now don fleece vests emblazoned with the Point72 logo as opposed to the old SAC one. But those changes are largely cosmetic.
Federal authorities insist that SAC's guilty plea, combined with the insider trading convictions of more than 80 people, including eight who used to work for Mr. Cohen, serves as a powerful deterrent. But some say that message may travel only so far.
"The SAC affair put more fear into midlevel people than into billionaires," said Erik M. Gordon, a professor at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. "If you are as rich as Cohen, you can survive huge fines and attorney fees and even an industry ban that leaves you managing your own billions. The only thing you fear is jail time."
Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment. The firm this year has taken a number of steps to stiffen its compliance procedures and surveillance of traders to ensure that no more improper trading takes place.
It remains to be seen if Point72 will be able to continue its early success, especially if top traders continue to leave and the firm makes no new star hires to replace them.
The two most recent prominent departures are the portfolio managers Shoney Katz and Peter Avellone, who are joining a trading platform at Citadel, the large investment firm led by Kenneth C. Griffin, another billionaire investor. Mr. Katz and Mr. Avellone left Point72 within the last few weeks, said the people briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Gabriel Plotkin, one of Mr. Cohen's most successful traders, recently wound down his onetime $1 billion stock portfolio to focus exclusively on raising money for his own hedge fund, which will start next year with up to $200 million in financial backing from Mr. Cohen. Mr. Plotkin seeks to raise up to $1 billion from other investors and intends to staff his new fund with the analysts and junior traders who have worked with him at Mr. Cohen's firm, these same people said.
Point72 has managed to hire just two established traders from the outside so far this year: Scott Braunstein, who came from JPMorgan Chase's asset management division, and Howard Man from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For Mr. Man, who will be based in the Point72 office in Hong Kong, this is his second go-round working for Mr. Cohen.
Most of the hires at Point72 have been research analysts, many of them relatively junior employees. The firm has brought on about 30 new analysts this year, said a person briefed on the matter. This person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Cohen was looking to hire analysts over more experienced traders because he now preferred to groom his own trading force.
In effect, Mr. Cohen, a minority owner in the New York Mets baseball team, is looking to create his own internal farm team to develop the firm's traders of tomorrow.
But that strategy has risks, because it takes time for an analyst to mature into a trader knowledgeable enough to take the appropriate risk to make money. Hedge fund industry recruiters who did not want to be identified because they sometimes worked with Point72 said the firm's push to hire analysts also reflected the fact that top traders were still reluctant to join the firm so soon after SAC's guilty plea.
The billion-dollar profit that Point72 has made so far this year is a large one, but the firm is a very different creature now, and comparisons with hedge funds are inexact. Because it is what is known as a family office, the firm does not have outside investors to share profits and pay fees.
Through the end of June, Point72 was up a little over 9 percent, but that is a gross figure, said two people briefed on the matter. Hedge funds are normally judged based on their performance after paying fees and expenses. If Point72 were still operating as a hedge fund, its reported performance to outside investors would be closer to 4 to 5 percent.
A 4 percent gain would be enough to beat the average 3.2 percent return posted by all hedge funds as measured by the Hedge Fund Research indexes. A year ago, SAC ended June up 8.25 percent after paying fees and expenses. For the full year, the fund posted a 20 percent return.
By that standard, the current 9 percent gross return is good, but it is a far cry from the 25 percent average annual return SAC recorded during its 22-year history.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in June, as the real estate market appears to have cooled off this summer.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index slipped 1.1 percent to 102.7 last month. The index remains 7.3 percent below its level a year ago.
Sales have been slowed by a mix of meager wage growth, rising home prices and mortgage rates that rose steadily through the end of last year.
Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.
Signed contracts in June fell in the Northeast and South. They rose slightly in the Midwest and West. Pending sales in all four United States regions are below last year's pace.
Home sales had been improving through the middle of 2013, but stumbled over the last 12 months. Buying has decelerated despite a recent decline in mortgage rates and home prices' increasing at a slower rate than last year.
Sales were initially disrupted by harsh winter weather, but the summer slowdown suggests that financial pressures are now keeping would-be buyers on the sidelines.
"The latest decline raises questions about the housing market strength after the weather-related rebound is behind us," said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an analyst at BNP Paribas. "Housing will remain an area of concern" for the Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, she added.
New-home sales fell 8.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000, the Commerce Department said last week.
The Realtors group recently reported that sales of used homes increased 2.6 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million homes. It was the first time that sales had been above five million since October, yet the pace of buying remained below last year's level of 5.1 million.
Economists generally consider annual home sales of 5.5 million to be consistent with a healthy housing market.
Still, there are indications that sales could pick up. Along with the arrival of spring, average mortgage rates have dropped to 4.13 percent, down from a 52-week high of 4.58 percent, according to Freddie Mac.
The rate of average price gains has slowed to 4.3 percent year-over-year, according to the Realtors group. That is down from gains in the double digits. But wage growth has barely kept pace with inflation, eating into how much income people have to spend and save for down payments.

Full text:   The government's official statistic for college-tuition inflation has become somewhat infamous. It appears frequently in the news media, and policy makers lament what it shows.
No wonder: College tuition and fees have risen an astounding 107 percent since 1992, even after adjusting for economywide inflation, according to the measure. No other major household budget item has increased in price nearly as much.
But it turns out the government's measure is deeply misleading.
For years, that measure was based on the list prices that colleges published in their brochures, rather than the actual amount students and their families paid. The government ignored financial-aid grants. Effectively, the measure tracked the price of college for rich families, many of whom were not eligible for scholarships, but exaggerated the price -- and price increases -- for everyone from the upper middle class to the poor.
>
You can think of it as the Joseph A. Bank problem, in honor of the men's retailer where clothes are permanently on sale. If you take Joseph A. Bank's sticker prices literally, you don't understand its business.
The good news is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has gradually begun to change its methods since 2003, to capture the effects of financial aid. It will take more time to know how well those efforts are working. But the bureau won't alter the historical data, which means the long-term comparisons will never capture the actual cost of college for American families.
Those oft-cited comparisons, notes Sandy Baum, a George Washington University professor and an expert on college costs, says, are "certainly misleading."
The discrepancy matters because the country is in the midst of a roiling debate about whether college is worth it. Various pundits on both the left and right have taken to claiming that higher education is overrated and often not worth it. The shocking increase in college costs, according to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, is part of their argument.
I know what you're thinking at this point: Wait a minute -- college really is expensive and has gotten a lot more so. It's certainly true that public colleges have become more expensive in recent years, partly because of state budget cuts. These rising costs have created financial struggles for many students and, most worrisome of all, have kept some from graduating or even applying in the first place. By almost any economic calculation, the country would be better off if college were more affordable for middle- and low-income families.
At the same time, it's worth remembering that the perception of college costs comes in large part from the high list price of private colleges. The next time you hear somebody describe college as costing $60,000 a year, know that the truth is: It costs $60,000 for affluent students who don't qualify for financial aid to attend one of the elite colleges that a tiny share of Americans attend (and the figures includes housing and food).
Taking into account financial aid -- some of which comes from the colleges themselves, some of which comes from the government -- the average tuition and fees were $12,460 at private colleges last year and $3,120 for in-state students at public four-year colleges, according to the College Board. At those prices, college is an investment with an excellent return for the vast majority of students who graduate.
So what's going on with the government's numbers? They show tuition and fees more than doubling since 1992 (that is, having risen more than 100 percent), after adjusting for the change in the value of a dollar. By comparison, gasoline has become 83 percent more expensive over that time. Child care is up 44 percent, medical care up 35 percent and supermarket food up 3 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, the cost of new vehicles has fallen 34 percent in real terms, and the cost of furniture is down 39 percent.
These are the kind of comparisons that show up in those scary charts making college tuition look as if it's in a different league from almost everything else. The only high-profile category with a price that has increased more rapidly is tobacco, because of the surge in taxes over the last two decades.
Fortunately, the government isn't the only organization that collects data on college tuition over time. The College Board also does, and it publishes different indexes on published tuition and net-price tuition, separately for public and private colleges. (Only scholarship grants are considered in the net-price calculation. Loans, appropriately, are treated as part of the tuition that families are really paying.)
Net tuition and fees at private four-year colleges have risen 22 percent since 1992, the College Board says, and the increase has been 60 percent at public four-year colleges. Community-college tuition has declined, because aid grants have outpaced published tuition. These numbers are obviously quite different from the government's index showing a 107 percent increase.
From an economic perspective, the College Board's net-price data makes more sense than the government's index. Higher education is a white-collar service industry that is split between the public and private sectors and largely immune from foreign competition, much as health care is and, to a lesser extent, day care is. We shouldn't be surprised that the actual increase in real college prices over the last two decades -- somewhere in the range of 40 percent to 50 percent -- is quite similar to that of health care or day care.
Coincidentally, sticker prices and net prices for college have changed by broadly similar percentages in the last several years, which is why it's too early to know whether the government's new methodology will be less misleading. But I'm hopeful. "We feel our financial-aid program additions have definitely had an impact," Mike Reese, the education analyst at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, told me.
There is one broader point worth making about inflation. We've been in the midst of a mini-boom in inflation conspiracy theories, be it from the writer Amity Shlaes in National Review or from the website shadowstats.com. These critics contend that, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, inflation is much faster than the government acknowledges.
The truth is closer to the opposite. The official numbers probably exaggerate inflation somewhat, academic research has found. The main reason is the difficulty of accurately capturing technological improvements over time. Imagine trying to compare the price of a MacBook Air in 2014 with a Commodore 64 in 1985.
But the problems with the college price index matter, too. There, as elsewhere, the inflation scare stories don't match reality.

Full text:   HAGUE JUDGES TO RULE ON SEIZURE OF YUKOS
A ruling by a panel of judges in The Hague is expected on Monday in a long-running case brought against the Russian Federation by the former majority shareholders of Yukos, the Russian oil company that was seized and sold off by the government in 2003 after the arrest of its chief executive and largest shareholder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, left. A verdict in favor of the former shareholders, who are asking for more than $100 billion in compensation, would add to Russia's woes. It also might be problematic for Rosneft, which acquired the main part of Yukos, and for BP, which owns 20 percent of Rosneft, among other parties. The former shareholders, who include several associates of Mr. Khodorkovsky, who was recently released from jail, say the company was illegally expropriated. The government says it acted legally to recover back taxes. STANLEY REED
FURTHER BOND-BUYING REDUCTIONS BY FED EXPECTED
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday, is widely expected to announce another cut in its monthly bond purchases, to $25 billion, in keeping with its declared intention to end the purchases in October. Officials also are expected to continue internal discussions about the next steps in the Fed's retreat, but those plans probably will not be resolved, or unveiled, for another few months. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM
EUROPE'S BANKS TO REPORT SECOND-QUARTER EARNINGS
Earnings will kick off in earnest for European banks beginning on Tuesday as UBS and Deutsche Bank report their second-quarter results. Barclays, BNP Paribas and Société Générale are among the other banks reporting this week. The earliest reports have been a mixed bag, with Credit Suisse reporting a $779 million loss driven primarily by its tax evasion settlement with the United States government and the Royal Bank of Scotland reporting its results early after it posted a better-than-expected profit. The Lloyds Banking Group, which reports on Thursday, may detail its own settlement with British and American authorities after it said last week that it was in "late stage" discussions to resolve investigations of its role in setting global benchmark interest rates. CHAD BRAY
U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH EXPECTED TO REBOUND
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department will release its advance estimate for economic growth in the second quarter of 2014. Economists estimate that gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the period, a reversal from the 2.9 percent contraction reported in the first quarter. The pickup reflects healthy consumer spending, including on automobiles, as well as a rebound in sectors that were weak in the first quarter, like housing and capital spending by businesses. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
POSSIBLE BOND DEFAULT BY ARGENTINA IS LOOMING
Argentina will default on Wednesday for the second time in 13 years if it cannot come to an agreement with a group of New York hedge funds seeking more than $1.3 billion in bond payments. A New York court has ordered Argentina to pay the investors, who refused to accept restructured bonds after the country defaulted in 2001. Last week both parties were ordered to meet "continuously" with a court-appointed mediator until they reached a settlement. But while both sides have met separately with the mediator, they have yet to meet together, and Argentine representatives were back on a plane to Buenos Aires on Friday. ALEXANDRA STEVENSON
INFLATION AND JOB DATA FOR JULY IN THE EUROZONE
On Thursday, the European Union statistics agency will publish its first estimate of inflation in the eurozone during July and the official unemployment rate for June. Any decline in inflation below 0.5 percent, the June level, could raise concern about the risk of deflation. The bad news could be offset by a slight decline in unemployment from the 11.6 percent recorded in May. JACK EWING
HEALTHY LABOR NUMBERS ANTICIPATED FOR U.S.
On Friday, the Labor Department will announce the latest data on hiring and the job market in July. Economists estimate the economy will have added 230,000 jobs in July, with the unemployment rate remaining unchanged at 6.1 percent. Although a gain in the range of 230,000 would be well below the 288,000 surge recorded in June, it would still represent a healthy pace of job creation, and come amid other recent signs that the labor market is finally healing, including lower initial claims for unemployment benefits by newly laid-off workers.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDEconomic inequality in the United States has been receiving a lot of attention. But it's not merely an issue of the rich getting richer. The typical American household has been getting poorer, too.
The inflation-adjusted net worth for the typical household was $87,992 in 2003. Ten years later, it was only $56,335, or a 36 percent decline, according to a study financed by the Russell Sage Foundation. Those are the figures for a household at the median point in the wealth distribution -- the level at which there are an equal number of households whose worth is higher and lower. But during the same period, the net worth of wealthy households increased substantially.
The Russell Sage study also examined net worth at the 95th percentile. (For households at that level, 95 percent of the population had less wealth.) It found that for this well-do-do slice of the population, household net worth increased 14 percent over the same 10 years. Other research, by economists like Edward Wolff at New York University, has shown even greater gains in wealth for the richest 1 percent of households.
For households at the median level of net worth, much of the damage has occurred since the start of the last recession in 2007. Until then, net worth had been rising for the typical household, although at a slower pace than for households in higher wealth brackets. But much of the gain for many typical households came from the rising value of their homes. Exclude that housing wealth and the picture is worse: Median net worth began to decline even earlier.
"The housing bubble basically hid a trend of declining financial wealth at the median that began in 2001," said Fabian T. Pfeffer, the University of Michigan professor who is lead author of the Russell Sage Foundation study.
The reasons for these declines are complex and controversial, but one point seems clear: When only a few people are winning and more than half the population is losing, surely something is amiss.
Correction: August 10, 2014, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 27 about household wealth in the United States referred incorrectly to households that rank in the 95th percentile in net worth. Their net worth is greater than or equal to that of 95 percent of all households, not greater than 94 percent.

Abstract: [...]the researchers found hints that such couples may now be less likely to divorce than those in which the husband has more education. According to the sociologist Philip N. Cohen, among 40-somethings with at least a bachelor's degree, as of 2012, 63 percent of men and 59 percent of women were in their first marriage, compared to just 43 percent of men and 42 percent of women without a bachelor's degree.

Full text:   OVER the past 40 years, the geography of family life has been destabilized by two powerful forces pulling in opposite directions and occasionally scraping against each other, much like tectonic plates. One is the striking progress toward equality between men and women. The other is the equally striking growth of socioeconomic inequality and insecurity.
Since the 1970s, families have become more egalitarian in their internal relationships. But inequality among families has soared. Women have become more secure as their real wages and legal rights have increased. But families have become more insecure as their income and job instability have worsened.
Sometimes these trends counteract each other, with women's work gains partly compensating for men's losses in low-income families. Sometimes they reinforce each other, since the new trend for high-earning men to marry high-earning women increases the relative advantage of such couples over low-income or single-earner families. For all Americans, these trends have changed the rewards, risks and rules of marriage.
In 1977, two-thirds of Americans believed that the ideal family arrangement was for the husband to earn the money and the wife to stay home. By 2012, less than one-third still held this belief, according to a paper coming out this week by the Council on Contemporary Families.
Husbands have doubled the time they spend doing housework. One frequently cited study suggested that couples who shared housework equally had sex less frequently than couples who followed a more conventional division of labor. But a forthcoming study of more recent marriages finds that egalitarian couples report no difference in sexual frequency or satisfaction compared to couples who cling to traditional roles -- the exception being the about 5 percent of marriages in which the husband performs most of the housework.
The researchers Christine R. Schwartz and Hongyun Han report another striking indication of continuing progress toward marital equality. Through the 1980s, couples in which the wife had more education than her husband were more likely to divorce than couples in which the wife had less or equal education. But couples who have married since the early 1990s have no added divorce risk when the wife is better educated. In fact, the researchers found hints that such couples may now be less likely to divorce than those in which the husband has more education.
But while the sexes have become more equal, society as a whole has become far less, producing especially deep losses for young men. In 1969, by the time men reached age 25, three-quarters were earning wages that could support a family of four above the poverty line. By 2004, it took until age 30 for the same percentage of men to reach this income level. And while in 1969 only 10 percent of men ages 30 to 35 were still low earners, by 2004 almost a quarter of men in that age range remained low earners.
Rising inequality has changed family dynamics for all socioeconomic groups.
In 1970, marriage rates varied little by level of education, although men and women with only a high school degree were somewhat more likely to marry than those with a college degree. In the 1970s, divorce rates rose sharply for all educational groups. Since then, however, marriage and divorce patterns have diverged.
Among Americans without college degrees, marriage rates have fallen precipitously and divorce rates remain higher. Divorce rates have fallen for college-educated couples, who are now considerably more likely to get married, and stay married, than their less-educated counterparts. According to the sociologist Philip N. Cohen, among 40-somethings with at least a bachelor's degree, as of 2012, 63 percent of men and 59 percent of women were in their first marriage, compared to just 43 percent of men and 42 percent of women without a bachelor's degree.
High-earning women have actually increased their marriage rates since the 1970s. In 1980, only 58 percent of high-earning women were married, compared to 64 percent in 2010.
So among college-educated Americans, women's increased earning power seems to have stabilized marriages. And in some ways inequality actually makes life easier for such couples, since more Americans are available to work as nannies and house-cleaners for relatively low wages.
But educated couples have not escaped the insecurity that has accompanied the polarization of incomes. The gap between the highest and lowest paid college graduates has widened substantially since the '70s, and the real earnings of young graduates actually fell between 2000 and 2013.
When the sociologist Marianne Cooper interviewed affluent Silicon Valley couples for her new book, "Cut Adrift: Families in Insecure Times," she was struck by the anxiety they expressed about their retirement prospects, and especially about how to provide their children with the skills, résumés and entrepreneurial personality traits they believe are now needed to succeed in a "winner-take-all" job market.
College-educated parents have increased the time they spend with their children at twice the rate of other Americans since the 1990s, much of it devoted to chauffeuring kids to games, camps and other activities. But these frenetic schedules are stressful and may interfere with the time couples have to spend alone, which is important to marital quality. This could be dangerous down the road, because divorce rates among couples over 50 have more than doubled since 1990, and because the protective factor of high education is not as great in late-life divorces. According to Susan L. Brown and I-Fen Lin, sociologists at Bowling Green State University, the divorce rates of college graduates over 50 are almost as high as those of high school graduates.
OVER all, though, family instability has increased most among less-educated Americans.
Men with only a high school diploma, the sociologist Andrew J. Cherlin points out in his forthcoming book, "Labor's Love Lost," used to be the mainstay of family stability in the working class. However, the male-breadwinner marriages that such men established in the 1950s and 1960s rested on two pillars that no longer exist.
The first was the availability of stable, family-wage jobs for young men without a college education. Blue-collar men could marry early, knowing that even if their starting wages were low they could anticipate predictable increases each year -- and expect their children and grandchildren to do even better.
Over the 25 years between 1947 and 1972, the average real hourly compensation of production and nonsupervisory workers nearly doubled, rising by almost 3 percent a year, according to the University of Iowa professor Colin Gordon. Confidence in future progress imbued workers with a sense that deferring gratification and sticking it out would eventually pay off, making work a powerful force promoting young men's maturation.
The second pillar supporting the stable marriages of the postwar era was the fact that most women could not earn a living wage on their own. Fifty years ago, the average college-educated woman earned less than the average high-school-educated man. Female workers, whatever their education level, had much shorter job tenures than males, and their real wages remained almost flat.
The result was that a young man could take almost any job and expect his earnings to improve substantially with time. Conversely, a young woman could marry almost any man and expect that he could support a family far better than she ever could. The prospect of ever-improving economic security made young men more likely to stay with their employers, especially since so many belonged to unions that advanced their collective interests. And the lack of earnings prospects for women made them more likely to stay with their husbands.
Today, job prospects for young men are far less favorable. Real wages for men under age 35 have fallen almost continuously since the late 1970s, and those with only a high school diploma have experienced the sharpest losses. Between 1979 and 2007, young male high school graduates saw a 29 percent decline in real annual earnings -- an even steeper decline than the 18 percent drop for men with no high school diploma.
The biggest problem facing high-school-educated young men, Dr. Cherlin points out, is not that they have lost their work ethic but that they have few opportunities to develop one. Traditional working-class jobs are disappearing, and even if a man can find the same blue-collar job that his father or grandfather held, his wages will no longer sustain a family. Between 1947 and 1979, the wages of the average meatpacking worker, adjusted for inflation, increased by around 80 percent, to just under $40,000 per year. But from 1979 to 2012, a meatpacker's wages declined by nearly 30 percent, to about $27,000.
Women's wages, by contrast, have risen significantly since the 1970s, except for those on the very bottom, who have suffered, like men, from the decline in the real value of the minimum wage. For a low or moderately educated woman, marrying a man who has a job and is willing to share his resources is still an advantage. But she has to consider the very real possibility that if he loses his job or misuses the couple's resources, he may become a financial burden.
Meanwhile, women's expectation of fairness and reciprocity in marriage has been rising even as men's ability to compensate for deficits in their behavior by being "good providers" has been falling. Low-income women consistently tell researchers that the main reason they hesitate to marry -- even if they are in love, even if they have moved in with a man to share expenses, and even if they have a child -- is that they see a bad marriage or divorce as a greater threat to their well-being than being single.
Their fears are justified. Chronic economic stress is associated with an increased incidence of depression, domestic violence, alcohol or drug abuse and infidelity, all of which raise the risk of divorce. If a woman's marriage breaks up or her husband squanders their resources, she may end up worse off than if she had remained single and focused on improving her own earning power.
If women lowered their expectations to match men's lower economic prospects, perhaps marriage would be more common in low-income communities. But it would most likely be even less stable, and certainly less fair.
Turning back the inequality revolution may be difficult. But that would certainly help more families -- at almost all income levels -- than turning back the gender revolution.

Abstract: Even with the prospect of jail time looming, Mr. D'Souza has emerged as the right-wing media star of the moment, a seemingly constant presence on talk radio and Fox News. According to Mr. D'Souza, Mr. Ricketts was taken with his 2010 book, "The Roots of Obama's Rage," and wanted more Americans to be exposed to its thesis, which argues that Obama is carrying out the anticolonial agenda of his Kenyan father.

Full text:   Nobody wants the summer to end, but especially not Dinesh D'Souza.
In June, he published, "America: Imagine a World Without Her," which spent a week as the No. 1 book on Amazon, and is currently No. 2 on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list.
In July, he released a companion film, which has grossed more than $12 million, already roughly the same as the total of such well-known documentaries as "Hoop Dreams" and "Roger & Me," counting inflation.
But in September, he will stand before a judge in a Manhattan courtroom and face a possible prison term after pleading guilty earlier this year to a violation of campaign-finance laws.
"The whole experience has been undoubtedly traumatic," Mr. D'Souza said of his prosecution. "But I'm determined not to let it deter me."
Even with the prospect of jail time looming, Mr. D'Souza has emerged as the right-wing media star of the moment, a seemingly constant presence on talk radio and Fox News. During the run-up to the film's release, he appeared at screenings across the country, arriving, rock-star style, on a tour bus emblazoned with a giant image of his face.
Animating both the book and film is Mr. D'Souza's claim that America is under attack from within -- and that the enemy is its own government, as well as its progressive collaborators in Hollywood, academia and the mainstream media. In Mr. D'Souza's telling, their goal is to undermine the country's self-image and standing by replacing the narrative of American greatness and exceptionalism with one of guilt and shame.
Mr. D'Souza has long been known as a conservative provocateur, but his latest incarnation as a right-wing Michael Moore represents a significant departure for a man who was once seen as the next William F. Buckley Jr. His success as a documentarian has also opened up the possibility of a new medium for conservatives, one that has mostly been dominated by liberals.
"With film, you have a grand platform to alter the national conversation in a profound fashion," said the radio host Laura Ingraham, who has known Mr. D'Souza since college. "I think that's more important in many ways than the daily television hits or radio shows."
Mr. D'Souza's surging popularity stems in part from his background. Born and raised in India, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth and has been affiliated with some of the country's most respected conservative think tanks.
Both his book and the film are rife with controversial assertions. "How, for example, did Obama get elected as a complete unknown?" Mr. D'Souza asks in the book. "There is a one-word answer: slavery. America's national guilt over slavery continues to benefit Obama, who ironically is not himself descended from slaves."
Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House and co-host of CNN's "Crossfire," says Mr. D'Souza's roots and scholarly bona fides give him "credibility" in right-wing circles. "A lot of conservatives feel comfortable being told things by Dinesh that they might not exactly feel comfortable being told by someone else," he said.
After Dartmouth, Mr. D'Souza worked at the Policy Review, a conservative journal in Washington, before joining the Reagan administration in 1988 as an adviser. His first book, "Illiberal Education," published in 1991, was at the center of a debate over so-called political correctness on America's college campuses.
Since then, however, Mr. D'Souza's career has taken a series of unexpected turns. His views have drawn criticism not only from the left but also from the right. His 2007 book, "The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11," ignited outrage among some conservatives, who considered its thesis -- captured succinctly in the subtitle -- not only deeply flawed but irresponsible. And in 2012, Mr. D'Souza abruptly resigned as president of King's College, a Christian school in Manhattan, after it surfaced that he was involved with a woman who was not his wife.
Mr. D'Souza, 53, said his foray into filmmaking began after a talk with the billionaire Joe Ricketts, a major donor to right-wing causes. According to Mr. D'Souza, Mr. Ricketts was taken with his 2010 book, "The Roots of Obama's Rage," and wanted more Americans to be exposed to its thesis, which argues that Obama is carrying out the anticolonial agenda of his Kenyan father.
"A book can reach 50,000, maybe 100,000, people," Mr. Ricketts said, as recalled by Mr. D'Souza. "How do you reach a million people?"
"You have to make a movie," Mr. D'Souza replied.
The result was Mr. D'Souza's first film, "2016: Obama's America," which was released during the 2012 campaign and is currently the second-highest-grossing political documentary of all time, behind only Mr. Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11." Mr. Ricketts invested in "2016: Obama's America," but not in the most recent film.
In the process of becoming one of the most influential voices on the right, Mr. D'Souza has alienated a number of the conservative intellectuals who once looked up to him. Some accuse him of cynically using his academic credentials to advance false, reductive ideas in order to sell books and movie tickets.
"He was the all-star, the guy every student aspired to be," said James Panero, who graduated from Dartmouth in 1998 and is now executive editor of The New Criterion, a conservative literary journal. "But I think the rewards of playing to the crowd, of throwing out red meat, have become too great."
In a sense, Mr. D'Souza's trajectory is emblematic of a broader shift in the conservative movement. The policy journals and think tanks that once played a key role in shaping conservative thought have been marginalized by the grass-roots populism of talk radio, Fox News, local political movements -- and now, perhaps, documentary films.
"The idea that American politics is made by a kind of professional elite was always a bit dubious and is becoming less and less true," said Mr. D'Souza.
A little controversy has also helped raise Mr. D'Souza's profile. Costco carried his new book when it was first published, but decided to drop it several weeks later. The move provoked an outcry on the right, which accused the retailer of political censorship; the company's co-founder, James D. Sinegal, is a major Democratic supporter.
Costco insisted that the decision had nothing to do with the book's author. "We don't do things based on political beliefs," said Richard A. Galanti, the company's chief financial officer. "The book wasn't selling well, so we decided to pull it."
Regardless, Mr. D'Souza exploited the opportunity, taking to Fox News, radio and Twitter to accuse the retailer of trying to silence him. The interest generated by the ensuing furor, coupled with the release of the companion film, drove up sales, prompting Costco to restock the book.
Mr. D'Souza also spied political motives behind his campaign-finance prosecution. Earlier this year, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, announced criminal charges against Mr. D'Souza, accusing him of skirting contribution limits by arranging to have two people donate $10,000 each to the Senate campaign of a friend, with the understanding that he would reimburse them.
His lawyers accused the Justice Department of singling out Mr. D'Souza because of his condemnation of Mr. Obama -- a claim the government vehemently denied. Mr. D'Souza pleaded guilty in May and faces up to two years in prison.
The criminal indictment makes a brief appearance near the end of Mr. D'Souza's new film. Harvey A. Silverglate, a lawyer and outspoken critic of law enforcement, explains that on a normal day, the average American does three things that could be deemed felonies "by some ambitious Department of Justice prosecutor." Soon after, Mr. D'Souza tells the story of the Internet folk hero Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide last year after being charged with computer fraud.
Enter Mr. D'Souza, in handcuffs: "the latest victim to be targeted by the Obama White House," says the voice-over from the Fox News host Sean Hannity.
"Where will they stop?" Mr. D'Souza asks. "At the point where we stop them."

Full text:   For much of the past five years readers of the political and economic news were left in little doubt that budget deficits and rising debt were the most important issue facing America. Serious people constantly issued dire warnings that the United States risked turning into another Greece any day now. President Obama appointed a special, bipartisan commission to propose solutions to the alleged fiscal crisis, and spent much of his first term trying to negotiate a Grand Bargain on the budget with Republicans.
That bargain never happened, because Republicans refused to consider any deal that raised taxes. Nonetheless, debt and deficits have faded from the news. And there's a good reason for that disappearing act: The whole thing turns out to have been a false alarm.
I'm not sure whether most readers realize just how thoroughly the great fiscal panic has fizzled -- and the deficit scolds are, of course, still scolding. They're even trying to spin the latest long-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office -- which are distinctly non-alarming -- as somehow a confirmation of their earlier scare tactics. So this seems like a good time to offer an update on the debt disaster that wasn't.
About those projections: The budget office predicts that this year's federal deficit will be just 2.8 percent of G.D.P., down from 9.8 percent in 2009. It's true that the fact that we're still running a deficit means federal debt in dollar terms continues to grow -- but the economy is growing too, so the budget office expects the crucial ratio of debt to G.D.P. to remain more or less flat for the next decade.
Things are expected to deteriorate after that, mainly because of the impact of an aging population on Medicare and Social Security. But there has been a dramatic slowdown in the growth of health care costs, which used to play a big role in frightening budget scenarios. As a result, despite aging, debt in 2039 -- a quarter-century from now! -- is projected to be no higher, as a percentage of G.D.P., than the debt America had at the end of World War II, or that Britain had for much of the 20th century. Oh, and the budget office now expects interest rates to remain fairly low, not much higher than the economy's rate of growth. This in turn weakens, indeed almost eliminates, the risk of a debt spiral, in which the cost of servicing debt drives debt even higher.
Still, rising debt isn't good. So what would it take to avoid any rise in the debt ratio? Surprisingly little. The budget office estimates that stabilizing the ratio of debt to G.D.P. at its current level would require spending cuts and/or tax hikes of 1.2 percent of G.D.P. if we started now, or 1.5 percent of G.D.P. if we waited until 2020. Politically, that would be hard given total Republican opposition to anything a Democratic president might propose, but in economic terms it would be no big deal, and wouldn't require any fundamental change in our major social programs.
In short, the debt apocalypse has been called off.
Wait -- what about the risk of a crisis of confidence? There have been many warnings that such a crisis was imminent, some of them coupled with surprisingly frank admissions of disappointment that it hadn't happened yet. For example, Alan Greenspan warned of the "Greece analogy," and declared that it was "regrettable" that U.S. interest rates and inflation hadn't yet soared.
But that was more than four years ago, and both inflation and interest rates remain low. Maybe the United States, which among other things borrows in its own currency and therefore can't run out of cash, isn't much like Greece after all.
In fact, even within Europe the severity of the debt crisis diminished rapidly once the European Central Bank began doing its job, making it clear that it would do "whatever it takes" to avoid cash crises in nations that have given up their own currencies and adopted the euro. Did you know that Italy, which remains deep in debt and suffers much more from the burden of an aging population than we do, can now borrow long term at an interest rate of only 2.78 percent? Did you know that France, which is the subject of constant negative reporting, pays only 1.57 percent?
So we don't have a debt crisis, and never did. Why did everyone important seem to think otherwise?
To be fair, there has been some real good news about the long-run fiscal prospect, mainly from health care. But it's hard to escape the sense that debt panic was promoted because it served a political purpose -- that many people were pushing the notion of a debt crisis as a way to attack Social Security and Medicare. And they did immense damage along the way, diverting the nation's attention from its real problems -- crippling unemployment, deteriorating infrastructure and more -- for years on end.

Full text:   General Electric reported second-quarter results on Friday that reflected its steady return to its industrial roots, as the giant conglomerate looks to accelerate the shift.
G.E., the largest industrial company in the United States, said revenue from its industrial businesses, with products including jet engines, power generators, oil field machinery and medical imaging equipment, rose 7 percent. Revenue at its sizable finance unit, GE Capital, declined 6 percent.
The reduction of the finance side of the G.E. portfolio is by design, as the company has steadily trimmed its dependence on GE Capital since the financial crisis hit in 2008.
G.E. also announced on Friday that it intended to spin out its North American consumer-finance business, Synchrony Financial, in an initial public offering in late July. In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would sell 15 percent of the business to the public, 125 million shares, with $24.50 a share as the midpoint of the expected price range. The offering would value Synchrony at roughly $20 billion.
The S.E.C. filing described the offer as "a first step in G.E.'s exit" from the business. The spinoff with an initial public offering yields considerable tax savings compared with the faster path of shedding the consumer finance unit in a sale to another company, Jeffrey S. Bornstein, G.E.'s chief financial officer, noted in an interview.
Selling the business to another company, Mr. Bornstein said, would involve a sizable tax bill from a cash transaction. In the Synchrony offering, G.E. shareholders will be offered a tax-free swap, if they choose, of G.E. shares for Synchrony shares, with the ratio of exchange not yet determined.
The further move away from finance comes only a month after G.E. agreed to buy the energy businesses of Alstom, a French industrial corporation, for $13.5 billion.
G.E. says it is on target to reduce the share of its earnings that come from GE Capital to 25 percent by 2016. Before the financial crisis, the finance unit routinely accounted for more than half its earnings. In the second quarter, GE Capital contributed 43 percent of the company's earnings.
In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, pointed to the Alstom acquisition and the Synchrony spinoff as evidence that the tilt to the industrial business was not only proceeding but also accelerating. "We are boldly reshaping the company," he said.
The second-quarter results showed that G.E. was willing to sacrifice some revenue growth as it trimmed its finance business.
Total revenue across the corporation rose 3 percent, to $36.2 billion, from $35.1 billion in the year-earlier quarter. But the total revenue figure was slightly below the average estimate of Wall Street analysts of $36.3 billion, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.
G.E. reported net income of $3.5 billion, a 13 percent increase from the year-earlier quarter. The company's operating earnings per share rose 8 percent, to 39 cents a share, which matched analysts' expectations. The percentage gain in net income was higher because it included one-time gains from businesses sold that were not included in operating earnings per share.
The company's three largest industrial businesses -- power and water, aviation, and oil and gas -- all reported strong growth, ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent. The backlog of orders for G.E.'s industrial equipment and services reached a record $246 billion, up $23 billion from the year-ago quarter. And industrial profits outpaced revenue growth, as cost-cutting improved margins.
There were weak spots, including the sales of health care equipment in the United States. The falloff in health care spending seen since the introduction of the Affordable Care Act has left hospitals and clinics reluctant to buy new equipment, like medical-imaging machines.
The solid growth of the overall industrial business helps further the G.E. strategy. But the recent transactions, analysts note, are really speeding up the industrialization of the company. The Alstom purchase, for example, is among the largest acquisitions in G.E.'s history. (G.E.'s purchase of RCA in 1986 for $6.4 billion, if adjusted for inflation, would be slightly larger.)
"G.E. is right in the middle of making major changes, remaking its portfolio," said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- EIGHTEEN years ago, when Alan Greenspan wanted to send a message that he was worried that the stock market was getting a little bubbly, he did it with a typically inscrutable phrasing buried in an otherwise unremarkable speech.
In 1996, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, mused about how the Fed would know "when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions." The next morning the stock market sold off ferociously on the mere hint of his concern.
How things change.
Mr. Greenspan's comments were vague and subject to varying interpretation, and even then they prompted hand-wringing over whether it made sense for the nation's top economist to tell the financial markets that prices might have risen too high. Contrast Mr. Greenspan's comments with those Tuesday and Wednesday by the woman who now holds that same job. Janet L. Yellen deployed the bully pulpit of the Federal Reserve leadership to send a message on market prices.
Ms. Yellen specifically called out the valuations of leveraged loans (which fund corporate buyouts) and high-yield "junk" bonds (which fund companies viewed as having risky finances) as potentially excessive. She acknowledged that prices for a wide range of assets, including stocks, bonds and real estate, had risen, but argued that they "remain generally in line with historic norms."
A written report accompanying Ms. Yellen's testimony went further, pointing to "substantially stretched" valuations of social media and biotechnology stocks. An index of social media stock prices fell.
These events raise interesting questions: Should government officials speak up when they think markets have gotten prices wrong? At what point does the Fed leader go from being the nation's economist in chief to the market strategist in chief? And should investors listen to Ms. Yellen's views?
Here is the predicament that Ms. Yellen and other top policy makers face. The last two recessions in the United States have been caused by the popping of asset bubbles, first the stock market in 2000, then housing in 2007.
The mission Congress assigned the Fed is to look after the real economy -- maximum employment and stable prices, to be precise. But all of their policy tools work through the financial system. They are trying to maintain low unemployment and low inflation, but they do that almost exclusively by buying and selling bonds.
That means that their policies often have a more significant impact (and certainly a more immediate and measurable one) on the price of, say, junk bonds than they do on job creation and wages.
That is always true, but it has never been more true than lately, with the Fed deeply engaged in unconventional steps to try to increase economic growth, leading to nearly $4.5 trillion in assets ending up on the central bank's balance sheet.
To some degree, the whole point of that exercise was to drive up the prices of stocks and other assets to encourage economic growth. But a major risk all along has been that the efforts would raise asset values to bubble territory without accompanying economic growth.
If you believe that is happening, there are two options. One, embodied in a speech at the University of Southern California on Wednesday by the president of the Dallas Fed, Richard W. Fisher, is to pull back on money printing. But if you believe that the Fed needs to keep doing everything it possibly can to get stronger growth, then you are left with a few other options. One, which Ms. Yellen has repeatedly emphasized, is regulating banks and other financial institutions well to ensure that even if a bubble does emerge, and pop, the rest of the economy does not go down with it. There is no reason that somebody paying too much for junk bonds or social media stocks now needs to cause a recession in 2016, in other words.
Another option is to use "open mouth policy" (as opposed to the usual "open market policy"), jawboning markets to try to rein in excesses that might create risks. It is not an outlandish idea. The economist Dean Baker has argued that if Mr. Greenspan had made full-throated, public arguments that there was a housing bubble in 2004 and 2005, it might have led to fewer people stretching to buy homes and less damage when the bubble eventually popped.
But it does amount to a government official substituting her own judgment for that of the marketplace, the prices arrived at by thousands of buyers and sellers for an app maker or a leveraged loan.
For a sense of the risks there, consider this: Mr. Greenspan's warning of irrational exuberance in the stock market was in December 1996. The worst excesses of the dot-com bubble occurred years later; even at the low point of the post-dot-com stock crash and the financial crisis of 2008, prices never again fell that far. A person who ignored Mr. Greenspan's advice and bought into the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index the morning after his speech has earned a 268 percent return since then (including reinvested dividends).
As Ms. Yellen may learn, the challenge of telling people when the prices are right is that you might just be wrong.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Wednesday that it would be a "grave mistake" for Congress to adopt legislation proposed by House Republicans constraining the Fed's management of monetary policy.
Ms. Yellen and Republican lawmakers traded strong words during a testy hearing before the House Financial Services Committee that focused on a bill that would require the Fed to publish a set of rules for raising and lowering interest rates.
Ms. Yellen said such a rule would impair the Fed's ability to manage the economy, even inhibiting its ability to respond to financial crises. It "would essentially undermine central bank independence," she said.
Republicans criticized what they described as an alarmist response by Ms. Yellen and Democrats to a proposal that they said would do nothing more than modestly increase the Fed's accountability by requiring greater transparency.
They emphasized that the legislation did not specify a particular rule -- it simply told the Fed to pick one. The committee's chairman, Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, sharply criticized what he described as "howling protests and apocalyptic visions from my Democratic colleagues," calling them "apologists for the status quo."
"The Fed can set any rule it wishes," Mr. Hensarling added. "It can change the rule any time it wishes. It can deviate from the rule any time it wishes." Under the proposed bill, he added, "it simply has to report and explain this to the rest of us. That's what transparency and accountability are all about."
The sparring largely overshadowed questions about the current course of Fed policy, in the face of mounting evidence that the economy has recovered from a rocky winter.
The Fed's Beige Book, an anthology of economic impressions gathered by the Fed regional banks and released two weeks before meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, reported that growth continued at a "modest to moderate pace" throughout the country.
The report was consistent with recent data showing stronger job growth and improvements in manufacturing activity. On Wednesday, the Fed reported that manufacturing output increased 0.1 percent in June, a modest increase that capped a strong quarter during which factory production advanced at an annual rate of 6.7 percent.
Another report, from the Labor Department, found producer prices rebounding 0.4 percent last month after a decline of 0.2 percent in May, also showing signs of a healthier manufacturing sector. The government will publish an initial estimate of second-quarter economic activity at the end of July.
The evidence of faster growth has revived concerns that the Fed will need to move more quickly. The central bank plans to end the expansion of its bond holdings in October. Ms. Yellen did not give a direct answer on Wednesday to questions about how soon the Fed would begin to raise its key short-term gauge from its current rate near zero, but she did note that most economists expected the Fed to act in the third quarter of 2015.
Some Fed officials and economists say that is not soon enough. Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said on Wednesday that the Fed should start raising rates early next year.
"We are at risk of doing what the Fed has too often done: overstaying our welcome by staying too loose too long," he said. "I believe the time to dilute the punch is close upon us."
James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, also has warned in recent weeks that he now expects inflation will rise above the Fed's target next year.
Ms. Yellen has largely played down such concerns, describing inflation as muted and unlikely to rebound strongly. She remained primarily concerned about reducing unemployment and expediting the incomplete recovery.
Citing "substantial headwinds" impeding growth, she said, "Until they are completely gone, it calls for an accommodative monetary policy."
Her testimony to Congress, however, included an acknowledgment that the Fed would act sooner if the recovery, particularly in the labor market, continued to outstrip expectations.
The hearing on Wednesday had this debate about current policy as its subtext.
The Republican-sponsored bill introduced last week would require the Fed to adopt something like the Taylor Rule, a formula written by the Stanford economist John Taylor that specifies interest rates based on inflation and the gap between actual and potential economic output. The Fed could change the rule, but it would be required to explain deviations.
Mr. Taylor said last week that his rule would now require the Fed to set short-term interest rates at around 1.25 percent.
Ms. Yellen, in making the case that the Fed needs flexibility, is also arguing that it needs to maintain lower rates to reduce unemployment further.
Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who was a co-author of the bill, asked Ms. Yellen whether she had read the legislation, waited for a response, and then said he would refresh her memory. He said the point of the bill was to establish accountability. "We cannot have an entity within the federal government just operating on a whim," he said.
Ms. Yellen responded that the Fed was "the most transparent central bank to my knowledge in the world."
Democrats rallied to Ms. Yellen's defense, contending that Congress already had sufficient oversight of monetary policy. Maxine Waters of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, called it a "recipe for disaster."
Democrats also urged Ms. Yellen to persist in holding down interest rates.
"The economy is worse than your statement indicates," Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, told Ms. Yellen.
"There isn't a person in this room who has waxed eloquently about how everything's going spectacularly in their district," he said. "And many, many members have told me and spoken about how, in a very large percentage of this country, we're still in recession."

Full text:   Is it naïve to expect corporations to assist in addressing the social, economic and environmental challenges of the day?
In 1929, several years before Social Security and the National Labor Relations Act cemented pensions and labor rights in law, workers at the Eastman Kodak Company already enjoyed profit-sharing, retirement bonuses and a pension plan. They had sickness benefits and accident insurance.
In 1914, Henry Ford decided to raise wages to $5 a day, doubling, in one stroke, most of his workers' pay. "We were building for the future," he later explained. "A low-wage business is always insecure."
Almost half a century later, Coca-Cola's chairman, William E. Robinson, argued that a corporate executive served not just stockholders, but also workers, customers and the community. "The neglect of the customers and his labor relations will seal his doom far faster than an avaricious quick-dollar stockholder or director," he said.
Today, we live in a different world. Energy companies both recognize that climate change is a problem and actively lobby against efforts to combat it. The nation's half a million fast-food cooks earn, on average, $9.07 an hour, which even on a full-time basis is not enough to keep a family of four out of poverty. Yet fast-food behemoths like McDonald's and Wendy's fight tooth and nail against efforts to raise wages.
Coming out of World War II, corporate America enthusiastically draped itself in the American flag. As General Motors' Charles E. Wilson famously told a Senate committee in 1953, "for years I thought that what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa."
G.M.'s star-spangled jingoism sits in awkward contrast to Pfizer's recent efforts -- along with those of other companies -- to rid itself of its status as an American corporation to avoid taxes.
"Over all, there is no question that the ethos of corporate America has changed dramatically over the past 40 years," said Rick Wartzman, executive director of the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, who is writing a book about how the social contract between workers and employees has changed since World War II. The belief that business must serve multiple constituents, he argued, has given way to an imperative "to make the shareholder king."
Milton Friedman, the economic thinker from the University of Chicago, argued that this was exactly as it should be. The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, he stated in an essay published in The New York Times 44 years ago. For executives to devote resources to anything else would amount to doing charity with other people's money.
Friedman's maxim arrived just in time for the era of the hostile takeover and the leveraged buyout, when corporate raiders sold themselves as saviors liberating shareholders from misguided managers who paid too little attention to the stock price.
Though legally dubious, the argument that it is an executive's fiduciary duty to maximize the company's share price became a mantra from the business school to the boardroom. And it was nailed down with money.
In 1993, some 20 percent of executive compensation was based on stock, according to Lynn Stout of Cornell Law School. Today, equity accounts for about 60 percent of the remuneration of executives at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. With so much money tied up in stock options and the like, it is not surprising that executives will do almost anything to give their share price a boost regardless of what costs this might incur after their options have vested.
These changes responded to economic forces. The 1970s and 1980s were an era of high inflation, high interest rates and low returns on investment. Globalization was exposing American companies to much greater competition from abroad, putting pressure on margins and redoubling executives' attention on cost cutting and short-term profitability.
George Eastman had a vested interest in maintaining a trained and motivated work force in Rochester. Steve Jobs did not have much of a factory work force to think of. Another company halfway around the world made most of Apple's devices.
Is there any hope that corporate ethics might swing back to something resembling the earlier era?
Corporate executives jumping on the "corporate social responsibility" bandwagon certainly want you to think so. In 2000, 44 businesses signed up to the United Nations' global standards on human rights, workers' rights, environmental stewardship and anti-corruption policies. By last year, 7,717 had signed.
Companies, of course, are not charities. Their main responsibility is to remain profitable.
Still, there is a case to be made that attending to workers' rights or environmental degradation might help the business in the long term. The housing bubble and subsequent financial crisis served as a stark reminder of the consequences of compensating bankers based on short-term returns regardless of whether their business would blow up a couple of years down the road.
More broadly, company executives are under a new form of pressure. George Serafeim of Harvard Business School points out that the information age has brought greater transparency to corporate operations. Customers, investors and employees know more about what businesses do around the world and can exert influence to change their behavior.
Some prominent businesses, like the American retailer Costco, the Danish pharmaceutical multinational Novo Nordisk or the Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate Unilever appear to take a serious stand on broader social and environmental issues.
Nonetheless, it would be wise to temper expectations that corporate ethics are about to turn the corner.
After all, the motivations go only so far: Notably, pressure to "do good" from investors, customers and employees is not likely to encourage much good-doing in domains that investors, customers and employees cannot readily see.
Remember Enron? A report by Jean Tirole of the Toulouse School of Economics and Roland Bénabou of Princeton University notes that even as the company was quietly cooking the books, it was visibly giving money to all sorts of philanthropies. "Companies may behave better where it is most visible and not where it is less visible," Professor Bénabou told me.
Corporations of an earlier era were just as motivated by self-interest. Eastman Kodak's mini-welfare state came about in part to keep unions at bay. Henry Ford wanted to encourage his workers to be more productive and hoped that many would ultimately be able to afford Model T's for themselves. But he also wanted to limit the dividend he would have to pay to the Dodge brothers, Ford shareholders who needed the money to set up a rival carmaker.
Wilson's patriotic take on G.M.'s interests occurred at a confirmation hearing in which he was trying to convince senators that he could be a fine defense secretary and still keep his G.M. stock.
Indeed, there is a corollary to Milton Friedman's proposition: You can trust a business that merely wants to turn a profit in a way that you cannot quite trust one that wants to change the world, too.
"I don't think we would get very far in addressing large social concerns if we left them to corporations," said Margaret Blair of Vanderbilt Law School. "The ethic of shareholder values is just too strong, and our social problems are just too big."
Elected governments are certainly imperfect. But to address our most intractable ills, they are the better tool.

Abstract: Ms. Yellen's testimony suggested the Fed's leadership remained largely unmoved by the arguments of some Fed officials and outside economists that monetary policy has done what it can to stimulate the economy, and that the Fed is in danger of risking excessive inflation in the future by waiting too long to start raising interest rates.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Tuesday that the financial markets remained in reasonable health despite signs of bubbles in some areas, including the stocks of social media and technology companies.
In her testimony, Ms. Yellen -- reinforced by a separate report from the Fed -- said that valuations of assets including junk bonds and shares in smaller tech companies appeared "stretched," but that the Fed did not plan to curtail its economic stimulus campaign in response.
In response to her comments, the stock market dipped mildly, with declines concentrated in the tech sectors Ms. Yellen highlighted.
Ms. Yellen, in playing down concerns about financial stability, said the economic recovery remained incomplete and the Fed's help was necessary.
"Too many Americans remain unemployed, inflation remains below our longer-run objective and not all of the necessary financial reform initiatives have been completed," Ms. Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee.
Ms. Yellen's testimony is likely to reinforce a sense of complacency among investors who regard the Fed as convinced of its forecast and committed to its policy course. She reiterated the Fed's view that the economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace, and that the Fed is in no hurry to start increasing short-term interest rates.
When Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, asked Ms. Yellen about the greatest risks to that growth forecast, she seemed flummoxed by the question, eventually reiterating the Fed's confidence that growth would continue.
Fed officials including Ms. Yellen have said that they are puzzled by the lack of volatility in financial markets, suggesting that investors have developed an unwarranted degree of confidence about the Fed's intentions.
Ms. Yellen restated that point Tuesday, telling the committee, "The outlook for the economy and financial markets is never certain, and now is no exception."
But that uncertainty about the future is actually contributing to the sense of stability, by making the Fed more cautious about retreating. Ms. Yellen's testimony suggested the Fed's leadership remained largely unmoved by the arguments of some Fed officials and outside economists that monetary policy has done what it can to stimulate the economy, and that the Fed is in danger of risking excessive inflation in the future by waiting too long to start raising interest rates.
"The Federal Reserve does need to be quite cautious with respect to monetary policy," Ms. Yellen said. "We have in the past seen false dawns."
The Fed plans to end one part of its stimulus campaign, the expansion of its bond holdings, in October, but Ms. Yellen stressed its plans to keep short-term interest rates near zero for some time. She noted the Fed's recent efforts to plan its eventual retreat "do not imply any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy."
Ms. Yellen appeared before the Senate committee to present the Fed's biannual report on monetary policy. She will testify before a House committee on Wednesday.
The economy shrank sharply in the first quarter, but Ms. Yellen emphasized the Fed's overall view that growth has since resumed -- although she added that "this bears close watching" -- and pointed to its forecast that the economy would continue to grow "at a moderate pace over the next several years."
The decline in the unemployment rate, meanwhile, has exceeded expectations, reaching 6.1 percent in June, but Ms. Yellen maintained her view that the decline was overstating the progress of the labor market. Some people who stopped looking for work are likely to return as the economy improves, she said. Wage growth also remains weak, suggesting employers still find it easy to replace workers.
Ms. Yellen also spoke about the "serious psychological toll" of unemployment and its long-term costs, underscoring her commitment to the Fed's efforts.
Inflation also remains sluggish, suggesting that the economy continues to operate below capacity, and allowing the Fed to extend its stimulus campaign. "With wages growing slowly and raw material prices generally flat or moving downward, firms are not facing much in the way of cost pressures that they might otherwise try to pass on," the Fed said in a report accompanying Ms. Yellen's testimony.
But Ms. Yellen added that the Fed was ready to respond if it concluded that it had overestimated the slack in the labor market, a more substantial acknowledgment of the views of her critics than she has made in other recent remarks.
"If the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated by the committee, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid than currently envisioned," Ms. Yellen told the Senate committee. "Conversely, if economic performance is disappointing, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than currently anticipated."
The Fed also remains watchful for signs of financial instability, Ms. Yellen said. Valuations in most sectors "remain generally in line with historical norms," but there is evidence of overconfidence in sectors including junk bonds, she said.
The Fed, in a biannual report accompanying Ms. Yellen's testimony, also cited social media and biotechnology stocks as potentially overvalued.
Ms. Yellen has said that concerns about financial stability are not sufficient, at present, to warrant a shift in the course of monetary policy.
Ms. Yellen faced tough questioning about financial regulation from several Democratic senators. The sharpest questions closed the hearing.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, asked Ms. Yellen whether JPMorgan Chase had complied with a legal requirement to provide the Fed with a credible plan for its orderly dissolution, should that become necessary.
"Can you honestly say that JPMorgan could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion with no threats to the economy and no need for a taxpayer bailout?," Ms. Warren asked.
When Ms. Yellen avoided the question, Ms. Warren persisted, "Have they ever gotten to a plan that you can say with a straight face is credible?"
Ms. Yellen demurred again and the hearing ended.
Ms. Warren walked over to Ms. Yellen and kissed her cheek. The two women laughed, and chatted, and left.

Full text:   About 10,000 motorists die each year because of inadequate road conditions, and millions of other Americans waste large portions of their lives stuck in traffic or stalled trains. The enormous cost to society of poor infrastructure grows every year, and most of the blame can be placed directly on a Congress that refuses to collect and spend enough money to fix it.
On Tuesday the House made the situation worse with a sad excuse for a highway funding bill: A 10-month measure that keeps spending at an inadequate level and does not address the dwindling revenues that keep producing all-too-familiar cliffhanging crises. The bill pays for building projects through a series of budget gimmicks, including one that will probably result in companies underfinancing their pensions. Yet the Obama administration, desperate to avoid the cancellation of projects that would occur if the Highway Trust Fund runs out of money next month, decided to support the stopgap bill.
This crisis was entirely foreseeable and was brought about by the ideological refusal of Congressional Republicans to raise the gasoline tax -- the traditional method of paying for road projects, because it allows those who benefit from better roads to pay for them. The gas tax has been stuck at 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, and during those 21 years it has lost 39 percent of its value to inflation. But Republicans, afraid of violating a no-tax-increase pledge they made to an extremist group, won't touch it. "I've never supported raising the gas tax," Speaker John Boehner said last week.
Without an increase, the trust fund will continually run out of money, jeopardizing one of the most basic functions of government. If the fund were allowed to run dry next month, it would cut federal transportation financing to the states by 28 percent, and slow or stop 100,000 projects that employ about 700,000 workers at the height of the construction season. That would be fine with hard-right Republicans who want Washington to get out of the transportation business and leave the states on their own; they have overseen an unprecedented 20 percent cut in construction spending over the last five or six years.
But the country could not afford a blow of that size to the economy. President Obama was right to think big last year when he proposed spending $302 billion over four years on transportation projects, but even he lacked the political courage to back a higher gas tax to pay for it, instead suggesting ending corporate tax loopholes. Last month, a Republican senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, broke ranks with his party and joined Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, in calling for a 12-cent gas tax increase that would be indexed to inflation in future years.
But few other Republicans have signed on. Instead, the bill that leaders pushed through the House on Tuesday would raise most of its $10.9 billion by allowing companies to spend less on their pension payments (thus raising their taxable incomes), which could harm retirement security for many Americans. The Senate Finance Committee proposal is better, focusing instead on better tax enforcement, but it avoided the best solution of raising the gas tax in order to achieve bipartisan support.
Both bills run out at the end of May, which will probably lead to another crisis that will be temporarily solved by yet another budget gimmick. People of both parties ride in cars or take trains and buses, but they are being let down by politicians pretending that essential public works don't come with a price tag.

Abstract: The 2012 highway bill and the new proposal give companies relief on that front, letting them fund their pensions based mostly on a historical 25-year average of interest rates; essentially, they're being allowed to calculate the cost of promising pension benefits on the basis of investments -- safe, high-yielding bonds -- that were once available to pension funds but can't be found today.

Full text:   The Federal Highway Trust Fund is expected to run out of money in August. So, naturally, Congress is debating a temporary fix that involves letting corporations underfund their pension systems.
Of course, we could replenish the fund by raising the federal gasoline tax, which is its primary source of financing. That's what Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, want to do. But increasing gas taxes is unpopular, so Congress hasn't done so since 1993, which means that the tax on gas has actually fallen 39 percent over the last 21 years after you adjust for inflation. Instead, Congress has used a series of gimmicks and shifts to keep the fund solvent as highway construction costs have risen.
The latest proposal, which passed the Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday, works like this: If you change corporate pension funding rules to let companies set aside less money today to pay for future benefits, they will report higher taxable profits. And if they have higher taxable profits, they will pay more in taxes over the 10-year budget window that Congress uses to write laws. Those added taxes can be diverted to the Federal Highway Trust Fund.
Unfortunately, this gimmick will also result in corporations paying less in taxes in later years, when they have to make up for the pension payments they're missing now. But if it happens more than 10 years in the future, it doesn't count in Congress's method for calculating budget balance. "Fiscal responsibility," as popularly defined in Washington, ignores anything that happens after 2024.
Letting companies underfund pensions so they pay more taxes is a dumb idea, but it's not a new one: A similar strategy was part of the last bipartisan highway bill, which passed in 2012. The new proposal would simply extend the underfunding that was already allowed in the 2012 bill for a greater number of years.
This idea has come up in the last few years because pension costs are heavily driven by interest rates -- and lower rates mean higher costs. When rates are low, as they are now, the government tells companies to set aside more money to pay for future pension benefits because they can't count on high returns on safe investments to cover pension costs. Some companies have complained that "artificially low" interest rates are forcing them to actually overfund their plans. The 2012 highway bill and the new proposal give companies relief on that front, letting them fund their pensions based mostly on a historical 25-year average of interest rates; essentially, they're being allowed to calculate the cost of promising pension benefits on the basis of investments -- safe, high-yielding bonds -- that were once available to pension funds but can't be found today.
This is wishful math. Low long-term interest rates are not artificial; they reflect an expectation that the Federal Reserve will keep rates unusually low for a long time, and that economic growth will be relatively weak and uncertain. That, in turn, means that returns on safe investments like bonds will continue to be below historical averages, and that corporate pension funds still won't get the safe, high returns they used to enjoy. If companies are allowed to put less money into their pension funds in that environment, the funds will deplete over time, and the companies will just have to pay more later -- unless they go bankrupt, in which case a federal agency (the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation) will be on the hook to pay retirees.
But even if my prediction is wrong, a change to corporate pension policy is a bad way to pay for highways. Let's say the companies are correct -- that low long-term interest rates do not reflect fundamentals, and that interest rates will rise soon, showing that corporate pension plans have really been overfunded all along. If that's true, adjusting the rules now will simply create tax revenue that would otherwise come in later when interest rates rise, allowing companies to cut their pension contributions naturally. It does nothing to substantively affect the long-term fiscal position of the federal government, or to make more funds available to pay for highways into the distant future.
And that's something everybody in Congress knows: The hunt for "pay-fors" -- deficit-cutting measures to offset things like replenishing the Highway Trust Fund -- is not so much about keeping the economy strong. It's more about being able to announce that the Congressional Budget Office said your plan wouldn't raise the deficit over the next 10 years. That works even if, as with the latest Republican proposal, you take all the added corporate tax revenue over the 10-year window to keep the Highway Trust Fund solvent for just five additional months. Yes, even if we run with this gimmick, Congress will be back in January, trying to find a way to claw the fund out of insolvency again.
Raising the gas tax and indexing it to inflation would be a fine way to fix the perennial shortfall in the fund without increasing the deficit. But there is another perfectly valid option: replenishing the fund by borrowing money. Interest rates are low, investors are clamoring to lend money to the United States and federal debt is projected to be a stable share of the economy over the next 10 years. This is a good time to borrow money and to spend the proceeds on useful highway construction.
Yet instead, Congress is debating whether it should -- again -- let corporations underfund their pension plans, and generate a one-time boost in tax revenue. And Congress would use that revenue to fund a few months of a continuing spending program that it does not have a plan to make permanently solvent, while exposing pension beneficiaries and taxpayers to risk if a corporation goes bankrupt after underfunding its pension plan.
If you define "fiscal responsibility" solely in terms of whether the federal budget deficit grows or shrinks over a 10-year window, you can reach the conclusion that the foregoing plan serves the goal of "fiscal responsibility." Which only goes to show that politicians in both parties have settled on an insane definition of "fiscal responsibility."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- House Republicans frustrated by the Federal Reserve's expansive economic stimulus campaign and its growing role as a financial regulator are renewing their efforts to constrain the central bank.
The Fed would be required to set monetary policy based on a published formula under legislation introduced this week by leading Republicans on the Financial Services Committee. Other bills would eliminate the Fed's responsibility to maximize employment, or eliminate the Fed entirely.
The bills face uncertain prospects in the House, and have no future in the Senate while it remains under Democratic control. But they highlight ideas that Republicans are likely to revisit if they win a majority in both houses of Congress in the midterm elections.
"We have seen a radical departure from the historic norms of monetary policy conduct," Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said at a hearing on Thursday. "Monetary policy is at its best in maintaining stable, healthy economic growth when it follows a clear, predictable rule or path."
The most prominent piece of legislation, sponsored by Representatives Bill Huizenga of Michigan and Scott Garrett of New Jersey, is a result of a yearlong series of hearings orchestrated by Mr. Hensarling's committee to review the Fed's performance on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.
It would require the Fed to set interest rates based on a published rule like the Taylor Rule, a formula written by the Stanford University economist John B. Taylor that specifies the appropriate level of interest rates based on the pace of inflation and the gap between actual and potential economic output. The Fed would be required to explain deviations from its rule, although it could change the rule. It would also be subject to audits by the Government Accountability Office.
The Fed has moved in the direction favored by Republicans in recent years, most notably by adopting an explicit inflation target in 2012. But the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and other officials have emphasized the need for flexibility. Professor Taylor, for example, argues that under his formula the Fed should already have raised short-term interest rates above 1 percent, while the Fed has indicated it plans to keep rates near zero into next year to encourage job growth.
Professor Taylor said at Thursday's hearing that the legislation left the Fed "enough flexibility" to deviate from the rule in a crisis. "It seems to me to be the essence of transparency and accountability," he said. "How could someone object to that?"
Simon H. Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, responded that the legislation would not succeed in making monetary policy more predictable, but instead inject politics into the process.
"The experts have to have the ability to make these decisions," he said. "What you're going to get from this is a massive amount of volatility in financial markets."
A second prong of the legislation is focused on the Fed's regulatory role, requiring the central bank to subject proposed rules to a cost-benefit analysis. Republicans describe this as a common-sense requirement already imposed on most arms of the federal government. Democrats counter that it is an effort to impede the expansion of regulation required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.
Representative Maxine Waters of California, the ranking Democratic member of the committee, said the requirement would "cripple" the Fed "by making the Fed's rule-making more tedious, more expensive and subject to endless legal challenges."
Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University who testified on Thursday in support of the legislation, said a little trouble was worth it. "It may take the Fed a little longer to adopt a rule, but these rules are in place for years and years," she said. "What we'll end up with is higher-quality rules."
The legislation includes a variety of other measures to increase transparency, including quarterly congressional testimony by the Fed's chief and disclosure of the salaries of highly paid employees. It would also create a staff for each member of the Fed's board, increasing the ability to conduct independent research.
Republicans unhappy about the Fed's expansive campaign to stimulate the economy have sought repeatedly in recent years to rein in the central bank. The House in 2012 passed legislation increasing oversight of the Fed's decision-making process, although the details were different then.
Another bill now before the House would require the Fed to focus on controlling inflation, eliminating its legal obligation to seek to maximize employment, a mandate made explicit in the 1970s. Another would eliminate the central bank entirely.
"All anyone cares about is what the Fed is going to do," said Representative John Campbell, a California Republican who said he favored the relatively modest approach of requiring the Fed to specify and follow a policy rule. "It's like they're running the whole show, and to me that's a distortion of the way that the economy is supposed to work. We're just saying, please give the market some stability here."
The Fed has not responded publicly to the latest proposals, but it has objected to similar ideas as impairing its freedom to manage interest rates. Ms. Yellen is likely to face questions on the subject when she appears before House and Senate panels on Tuesday and Wednesday for semiannual testimony.

Full text:   One unhappy lesson we've learned in recent years is that economics is a far more political subject than we liked to imagine. Well, duh, you may say. But, before the financial crisis, many economists -- even, to some extent, yours truly -- believed that there was a fairly broad professional consensus on some important issues.
This was especially true of monetary policy. It's not that many years since the administration of George W. Bush declared that one lesson from the 2001 recession and the recovery that followed was that "aggressive monetary policy can make a recession shorter and milder." Surely, then, we'd have a bipartisan consensus in favor of even more aggressive monetary policy to fight the far worse slump of 2007 to 2009. Right?
Well, no. I've written a number of times about the phenomenon of "sadomonetarism," the constant demand that the Federal Reserve and other central banks stop trying to boost employment and raise interest rates instead, regardless of circumstances. I've suggested that the persistence of this phenomenon has a lot to do with ideology, which, in turn, has a lot to do with class interests. And I still think that's true.
But I now think that class interests also operate through a cruder, more direct channel. Quite simply, easy-money policies, while they may help the economy as a whole, are directly detrimental to people who get a lot of their income from bonds and other interest-paying assets -- and this mainly means the very wealthy, in particular the top 0.01 percent.
The story so far: For more than five years, the Fed has faced harsh criticism from a coalition of economists, pundits, politicians and financial-industry moguls warning that it is "debasing the dollar" and setting the stage for runaway inflation. You might have thought that the continuing failure of the predicted inflation to materialize would cause at least a few second thoughts, but you'd be wrong. Some of the critics have come up with new rationales for unchanging policy demands -- it's about inflation! no, it's about financial stability! -- but most have simply continued to repeat the same warnings.
Who are these always-wrong, never-in-doubt critics? With no exceptions I can think of, they come from the right side of the political spectrum. But why should right-wing sentiments go hand in hand with inflation paranoia? One answer is that using monetary policy to fight slumps is a form of government activism. And conservatives don't want to legitimize the notion that government action can ever have positive effects, because once you start down that path you might end up endorsing things like government-guaranteed health insurance.
But there's also a much more direct reason for those defending the interests of the wealthy to complain about easy money: The wealthy derive an important part of their income from interest on bonds, and low-rate policies have greatly reduced this income.
Complaints about low interest rates are usually framed in terms of the harm being done to retired Americans living on the interest from their CDs. But the interest receipts of older Americans go mainly to a small and relatively affluent minority. In 2012, the average older American with interest income received more than $3,000, but half the group received $255 or less. The really big losers from low interest rates are the truly wealthy -- not even the 1 percent, but the 0.1 percent or even the 0.01 percent. Back in 2007, before the slump, the average member of the 0.01 percent received $3 million (in 2012 dollars) in interest. By 2011, that had fallen to $1.3 million -- a loss equivalent to almost 9 percent of the group's 2007 income.
That's a lot, and it surely explains a lot of the hysteria over Fed policy. The rich are even more likely than most people to believe that what's good for them is good for America -- and their wealth and the influence it buys ensure that there are always plenty of supposed experts eager to find justifications for this attitude. Hence sadomonetarism.
Which brings me back to the politicization of economics.
Before the financial crisis, many central bankers and economists were, it's now clear, living in a fantasy world, imagining themselves to be technocrats insulated from the political fray. After all, their job was to steer the economy between the shoals of inflation and depression, and who could object to that?
It turns out, however, that using monetary policy to fight depression, while in the interest of the vast majority of Americans, isn't in the interest of a small, wealthy minority. And, as a result, monetary policy is as bound up in class and ideological conflict as tax policy.
The truth is that in a society as unequal and polarized as ours has become, almost everything is political. Get used to it.

Full text:   LONDON -- The Bank of England on Thursday left its key interest rate unchanged at a record low as policy makers seek to balance Britain's robust economic recovery with the need to cool an overheating housing market.
Britain's central bank said it would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. The bank also left unchanged a stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $642 billion, in government bonds that it has purchased over the past five years.
The bank had not been expected to act, but bank officials have hinted in recent weeks that a rate increase may happen sooner than the market anticipates.
Analysts generally have said that they do not expect interest rates to rise in Britain before late this year or early next year, but a robust housing market and strong employment data may force the hand of policy makers.
The British economy recorded growth of 0.8 percent in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter, and has outpaced much of Continental Europe. Growth in the second quarter may have risen further, to 0.9 percent, according to an estimate published this week by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, an independent body.
"Based on our estimates, the U.K. economy is now 3.2 percent larger than in the same period last year," the institute said on Tuesday.
The vote on Thursday by Monetary Policy Committee members was unanimous. The last vote by a committee member to raise rates came in July 2011, according to the Bank of England.
The apparent harmony in recent months "may be hiding bigger disagreements behind the scenes," Robert Wood, an economist at Berenberg, said in a research note. "The minutes of today's meeting, due in two weeks, will be key for judging how the consensus is changing."
Mr. Wood said that he believes a rate increase is likely in November.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at the research firm Capital Economics, said he does not expect the committee to act before the first quarter of 2015. The cooling of the housing market in the coming months and the likely easing of inflation "suggests that the committee is likely to refrain from raising" rates before next year, Mr. Tombs said in a research note on Thursday. Britain's inflation rate in May fell further below the central bank's 2 percent target, to 1.5 percent.
Government officials have expressed particular concern about the housing market in Britain, where a shortage of housing stock has rapidly pushed up prices, particularly in London and parts of southeast England. In a recent survey, the mortgage lender Nationwide said housing prices were up 25 percent in London in the past year.
George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, recently said that the housing shortage was perhaps the greatest threat to the country's economic recovery, in part because house buyers are taking on too much debt.
Last month, Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, announced a series of measures aimed at cooling the housing market.
The measures included restricting the number of new residential mortgages on a bank's loan portfolio that are equivalent to, or more than 4.5 times, a borrower's annual income. Under the move, banks can have no more than 15 percent of such loans in their portfolios.
The discussions about the threat of rising housing prices may already be having an impact.
In its latest housing data released on Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that 53 percent of housing industry professionals that it surveyed reported an increase in housing prices in June, down from 56 percent in May. The rate of price increases in London also appears to be easing, the institution said.
Simon Rubinsohn, the institution's chief economist, said that "rhetoric from key officials at the bank, including Mark Carney, alongside the consequences of the introduction of the mortgage market review are already slowing momentum, particularly in London."
Mr. Carney has been criticized by some for sending mixed signals to the market about the timing of any rate increases.
Mr. Carney has suggested that it would be difficult to raise rates above 2.5 percent and that the earliest the central bank could reach that level would be 2017. That compares with what has traditionally been considered by central bankers as a "normal" rate of about 5 percent.
The rate decision comes after the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that it was planning to stop adding to its bond holdings later this year, a sign of confidence in the United States economy. The bond-buying program was one of the central bank's most aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy.
But the Fed suggested in minutes from its June meeting that investors should not interpret the end of its bond purchases as a sign that interest rates would rise sooner in the United States.

Full text:   Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserve's new vice chairman, said on Thursday in his first public remarks that regulators had made "significant progress" in improving the resilience of the financial system.
Mr. Fischer, surveying the regulatory landscape, said financial companies were in better health and rules had been strengthened, addressing some of the problems that contributed to the last crisis. But he cautioned that work in important areas remained incomplete or untested.
"We need always be aware that the next crisis -- and there will be one -- will not be identical to the last one and that we need to be vigilant in both trying to foresee it and seeking to prevent it," Mr. Fischer said in a speech at a meeting of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Mr. Fischer, formerly the governor of the Bank of Israel, was confirmed by the Senate as the Fed's vice chairman last month.
A prominent academic economist before becoming a policy maker in the 1990s, Mr. Fischer is widely respected for his knowledge of monetary policy. In choosing to make his debut with a speech about financial regulation, not an area of expertise for him, he highlighted its importance to the Fed since the financial crisis and to his new job as a lieutenant of the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
Mr. Fischer focused on three areas of regulation.
He described stronger capital rules, which limit borrowing by banks, as the area of clearest improvement, reducing the chances of bank failures. He offered a mixed verdict, by contrast, on efforts to ensure that large banks can be safely dismantled if they fail. He suggested that complete success was probably beyond reach.
Referring to the problem in his prepared remarks by the abbreviation T.B.T.F. for "too big to fail," Mr. Fischer said, "While we must continue to work toward ending T.B.T.F. or the need for government financial intervention in crises, we should never allow ourselves the complacency to believe that we have put an end to T.B.T.F."
Mr. Fischer expressed even greater reservations about efforts by regulators to develop tools for limiting asset bubbles. He said that the Bank of Israel under his leadership had used such tools with limited success to restrain real estate investment and the rise of housing prices.
Regulators do not have good estimates of the probable impact of individual measures, he said. Moreover, measures that target areas like the housing market are likely to be "politically sensitive." Finally, he said, coordination among regulators is required.
Mr. Fischer also endorsed a suggestion by one of his predecessors, Donald L. Kohn, that Congress should instruct the Fed to maintain financial stability, adding it to the list of the bank's explicit responsibilities along with stable inflation and maximum employment.
"It may well be that adding a financial-stability mandate to the overall mandates of all financial regulatory bodies, and perhaps other changes that would give more authority to a reformed Financial Stability Oversight Council, would contribute to increasing financial and economic stability," Mr. Fischer said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: The big decline in estimates of the size of the United States economy was caused primarily by a sharp reversal in the government's estimate of spending on health care services. Health care providers, including physicians and hospitals, reported a decline in revenue from the previous quarter. Because that survey is supposed to cover all sources of revenue, including money from patients, insurance companies and the government, it is taken as definitive in calculating spending on health care services.

Full text:   The first quarter of this year was the worst for the United States economy since the depths of the Great Recession in early 2009.
During the same period, employers hired more people than in any quarter over the last six years, signaling gathering strength in the economy.
It is hard to imagine how both of those statements could be true, but they are what government statistics indicate.
While the employment numbers have been strong, the government sharply cut its estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product late last month. It had previously said the economy declined at an annual rate of 1 percent during the quarter -- a small dip that could be explained by severe weather in much of the country. The new figures showed a 2.9 percent rate of decline, the worst since a 5.4 percent drop in the first three months of 2009.
What happened? Put simply, a single government survey produced highly dubious numbers. Those who conduct the survey say it was done normally and that nothing suspicious surfaced in the responses. But -- particularly in the case of one vital part of the economy -- that survey contradicted other available information. The result was suspiciously low revenue estimates for companies in both health services and food retailing.
"If activity in these sectors was really as weak" as the G.D.P. figures indicate, said Dean Maki, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital, "one would think employers would have caught on to this by now and stopped hiring aggressively."
The big decline in estimates of the size of the United States economy was caused primarily by a sharp reversal in the government's estimate of spending on health care services.
In May, the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce Department, which produces the G.D.P. figures, estimated that in the first quarter such spending rose at an annual rate of 9.7 percent before adjusting for inflation. That would have been the largest quarterly increase in 13 years.
There was a significant increase in Medicaid spending in the first quarter, said Benjamin R. Mandel, an economist who is chief of the federal branch of the bureau's government division. He said that increase was one reason the early estimate was so positive. He also said that increase had been expected because, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid coverage expanded at the beginning of the year in many states.
But the revised estimate released in June said that spending on health care services fell at an annual rate of 0.9 percent. Instead of the largest increase in more than a decade, it was the first decline in nearly half a century, since the third quarter of 1965. That one change accounted for most of the decline in the estimate for overall first-quarter G.D.P.
Behind that reversal were the results of a quarterly survey of service providers. The survey, conducted by the Census Bureau, asks 18,000 companies in 11 service industries about their revenue and expenses. Health care providers, including physicians and hospitals, reported a decline in revenue from the previous quarter.
Because that survey is supposed to cover all sources of revenue, including money from patients, insurance companies and the government, it is taken as definitive in calculating spending on health care services.
Anne S. Russell, an assistant division chief in the Census Bureau who is responsible for the services survey, told me that no obvious red flags emerged. The response rate was within normal limits, she said. The figure will be revised in three months, but only to pick up late responses or reports from companies saying they made mistakes in their first filings. Such changes are seldom very large. Eventually, there will be a more comprehensive annual survey, which could change the numbers, Ms. Russell said.
Mr. Mandel, the B.E.A. economist, said the bureau was trying to figure out what happened. "On the why, I don't have a clear answer," he said in an interview. "We are trying to come up with theories."
There are some possible explanations. Many of those who signed up for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act did not do so until March and did not become covered until April or May. It could make sense for such people to defer some health care until they were covered.
That may have been what happened in 1965, the other year when health care spending declined in a quarter. That occurred while Congress was passing the legislation that established Medicare, beginning in 1966. There were large increases in health care spending after Medicare went into effect.
Still, if that is the explanation, then it would hardly be reasonable to assume that weakness in health care spending continued in the second quarter. But Mr. Maki, the Barclays economist, said it appeared the latest monthly estimates of spending for health care and other things, including food consumption, assume that first-quarter weakness will continue.
Stunned by the G.D.P. report, Mr. Maki put together a model that uses other available data -- hours worked, industrial production and new claims for unemployment insurance -- to estimate G.D.P. In the past, he said, that model has done a reasonably good job of estimating the change in real G.D.P. going back to 1967. For the first quarter, it estimates a growth rate of 3 percent, rather than the official figure of a 2.9 percent decline. That is the largest discrepancy ever.
Barclays maintains a running estimate of each quarter's G.D.P. based on other statistics as they are released. If the current estimate of 2.7 percent is correct, the rebound would not be enough to offset the first quarter, leaving the economy showing negative growth for the first six months of 2014.
During the same period, the economy added an average of 231,000 jobs a month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The last time the first half of a year produced more jobs was in 1999. And a separate report from the bureau, covering employer reports about hirings and firings, showed more people were hired during the first quarter than in any comparable period since the first three months of 2008, as the Great Recession was just beginning. This week, the National Federation of Independent Business said that 26 percent of small businesses had job openings they could not fill in June. That was the highest such figure since 2007.
If the first-quarter G.D.P. report is wrong, can we expect it to be changed? The B.E.A. will release annual revisions at the end of this month, but there is not likely to be a lot of new information by then. As a result, any change might not be reported until 2018, the next scheduled comprehensive revision. By then, figures for this year's first quarter are likely to be of little interest.
Whether or not the estimates are changed soon, the wildly fluctuating reports for the first quarter remind us that "there are literally hundreds of preliminary assumptions that go into estimates of economic barometers," said Robert J. Barbera, a longtime Wall Street economist who is now the director of the Center for Financial Economics at Johns Hopkins University. "Much of the art of economic forecasting is knowing when to say, 'Nah.' "
This is, he said, one of those times. "The first-quarter real G.D.P. number simply makes no sense."

Abstract: The House Ways and Means Committee released a bipartisan plan on Tuesday that would provide federal financing for transportation projects through May 15, 2015, and would be the first step in replenishing the Highway Trust Fund, which will run out of money next month unless Congress acts. [...]while it doesn't provide as much funding as I would like -- enough to get through the end of next year -- it does give Congress and the tax-writing committees ample time to consider a more long-term solution to the Highway Trust Fund," the committee's chairman, Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, said in a statement.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The House Ways and Means Committee released a bipartisan plan on Tuesday that would provide federal financing for transportation projects through May 15, 2015, and would be the first step in replenishing the Highway Trust Fund, which will run out of money next month unless Congress acts.
The proposal, which would be financed in several unusual ways, is expected to generate about $10 billion to keep the Highway Trust Fund from becoming insolvent on Aug. 1 and to pay for projects the fund does not cover. The committee will begin work on the bill Thursday.
"And while it doesn't provide as much funding as I would like -- enough to get through the end of next year -- it does give Congress and the tax-writing committees ample time to consider a more long-term solution to the Highway Trust Fund," the committee's chairman, Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, said in a statement.
Senators announced separately on Tuesday that they were close to a short-term deal to shore up the highway fund. That announcement could come as early as Wednesday morning.
The House plan would be financed through a financial maneuver known as pension smoothing, which increases tax revenues by allowing companies to delay tax-deductible pension contributions, and by unspecified user fees. Money would also be transferred from a fund that is used to clean up leaky underground storage tanks.
Fearing their projects will be left unfunded, states have been shifting money to the most urgent road and bridge repairs, holding off on awarding contracts for other projects, and in many cases delaying work as they prepare for financing to dry up.
"The sad part is that people have been working these kind of things into their transportation budgets for a while because nobody expects Washington to get anything done," said Marcia L. Hale, president of Building America's Future, a Washington-based group that lobbies for more money for infrastructure projects.
The Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956 to finance the Interstate Highway System. It is financed by a gasoline tax, which is set at 18.4 cents per gallon and is not indexed to inflation. The tax has not been increased since 1993, and the rise of hybrid vehicles and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks has also caused the tax revenues to fall.
But with little appetite for tax increases in the House, lawmakers have wrangled for years over the best way to finance the nation's major road, bridge, rail and aviation projects.
Time is running short. The House is 15 days away from its five-week summer recess. If Congress is not able to reach an agreement before then, federal highway funding will be cut by 28 percent on Aug. 1, about the time that construction season starts in most states.
Aubrey L. Layne Jr., the state transportation secretary in Virginia, said the state's cash reserves would finance projects for only about 90 days if the Highway Trust Fund were to dry up.
"But in about 30 to 45 days, we should have to start delaying some projects," Mr. Layne said. Virginia gets about $1 billion a year from the federal government for transportation projects.
Kevin Gutknecht, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation, said the state can finance its entire lineup of road and bridge repairs for the rest of the year, "but obviously we are worried about the long-term effects if Congress doesn't do anything to address the problem."
Wyoming has the authority to borrow up to $100 million from the State Treasurer's Office if federal financing is slowed up, said Del McOmie, chief engineer at the state's Department of Transportation. Mr. McOmie said the borrowed money would allow Wyoming to pay contactors to continue the repair and construction work.
"But it will stress our borrowing authority if it gets beyond November," Mr. McOmie said.
The trust fund provides California with about $3.2 billion a year for its transportation projects, but officials said California had enough cash on hand to keep up work through at least the end of the year
"We can only do so with the assurance that the federal government will continue to honor commitments made to projects already underway," Vanessa Wiseman, a spokeswoman for the Caltrans, the state transportation agency, said in an email.
Many state transportation officials said that even a short-term disruption in financing would have an impact on roadwork.
Beyond the loss of jobs and the cost of restarting work after a delay, officials said vendors' contracts may force states to pay millions of dollars if work is stopped.
"There are severe penalties that are built into the agreements," Mr. Layne said. "Vendors may have bought materials like concrete that they haven't used, and we would be on the hook for that."
The Obama administration warns that the trust fund's insolvency could put 700,000 workers out work just as it appears that the economy is starting to rebound. The administration wants a long-term solution.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, a former mayor of Charlotte, N.C., has lobbied Congress for a four-year spending plan that would allow state and local governments to begin work on longer-term projects that cannot be squeezed into a limited time frame.
"We've had 18 short-term measures in the last five years," Mr. Foxx said. "The cumulative effect of short-term measures is that the country is grinding to a halt."

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDCARACAS, Venezuela -- Brink's, the armored car company, could see about $400 million in revenue disappear this year from its operations in this country. Procter & Gamble announced a write-down of $275 million on its Venezuela business. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines are slashing their Venezuela flights.
Venezuela, once an apparent profit center for multinational companies, increasingly looks like a financial black hole.
Despite the nation's socialist-minded government, large American and other foreign companies thrived here for years, benefiting from limited competition, brand-hungry consumers and close commercial ties with the United States. At the same time, Venezuela's overvalued currency greatly inflated the dollar value of sales on companies' books, lifting their bottom lines, at least on paper.
Now the country's economic chaos is taking its toll, as currency restrictions and a major devaluation cause profits to evaporate.
The economic crisis in this major oil exporting nation has grown since the longtime president, Hugo Chávez, died in March last year. The new president, Nicolás Maduro, has been unable to come up with a consistent set of policies to curb raging inflation and other ills, although there are signs that reforms may be on the horizon.
"It used to be a very profitable environment for them, but I think we're hitting the wall," said Carlos Tejera, the general manager of the Venezuela American Chamber of Commerce. "All indications are these multinationals are going to have to take a really cold, hard look at what's going on here and have to make a decision, because this is unsustainable."
The problems are rooted in the country's currency, the bolívar.
Under standard accounting practices, American companies have long booked sales and profit on their Venezuelan operations using the primary exchange rate set by the government. For years, the currency has been overvalued, allowing multinational companies to post strong numbers.
The country's high inflation -- currently around 60 percent a year -- has also meant that the prices in bolívares that companies charge for many goods and services have risen sharply. That has pushed up bolívar sales figures even higher and exacerbated the distortion when they are converted to dollars.
Such distortions can be seen in the financials of Femsa, the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America. Last year, the company reported revenue in Venezuela of $2.4 billion, slightly greater than in Brazil, a much larger country. Yet sales volumes, which reflect the number of bottles or other units sold, were two to three times bigger in Brazil than in Venezuela, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"It's all smoke and mirrors," said Jonathan M. Rosenthal, co-founder of Newfoundland Capital Management, a hedge fund based in São Paulo, Brazil, that holds short positions in Brink's, betting that its stock will fall as the impact of Venezuela's crisis on its business becomes clear. He said such accounting has filled the books of many companies with "phantom profits."
Now companies are feeling the pain from a series of currency devaluations over the last year and a half.
First, the government changed the fixed exchange rate to 6.3 bolívares to the dollar, from 4.3. Then it created a three-tier exchange rate. The primary rate of 6.3 bolívares is largely intended for importing essential goods like food and medicine. Then there's an intermediate rate of 10.5 bolívares to the dollar, available to companies invited to take part in government auctions, and another, created earlier this year, of 50 bolívares, which was intended to be open to all companies and individuals, although access has been fairly restricted. Both of those rates fluctuate slightly.
In the case of Brink's, the company's filings showed that Venezuelan revenues last year, measured at the government's fixed exchange rate, were a robust $447 million. The company said that Venezuela made up a "significant component" of its overall operating profit last year.
But the rosy outlook changed in late March, when Brink's started calculating its sales using the recently created exchange rate of about 50 bolívares to the dollar. In its quarterly report in April, the company said, "We do not expect Brink's Venezuela to be a significant component of Brink's consolidated revenue or operating profit in the last nine months of 2014."
If the devalued exchange rate had been applied to last year's Venezuela revenues, the company said, they would have shrunk by 88 percent and the operating profit for the entire company would have fallen by 31 percent.
Further complicating the picture, the Venezuelan government has not allowed companies to repatriate profits for the last five years.
Companies have ways of chipping away at the locked-up profits, including charging higher fees to Venezuelan subsidiaries for goods and services provided by the parent corporation. But many foreign companies are stuck holding vast troves of bolívares that shrink in value each time there is a devaluation.
Procter & Gamble said in April that it had the equivalent of about $900 million in cash in this country and that it was taking a $275 million write-down as a result of applying the government's intermediate exchange rate to its Venezuelan balance sheet. Colgate-Palmolive wrote down $174 million, while Ford wrote down about $316 million.
"All the companies knew there would be a loss because everyone knew there wouldn't be dollars" available at the fixed exchange rate, said an executive with an American company in Venezuela who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We were trapped because the law here did not give you a way out."
The currency controls have only tightened over the last year, making it increasingly difficult for companies to obtain the dollars they need to import goods, services, parts or other materials. The government has also failed to pay companies the hard currency it had promised them for imports bought on credit from suppliers, and in many cases suppliers are now refusing to ship more goods to Venezuela until they receive payment.
While international reserves have fallen, economists disagree on whether the government has enough dollars on hand to meet the demand for hard currency or whether it has restricted the supply of dollars as a matter of policy. Either way, the result is that economic production has slowed and shortages of all types are widespread.
Stores are often out of basic products such as dish soap or corn flour. DirecTV has stopped taking on new customers because it cannot get the dollars to import more dish antennas.
Without dollars, car companies cannot import the parts needed to assemble vehicles; Ford and Toyota were forced to temporarily close their factories. An industry trade group reported that in the first five months of this year automakers in Venezuela, including Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Mitsubishi, produced just 4,635 vehicles, down from 31,153 in the same period last year.
In yet another reflection of the currency restrictions, the government has refused to let airlines operating in Venezuela trade the bolívares they receive for ticket sales and other services here for dollars. The International Air Transport Association says that the airlines have more than $4 billion in revenues held up in the country, based on the government's base exchange rate at the time the tickets were sold.
The result is that Venezuela is becoming increasingly cut off from the world.
Two airlines, Air Canada and Alitalia, have stopped flying to Venezuela (Air Canada said it had acted in response to violence around antigovernment protests), and others have sharply reduced service. American Airlines this month reduced its flights to Venezuela to 10 a week, down from 48. It eliminated direct flights from New York, Dallas-Fort Worth and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and flies only from Miami. American Airlines says that it is owed $750 million by the country's government. Delta, which flies from Atlanta to Caracas, said that in August it would cut flights to just one a week, down from once daily.
There are suggestions, however, that the government may be edging toward reforms that could help spur the economy. Economic officials have said that they intend to move toward a unified exchange rate. And recently Jorge Giordani, an ideological hard-liner on economic policy, was pushed out of the government.
After that, the intermediate exchange rate weakened slightly, a sign, for some, that changes were coming, however slowly.
Correction: July 11, 2014, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the effects of currency devaluation in Venezuela misstated an equity position held by Newfoundland Capital Management, a Brazilian hedge fund. While the hedge fund holds a short position in Brink's stock, it does not hold a short position in Femsa stock. The article also misspelled the city in which Newfoundland Capital is based. It is Sáo Paulo, Brazil, not Sáo Paolo.

Full text:   In Spain, where there was a debt crisis just two years ago, investors are so eager to buy the government's bonds that they recently accepted the lowest interest rates since 1789.
In New York, the Art Deco office tower at One Wall Street sold in May for $585 million, only three months after the going wisdom in the real estate industry was that it would sell for more like $466 million, the estimate in one industry tip sheet.
In France, a cable-television company called Numericable was recently able to borrow $11 billion, the largest junk bond deal on record -- and despite the risk usually associated with junk bonds, the interest rate was a low 4.875 percent.
Welcome to the Everything Boom -- and, quite possibly, the Everything Bubble. Around the world, nearly every asset class is expensive by historical standards. Stocks and bonds; emerging markets and advanced economies; urban office towers and Iowa farmland; you name it, and it is trading at prices that are high by historical standards relative to fundamentals. The inverse of that is relatively low returns for investors.
The phenomenon is rooted in two interrelated forces. Worldwide, more money is piling into savings than businesses believe they can use to make productive investments. At the same time, the world's major central banks have been on a six-year campaign of holding down interest rates and creating more money from thin air to try to stimulate stronger growth in the wake of the financial crisis.
"We're in a world where there are very few unambiguously cheap assets," said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock, one of the world's biggest asset managers, who spends his days scouring the earth for potential opportunities for investors to get a better return relative to the risks they are taking on. "If you ask me to give you the one big bargain out there, I'm not sure there is one."
But frustrating as the situation can be for investors hoping for better returns, the bigger question for the global economy is what happens next. How long will this low-return environment last? And what risks are being created that might be realized only if and when the Everything Boom ends?
>
Safe assets, like United States Treasury bonds, have been offering investors paltry returns for years, ever since the global financial crisis. What has changed in the last two years is that risky assets, like stocks, junk bonds, real estate and emerging market bonds, have also joined the party.
Want to buy shares of American companies? At the current level of the Standard & Poor's 500 index, every dollar invested in stocks buys you about 5.5 cents of corporate earnings, down from 7.4 cents two years ago -- and lower than just before the global financial crisis in 2007-8.
Prefer a more solid asset? The price of office and apartment building has risen similarly; office space in central business districts nationwide costs $300 per square foot on average, up from $147 in early 2010, according to Real Capital Analytics. In Manhattan, an investor in an office building can expect rent payments after expenses to add up to only a 4.4 percent return, known as the capitalization rate, lower than even in 2007, the top of the last boom.
What about overseas investments? Spain and other Southern European countries that were the nexus of the European debt crisis are not the only places where bond rates have plummeted (even Greece was able to issue bonds at favorable rates earlier this year). Emerging markets, which generally have higher interest rates because of higher inflation and less political stability, are offering record low interest rates as well. Bonds issued by the governments of Brazil and Malaysia, for example, are currently yielding only around 4 percent.
The high valuations now aren't as extreme as those of stocks in 2000 or houses in 2006; rather, what is new is that it applies to such a breadth of assets. In 2000, when the stock market was, with hindsight, a speculative bubble, other assets like bonds, emerging market investments and real estate looked reasonable.
The Everything Boom brings obvious economic risks. In the most pleasant outcome, global economic growth would pick up, causing today's expensive assets to begin looking more reasonably priced. But other outcomes are also possible, including busts in one or more markets that could create a new wave of economic ripples in a world economy still not fully recovered from the last crisis.
There are two principal reasons behind this low-return environment, though people might dispute which is the cause and which is the effect.
Global central banks have been on an unprecedented campaign of trying to stimulate growth through low interest rates and of buying assets with newly created money. If the Federal Reserve keeps its short-term interest rate target near zero until next year, as most officials of the central bank expect, it will have maintained the zero-interest-rate policy for seven years. The Fed held $900 billion in assets in August 2008; now that number is $4.4 trillion and counting, with the third round of asset-buying set to expire at the end of the year. Central banks in Britain, Japan and the euro zone have pursued similar policies.
In a view widespread in the capital markets, the low returns are a byproduct of those low rates. The Fed and other central banks have siphoned off trillions of dollars' worth of the supply of global investments, and private investors are having bidding wars for whatever is left.
"Interest rates are so low," said Peter J. Clare, a managing director and co-head of the United States buyout group at private equity firm the Carlyle Group. "There are few other attractive places where investors can direct their money, so it drives investor money into equity markets. It's just the most basic of supply and demand equations: When there's more demand, it drives up the price and pushes valuations where they are today."
But while central banks can set the short-term interest rate, over the long run rates reflect a price that matches savers who want to earn a return on their cash and businesses and governments that wish to invest that savings -- whether in new factories or office buildings or infrastructure.
In this sense, high global asset prices could be the result of a world in which there is simply too much savings floating around relative to the desire or ability of businesses and others to invest that savings productively. It is a reassertion of a phenomenon that the former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke (among others) described a decade ago as a "global savings glut."
But to call it that may not get things quite right either. What if the problem is not too much savings, but a shortage of good investment opportunities to deploy that savings? For example, businesses may feel that capital expenditures are unwise because they won't pay off.
Mr. Bernanke himself has been wrestling with the possibility that the original framing of a global savings glut got the problem in reverse. "I may have made a mistake in trying to assign a name," Mr. Bernanke, now at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. "A glut means more than is wanted. But it doesn't necessarily arise because people want to save more. It can be because they invest less.
"It's entirely possible that if you look at the world, you have slow-growing advanced economies, China cutting back on capital investments, that the rate of return is just going to be low."
If this analysis of the world is correct, investors have an unpleasant choice: consign themselves to returns lower than the historical norm, or chase evermore obscure investments that might offer an extra percentage point or two of return.
The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.

Abstract: In Germany, as in the United States, business lobbyists and some economists have warned that a robust minimum wage will lead to job losses and higher prices, but that has not been the historical experience.

Full text:   The federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is obviously too low. So is the Democrats' proposed increase to $10.10 an hour by 2016. If the minimum wage had merely kept pace over time with inflation, average wages or productivity growth, it would be between $11 an hour and $18 an hour today.
It would also be higher if it kept pace with what other advanced economies are prepared to pay.
Last week, the lower house of Parliament in Germany voted to set a nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros an hour, about $11.60, effective in 2015. The upper house is expected to approve the measure this week. With the passage of it, Germany, France, Britain and the Netherlands have or soon will have higher minimum wages than the current and proposed minimums in the United States, and only six countries in the European Union will be without a statutory minimum wage: Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Italy and Sweden.
The expected German minimum is noteworthy not only for its level. For nearly 70 years, most wages in Germany have been set by agreements that are collectively bargained between unions and employers. In recent decades, however, and particularly following reunification with the former East Germany, the share of workers who are effectively covered by union agreements has fallen. By enacting an adequate minimum wage, the German Parliament is responding constructively to that development, because a solid wage floor ensures that economic growth is broadly shared even by those who fall outside the collectively bargained framework.
In a global economy that has long relied on low wages to lift profits, a relatively high minimum wage in Germany would also reflect a growing consensus there that a high-wage, high-productivity economy is, in fact, an advantage in stabilizing the nation economically and socially.
In Germany, as in the United States, business lobbyists and some economists have warned that a robust minimum wage will lead to job losses and higher prices, but that has not been the historical experience. Rather, higher wages for low-wage workers are generally offset by lower labor turnover, while the boost in consumer spending from higher wages is good for the economy. Boosting consumer demand is especially important in Germany, whose economy is overly reliant on exports.
Germany's move offers the United States important lessons, if only lawmakers in Washington would learn.

Full text:   On Sunday The Times published an article by the political scientist Brendan Nyhan about a troubling aspect of the current American scene -- the stark partisan divide over issues that should be simply factual, like whether the planet is warming or evolution happened. It's common to attribute such divisions to ignorance, but as Mr. Nyhan points out, the divide is actually worse among those who are seemingly better informed about the issues.
The problem, in other words, isn't ignorance; it's wishful thinking. Confronted with a conflict between evidence and what they want to believe for political and/or religious reasons, many people reject the evidence. And knowing more about the issues widens the divide, because the well informed have a clearer view of which evidence they need to reject to sustain their belief system.
As you might guess, after reading Mr. Nyhan I found myself thinking about the similar state of affairs when it comes to economics, monetary economics in particular.
Some background: On the eve of the Great Recession, many conservative pundits and commentators -- and quite a few economists -- had a worldview that combined faith in free markets with disdain for government. Such people were briefly rocked back on their heels by the revelation that the "bubbleheads" who warned about housing were right, and the further revelation that unregulated financial markets are dangerously unstable. But they quickly rallied, declaring that the financial crisis was somehow the fault of liberals -- and that the great danger now facing the economy came not from the crisis but from the efforts of policy makers to limit the damage.
Above all, there were many dire warnings about the evils of "printing money." For example, in May 2009 an editorial in The Wall Street Journal warned that both interest rates and inflation were set to surge "now that Congress and the Federal Reserve have flooded the world with dollars." In 2010 a virtual Who's Who of conservative economists and pundits sent an open letter to Ben Bernanke warning that his policies risked "currency debasement and inflation." Prominent politicians like Representative Paul Ryan joined the chorus.
Reality, however, declined to cooperate. Although the Fed continued on its expansionary course -- its balance sheet has grown to more than $4 trillion, up fivefold since the start of the crisis -- inflation stayed low. For the most part, the funds the Fed injected into the economy simply piled up either in bank reserves or in cash holdings by individuals -- which was exactly what economists on the other side of the divide had predicted would happen.
Needless to say, it's not the first time a politically appealing economic doctrine has been proved wrong by events. So those who got it wrong went back to the drawing board, right? Hahahahaha.
In fact, hardly any of the people who predicted runaway inflation have acknowledged that they were wrong, and that the error suggests something amiss with their approach. Some have offered lame excuses; some, following in the footsteps of climate-change deniers, have gone down the conspiracy-theory rabbit hole, claiming that we really do have soaring inflation, but the government is lying about the numbers (and by the way, we're not talking about random bloggers or something; we're talking about famous Harvard professors.) Mainly, though, the currency-debasement crowd just keeps repeating the same lines, ignoring its utter failure in prognostication.
You might wonder why monetary theory gets treated like evolution or climate change. Isn't the question of how to manage the money supply a technical issue, not a matter of theological doctrine?
Well, it turns out that money is indeed a kind of theological issue. Many on the right are hostile to any kind of government activism, seeing it as the thin edge of the wedge -- if you concede that the Fed can sometimes help the economy by creating "fiat money," the next thing you know liberals will confiscate your wealth and give it to the 47 percent. Also, let's not forget that quite a few influential conservatives, including Mr. Ryan, draw their inspiration from Ayn Rand novels in which the gold standard takes on essentially sacred status.
And if you look at the internal dynamics of the Republican Party, it's obvious that the currency-debasement, return-to-gold faction has been gaining strength even as its predictions keep failing.
Can anything reverse this descent into dogma? A few conservative intellectuals have been trying to persuade their movement to embrace monetary activism, but they're ever more marginalized. And that's just what Mr. Nyhan's article would lead us to expect. When faith -- including faith-based economics -- meets evidence, evidence doesn't stand a chance.

Abstract: No, the real scandal is what Republicans did to cripple the agency when virtually no one was looking. Since the broad Tea Party-driven spending cuts of 2010, the agency's budget has been cut by 14 percent after inflation is considered, leading to sharply reduced staff, less enforcement of the tax laws and poor taxpayer service.

Full text:   There is a scandal going on at the Internal Revenue Service, but it has nothing to do with Lois Lerner or her missing emails. House Republicans have not given up on their noisy crusade to tie Ms. Lerner to what they imagine to be widespread political corruption within the Obama administration, but all they have proved is that the I.R.S. is no better at backing up its computer files than most other government agencies.
No, the real scandal is what Republicans did to cripple the agency when virtually no one was looking. Since the broad Tea Party-driven spending cuts of 2010, the agency's budget has been cut by 14 percent after inflation is considered, leading to sharply reduced staff, less enforcement of the tax laws and poor taxpayer service.
As the economist Jared Bernstein noted recently in The Washington Post, a weakened I.R.S. enforcement staff will be unable to make a dent in the $385 billion annual gap between what taxpayers owe and what they pay -- an unintended tax cut, mostly for the rich, that represents 11 percent of this year's spending. Middle-class taxpayers who struggle to fill out their 1040s may welcome a diminished threat of an audit, but in fact this reduction is not about them. The I.R.S. audits a far higher percentage of tax returns from people reporting incomes over $200,000 than from those reporting less, because that is where the money is (along with the most profitable cheating).
But in 2013, it audited only 24 percent of returns over $10 million, compared with 30 percent in 2010. Of returns reporting between $1 million and $5 million, it audited 16 percent in 2013, compared with 21 percent in 2010. That is great news for the nation's highest-income taxpayers, many of whom donate generously to Republican politicians to keep their taxes low. They are getting their money's worth from lawmakers who debilitate revenue collection while claiming to be deeply worried about the budget deficit.
But it is bad news for building roads, keeping the air clean, protecting the nation's security, and countless other vital government tasks. Revenue collected by I.R.S. enforcement actions has fallen by more than $4 billion over the last four years, according to a new report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And every dollar spent on enforcement yields $6 in additional revenue. Many I.R.S. computers use obsolete Windows XP operating systems and cannot keep up with a growing problem of identity theft that is directing refunds to criminals.
The budget cutters are also trying to prevent the agency from performing its new job of collecting higher taxes on the rich to pay for health care reform, and distributing health insurance subsidies for low- and moderate-income people, many of whom will now be covered for the first time. The agency also has to collect and process more information about assets held in offshore accounts under a 2010 law, for which it needs more people and resources, not fewer. Guess who uses offshore accounts?
But rather than meet their legal responsibilities, House Republicans have proposed cutting I.R.S. funding by yet another $341 million in 2015, to $10.9 billion. (Their bill also would outlaw the agency's collection of the health law's individual mandate penalty.)
President Obama's budget, by contrast, would increase the agency's spending by $1.2 billion compared with this year's -- not nearly enough, but at least a start in reversing a troubling trend and letting the I.R.S. do its job of collecting the money to pay for essential government services.

Full text:   PARIS -- The European Central Bank left its monetary policy intact on Thursday, choosing to wait for the extraordinary measures it enacted a month ago to work their way through the economy before deciding whether additional action was needed to bolster growth and keep deflation at bay.
"The key E.C.B. interest rates will remain at the current levels for an extended period of time," Mario Draghi, the central bank president, said at a news conference in Frankfurt, citing the continuing outlook for low inflation.
The decision, announced after the central bank's Governing Council met in Frankfurt, had been widely expected after the bank unveiled initiatives last month to stimulate the economy, including imposing a negative interest rate on the deposits that lenders hold at the central bank and making more cheap loans available to banks.
"It will simply take several more months before the impact of last month's decisions can adequately be assessed," Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Group in Brussels, wrote in a research note.
The only surprise was in Mr. Draghi's announcement that, as of January, the Governing Council would begin holding monetary policy meetings once every six weeks, instead of monthly, and that it would publish minutes of its meetings.
Publication of the minutes signaled a concession to critics who had called for the bank to follow what had become a widespread practice aimed at increasing transparency in monetary policy. The United States Federal Reserve has since 2005 been publishing its minutes three weeks after each policy meeting.
The change in schedule also brings the frequency of central bank meetings in line with that of the Fed, but Mr. Draghi said that was irrelevant.
"We have no plans to synchronize with anyone," he said. "The Governing Council decided that a monthly frequency was just too tight. That's the reason."
Mr. Draghi also revealed details of the central bank's new program to spur the credit market by providing cheap, four-year loans to banks in exchange for a commitment that the funds be lent to companies, instead of, for example, used to buy government bonds or other financial assets. A bank that failed to meet that condition would have to repay the loans early.
The central bank hopes that supplying the loans will help ease the stark divide between the so-called core and periphery euro zone nations; Standard & Poor's estimates that corporations in Spain currently pay about 1.5 percentage points more in interest on multiyear loans than do comparable German corporations -- a punishing handicap in international competition.
The first allocations under the program, called Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations, will come in September and December, Mr. Draghi said, in amounts up to 7 percent of banks' loan books, totaling around 400 billion euros, or $546 billion. Mr. Draghi said the total could ultimately reach as much as [euro]1 trillion.
"We want to see the impact of this program," Mr. Draghi said. "The impact is going to be substantial."
While the central bank took no action on Thursday, Mr. Draghi said the market should not interpret that as a sign of complacency.
"The E.C.B. cannot and should not act every month," he said, but added: "The governing council is unanimous in its commitment to use also unconventional measures" to meet its goals.
The bank on June 5 initiated a minus 0.1 percent interest rate on the deposits that banks park there, effectively charging them for sitting on cash. It also cut its main interest rate target to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent.
The moves "have relieved the immediate pressure for action," Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London, wrote in a research note before the meeting. "The E.C.B. has kept the door open for more easing, but will be less fussed by monthly inflation rate releases for a while."
The central bank's inaction contrasted with that of the Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, which on Thursday cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent from 0.75 percent.
The Riksbank cited its own battle with deflationary pressures for the move, noting that it had revised its 2014 forecast to show prices falling 0.1 percent, compared with an earlier forecast of a 0.2 percent increase. It also cited the strength on the foreign exchange market of the Swedish currency, the krona.
The krona has remained strong as the Riksbank, concerned about high household debt in Sweden, held off longer than other central banks in bringing rates down nearer to zero.
The European Central Bank's announcement came just days after an official report showed that consumer prices in the 18-nation euro zone rose last month at a rate of just 0.5 percent, far below the central bank's target of holding inflation at just under 2 percent.
A separate report showed that new lending to the private sector had been declining for more than a year.
Mr. Draghi vowed in July 2012 to do "whatever it takes" to save the euro, bringing a halt to the crisis that had driven sovereign borrowing costs to unsustainable levels in several countries and restoring calm to the euro zone.
As a result of that verbal intervention, and some timely bond buying, Spain, Italy and Ireland are now paying interest on their 10-year debt that is not substantially different from that on comparable United States bonds.
Despite that success, the European Central Bank has had to ease policy twice since November because of the threat of deflation. The condition of widespread falling prices has the potential to further depress growth and, most worryingly at a time when the bank is trying to prop up fragile lenders, to hobble banks and borrowers.
The current "lowflation" is only partly a monetary phenomenon: With more than 25 million people out of work, and households and businesses working to reduce debt, slack demand is also holding prices in check.
Economists expect the gross domestic product of the euro zone to have grown at an annual rate of a little above 1 percent in the second quarter, accelerating from the 0.7 percent growth rate of the first three months of 2014. The data will be released on Aug. 14.
The central bank has become increasingly concerned about the strength of the euro, because the strong currency weakens inflationary pressures by making imports cheaper, even as it holds down the value of corporations' overseas earnings. The euro weakened slightly after the central bank meeting, trading around $1.36, and the euro zone benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index gained more than 1 percent. The currency's weakness might have reflected expectations that a relatively strong jobs report in the United States would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise rates before the European Central Bank, making dollar assets more attractive than those denominated in euros.
Like the other big central banks, the European bank turned to ultralow interest rates after the financial crisis to keep financial institutions above water and to hold down borrowing costs for struggling corporations. Because most governments have abandoned fiscal stimulus, the other main option for affecting output, the responsibility for keeping economies afloat has fallen to central banks and the imperfect tool of monetary policy.
The central bank has so far resisted the adoption of so-called quantitative easing employed by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. In that approach, the other central banks have been buying bonds outright on a large scale, in effect converting debt securities into cash to grease the wheels of the financial system.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: Michelle Applebaum, a now-retired steel analyst whom I have relied upon for insights since the 1980s, when she was at Salomon Brothers, says that one reason the 1959 strike proved disastrous for the big steel companies was that it showed customers they had choices. Customers whose own operations would have to shut down without steel sought to build up stockpiles, and that meant dealing with foreign steel makers who previously had made minimal inroads in the United States market.

Full text:   It has been 55 years since bitter labor relations exploded into one of the longest and most debilitating strikes the United States has ever seen.
Half a million steelworkers walked out in July 1959, threatening to throw the nation back into recession. "It would," said a statement issued by R. Conrad Cooper, a United States Steel official who led the industry's bargaining committee, "take a complete surrender of the all the economic and other principles for which we stand" for the company to agree to the union's demands for raises without significant changes in work rules.
In October, with no deal in sight, President Dwight D. Eisenhower invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to force workers back to their jobs. "If permitted to continue, this strike would imperil the national health and safety," he said. Limited steel production resumed after the Supreme Court upheld that action in November, but it was not until January 1960 that the strike was finally settled.
U.S. Steel was the first billion-dollar corporation when it was created in 1901 by J. P. Morgan. In 1959 it was still the seventh most valuable company in the country. Its profits were high and rising, making it hard for the industry to credibly claim workers were being greedy, and its executives seemed to exude haughtiness.
But it was the run-up to that strike, as well as the eventual terms of the settlement, that paved the way for the decline of the company and the industry it led. The episode opened the door for surging imports and eventually for wage increases that the companies could ill afford.
This week the decline in importance of U.S. Steel was illustrated by the fact that it went all but unnoticed when the company was unceremoniously removed from the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. By the time it was kicked out, U.S. Steel's stock market value was lower than that of any of the other 499 companies. That value, $3.8 billion, was about 30 percent less than in 1959 -- and that does not take inflation into account.
The United States economy is no longer so dependent on heavy manufacturing, a development that would have taken place even if the men running U.S. Steel had far more foresight than they did. But they might have coped with it far better than they did. They might have found a way to better use newer technology that enabled companies like Nucor, which remains in the S.&P. 500 and whose market value is four times that of U.S. Steel, to prosper making steel.
More broadly, the descent of U.S. Steel from all powerful to also-ran might be worth contemplating by those who now seem to be astride the world economy, a list that could include companies in Wall Street, Silicon Valley and China.
Michelle Applebaum, a now-retired steel analyst whom I have relied upon for insights since the 1980s, when she was at Salomon Brothers, says that one reason the 1959 strike proved disastrous for the big steel companies was that it showed customers they had choices.
In those days nearly the entire industry negotiated at the same time, and there was talk of a strike for months in advance. Customers whose own operations would have to shut down without steel sought to build up stockpiles, and that meant dealing with foreign steel makers who previously had made minimal inroads in the United States market. Those stockpiles enabled the economy to come through better than expected. The Pentagon's fears of a crisis in national defense capability were not realized.
When the strike did end, workers received minimal wage increases, but they also obtained a cost-of-living provision to ensure that wages and benefits kept up with inflation. That would prove to be valuable for them in later years. Steel users had learned how to deal with imported steel, a lesson they did not forget.
In the next round of steel talks, in 1962, the administration of President John F. Kennedy leaned on the union to accept what was viewed as a modest settlement. President Kennedy hailed it as "noninflationary."
Days later, Roger M. Blough, U.S. Steel's chairman and chief executive, called the White House and said he needed to meet with the president that day. The fact that Mr. Blough could arrange such a meeting without disclosing what it was about was an indication of the company's power. The fact that he felt it necessary showed he knew the announcement he was about to make was hardly routine: U.S. Steel was raising prices.
After Mr. Blough left, an angry president met with his economic advisers. "My father," he told them, according to a later report in The New York Times, "always told me that all businessmen were sons-of-bitches, but I never believed it till now."
The president told a news conference the next day the price increase was a "wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest." He added: "Some time ago I asked each American what he would do for his country, and I asked the steel companies. In the last 24 hours we had their answer."
The Justice Department said it would investigate possible antitrust violations. So did a Senate committee. Administration officials called other steel companies to try to persuade them not to go along with the price increase. Most did raise prices, including Bethlehem Steel, whose president, Edmund F. Martin, had been quoted as telling reporters just before the U.S. Steel announcement that "there shouldn't be any price rise." Bethlehem said he had been misquoted. F.B.I. agents were dispatched to interview the reporters to see whether they stood by their reports, awakening one of them at 3 a.m. The full-court press worked. Within days, Inland Steel said it would not go along, and other companies soon backed down. Senator Barry Goldwater, who was planning to run against Kennedy in 1964, said the president's actions were "something you'd expect in a police state."
After the fight was won, Kennedy insisted he was not antibusiness and said he had been misquoted by The Times. His father, he said at a news conference, had not referred to "businessmen" with the vulgar phrase, and he had not endorsed that sentiment. It was "steel men" that both father and son were condemning.
The steel industry since then has experienced its ups and down, but there have been more downs than ups. U.S. Steel management over the years invested in the oil industry -- at a particularly bad time -- and expanded internationally to Eastern Europe with transactions that did not prove to be very profitable. The oil investments did work out eventually, but by then the company had been intimidated by Carl C. Icahn into issuing a new class of shares covering the oil interests. When the company split in two in 2001, the oil company, Marathon Oil, was worth far more than the steel company. The long-suffering owners of U.S. Steel's common stock realized no benefit from the oil investment.
But Ms. Applebaum, the analyst, says U.S. Steel is a success story, at least on a relative basis. There is a long list of big steel makers that have been through bankruptcy court, but U.S. Steel is not on it. The company, she said, saved itself through "tight capital spending, prudent asset divestitures and a number of rationalizations through the years."
A U.S. Steel spokeswoman turned aside my request for an interview with the current chief executive, Mario Longhi, and said the company had no comment on its expulsion from the S.&P. 500, of which it had been an original member.
Mr. Longhi, who took over as chief executive last year, probably can't get a White House appointment without saying why he wants one. But at least he did not have to face an angry president this week when the company, according to American Metal Market, told customers that it was raising prices on flat rolled steel. The trade publication said that move was a surprise and questioned whether the price increase would stick.
No one in Washington seems to have noticed.
Had Mr. Longhi agreed to talk to me, I might have asked if he thought being ignored was worse than being hated.

Full text:   You often find people talking about our economic difficulties as if they were complicated and mysterious, with no obvious solution. As the economist Dean Baker recently pointed out, nothing could be further from the truth. The basic story of what went wrong is, in fact, almost absurdly simple: We had an immense housing bubble, and, when the bubble burst, it left a huge hole in spending. Everything else is footnotes.
And the appropriate policy response was simple, too: Fill that hole in demand. In particular, the aftermath of the bursting bubble was (and still is) a very good time to invest in infrastructure. In prosperous times, public spending on roads, bridges and so on competes with the private sector for resources. Since 2008, however, our economy has been awash in unemployed workers (especially construction workers) and capital with no place to go (which is why government borrowing costs are at historic lows). Putting those idle resources to work building useful stuff should have been a no-brainer.
But what actually happened was exactly the opposite: an unprecedented plunge in infrastructure spending. Adjusted for inflation and population growth, public expenditures on construction have fallen more than 20 percent since early 2008. In policy terms, this represents an almost surreally awful wrong turn; we've managed to weaken the economy in the short run even as we undermine its prospects for the long run. Well played!
And it's about to get even worse. The federal highway trust fund, which pays for a large part of American road construction and maintenance, is almost exhausted. Unless Congress agrees to top up the fund somehow, road work all across the country will have to be scaled back just a few weeks from now. If this were to happen, it would quickly cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs, which might derail the employment recovery that finally seems to be gaining steam. And it would also reduce long-run economic potential.
How did things go so wrong? As with so many of our problems, the answer is the combined effect of rigid ideology and scorched-earth political tactics. The highway fund crisis is just one example of a much broader problem.
So, about the highway fund: Road spending is traditionally paid for via dedicated taxes on fuel. The federal trust fund, in particular, gets its money from the federal gasoline tax. In recent years, however, revenue from the gas tax has consistently fallen short of needs. That's mainly because the tax rate, at 18.4 cents per gallon, hasn't changed since 1993, even as the overall level of prices has risen more than 60 percent.
It's hard to think of any good reason why taxes on gasoline should be so low, and it's easy to think of reasons, ranging from climate concerns to reducing dependence on the Middle East, why gas should cost more. So there's a very strong case for raising the gas tax, even aside from the need to pay for road work. But even if we aren't ready to do that right now -- if, say, we want to avoid raising taxes until the economy is stronger -- we don't have to stop building and repairing roads. Congress can and has topped up the highway trust fund from general revenue. In fact, it has thrown $54 billion into the hat since 2008. Why not do it again?
But no. We can't simply write a check to the highway fund, we're told, because that would increase the deficit. And deficits are evil, at least when there's a Democrat in the White House, even if the government can borrow at incredibly low interest rates. And we can't raise gas taxes because that would be a tax increase, and tax increases are even more evil than deficits. So our roads must be allowed to fall into disrepair.
If this sounds crazy, that's because it is. But similar logic lies behind the overall plunge in public investment. Most such investment is carried out by state and local governments, which generally must run balanced budgets and saw revenue decline after the housing bust. But the federal government could have supported public investment through deficit-financed grants, and states themselves could have raised more revenue (which some but not all did). The collapse of public investment was, therefore, a political choice.
What's useful about the looming highway crisis is that it illustrates just how self-destructive that political choice has become. It's one thing to block green investment, or high-speed rail, or even school construction. I'm for such things, but many on the right aren't. But everyone from progressive think tanks to the United States Chamber of Commerce thinks we need good roads. Yet the combination of anti-tax ideology and deficit hysteria (itself mostly whipped up in an attempt to bully President Obama into spending cuts) means that we're letting our highways, and our future, erode away.

Full text:   The stock market, continuing a remarkable ascent that began in the darkness of the last recession, surged past a milestone on Thursday after a strong jobs report indicated that the economy might finally be gaining steam.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which measures the share price performance of 30 blue-chip companies, broke through 17,000 for the first time. It closed at 17,068.26, up 92.02 points, or 0.54 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broader yardstick, finished the day within striking distance of 2,000, closing up 10.82 points, or 0.55 percent, at 1,985.44, a record.
The S.&P. 500 is now nearly three times its low point in 2009, when the economy was in free fall and the government was scrambling to shore up the financial system. When adjusting for inflation, however, the S.&P. 500 is still below its peak in 2000.
The stock market's rally has taken place even as a tepid economy has failed to lift the incomes of many Americans. The economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter. Still, there are signs that economic growth is starting to pick up. The stock market records were set after the government announced on Thursday that the economy had added 288,000 jobs in June, more than analysts had been expecting.
"While the economy has been slower than people would have liked, there are signs that it has continued to improve," said Shep Perkins, a portfolio manager at the Putnam Global Equity Fund. "You could see the S.&P. at 3,000 in three to four years."
The current bull market has lasted nearly 64 months, making it the fourth-longest since the crash of 1929, according to an analysis by S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. And in recent years, the United States stock market has substantially outperformed those of Europe, Japan and China.
Some individual investors have benefited from the rally. The value of stocks and mutual funds held by households increased by more than $3 trillion in the 12 months through March, according to data from the Federal Reserve. But such gains will have mostly gone to the wealthier households, where stock ownership is concentrated. "The trickle down is not working," said Douglas Kass of Seabreeze Partners Management, a hedge fund firm. "The schism between haves and the have-nots has widened."
Stronger corporate profits have helped sustain the rally. Some companies have bolstered their bottom lines in part by restraining expenses. But investors seem most excited about younger companies with strong growth prospects. Stock in Facebook, for instance, has risen more than any other in the S.&P. 500 over the last 12 months, soaring 170 percent. Netflix is up 114 percent. "Innovation has been a huge driver," Mr. Perkins, the mutual fund manager, said.
Reflecting the excitement about a new wave of technology shares, the Nasdaq index has climbed strongly, closing at 4,485.93 on Thursday, putting it a little more than 10 percent below its peak in 2000 during the technology bubble.
Still, some investors question whether the stock market can hold on to its gains.
One of the most surprising features of the most recent bull market is that it has taken place during a drawn-out period of economic sluggishness. During the extended rallies of the 1990s and the 2000s, the economy grew at about 3 percent a year, double the growth rate of the latest ascent.
And not all investors are convinced that growth is poised to accelerate. The mood in the bond market, for instance, is circumspect. The yields on bonds have fallen this year, indicating that investors believe the Fed will have to keep interest rates low to prevent the economy from stalling.
The 10-year Treasury note closed with a yield of 2.64 percent, down from just more than 3 percent at the end of last year. "This demonstrates that bond investors are skeptical about the economic recovery," said Timothy M. Ghriskey of Solaris Asset Management. "And rightly so, because we saw a weak economy in the first quarter."
To stimulate the economy, the Fed has pumped more than $3 trillion into it to spur growth and the banking system since the financial crisis. But some investors assert that this stimulus has helped generate speculation in the stock market while having a limited effect on the real economy. "There has been no escape velocity in the economy," Mr. Kass said. "We are dependent on the kindness of the Federal Reserve."
As the economy recovers, the Fed is gradually injecting less money into the financial system. If profits and the economy grow robustly, stock market investors may not care that there is less monetary stimulus. But if the withdrawal causes a tightening in financial conditions, the appetite for stocks might dwindle.
For now, however, financial markets have been trading with little volatility. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said on Thursday that its "financial stress index" was at a record low, which means investors in many markets are not worried yet.
But to some analysts, the market is too calm.
One big question that skeptics have is whether the rally has made stocks overvalued, and potentially vulnerable to a decline. There are many ways to assess how expensive stocks are, and bullish and bearish investors often use different yardsticks to make their case.
Optimists, for instance, note that the stock market value of the companies in the S.&P. 500 is 16.5 times the 2014 profits that analysts expect for those firms. That ratio is not particularly high by historical standards, they say. "Valuations are not extreme by any means," Mr. Ghriskey said.
But the skeptical analysts contend that the stock market is trading at lofty valuations when using longer-term comparisons of earnings and stock prices, including a yardstick devised by Robert J. Shiller, a professor at Yale. This measure shows the stock market is trading at close to the valuation it had before it plunged in 2008.
And Gerard Minack of Minack Advisors says that he has noticed a particularly disquieting feature in the latest rally. During past peaks, even though some stocks were significantly overvalued, many others had attractive valuations. Now, he says, almost no companies in the S.&P. 500 are real bargains. "What is cheap is cheap for a very good reason," Mr. Minack said. "Everything else is rich or fully valued."
The stock market's optimists, however, say such concerns are overblown. Corporate earnings, they say, could post substantial gains if the European and Asian economies bounce back. "That has to be the hope of the equity markets," Mr. Ghriskey said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   American companies are finally getting comfortable enough with the economy's prospects to add new workers at a very healthy pace, after years of saying they lacked the confidence to hire people aggressively during a fitful recovery.
Employers added 288,000 jobs in June, the Labor Department said Thursday, the fifth month in a row that hiring has topped the 200,000 mark. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.1 percent last month, the best reading since September 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers turned what had been a mild recession into an economic rout.
Since then, many segments of the economy have rebounded -- including corporate profits, Wall Street and the housing market -- even as payrolls inched higher at a grindingly slow rate. Now, these broader economic gains are prompting businesses to actually hire significantly more workers in response to growing demand, rather than taking half steps, like adding hours to stretch existing work forces.
The prospect of stronger economic growth, with healthier consumer spending as more Americans find work, helped to lift the stock market to new highs. On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 17,000 for the first time, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index recorded a new high and the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit its highest level since the go-go days of 2000.
Despite the broad gains, the economy is still a long way from its peak before the housing bubble burst and the recession began at the end of 2007. The broadest measure of unemployment, which includes people who are working part time because full-time positions are not available, stands at 12.1 percent. And the proportion of Americans in the labor force has been stuck for three straight months at 62.8 percent, a 36-year low, and is down sharply from 66 percent in 2008.
But the recent healthy level of hiring looks more sustainable than it has in years. Factoring in June's increase and upward revisions for estimated hiring in April and May, employers added an average of 231,000 workers a month in the first half of 2014, the best six-month run since the spring of 2006. "We're clicking on all cylinders in terms of job growth," said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays.
Just as significant as the headline figures, Mr. Maki said, is that June's hiring was broad-based, as industries as varied as health care, manufacturing, financial services and retailing all added workers. "Every major sector showed job growth in June, including the private service sector, where the bulk of jobs in the U.S. are created," Mr. Maki said.
In an important turnabout, there were encouraging gains not just in well-paid white-collar professions, or in low-wage sectors like retail and restaurants, but also in the vast middle tier of jobs that enable workers to gain a foothold in the middle class. For example, manufacturers hired 16,000 workers, while transportation companies added 17,000 employees and the long-dormant public sector saw an addition of 26,000 positions.
"It's definitely a strong report," said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. "There really aren't that many clouds."
Despite the stock market jump, the more robust rate of hiring is making some traders nervous that the Federal Reserve will be forced to start raising short-term interest rates earlier than had been expected to ward off any risk of higher inflation. The drop in the unemployment rate to near 6 percent comes months earlier than the Fed had expected; the central bank had predicted it would take until the end of the year for the jobless rate to reach that level.
While the Fed's program of buying bonds to stimulate the economy is on track to end in October, most economists have been predicting the first increases in short-term rates would not come until the summer or early fall of 2015. Now, some experts like Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics say the Fed could move as soon as March.
Despite such concerns, there was little hint of accelerating wage inflation in the data in June, a crucial trend that the Fed watches to gauge the broader danger of higher inflation. Wages are up just 2 percent from the period a year earlier, in line with the inflation rate today as well as the overall rate of salary increases over the last four years.
Some of the recent job gains represent a catch-up for employers that put off hiring during a bumpy 2013. The initial weakness in the first quarter of 2014 delayed it further, as the economy shrank 2.9 percent during a bitter winter and a downward swing for inventories.
Roger Hargens, chief executive of Accumold, an Ankeny, Iowa, maker of small, highly specialized components for medical device firms and other manufacturers, had hoped to begin hiring more aggressively last year. But after the delay of a big order last fall, he waited instead.
The last few months have been strong enough to persuade him to take the plunge. Orders in June hit their best level ever, with much of the demand coming from overseas customers. Accumold's products include the exterior plastic shells of hearing aids, as well as the tiny tools used by doctors to remove cataracts or perform laparoscopic surgery.
Accumold added three workers last month at its facility in the Des Moines suburbs, and the company plans to hire another 10 to 20 employees in the second half of the year, bringing the total work force to just under 200 people. By the end of 2015, Mr. Hargens hopes to employ 220 to 230 people at his company, where the typical production worker earns about $17 an hour while people with technical expertise often make at least $25 an hour.
"We're starting to scale up in a big way," said Mr. Hargens, who is heading to Europe on Monday to meet with customers in Switzerland, France and Britain. "We had to hold off, but now we're back on track."
As the story of Accumold suggests, the 70 million American workers with a high school diploma or some college, who make up the largest group in the work force, are finally seeing some of the gains only college graduates had enjoyed earlier in the recovery.
Unemployment among high school graduates fell to 5.8 percent in June from 6.5 percent a month earlier, and joblessness among people with some college or an associate degree fell to 5 percent, from 5.5 percent in May. The unemployment rate among college graduates increased 0.1 percentage point to 3.3 percent.
Mr. Maki, the Barclays economist, said that among workers with only a high school diploma, employment was actually falling at this point in 2013 by 16,000 a month on a yearly basis. Now, he said, employers are adding 29,000 high school graduates a month.
"We're seeing more significant gains among those who have less than a college degree," Mr. Maki said. "The trend is beginning to shift."

Full text:   U.S. JOBS DATA TO BE RELEASED EARLY IN HOLIDAY WEEK
Because of the Fourth of July holiday, the Labor Department will release the latest data on unemployment and job creation on Thursday. Typically, the announcement takes place on the first Friday of the month. Economists on Wall Street expect the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 6.3 percent, while estimating the economy added 215,000 jobs in June. One additional data point to watch is the labor participation rate, which has been depressed since the recession, for any sign workers are returning to the job hunt as prospects improve. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ
JUNE DATA ON NEW-CAR SALES EXPECTED TO BE STRONG AGAIN
Automakers on Tuesday are expected to post another strong month for new-vehicle sales in the United States in June. Analysts at TrueCar, the auto research website, predict that sales rose 1 percent in June from the same month last year and reached a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.4 million cars, down from May but still representing a rebound from the winter slowdown. Close attention will be paid to General Motors, whose sales have held up despite a scandal over safety defects that have led to the recall of millions of its vehicles. BOB GOETZ
SUPREME COURT TO RULE IN CASE CRUCIAL TO PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS
The Supreme Court is expected to issue a major decision on Monday that could significantly cut into the power and revenues of the nation's public sector unions. In the case, Harris v. Quinn, eight home-care workers in Illinois have asked the court to rule that government employees who opt out of belonging to the home-care union cannot be required to pay fees to the union for representing them and administering their contracts. STEVEN GREENHOUSE
EURO ZONE DATA EXPECTED TO SHOW SCANT MOMENTUM
Euro zone economic data is expected to confirm the picture of a barely growing economy. On Monday, an inflation report from Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, is expected to show prices just barely creeping up in June, while the May jobs report on Tuesday is expected to show the unemployment rate holding steady at 11.7 percent. The European Central Bank's governing council will meet on Thursday, but no policy action is expected, as monetary authorities await the outcome of their June easing. DAVID JOLLY
OTHER ECONOMIC REPORTS SCHEDULED THIS WEEK
Despite the holiday-shortened week, several other economic reports are scheduled. These include pending home sales in May, on Monday; construction spending in May, on Tuesday; factory orders in May, on Wednesday; and the United States trade balance in May, on Thursday.

Full text:   THROUGHOUT the economic recovery since the Great Recession officially ended in the summer of 2009, consumers have generally remained doubtful that the economy really has gotten better. Now, as they finally conclude that the business climate has improved, a hitherto perfect recession indicator has sounded a warning.
The Conference Board reported this week that in June more of the people it polled believed that business was good than thought it was bad. The margin -- 23 percent to 22.8 percent -- was narrow and could be reversed when the final June figure is released in a month. But there had been no such reading since January 2008, when the recession was just beginning.
On Wednesday, the day after the Conference Board report, the Bureau of Economic Analysis sharply lowered its estimate of economic activity in the first three months of 2014, saying the overall economy shrank at a rate of 2.9 percent during the quarter, adjusted for inflation. It had earlier estimated smaller declines, which were blamed in large part on the weather.
As is shown in the accompanying charts, the bureau said that the economy declined at an annual rate of 1.7 percent during the quarter on a nominal basis -- that is, even before adjusting for inflation.
Such nominal declines are rare. Since the government began keeping quarterly statistics on gross domestic product in 1947, it reported nominal declines in only 16 quarters before this year. The official recession arbiter, the National Bureau of Economic Research, later determined that the economy was in recession in at least part of each of those quarters.
There were four post World War II recessions when nominal G.D.P. rose in each quarter, generally in periods of moderate to high inflation. But in the other seven recessions, there was always at least one quarter when nominal G.D.P. fell.
The economic research bureau uses real G.D.P. figures as one indicator in determining whether the economy is in recession, but also looks at industrial production, retail sales and employment. None of those now seem to be pointing to an economic downturn.
It seems likely that the first-quarter fall in nominal G.D.P. was caused by several factors that are unlikely to repeat. The level of inventories plunged, partly because of the weather. Without the impact of inventories, the economy would have shown a small increase, in nominal terms. Health care spending was also surprisingly low, and probably recovered in the quarter now ending.
Since 1967, the Conference Board, as part of its consumer confidence survey, has been asking consumers whether they thought business conditions were good, average or bad. The accompanying charts do not include those who viewed business conditions as normal.
Until June, the proportion of consumers thinking conditions were bad had exceeded the proportion who thought they were good for 76 consecutive months. The longest previous periods of continued negative consensus were 44 months in the early 1980s and 46 months in the early 1990s.
Chart After Economy Shrinks, More Consumers Now Say Business Looks Good: The Government Reported This Week That the Nation's Economy Shrank During the First Quarter Before Considering Inflation. That Was the First Time That Happened Since 2009. All Previous Declines Since the Data Began to Be Calculated in 1947 Have Come During Recessions. But the Conference Board Said That in June, for the First Time in More Than Six Years, More Consumers Thought Business Conditions Were Good Than Thought They Were Bad.; Quarterly Change in Nominal Gross Domestic Product, at Annual Rates; Percentage of Americans Saying Business Conditions Are Good and Those Saying Conditions Are Bad (Sources: Bureau of Economic Affairs, Via Haver Analytics, Conference Board)

Full text:   The beginning of the year was not just bad for the United States economy: It was, on paper at least, the worst quarter since the last recession ended five years ago.
The Commerce Department revised its estimates of first-quarter gross domestic product Wednesday to show that the economy contracted at a 2.9 percent annual rate. A combination of shrinking business inventories, terrible winter weather and a surprise contraction in health care spending drove the first-quarter decline, which is the worst since the first quarter of 2009, when the economy shrank at a 5.4 percent rate.
What makes the sharply negative number all the more stunning is that it didn't feel like an economic contraction at all in the first quarter. Employers kept adding jobs. Many measures of business activity and consumer confidence were stable. And forecasters are expecting a healthy pop of growth in the second quarter, which ends next week.
But the economy was hit by an unlikely combination of negative forces that conspired to turn what seemed set to be another quarter of so-so growth into a considerably more gloomy experience.
Economists had expected the revised number to show contraction, though they expected a less bad number than the one that materialized. One key thing they missed: Consumer spending, the mainstay of economic activity, was far weaker than either government numbers or private analysts had thought -- particularly spending on health care.
Previous G.D.P. numbers, released in late May, showed that health care spending contributed 1 percentage point to economic growth. The new report now finds that health care spending actually subtracted 0.16 of a percentage point from the growth rate. The health care spending data in G.D.P. is a measure of how much President Obama's health reform law is reshaping health care spending patterns, and it is now showing opposite results from those reported two months ago, when the first-quarter data was initially released.
But other causes of the first quarter-contraction were already well known. Businesses pulled back on their inventories, which subtracted 1.7 percentage points from growth (an earlier estimate had been 1.6 percent).
And the rough winter weather threw a wrench in many categories of business activity, slowing home building activity (residential investment subtracted 0.13 of a percentage point) and commercial building work (which subtracted 0.22 of a percentage point). Trade was a further drag, as exports fell sharply and imports rose a bit.
But the fact that the economy as a whole could show such a sharply negative result thanks to a few combined idiosyncratic factors is also a reflection of an underlying weakness.
When growth is strong, even some bad weather and an unexpected inventory swing don't cause a contraction in the economy, or at least not a contraction on the scale reported for the first quarter of 2014. But because the pattern of growth has been roughly in the 2 percent range or a bit below that for years now, the economy is more vulnerable to shocks that leave G.D.P. growth in negative territory.
The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.

Full text:   NAIROBI, Kenya -- The Sudanese government has reconstituted the janjaweed, notorious militias that terrorized the restive Darfur region for years, making them an official, uniformed force that has recently burned down huts and attacked civilians, according to a new report prepared by the Enough Project, an activist group that aims to prevent genocide.
The report, which will be released publicly this week, includes satellite imagery of hundreds of burned down huts, describing the growing crisis as a replay of the conflict in Darfur that exploded in 2003, when militias laid waste to villages of certain ethnic groups.
But what is different this time, the report's authors say, is that the government's role in fomenting the violence is hardly secret, with the culprits wearing state-issued uniforms, complete with little Sudanese flags, and even bragging about their exploits on Facebook.
"The Sudanese government has abandoned the fig leaf that the janjaweed don't operate under their command and control," said the Enough Project, a nonprofit group based in Washington. "After spending years trying to distance themselves from these forces of terror, the regime is not even bothering to deny their association with these war criminals anymore."
United Nations officials say the trouble started a few months ago when thousands of members of the new militias, called the Rapid Support Forces, showed up in Darfur after rampaging in a nearby state. Their job was supposed to be fighting the rebels who have been seeking autonomy for the region. Instead, United Nations officials say, the new militias began to raze villages, rape women and kill civilians, burning down a displaced persons camp right in front of a United Nations base in March. Most of the people in the camp had already fled, seeking protection with peacekeepers, so few were killed.
United Nations officials were adamant that the culprits were government forces.
"We could see the attackers," one United Nations official said.
Sudan's many internal conflicts often overlap and intertwine. A possible reason Darfur is heating up again is that the leading Darfurian rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement, has been roped into the emerging civil war in South Sudan, helping the South Sudanese government. The Justice and Equality rebels are considered Darfur's most capable fighting force. Their absence has created a sudden opening for government-sponsored militiamen to operate virtually unopposed.
According to the Enough Project, which interviewed Darfurian advocacy groups and tracked various commanders on social media sites, the new militias are led by army officers and known janjaweed figures. Janjaweed is a term used by Darfurians for the government-backed militias widely believed to be responsible for atrocities that prompted the International Criminal Court to charge Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, with genocide.
Critics of the Sudanese government say it is once again trying to suppress insurgencies by deputizing local proxies who operate with impunity and end up being impossible to rein in. In recent briefings, Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations, and Fatou Bensouda, the International Criminal Court prosecutor, singled out the Rapid Support Forces as a new menace. Last week, Ms. Bensouda called them "the newest iteration of the janjaweed."
The Sudanese government denies this, touting its new recruits as patriots battling back the various threats to the Sudanese state, of which there is no shortage: the smoldering resentments in Darfur, tens of thousands of rebel fighters dug into the Nuba Mountains, others hiding out in Blue Nile state, and student protesters calling for an immediate end to the rule of Mr. Bashir, in power since 1989.
A Sudanese official denied the report's allegations. "What the I.C.C. and Enough are claiming is untrue and uninformed," said Gamal Goraish, deputy chief of mission at the Sudanese Embassy in Washington. "These are very disciplined, organized troops. I won't comment on the term 'janjaweed' -- we don't use that term. But I can tell you the I.C.C. and Enough are only giving you part of the story."
Mr. Goraish provided a four-page fact sheet with bullet points detailing the Rapid Support Forces' achievements, including defeating rebels and fixing water pumps.
As for the satellite photographs that showed rings of ash where villages once stood, Mr. Goraish said those areas might have been rebel camps.
Whatever is happening in Darfur, the broader picture in Sudan seems bleak. Sudan lost 75 percent of its oil when South Sudan broke away in 2011, and inflation, a plummeting currency and a growing sense of malaise have dogged the country ever since. It is a mystery how the government is able to even pay the thousands of new soldiers and outfit them with the latest four-wheel-drive trucks, crisp camouflage and mammoth guns, all proudly displayed on a Facebook page that is labeled their official site. The Enough Project says they may be getting help from Iran.
A few years ago, throngs of displaced people in western Darfur decided to venture back home. The violence was decreasing. Things were looking up. But not now.
According to a Darfurian tribal leader whose accounts were included in the Enough Project's report, thousands of Rapid Support Forces militiamen surrounded a village in February and opened fire, "killing scores of people instantly."
"Militiamen looted and set fire to houses," the report continued. "R.S.F. troops seized and raped more than 20 women and girls. According to this account, thousands of villagers were still trapped in the desert."

Key Fed Official Says a Rate Increase Is Not Yet Imminent

Full text:   The Federal Reserve can reasonably wait to raise interest rates until mid-2015 without risking an undesirable rise in inflation, an influential Fed policy maker said on Tuesday.
"We think we can get the unemployment rate considerably lower and still not have an inflation problem," said William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "We also don't have inflation at a level consistent with price stability."
In May, the unemployment rate stood at 6.3 percent, the lowest level since the end of 2008 and unchanged from April. Inflation has been running below the Fed's 2 percent goal, although some recent readings have been firmer.
"The market expectations are that the Federal Reserve will start to raise short-term interest rates around the middle of 2015 -- that sounds to me like a reasonable forecast," Mr. Dudley told a Puerto Rico accounting group. "But, you know, forecasts often go astray."
Mr. Dudley, who as chief of the New York Fed holds a permanent vote on the central bank's policy-making panel, speaks from experience: In the last several years the Fed has been frequently overly optimistic about economic growth prospects, and officials have had to repeatedly lower their forecasts.
At the same time, the Fed has underestimated how quickly unemployment will drop; it now sees the jobless rate as approaching near normal levels this year.
Mr. Dudley's comments, which often reflect dominant sentiment at the Fed, suggest the central bank is in no hurry to raise rates from their current near-zero level once it winds down its bond-buying stimulus this year.
Traders of short-term interest rate futures currently peg June 2015 as the likely start of an expected gradual run of interest rate increases by the United States central bank.
Speaking at a separate event, Charles I. Plosser, the hawkish president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said he had "growing concerns that we may have to adjust our communications in the not-too-distant future. Specifically, I believe the forward guidance in the statement may be too passive."
Mr. Plosser's comments reflect concern among a minority at the Fed that the central bank may wait too long before raising rates, allowing inflation to spiral upward and out of control.
Mr. Dudley made it clear on Tuesday that he did not share those concerns.
"In the current environment, it is still very, very appropriate to continue to follow a very accommodative monetary policy because we're making progress toward our objectives but we have not yet reached our objectives," Mr. Dudley said.

Abstract: The healthiest thing for the housing market would be home price rises that thread the needle: high enough that homeowners are building equity and homebuilders have incentive to start new construction, but low enough that they don't significantly outpace wage growth and result in unaffordable housing and a painful correction.

Full text:   The latest readings on United States home prices are the latest confirmation of a slowdown in that area: Prices are still rising in most cities, but much more slowly than they were a few months ago. And that's news we should cheer.
The S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices in 20 major cities rose 0.2 percent in April, down from 1.2 percent in March and well below the 0.8 percent that analysts forecast. Over the last year, prices have risen 10.8 percent, compared with a 13.7 percent gain in the year ended in November, the recent peak. A second report on home prices out Tuesday, from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, showed the same pattern.
Just two years ago, buying a home looked to be a screaming bargain across most of the country. But the gains in home prices since then have made it a much closer call, as we reported last month. Jed Kolko, the chief economist of Trulia, writes Tuesday that national home prices are only 3 percent undervalued relative to long-term fundamentals, and that a handful of markets, particularly in Southern California, are now significantly overvalued.
This doesn't mean that a bubble on the order of 2006 has returned, only that buyers in some of those higher-priced markets should be wary and consider renting a home instead if they are on the fence. "Orange County, today's frothiest market," writes Mr. Kolko, "is just 17 percent overvalued now versus being 71 percent overvalued" at the start of 2006.
But that moderate potential overvaluation could easily become a major one if double-digit price increases rise too much longer. In a world where inflation is low and wages are flat, continued steep home prices increases would rapidly move the housing market from broadly balanced to unaffordable and primed for a correction in just a few months.
That's what makes this housing recovery seem healthier and more sustainable than the bubble of the early 2000s. Then, even as home prices soared beyond any traditional level relative to income, home buyers responded by taking on more risk and buying anyway, speculating on further home price gains. This time, they seem to be looking at high valuations and not getting caught up in the excitement, instead drawing the line and paying no more than they can afford.
Home price numbers tend to move in more steady, gradual waves than other economic data. They also come out with long delays; the April Case-Shiller numbers are actually based on transactions that closed from February through April -- and those home sales generally went under contract a month or two before they closed.
So the latest home price readings are very much a look in the rearview mirror, and it's a look that suggests a deceleration is underway. The question is where it will ultimately settle. If prices were rising 13 percent in the year ended in November and 11 percent in April, what will, or should, the level be later in 2014?
The healthiest thing for the housing market would be home price rises that thread the needle: high enough that homeowners are building equity and homebuilders have incentive to start new construction, but low enough that they don't significantly outpace wage growth and result in unaffordable housing and a painful correction. The April home price numbers suggest we may be heading there.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   The deeply indebted college graduate has become a stock character in the national conversation: the art history major with $50,000 in debt, the underemployed barista with $75,000, the struggling poet with $100,000.
The anecdotes have created the impression that such high levels of student debt are typical. But they're not. They are outliers, and they're warping our understanding of bigger economic problems.
In fact, the share of income that young adults are devoting to loan repayment has remained fairly steady over the last two decades, according to data the Brookings Institutions is releasing on Tuesday. Only 7 percent of young-adult households with education debt have $50,000 or more of it. By contrast, 58 percent of such households have less than $10,000 in debt, and an additional 18 percent have between $10,000 and $20,000.
"We are certainly not arguing that the state of the American economy and the higher education system is just great," Matthew Chingos, a Brookings fellow and one of the authors of the new analysis, told me. "But we do think that the data undermine the prevailing sky-is-falling-type narrative around student debt."
The misperceptions matter because they distract us from the real trouble with our higher education system. It's not the graduates of expensive colleges who are struggling to get started on a career. Such graduates make for good stories (and they tend to involve the peer group of journalists), but history suggests that most of them will do just fine.
The vastly bigger problem is the hundreds of thousands people who emerge from college with a modest amount of debt yet no degree. For them, college is akin to a house that they had to make the down payment on but can't live in. In a cost-benefit calculation, they get only the cost. And they are far, far more numerous than bachelor's degree holders with huge debt burdens.
The solutions to the dropout crisis have some overlap with the solutions to the so-called student-debt crisis: more accountability for colleges. For the most part, though, the two issues are different -- and require different answers. Lifting the nation's college graduation rate depends on better, more cost-effective education, rather than merely cheaper education.
I realize that the stories of student debt are so common and visceral that many readers will view the Brookings argument with some skepticism. So let me walk through it.
The first thing to acknowledge is that student debt has risen over the last two decades. In 2010, 36 percent of households with people between the ages of 20 and 40 had education debt, up from 14 percent in 1989. The median amount of debt -- among those with debt -- more than doubled, to $8,500 from $3,517, after adjusting for inflation.
Some of the increase stems from the encouraging fact that more people are going to college. Contrary to popular belief, average tuition at private (nonprofit) colleges has not increased any faster than overall inflation over the last decade, once financial aid is taken into account, according to College Board data. Well-off students are paying more, but many middle- and low-income students are not.
At public colleges, however, tuition really has increased. Average net tuition and fees have risen more than 50 percent over the last decade, to $3,120 for in-state students. The recent cuts to higher-education budgets in some states, like Pennsylvania, play a role.
But even with tuition rising, several other factors have helped hold down debt burdens. The incomes of college graduates have grown since the early 1990s. And the repayment time for many loans has become longer. This combination creates perhaps the most surprising fact from the Brookings data:
The share of income that a typical student debtor has to devote to loan payments is only marginally higher than it was in the early 1990s -- and somewhat lower than it was in late 1990s. It was 3.5 percent in 1992, 4.3 percent in 1998 and 4 percent in 2010.
Maybe even more surprisingly, the burden for the people with the most debt is significantly lower today than two decades ago. Someone at the 90th percentile of debt had to devote 15 percent of her income to repayment in 2010, down from 20 percent in 1992.
All of which is to say that student debt is indeed a problem for some young people today, but that it's not a new phenomenon. For most, the returns on a college education have more than kept pace with the cost.
What explains the widely held notion to the contrary? I think it stems in large part from the fact that Americans are legitimately frustrated about the economy's performance over the last 15 years. But when you start looking at the evidence that blames student debt, it can be flimsy.
For example, recent research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggested that student loans were keeping some young adults from buying homes. But Beth Akers, one of the authors of the Brookings analysis, notes that the Fed's data stretches back only to 2003. The pattern may well be real -- and have existed for decades.
"The evidence," Ms. Akers says, "doesn't support the notion that student loan debt is creating a drag on the economy."
She carefully notes that more research might ultimately turn up such evidence, given that student debt has risen. For now, though, the anxiety about student debt has a lot in common with the scare stories that have historically accompanied an expansion of credit to the masses. The reality is that debt allows the middle class and poor to afford many staples of a good life, be it a house, a car or an education. Unlike houses or cars, education at least brings a healthy financial return.
With all this being said, the Brookings paper does contain a true cause for concern: "Among households with some college but no bachelor's degree, the incidence of debt increased from 11 to 41 percent." The average amount of debt among this group also more than doubled over the last two decades. Some members of the group are thriving community-college graduates, but more are college dropouts.
Those dropouts point to some of the big flaws that our higher-education system does have. Many colleges graduate fewer than half of the students they enroll -- and resist policy makers' attempts to hold them accountable for their results. Some public universities devote much of their financial aid to students who do not need it most, creating hardship for others. And recent state budget cuts have caused painful tuition increases on many campuses.
If you want to argue that American universities charge too much money for too little education, you can make a pretty good case. But the people paying the real price for those failings aren't the ones who fit the clichés.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- Russia's charged balancing act in its policy toward Ukraine was evident on Sunday, with President Vladimir V. Putin both endorsing a peace plan outlined by the Ukrainian president and rebuking Kiev for the shaky cease-fire.
As the violence drags on without a resolution in sight, Mr. Putin finds himself treading a narrow path between conflicting goals, according to government officials, analysts and diplomats.
His main objective is to preserve as much Russian influence as possible over Ukraine's future, championing the goal of the separatists for significant autonomy. That autonomy would keep the southeast closer in orbit to Moscow than to Kiev, rendering Ukraine's central government weak.
But Mr. Putin must achieve that goal without getting Russia enmeshed in the politically fractured and economically backward briar patch of the breakaway regions. That would be expensive, not least because any hint of a military role or even a hand in the area's destabilization could provoke far harsher Western sanctions.
Such sanctions are expected to be the focus of sustained consultations during the coming week when NATO foreign ministers and European leaders meet separately in Brussels. Washington warned last week that tougher sanctions were under serious discussion because it said Moscow was supplying covert military aid, including tanks and artillery, to the rebels.
Russia denies any such thing. "Mr. Putin says that the only viable solution will be through dialogue," Dmitri S. Peskov, the president's spokesman, said Sunday when asked to summarize Russia's position.
However, Mr. Putin is trying to satisfy several mutually antagonistic constituencies at once. Much of his domestic audience, fed for months on a diet of frenzied, Ukraine-in-flames reports on state-run television, endorses the need for a firm Russian hand.
The military and staunch nationalists, encouraged by Moscow's annexation of Crimea in March, are considered the leading chorus for this approach. They hope the Ukraine crisis can serve as the catalyst for Russia to go it alone once again as a superpower -- an idea with popular appeal.
"Ukraine should be considered territory occupied by the United States except for Donbass," Sergei Y. Glazyev, an economic adviser to Mr. Putin, said this month, using the shorthand for the region that includes the breakaway "People's Republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk. "We should call on other regions to liberate themselves from this occupation."
But the more liberal constituency in Russia, including many business executives, economists and diplomats, want to avoid the rupture with the West that would surely follow a full embrace of the separatists.
"A big country like Russia cannot be split from the rest of the world -- it is not the 19th century," Evgeny Gontmacher, a prominent economist, told participants in a recent seminar. "We will be barefoot and the inflation rate out of control."
Much of the West is not even waiting for stiffer sanctions to be put in place, he noted, but has already stopped investing in Russia and started blacklisting its institutions.
So the problem for Russia, and Mr. Putin in particular, is to balance those competing demands. (Officially, the Kremlin denies being swayed by the threat of sanctions.)
"Putin has to show that he is a strong leader who stands up for the national interests," said Aleksei V. Makarkin, an analyst at the Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. "On the other hand, he needs to send a message to the West that he is ready for a dialogue, to make it clear that he won't escalate the situation, that there is no need to impose sanctions."
Mr. Putin exercised both tracks of his dual policy over the weekend. On Saturday, hours after shells from Ukraine crashed into a Russian border post, causing damage but no casualties, he put the military on alert and announced snap exercises involving some 65,000 soldiers.
But he also issued a statement on Saturday endorsing the peace plan, even calling on both sides to stop fighting. He repeated the gist of his remarks to reporters during a live television broadcast on Sunday.
"It is important that this cease-fire open the way to a dialogue between all of the parties to the combat, so as to find solutions that will be acceptable to all sides," Mr. Putin said.
But he also criticized the continuing Ukrainian military operations despite the unilateral cease-fire that the government in Kiev said it put into effect on Friday. "What is needed is for all military operations to stop," he said. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry issued a statement accusing the pro-Russian separatists of fueling continued violence.
Of course, calling for dialogue and actually getting it started are two different matters. In a nationwide speech on Saturday laying out his peace plan, Petro O. Poroshenko, the new Ukrainian president, rejected negotiations with virtually all the separatist leaders. They in turn said they would not interact with Kiev.
Yevgeny N. Minchenko, a Moscow-based expert on Ukraine at the International Institute for Political Expertise, said the idea that negotiations could be held without the separatists was unrealistic. "If they want to solve the problem, they have to negotiate with the guys who control the situation," he said.
On Sunday, three past presidents of Ukraine -- Leonid M. Kravchuk, Leonid D. Kuchma and Viktor A. Yushchenko -- wrote an open letter to Mr. Putin asking him to do more to defuse the violence in Donbass and to withdraw Russian mercenaries. "Leave our country in peace!" they wrote.
Although Russian, Ukrainian and European officials have had some eight rounds of discussions on the peace plan, Moscow is keeping its official distance from the mechanics of carrying it out.
"How they are going to do it is their problem," said Mr. Peskov, Mr. Putin's spokesman, putting the onus in particular on Mr. Poroshenko. "We cannot do it on their behalf, we are not part of their conflict. This is a domestic conflict in Ukraine."
But he acknowledged that there was a "huge deficit of trust," citing the attacks by the Ukrainian military as the root cause.
"Definitely they have to figure out some trust-building measures to show their intentions are really peaceful, and that it is not an issue of ultimatums," Mr. Peskov said in a brief interview.
Analysts are uncertain what might work on that front, and predict that the fighting could drag on. This is particularly true because with more people dying, both sides were less likely to heed outsiders, they said.
Already, Mr. Poroshenko's supporters in central and western Ukraine endorse the idea, however unlikely, of wiping out the separatists, while in the southeast the fighting alienates more people from Kiev daily.
Moscow has plenty of time to both call for peace and supply the rebels, some analysts said, until it gets a Ukraine it can still dominate. "Their medium-term goal is to keep it festering; the militants are their leverage," said Cliff Kupchan, a Washington-based Russia analyst at the Eurasia Group. "I don't think peace is at hand."

Full text:   BRASÍLIA -- In 1500, Portuguese explorers arrived on the shores of what is now Brazil seeking, among other things, gold. Today, Portuguese adventurers have come here seeking merely goals.
They have not found them yet.
The Portuguese national soccer team, including the great Cristiano Ronaldo, has been set up in Brazil for several days, pursuing fortunes as its forebears did here centuries ago, but not doing nearly as well. A disastrous 4-0 defeat to Germany left the Portuguese in shambles, and they face the United States in Manaus on Sunday in a game for their World Cup survival.
When they square off, the teams are expected to have large contingents of supporters, with Brazilians possibly tipping the balance toward the Portuguese, who are hoping that long-held cultural, historical and linguistic ties will make them the second favorites at the World Cup, as some people believe.
"Portugal is the second team of every Brazilian," said Joanna de Assis, a reporter for TV Globo in Brazil. "If, God forbid, Brazil was out of the tournament, all Brazilians would support Portugal."
There may be some exaggeration in that, especially for older fans who recall the harsh treatment Pelé received at the feet of the Portuguese in the 1966 World Cup, when they cut him down mercilessly with cynical tackles almost every time he touched the ball.
"I cannot say for sure who the fans would root for now," Roberto DaMatta, an anthropologist and expert on Brazilian culture, said in a telephone interview. "But for those who remember what happened to Pelé against Portugal, there was no harmony back then. When we passed Portugal in football in the 1950s, we loved that."
Perhaps that explains why so many Brazilian fans were whistling at Ronaldo during Portugal's loss to Germany in Salvador, the coastal city that was once Brazil's principal port for slave trade. Then again, Ronaldo, Portugal's dashing and divisive star, is a special case because of his reputation as a prima donna. After Portugal's loss to Germany, a headline in a São Paolo newspaper read, "You Lost, Crybaby."
But Adrieli Franca, 21, a civil engineering student from Salvador, will have none of that. She attended last week's game in a crisp, new version of Ronaldo's maroon No. 7 Portugal shirt.
"I love Cristiano," she said. "I am crazy for him. That is why I am here."
Others have different opinions, like Anderson Dos Santos, 32, a taxi driver in Brasília.
"Once there is no more Brazil, I don't really care," he said. "Portugal is O.K. for me, but they are not strong."
The relationship between Portugal and its former colony in modern times is not easily pinned down. Certainly, there is a connection reflected in the language, the common history and the names of at least two local soccer clubs: Portuguesa in São Paolo and Rio de Janeiro's Vasco da Gama, named for the Portuguese explorer whose ship is depicted on the team logo.
According to DaMatta, an essential element of Brazilian independence is that there was no violent uprising, perhaps reducing any lingering resentment toward the old colonial power. Moreover, Brazil served as the seat of power for the Portuguese empire for most of the 19th century.
"In 1808, King John VI fled to Brazil when Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula, and he and his son and grandson ruled there for many years," DaMatta said. "This led to a different experience for the Brazilian-Portuguese experience, as the onetime periphery became the central power base."
Frances Hagopian, the Jorge Paulo Lemann visiting associate professor for Brazil studies at Harvard, said she never sensed antipathy toward Portugal when she lived in Brazil. But nor did she sense any special connection.
"Portugal is a country one-twentieth the size of its former colony," she said. "In most ways, Brazil has moved past Portugal as a developed country. I think even many of the elites look toward France."
But Portuguese remains the lingua franca. And although some Brazilians and Portuguese citizens say the language is identical save for a few words, others insist the accents and rhythm of speech are so different that it can be jarring.
"If we speak slowly, they can understand us," said Andre Ribeiro, 36, a car salesman from the Portuguese city of Porto who arrived in Brazil with a group of friends over a week ago.
Ribeiro said the Portuguese felt a natural kinship with Brazilians.
"Actually, we are more like brothers," he said. "That is how they have treated us here."
DaMatta said that besides language, Brazil inherited many things from Portugal that help characterized Brazilian culture. (Soccer was not one of them. Legend has it that soccer, Brazil's most popular sport, was imported by the son of a Scottish rail worker in the late 19th century.)
"Oh yes, we have the same sexism, the same corruption and the same assistance by the state to help certain people become millionaires," he said. "Portugal built no schools here, no universities, and they were late with health care. Everything was late."
In modern soccer terms, there doesn't appear to be universal antipathy leveled at Portugal, other than toward Ronaldo.
"The only animosity is directed toward Argentina," said Fernanda Fontes, a 33-year-old nurse who grew up in Salvador until moving to the United States at 16.
And although DaMatta said there was not enough cultural exchange between the countries, Portugal served as safe harbor for many Brazilians during the years of inflation in the 1980s and '90s. Many of those who went to Portugal were dentists, and according to DaMatta, they put some Portuguese dentists out of work.
"We have the best dentists in the world," he said. "So what did they do? They made laws limiting the ability of Brazilian dentists to work in Portugal."
Soccer players, however, have had no difficulty finding work in Portugal. The best Brazilian players may prefer to go to the more lucrative Spanish league, but Deco played for Porto from 1999 to 2004 (before moving to Barcelona). Today there are dozens of lesser-known Brazilian players in Portugal, according to Eurorivals.net, far more than in other European leagues.
Now, all the best Portuguese stars, including Ronaldo, the so-called crybaby, are playing in Brazil. Even he says they have been treated like another home team, which they hope will continue in Manaus.
"We have gotten nothing but fantastic support since we have been here," Ronaldo said. "With all the Brazilian hospitality, it has felt like home."
Now, if they can just get the goal.
Self-Evaluation: "I'm certainly honest enough and hard enough with myself to know that it wasn't my sharpest night," United States midfielder Michael Bradley said of his showing in a 2-1 victory over Ghana.

Full text:   AGRICULTURE is a small part of the United States economy, but last year it was the best part.
The output of the agriculture sector grew 16.4 percent after inflation last year, the fastest rise for the sector since at least 1998 and far faster than any other part of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product grew just 1.8 percent, while the second-fastest growing sector, the information industry, rose 3.2 percent.
Last week, the government released its estimates of state economic growth in 2013. North Dakota led the pack with a growth rate of 9.7 percent. Alaska was the only state whose economy declined, shrinking by 2.1 percent, largely because of declining oil production.
The economy of the District of Columbia also declined, but that was because of cuts in government spending.
North Dakota benefited from its rising production of shale oil, but it was also helped by the fact that its agriculture sector amounts to 12.9 percent of the state's economy, more than that of any other state except South Dakota.
By contrast, agriculture accounted for just 1.6 percent of the country's overall output in 2013. But that was the largest share in recent years, up from a recent low of 0.9 percent in 2006. The agriculture sector includes forestry, fishing and hunting as well as farming, but farming is much larger than the other categories.
Last year, the government changed the way it calculated G.D.P. figures, including counting research and development spending as investments rather than as consumption. It revised historical figures only back to 1997, so earlier years' output and growth figures for agriculture are not comparable.
Mitch Morehart, an economist with the Agriculture Department, said the strong growth in agriculture reflected a recovery in production for some crops after a drought in 2012, as well as strong production and rising prices for livestock. This year, he said, it appears that agriculture is not doing nearly as well.
Over all, the economies of the 10 states that are most dependent on agriculture grew at an average annual rate of 3.4 percent in 2013, while the 10 states that are least dependent on the farm economy grew at an average rate of 1.3 percent.
California is by far the largest agricultural producer, accounting for $46.7 billion, or 17 percent, of the total national agricultural output of $269.1 billion. But the state is so large that agriculture makes up only 2.1 percent of its output, less than 16 other states. Iowa, which ranks second in dollar value at $16.1 billion, depends on agriculture for almost 10 percent of its total economic output.
The 2013 surge in agriculture ended a string of three years in which that sector did not do as well as the overall United States economy. But since 1998, agriculture outperformed the rest of the economy in nine of the 15 years. During that stretch, agriculture grew at an annual rate of 4 percent, double the 2 percent average for the national economy.
Chart Booming Agriculture: The Agriculture Sector of the United States Economy Grew Far More Rapidly Than Any Other Sector in 2013, and Outperformed All but One Sector Over the Last 15 Years. It Remains a Small Part of the Overall Economy, but Its Share Is the Largest It has Been in at Least the Last 16 Years. States Most Dependent On Agriculture Generally Grew More Rapidly in 2013 Than Did States with Smaller Agricultural Sectors. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis)

Full text:   A Good Patent Decision
The Supreme Court, in a unanimous ruling on Thursday, properly said that merely using a computer to perform a well-established abstract idea is not patentable. The decision should help clarify and limit patents that have too often been granted for business processes that do not represent a true scientific or technological advance. Fewer bad patents should help to reduce the recent growth in frivolous and abusive patent infringement lawsuits.
The case, Alice Corporation v. CLS Bank International, involved four patents owned by Alice that cover a method of settling trades between investors in financial markets by using a neutral middleman. That approach has been used by traders for hundreds of years. That is why, Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said "that merely requiring generic computer implementation fails to transform that abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention."
In the last two decades, as the technology industry has grown, the number of patents granted by the Patent and Trademark Office every year has nearly tripled. But many of them, like the four Alice patents, should never have been granted. This ruling should make it easier for lower courts to strike down similarly weak patents.
Getting Paid for Overtime
In March, President Obama instructed the Labor Department to update federal rules on who is eligible for overtime pay. An important and needed change is to raise the salary threshold above which salaried workers are not guaranteed time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week. That level is currently a paltry $455 a week; it would be $984 a week if it simply had been adjusted for inflation since 1975, when the rules were last substantially revised.
This week, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and eight Democratic co-sponsors introduced a bill to gradually raise the salary threshold to $1,090 a week and to index it to inflation after that. At that level, nearly half of salaried workers would be eligible for overtime, which is fair and reasonable. In 1975, 65 percent of salaried workers were eligible for overtime pay; today, after nearly 40 years of erosion, only 12 percent qualify. Even if the bill doesn't become law, it shows the Labor Department where it should aim in updating the rules.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- THE Federal Reserve is poised to keep purchasing large volumes of mortgage bonds, and potentially Treasury securities too, even after the likely conclusion of its prominent bond-buying program later this year.
It is a prospect that reflects both the breadth of the Fed's campaign to stimulate the economy -- one initiative ending, others still running -- and the concern among many Fed officials that the central bank should not pull back too quickly.
The Fed is gradually curtailing the expansion of its enormous portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, from $85 billion a month last year to $35 billion a month starting in July. It plans to end the expansion by the end of the year.
At the same time, however, the Fed reinvests billions of dollars from maturing securities -- about $16 billion each month this year -- to maintain the size of its holdings.
The Fed once planned to stop reinvesting, allowing its holdings to dwindle, soon after it ended the expansion of the portfolio. In 2011, the Fed said this would be its first signal that it was winding down the stimulus campaign. But there is growing support among Fed officials to preserve the portfolio's size instead.
"Ending reinvestments as an initial step risks inadvertently bringing forward any tightening of financial conditions, as this might foreshadow the impending lift-off date for rates in a manner inconsistent with the committee's intention," William C. Dudley, the influential president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said last month.
Continuing to reinvest could also help to keep borrowing costs low.
Fed officials generally argue that the effect of bond buying on the economy is determined by the Fed's total holdings, not its monthly purchases. In this view, reinvestment would preserve the effect of the stimulus campaign.
By contrast, some analysts and academics see the flow of purchases as more important. A 2013 analysis by Arvind Krishnamurthy, an economist at Northwestern University, and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, found that buying bonds was beneficial, while holding bonds mattered little. In this view, reinvestment would provide a continuing jolt to the economy.
In either case, the benefits would be relatively modest in the short term, because the volume of reinvestment is likely to reach a low point in the next year, even as the Fed's holdings -- now more than $4 trillion -- remain at a historic high.
The Fed in recent years has almost completely replaced its inventory of short-term government debt with longer-term securities that do not begin to mature until 2016. It has reinvested just $332 million in Treasuries so far this year, and would need to reinvest just $4 billion in 2015, according to calculations by Lou Crandall, chief economist for Wrightson ICAP, a financial research firm in New Jersey.
Reinvestment of mortgage bonds is also in decline. The Fed received and reinvested about $24 billion a month as borrowers refinanced loans or sold homes in 2013. But as interest rates have ticked upward, prepayments have declined. Reinvestment averaged $16 billion a month during the first six months of 2014, and Mr. Crandall estimates that the volume will stabilize a little below that level next year.
"The numbers are not zero, and it's still important because they're very mindful of the signaling effect of their operations," he said. "But for 2015, it's largely symbolic."
That would change, however, in early 2016. Mr. Crandall calculates that $39 billion in Treasuries will mature in February that year, and about $177 billion during the rest of the year. Reinvesting those amounts would have a significant effect, he said.
Among Fed officials, the debate over reinvestment has become a proxy for the broader debate about how quickly the Fed should end its stimulus campaign. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies, including Mr. Dudley, see clear evidence that low borrowing costs can still help to improve the pace of growth, and they have sought to extend the Fed's stimulus campaign accordingly.
Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a strong proponent of the stimulus, suggested this month that the Fed could taper its reinvestments just as it has gradually slowed the expansion of its portfolio.
"If the economy was substantially stronger or substantially weaker than was expected, the reinvestment program would need adjustment," he said.
Officials also have come to accept the bond holdings as a fact of life. In 2011, when the Fed first described its exit plans -- which at the time it expected to enact much more quickly -- officials believed that reducing the Fed's bond holdings was a necessary step to maintain control of inflation. They now insist other tools will serve the purpose, and that the size of the balance sheet doesn't really matter.
John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said at a news conference last month that the reinvestment issue was simply "not that important" and that changing the policy would just create a distraction.
"My view is that we want to keep the communication as clear as possible," he said.
Indeed, some officials argue that raising short-term interest rates may be a more important measure to prepare for future downturns than reducing the Fed's bond holdings.
Already, the current recovery has run longer than the average period of growth between recessions since the Great Depression. And with short-term rates near zero, the Fed has little ability to respond if the economy falters.
"It would be desirable to get off the zero lower bound in order to regain some monetary policy flexibility," Mr. Dudley said in a speech last month before the New York Association for Business Economics. "In my opinion, this is far more important than the consequences of the balance sheet being a little larger for a little longer."

Abstract: The central bank is ready to begin large-scale asset purchases if it becomes clear that the euro zone economy faces "a protracted period of low inflation and economic stagnation," Vítor Constâncio, the vice president of the central bank, said, according to the text of a speech delivered at a conference in Athens.

Full text:   LUXEMBOURG -- The International Monetary Fund on Thursday said that if inflation continued to drag, the euro zone's central bank could do more to invigorate the economy by buying government bonds and other financial assets.
Such a program would in effect emulate the Federal Reserve's stimulus efforts. The I.M.F., in its annual report on the euro-currency union, also criticized its rules for managing national budgets as complicated and poorly enforced -- even as some member nations continue to call for greater leeway.
The stimulus recommendation from the I.M.F., which included a presentation Thursday evening by the fund's managing director, Christine Lagarde, was made here at a meeting of finance ministers from the 18-country euro zone. It aligned the fund with a chorus of economists urging more aggressive action to stimulate the euro zone's barely growing economy and address its troublingly low levels of inflation.
"If inflation remains stubbornly low, the E.C.B. should consider a large-scale asset purchase program, primarily of sovereign assets," the report said. This "would boost confidence, improve corporate and household balance sheets, and stimulate bank lending," it said.
The fund, in other words, may be calling for the European Central Bank to engage in a stimulus program similar to the Federal Reserve's so-called quantitative easing in the United States -- a big bond-buying program that the Fed is only slowly ending.
Asked during a news conference what was meant by "stubbornly low," Ms. Lagarde said it applied when measures taken to fight weak inflation were "not operative." Low meant "obviously way below" the 2 percent inflation rate target and "it seems to us we are currently in that zone," she said.
A top official of the European Central Bank, speaking Thursday in Athens, expressed a willingness by the bank to follow Ms. Lagarde's advice, though perhaps not as quickly as she would like.
The central bank is ready to begin large-scale asset purchases if it becomes clear that the euro zone economy faces "a protracted period of low inflation and economic stagnation," Vítor Constâncio, the vice president of the central bank, said, according to the text of a speech delivered at a conference in Athens.
"The E.C.B. stands ready to deploy additional unconventional instruments, should the likelihood of this scenario increase," Mr. Constâncio said. "The policy response would involve a broad-based asset-purchase program."
Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, has previously said that asset purchases were an option.
Mr. Constâncio's remarks Thursday were perhaps the most explicit declaration yet of the bank's willingness to emulate the Fed's program. He suggested that the central bank could find a way to introduce quantitative easing in the euro zone despite the lack of any pan-European government bond analogous to the United States Treasury securities purchased by the Fed.
Some economists have questioned whether, because of the fragmented bond market, it would even be possible to conduct quantitative easing in Europe.
"The experience of other countries with such programs testifies that they can be effectively designed," Mr. Constâncio said.
But Mr. Constâncio added that he saw only a "low probability" that an extended period of stagnation and low inflation would occur. And he cautioned that asset purchases by the central bank would be effective only if governments also took steps to improve the performance of their economies.
His remarks implied that, in return for stimulus action, the European Central Bank might demand that countries like France pursue economic changes the bank considers long overdue.
Another issue at the ministers meeting in Luxembourg was whether the bloc's budget rules remain so rigid that they actually damage growth.
Some governments and leaders are skeptical of the benefits of deficit limits and the push for austerity in recent years. Those leaders are seeking to reopen the issue with the backing of the Socialist group in the newly elected European Parliament.
The push for changing European Union policies to do more to promote growth appeared to be gaining traction on Thursday amid suggestions by diplomats and European officials that left-leaning European leaders could meet on Saturday in Paris with President François Hollande of France to discuss the issue, according to a report by Reuters.
Those leaders, who could include the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, would be likely to make broader support for anti-austerity policies a precondition of supporting Jean-Claude Juncker to lead the European Commission, when European Union leaders gather for a summit meeting at the end of next week.
But that would invite a clash with Britain, which bitterly opposes the appointment of Mr. Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, on the grounds that he is too supportive of a federalist vision for Europe, and was foisted on leaders by the European Parliament.
Arriving at the meeting, Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said his government was not demanding a change to the rules. Instead, he said, "We first need to find the right rhythm for each of our member states" allowing for "an orderly decrease of the debt situation and a decrease in the deficit that take place in conditions compatible with, and even helpful to, growth."
Pier Carlo Padoan, the Italian minister for the economy and finance, also suggested that his government did not want wholesale changes. But there is "need to put in place all the instruments the E.U. already has to speed up growth and create jobs," he told reporters in Luxembourg.
Suggestions on changing the system earned a frosty reception from Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister. "The current rules offer enough flexibility," he said. "It's not necessary to change the rules -- but to follow them," he told reporters.
Ms. Lagarde, the I.M.F. head, told the news conference that the current rules need "simplification to ensure there are no differences of interpretation and to put an end to therisk of complexity." But she acknowledged that was "not something that can be done overnight."
In its report, the fund called for a "simpler framework" based on the goal of reducing debt levels.
Under European Union rules, governments in the 28-member bloc must keep their public deficit at no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product.
But France is struggling to meet a 2015 deadline to bring its deficit below that level. And Italy, whose deficit came in right at the 3 percent ceiling last year, still faces the task of devising a strategy to prune its huge debt.

Abstract: In 2004, then-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began a program called Prouni, which offers scholarships for low-income students to attend private colleges. Since taking office in 2011, President Dilma Rousseff has expanded the program and more than quadrupled the budget for subsidized student loans under a program called Fies. Some 31 percent of them received aid from Prouni scholarships or Fies student loans or both. Because the big wave of student loans began only in 2011 and those students have until 2016 to start making payments, it is not yet clear whether Brazilian college graduates will have the same problems with debt that many Americans have.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDSÃO PAULO, Brazil -- Higher education in Brazil is increasingly in the hands of profit-seeking entrepreneurs.
Although for-profit colleges have faced scrutiny in the United States, the industry is finding a warm welcome here as the government tries to meet the demand for affordable higher education.
From 2002 to 2012, the number of students attending college in Brazil doubled to seven million. Still, with only 17 percent of Brazilians aged 18 to 24 in college, there is a gap that needs to be served. The government has pledged to raise that percentage to 33 percent by 2020.
To serve that lucrative and growing market, American and Brazilian private equity funds, corporations and investment banks are buying and merging educational institutions at a rapid pace.
Education experts caution that the emphasis on the business aspect of education does not always put students first. Despite such concerns, the for-profit system has proved appealing for a government with limited resources.
"The government has had no choice but to work with the private sector. It cannot meet the demand on its own," Fernando Iunes, global head of investment banking for Brazil's Itaú BBA, said.
Brazil's public universities are still considered the country's best for their prestige and quality of research. And tuition is free at public universities.
But its students come disproportionally from the country's upper class, and generous research budgets and unionized work forces make the cost per student three and a half times as much as at private colleges.
Private sector investment in technical, primary and high school education in Brazil is also growing. The British firm Pearson last December bought Multi, a chain of foreign-language schools, in a deal worth more than $880 million in cash and debt assumption. Avenues, a New York private school whose investors include the private equity firms Liberty Partners and LLR Partners, has announced plans to open campuses in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
Over the last five years, mergers and acquisitions have made some of the biggest chains bigger, concentrating power in giant for-profit groups. The 10 largest chains of colleges in Brazil now educate nearly 35 percent of the country's students.
Brazil's two largest chains of higher education institutions -- Kroton Educacional and Anhanguera Educacional -- received approval from antitrust authorities in May for a merger. Both companies trade on the São Paulo stock exchange, and the merger will create the world's largest publicly traded for-profit higher education company, worth more than $8 billion.
The universities of the merged company will have more than a million students. Among those is Claudinei Mota, a mathematics student at Uniban, part of the Anhanguera group, who got a government-sponsored loan to help pay his tuition of 400 reais, or $180, a month.
"I wouldn't be able to study without it," he said.
He hopes to find a job as a math teacher, which would let him repay his loan and continue studying to become a university professor.
Mr. Mota's college debt will total about 16,200 reais, including interest, if he takes nine years to repay his loans (public schoolteachers make about 3,000 reais a month in São Paulo).
"I would have preferred a public university, but the entrance exams are very competitive. Most spots go to private school graduates, who are better prepared," Mr. Mota said.
Since 2003, the left-leaning Workers' Party has governed Brazil. Despite occasionally antagonistic relations with the business sector, the government receives only praise from education entrepreneurs.
In 2004, then-President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began a program called Prouni, which offers scholarships for low-income students to attend private colleges. Since taking office in 2011, President Dilma Rousseff has expanded the program and more than quadrupled the budget for subsidized student loans under a program called Fies.
The subsidized loans carry an annual interest rate of 3.4 percent -- an extraordinary bargain in a country where inflation is more than 6 percent and banks often charge over 40 percent interest on personal loans -- and students can wait until 18 months after graduation to begin repayment.
About 5.3 million of Brazil's seven million college students were in private institutions in 2013. Some 31 percent of them received aid from Prouni scholarships or Fies student loans or both.
Because the big wave of student loans began only in 2011 and those students have until 2016 to start making payments, it is not yet clear whether Brazilian college graduates will have the same problems with debt that many Americans have.
João Carlos Santos, senior education sector analyst with the Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual, said the big companies worked with the government to expand the subsidized student loans.
"That gave them an additional advantage over smaller groups, which couldn't influence the process, and it accelerated consolidation in the sector," Mr. Santos said.
This government support has helped financiers reap handsome returns on their investments in for-profit education. The American private equity firm Advent International bought a 28 percent stake in Kroton in 2009, enough to give it joint control alongside Kroton's founders. It installed a new chief executive, guided the firm through seven acquisitions and multiplied its student body by 11-fold before selling its shares last year. The Brazilian private equity firm Pátria Investments performed a similar role in the country's second-largest chain, Anhanguera, and GP Investments did so for the third-largest chain of colleges, Estácio.
Advent bought its stake in Kroton for $141 million in 2009. When Advent sold it last year, that stake was worth about $1 billion.
Another large player is Laureate Education, a privately held American education company whose owners include the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the investor George Soros, Paul G. Allen's Vulcan Capital and the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors (now renamed Point72 Asset Management).
Laureate has made 12 acquisitions since it entered Brazil in 2005. It now has more than 200,000 students in the country.
"It is hard to find another country in which the government is working so hard, in cooperation with the private sector, to expand access to higher education," said José Roberto Loureiro, president of Laureate's Brazil operations.
The International Finance Corporation, a branch of the World Bank that invests in projects that reduce poverty and encourage development, is also backing the industry. The I.F.C. is invested in Laureate and several other for-profit college chains in Brazil.
Patrick Leahy, an I.F.C. senior manager for Latin America, said that even if these chains did not always offer the most prestigious degrees, they did give students skills and qualifications at an affordable price that permits them to move up the employment ladder. College graduates in Brazil earn on average 2.6 times as much as high school graduates.
"The system is not perfect, but it is unquestionably a success," Mr. Leahy said.
Laureate is still looking to make more deals, Mr. Loureiro said, and other mergers are happening at a rapid clip.
Mr. Loureiro acknowledged that for-profit colleges could not compete with Brazil's public universities with their "endless budgets," but he insisted that they improved the quality of education at the colleges that they acquired.
Eight out of the nine Laureate colleges that Brazil's Ministry of Education measured from 2009 to 2012 improved their rankings on national standardized tests after Laureate bought them.
But Nelson Cardoso Amaral, a professor of education at the Federal University of Goiás in midwestern Brazil, cautioned that the test measures might not tell the whole story. Mr. Amaral said the big for-profit chains had merely proved that they knew how to "teach to the tests," not that they were necessarily educating their students well.
"Government supervision of private colleges is very weak," he said. "We don't have enough data to accurately judge the education they are offering."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Correction: June 23, 2014, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about efforts by private investors to make money from the for-profit education sector in Brazil misstated the surname of an education sector analyst with BTG Pactual. He is João Carlos Santos, not Santana. A picture caption with the article also rendered the name of a Brazilian city incorrectly. As the dateline correctly noted, it is São Paulo, not São Paolo.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve on Wednesday sharply cut its economic forecast for 2014 even as it said the economy had bounced back after a nasty winter, allowing the central bank, in its view, to continue to retreat from its stimulus campaign.
A mélange of policy documents and public remarks by the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, carried the message that the Fed expected the recovery to maintain its slow and steady pace, and affirmed that the Fed intended an equally slow and steady retreat from its supporting role.
The Fed announced, as expected, that it would cut monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in July, to $35 billion, and that it still planned to end purchases this fall. It also affirmed that it is likely to start raising its benchmark interest rate next year.
"Growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months," the Fed said in a statement after a two-day meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. It said labor markets, household spending and business investment were all improving.
There are "many good reasons" to expect faster growth going forward, Ms. Yellen said at a news conference after the statement was released. But she tempered that optimism by noting that Fed officials expect that damage from the recession will continue to weigh on the pace of recovery.
Ms. Yellen said she was particularly concerned that some people who had been unable to find work would be permanently excluded from the job market.
"It is conceivable that there is some permanent damage to them, to their own well-being, to their families' well-being and to the economy's potential," Ms. Yellen said, echoing a concern increasingly prevalent among economic policy makers.
At the same time, Ms. Yellen sought to emphasize that the Fed regarded its forecasts as uncertain and its plans as malleable. Officials are concerned investors have grown too complacent about the trajectory of monetary policy and the economy.
David Wessel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that Ms. Yellen "looked for ways to feather the word 'uncertainty' into almost every answer."
"She ticked off an impressive list of reasons why the U.S. economy should be doing better in the months ahead," he wrote in an analysis on the Brookings website. "But she knows the Fed has been consistently over-optimistic about economic growth, and she didn't exude confidence."
The Fed offered little information about the question most on the minds of investors: What comes next, after the central bank ends its bond-buying campaign later this year?
The aggregated forecasts of Fed officials, published Wednesday, showed a small increase in the average expected level of the Fed's benchmark interest rate at the end of 2015 and 2016. The median for 2015 rose to 1.2 percent from 1.125 percent, but it was not clear that the change reflected a forward creep in the views of Fed officials about the timing of a first rate increase from the level close to zero at which the Fed has maintained the rate since late 2008. The change is slight, and the documents do not indicate whether it is Ms. Yellen and her allies who changed their views.
Comparisons were also complicated by shifts in the committee's membership, as two members left and two new arrivals submitted forecasts for the first time.
Twelve of the 16 participants said they expected a first rate increase in 2015. Investors generally share that expectation, but Ms. Yellen, who appeared to affirm that timing at her last news conference, avoided a repeat on Wednesday. Asked about the meaning of the Fed's statement that it would raise interest rates "a considerable time" after it stops buying bonds, she said the timing depended on the path the economy follows in the months ahead.
"While the Fed chair has tried to downplay those projections, they are consistent with Fed officials generally becoming at least a bit less dovish as unemployment continues to decline," Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
Other analysts saw less meaning in the movement, however, and markets continue to price in a somewhat later and slower increase in rates.
"The dots are likely biased upward by the more 'hawkish' members of the F.O.M.C., with the consensus likely more dovish," Michael Dolega, senior economist at TD Bank Group, wrote in a note to clients.
The Fed was more forthcoming about its economic views. Officials estimated that the economy would expand 2.1 percent to 2.3 percent this year, down from a March forecast for growth of 2.8 percent to 3.0 percent. It is the seventh straight year that the optimism of the Fed's initial forecasts has been gradually eroded by disappointing data.
They also estimated that the economy in the long term would grow at a rate of 2.1 percent to 2.3 percent, markedly below their expectations just a few years ago. They continued to predict, however, that growth in 2015 and 2016 would exceed that average, topping 3 percent for the first time since the recession.
Most Fed officials remained sanguine about inflation, making only small changes to their predictions that inflation will remain at or below 2 percent through 2016.
Ms. Yellen also said concerns about financial stability were not playing a major role in the timing of the retreat. "I don't see the kinds of broad trends that would suggest to me that the level of financial stability risks has risen above a moderate level," she said.
Some economists share the Fed's guarded optimism. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said he saw signs of gathering momentum, including increased lending by banks and borrowing by consumers.
"The real stimulus comes when the free market starts to stimulate, and that is happening now," Mr. Paulsen said. He worries, however, that the Fed is underestimating the potential for faster inflation, a concern also shared by some Fed officials, who have continued to press for the Fed to accelerate the pacing of its retreat.
The Fed's board held an unannounced meeting Tuesday, before the full policy-making committee convened, to discuss "medium-term monetary policy issues." The board, which comprises the governors based in Washington, but not the presidents of the regional reserve banks, held a similar meeting in April. The meetings are a reflection of Ms. Yellen's deliberative leadership style, the complexity of the internal debate -- and perhaps the need to bring new officials up to speed.
The policy-making committee has added three new voters since its last meeting in April. The Senate confirmed Stanley Fischer as the Fed's vice chairman and Lael Brainard as a new member of the board; Both were sworn into office on Monday. Loretta J. Mester, the new president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, also attended her first meeting and exercised the vote Cleveland holds this year.

Full text:   The Federal Reserve is expected to conclude its two-day meeting on Wednesday afternoon with another $10 billion scale-back of its monthly bond purchases. At that pace, the bond-buying program -- an effort to stimulate the economy by lowering long-term interest rates -- will be over by December at the latest.
Unfortunately, the slow and steady withdrawal of stimulus has not been accompanied by a slow and steady improvement in economic conditions. Rather, since the economy emerged from recession in mid-2009, growth has averaged a sluggish 2 percent or so -- year in and year out.
That is not to fault the Fed for winding down the bond purchases. The point of the program is to propel growth, so if growth is not accelerating, the program has run its course. Besides, the Fed is not giving up. By all indications, it will not begin to raise the current near-zero short-term rates until at least the middle of next year.
In that light, the Fed's moves are less about confidence in the economy and more about the limits of its present tools to change conditions. When the Fed met in April, for example, the government's initial estimate of growth in the first quarter of 2014 was an anemic 0.1 percent, which the Fed attributed to the rough winter. Since then, the initial estimate has been revised downward, to a contraction of 1 percent.
The final estimate, to be released at the end of June, is expected to be worse still. Even if growth rebounds as projected, overall economic performance for the year would still end up around 2 percent. That is not a cause for optimism.
Even signs of life that the Federal Reserve and its chairwoman, Janet Yellen, have identified as vital to a real recovery -- modestly higher inflation and a stronger job market -- are not as reassuring as they appear. For instance, inflation over the past year recently clocked in at 2.1 percent, a level the Fed aims for. But, at that rate, hourly and weekly pay for private-sector American workers has fallen over the past year, by 0.1 percent, after adjusting for inflation.
In a normal business cycle, low interest rates are usually enough to generate sufficient demand to boost economic growth to its historical average of roughly 3 percent. But there is nothing normal about the present cycle. The Fed has extracted about all the juice it can from low rates and continues to squeeze. It could also spur investment by tolerating higher inflation than its 2 percent target. But the basic problem -- spurring demand on the part of consumers and borrowers -- is outside its purview.
Only Congress can provide the extra dollars for that, but lawmakers have been unwilling or unable to take action, even just to provide basics like federal unemployment benefits or highway and bridge repair. Given that failure to act, it is a wonder the economy has managed to grow at 2 percent.
To assume that it will continue to do so or that it will fully recover without the government sector engaging in a meaningful way is to hope against evidence.

A Small Increase in Inflation Squeezes U.S. Workers

Abstract: There had been some hints here and there that worker pay was starting to rise in the last few months, including anecdotal reports of employers having to offer raises to recruit or retain workers and a few pieces of data hinting that the trend was taking effect broadly.

Links: http://findit.library.jhu.edu/resolve?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Anytimes&amp;atitle=A+Small+Increase+in+Inflation+Squeezes+U.S.+Workers%3A+%5BBusiness%2FFinancial+Desk%5D&amp;title=New+York+Times&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=2014-06-18&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=B.3&amp;au=Irwin%2C+Neil&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/

Full text:   The latest economic data out Tuesday morning was generally good. Home building activity remained above the one million a year rate. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May, such that inflation over the last year is now 2.1 percent, about in line with what the Federal Reserve aims for.
But that inflation news carried with it a depressing side note. Now that the Consumer Price Index for May has been published, it is possible to determine inflation-adjusted hourly earnings for the month. And the number is not good.
Average hourly earnings for private sector American workers rose about 49 cents an hour over the last year, to $24.38 in May. But that wasn't enough to cover inflation over the year, so in real or inflation-adjusted terms, hourly worker pay fell 0.1 percent over the last 12 months. Weekly pay shows the same story, also falling 0.1 percent in the year ended in May.
Pause for just a second to consider that. Five years after the economic recovery began, American workers have gone the last 12 months without any real increase in what they are paid.
There had been some hints here and there that worker pay was starting to rise in the last few months, including anecdotal reports of employers having to offer raises to recruit or retain workers and a few pieces of data hinting that the trend was taking effect broadly.
By the same measure cited above -- average hourly earnings for private sector workers -- the year that ended in February showed a strong 2.1 percent gain in pay versus only 1.1 percent inflation, which works out to a 1 percent annual gain in real hourly pay. That was the strongest in five years, and if it had been sustained would have been great news for American workers.
But it was not sustained. The numbers since then suggest two things: The strong gain in hourly pay reported for the 12 months ended in February looks to have been an anomaly. And while inflation has picked up since then, reducing the value of workers' paychecks, worker pay has only barely kept up with the higher prices.
The latest numbers should give pause to any Federal Reserve officials who see wage pressures as evidence that the economy is overheating. It might have been arguably true earlier in the year. It might prove true later in the year, if workers start successfully demanding wage increases in excess of inflation.
But for right now, the evidence points to more of what we've seen for most of the last six years: Employees have little negotiating power to demand higher pay.

Full text:   MOSCOW -- The event in Moscow last week was billed as an expert discussion, not a political one, on Ukraine's future. But Sergei Y. Glazyev, an economic adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin with a distinctive Stalinist bent, unleashed some rather overtly political remarks.
"Those Nazis were educated by the United States," he said about Kiev's newly elected government. "The Americans are clearly fanning a war between Russia and Europe."
Across town, in an arty cafe adorned with contemporary friezes of cavorting Greco-Roman couples, an entirely different discourse unspooled.
There, a panel of Russian and Ukrainian intellectuals was supposedly discussing the conflict's negative ripples. The moderators broached topics like Russia's "tele-fascism," or the idea that Ukraine is looking to the future while Russia is mired in the past.
But panelists interrupted with various lengthy diatribes, like the Ukrainian poet determined to repeat her earlier performance of screaming "MAIDAN!" into the microphone a lot. (Maidan is, of course, the main square in Kiev, where the protest movement that toppled Ukraine's government in February arose.)
Ukraine continues to dominate public discourse in Russia. Nothing else really competes. Not perennial public concerns like inadequate housing. Not thorny political issues like the new law allowing the government to designate nongovernmental organizations as "foreign agents," replacing the previous version of registering themselves.
In this country of unapologetic smokers, not even a ban on lighting up indoors that went into effect this month dented Ukraine's predominance.
Various factors fuel all the attention. First, naturally, is the worry that a full-blown war could erupt out of the skirmishing just across the border, with the Russian military involved overtly or covertly. Second is the sense that the fates of the two countries are intertwined, rooted in a shared history and culture, as well as myriad family ties.
Third, and perhaps most telling, the March annexation of Crimea put most Russians in a euphoric mood that has not diminished. The fact that the annexation has infused the public with a sense of greatness they had lost sent Mr. Putin's favorability ratings soaring above 80 percent month after month, and the government itself keeps its focus firmly on Ukraine.
His political allies are ecstatic. The high rating "means that it is unfashionable not to support the president," said Olga Timofeyeva, a Putin ally in Parliament.
Others are more sanguine. "It is not a rating for Putin; it is the rating for Putin's decision to annex Crimea," said Alexei Venediktov, the editor in chief of Ekho Moskvy, a radio station among the shrinking public outlets for opposition voices.
Behind the euphoria lies the worrying question about how to defuse the Ukraine crisis. The conflict has deepened over the past couple of days with the downing of a Ukrainian military transport plane, killing almost 50 people, and with accusations from the United States and Ukraine that Russia dispatched a few tanks across the border. Moscow denied sending tanks.
On the eventual outcome, the government line -- granting some measure of autonomy for the East and protecting the Russian language -- dominates the discussion.
These days, any Ukraine discussion is often accompanied by thinly disguised anger that a week after his June 7 inauguration, President Petro O. Poroshenko has not halted the offensive of the Ukrainian security forces against the separatists.
"They are trying to take a multilingual, multicultural society and build it into a monolithic, monolingual country," Alexander Voloshin, Mr. Putin's former chief of staff, told a civil society forum.
"They are trying to turn it into a country of ethnic Ukrainians," he said, rather than negotiate the compromises needed to end the crisis.
Despite the simmering conflict next door, experts of all stripes note a distinctive shift in mood that remains firmly in place three months after Crimea's annexation. Ukraine and its Western allies condemn the annexation as illegal, but there is no sign anyone is trying to get Crimea back.
"Today, there is a kind of renaissance, people are feeling that their country is strong again, but it is not about aggression," said Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a sociologist who specializes in studying Russia's political elite. "After the Soviet Union collapsed, we were losing territories -- losing and losing and losing. Now, Crimea is a symbol that we have stopped losing, we are gaining."
Even habitual critics of things Russian tend to root for the home team on this one.
For Artemy Lebedev, the founder of a cutting-edge design firm who has never been shy about criticizing what he laments as Russia's lack of professionalism, Crimea was different -- fast and bloodless.
"Maybe they used someone from Hollywood who told them what the army of the future should look like," he said in an interview, echoing remarks on his blog about how sharp, fit, polite and just downright good looking those soldiers were.
Mr. Lebedev garnered some abuse online from Putin opponents, but he said his feelings were about pride and achievement, not endorsing the president. "I was born in the U.S.S.R., and I felt bitter when 14 different countries split off from my country," he wrote. "It is just that it happened a long time ago, and everyone got used to it."
Members of the young generation who oppose Mr. Putin said they had learned to shut up about it, at least in public, because of the prevailing bliss.
Even the sense that Crimea is going to cost Russians a fortune has not dampened the public mood. For example, cost estimates for the Kerch Strait bridge that will ultimately become the first land link to Russia have risen repeatedly to more than $8 billion. While noting recently that those funds would have to be siphoned off from other projects, Alexei Kudrin, the former finance minister, said, "The price is something that I think the society is willing to pay."
Crimea crops up everywhere, not just in political debates.
One company introduced a new chocolate bar this month called "Crimea. Just Try to Take It." The wrapper shows a superhero dressed in the colors of the Russian flag. Customers mobbed a department store in Moscow that started selling T-shirts last week glorifying Mr. Putin and the annexation.
In the southern city of Krasnodar, the fable of Little Red Riding Hood was rewritten for a stage production as a parable about the annexation with Crimea as the wee heroine, Russia as granny and the United States as (want to guess?) the big, bad wolf.
Mr. Putin brings up Crimea often. On Thursday, Russia's national day, he said: "This year, we celebrate our national holiday with a special mood, special elation. Crimea and Sevastopol have returned to Russia, to their Motherland."
Yet amid the elation, pollsters also note rising concerns about Ukraine. The number of Russians who support the annexation of southeastern Ukraine dropped to less than a quarter from about 60 percent right after the acquisition of Crimea, said Lev Gudkov, the Levada Center director. Several factors were behind that, including modest inflation prompted partly by sanctions.
Mr. Putin's high ratings are undoubtedly linked to the relentless propaganda across state-controlled television that still flogs annexing Crimea as a historic feat. But that campaign also echoes public sentiment.
"Propaganda does not work unless people want to believe it," Mr. Gudkov said. "They fully understand that it is propaganda, but at the same time, they enjoy this imperialistic rhetoric, so they play along. Most people we ask say that his main victory is that he managed to restore Russia's reputation as a world power."
War-inflated enthusiasm is notoriously soft, and Mr. Gudkov and others are not quite sure what might sustain the current mood. "I don't think the euphoria will last," he said.

Full text:   A Shrinking, Shifting Middle Class
The downturn hit hard at industries that employ middle-wage workers, particularly those categories with large concentrations of men, and the subsequent recovery has done little to improve their position. More than 1.5 million construction jobs, paying wages of $55,120, on average, are still missing.
The manufacturing sector, which pays an average of $51,480 a year, has regained several hundred thousand jobs in the last couple of years but now employs 1.7 million fewer workers than it did before the recession.
By contrast, the health care sector has continued to thrive, expanding its role as a leading employer at all salary levels and emerging as the backbone of an evolving new middle class. Home services and outpatient centers grew the most, as the American population aged and health services shifted away from hospitals to less expensive ways of delivering care. And while the growth has slowed under pressure to keep costs down, health care services have added 1.5 million jobs and are expected to expand further.
Over all, industries whose average salaries are in the middle of the wage spectrum have shrunk by 2.5 million jobs.
Lost Jobs, Missing Workers, Stagnant Wages
After a long climb from the valley, the number of jobs has finally reached the previous peak of January 2008, with gains of more than 8.5 million jobs since early 2010. Still, the working-age population has grown substantially in the last six years, and the nation's economy, by reliable estimates, is at least seven million jobs below its potential. That has cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in lost output.
With the weak recovery from the recession, more than four million people are still considered among the long-term unemployed, out of work for at least half a year. They face considerably dimmer prospects of finding another job as their skills deteriorate and their contact with the world of work fades.
And that does not count the more than six million who have opted out of the labor force altogether, even taking into account demographic factors like the aging of the population.
Economists hope that many such people will be lured back to work as business improves and that wages will rise as the labor market tightens. But for now, the slack in the economy has served to hold down pay; wages for roughly four-fifths of American workers have declined since 2007, after adjusting for inflation.
Industrial Ruin and Revival
Since the end of World War II, every recession has eliminated factories and cut jobs in manufacturing. But the most recent downturn was one of the worst, leaving the American economy with only about 12 million people working for manufacturing industries, 8.7 percent of the total number on payrolls.
By contrast, after a steep two-year drop that began in 2008, the total value of what the country makes is now back to where it was in 2007. As a result, companies doing business in the United States are producing their cars, airplanes, computer chips, turbines, household appliances and most everything else at fewer factories with many fewer workers.
That efficiency and high productivity provide many benefits. But because manufacturing jobs tend to pay better than those at retailers and restaurants -- two sectors that have led the job expansion after the recession -- the loss of so many factory positions is an important reason for the erosion of middle-wage jobs.
Manufacturing has recaptured a bit of momentum recently, with lower energy prices, a recovering auto industry and the return of some overseas production lifting employment by 600,000 from the trough four years ago.
While there will be bumps along the road, American industry will probably continue on the path of greater production of more valuable and sophisticated goods, relying on a shrinking share of the total work force.
Employment Is Back Where It Started, but Not All Industries Fared the Same
Not all industries recovered equally over the past five years. Those that paid wages in the middle of the economic spectrum fared the worst over all, while low-paying industries hired the most during the recovery. Fast-food restaurants -- which pay less than $22,000 a year, on average -- added more jobs than nearly any other industry. Several high-paying areas also helped drive the recovery, including oil and gas extraction, computer programming, consulting, doctor's offices and investment firms.
For Many Americans, Not Much of a Recovery
While the richest Americans have generally recouped their losses from the recession and gained considerable new wealth during the recovery, the situation is bleaker for the poor and for low-wage workers than it was in 2007.
As work dried up and wages stagnated, tens of millions of Americans took jobs with lower pay and fewer hours, many of them turning to the federal government for additional support to help make ends meet.
The number of people receiving food stamps under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program soared to 47.6 million in 2013 from 26.3 million in 2007. Incomes for the typical middle-income family have slipped, and the nation's poverty rate remains above its prerecession level.
In Housing, a Puzzling New Normal
The collapse of the mortgage-fueled housing bubble was the central cause of the recession. Although housing's revival over the last couple of years has helped stabilize the economy, the sector will probably never again contribute as much to economic activity as it did during the boom years of the early 2000s.
Moreover, after scraping along the bottom for so long, it's not clear what a normal housing industry would look like. Prices have rebounded, builders are breaking ground on new developments, foreclosures have dwindled and households are forming once more. But almost one in five homeowners with mortgages owe more than their homes are worth.
Even after double-digit price increases, houses are still about 15 percent below their peak value, on average. The situation varies widely across the country, however, with energy-rich states like Texas and North Dakota surpassing their old peaks while those that were hit hardest, like Nevada and Florida, still far from their previous highs.
Benefiting From an Energy Bonanza
Even as much of American industry was suffering through the recession and anemic recovery, energy production was undergoing a stunning boom.
The middle of the country has been the prime beneficiary. Bolstered by hydraulic fracturing and other unconventional drilling methods, oil and natural gas output has surged, enriching traditional energy states like Texas as well as newer ones like North Dakota. (The effect can be seen in the map below, showing the change in all private employment by county.) Alternative energy sources like wind and solar have also gained.
Since 2007, employment in the oil and gas drilling business has surged by 60,000, to nearly 210,000, the highest level since "Dallas" was a hot television show in the 1980s and J.R. Ewing epitomized the swashbuckling oilmen of that time.
The combination of increased energy production and lower consumption, driven in part by efficiency gains, has led to much improvement in the country's trade balance. Cheap natural gas has been a lifeline for manufacturers struggling to compete with overseas rivals; it has helped revive production in energy-intensive industries like chemicals and plastics.
Thriving Technology Proves a Magnet for Talent
As much of the rest of the economy clawed its way out of the recession, the technology industry emerged relatively unscathed. Today, it is thriving.
Social networking companies like Twitter and Facebook were just getting up and running in the years before the recession. Apple introduced its iPhone less than a year before the official start of the economic downturn in December 2007, setting off a wave of purchases of smartphones that have since come to dominate the market for mobile phones.
These technology companies, along with hundreds of others, generally managed to power through the hard times and have since emerged as prime drivers of the economy, creating tremendous wealth for a number of individuals and adding many well-paying jobs.
Silicon Valley, with its initial public offerings and billion-dollar acquisitions, isn't showing any signs of slowing down. And those high-tech companies that capitalize on social media, cloud computing and big data are so appealing that they have even been luring business school graduates away from high-paying Wall Street jobs.

Full text:   It should surprise no one that the federal Highway Trust Fund is on the brink of insolvency. The 18.4 cents a gallon federal gas tax that is the fund's main source of revenue has not been raised since 1993. Since then, the population has grown by 55 million people. Roads, bridges, tunnels and public transit have not been maintained or upgraded to meet the increased demand.
And yet, once again, Congress is not only avoiding necessary tax increases, but is claiming, against all evidence, that it can raise needed revenue by cutting taxes.
Specifically, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, are pressing for a corporate "tax holiday" to raise money for the highway fund.
Under the plan, reported last week by Jonathan Weisman in The Times, American multinationals would escape taxes on 85 percent of their profits currently held in tax-deferred foreign accounts, provided they bring the money to the United States in the next year.
That would boost tax revenue by an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion in the next two years, as corporations rush to take advantage of the holiday. But after that, it would lose money -- by one government estimate, a simple tax holiday would lose $96 billion over 10 years -- because the low tax rate would be applied to profits that would have been brought home over time anyway.
An aide to Mr. Reid told The Times that complex provisions in the tax-holiday plan would ensure that it raises $3 billion over 10 years. But a tax holiday is a bad idea even if it does raise money. Such a reprieve in 2005 was disastrous, in part because it encouraged the hoarding of profits in tax-deferred foreign accounts in anticipation of future tax holidays.
Another problem is that a tax holiday is grossly unfair to companies that have no foreign presence and get no break on their tax obligations. It also worsens inequality, because profits that escape taxation during a tax holiday flow largely to shareholders and are subsequently taxed at special low rates, if at all.
There are better ways to replenish the highway fund. President Obama has recommended closing corporate tax loopholes to finance a four-year, $302 billion highway and public transit program. Contractors and unions are pressing to index the federal gas tax for inflation and impose other taxes, perhaps on tires or drivers' licenses.
There are also ways to tax foreign-held corporate profits that don't involve a tax holiday. Congress could curb tactics and incentives used by companies to shift income offshore. More directly, lawmakers could end the unlimited tax deferral on foreign-held earnings in favor of taxing profits when they are made. Unfortunately, to pass those and other appropriate revenue raisers would require common sense and political courage -- traits that Congress has yet to display.

An Upbeat View From the Bank of Japan

Full text:   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady on Friday and offered a slightly more upbeat view on overseas growth, signaling confidence that the economy was on course to meet its inflation target next year without additional stimulus.
In a separate move, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe unveiled a plan to cut the corporate tax rate below 30 percent in stages over a few years.
The central bank's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, said Japan's economy was showing signs of having weathered a sales tax increase that began in April and had been watched by economists as a risk to the recovery.
"The economy is moving roughly within our expectations," Mr. Kuroda told reporters. "Household spending remains solid as a trend."
Mr. Kuroda also noted that there were signs of clear improvement in job conditions and incomes. "We expect a gentle recovery to continue," he said.
The Bank of Japan has signaled that it has become increasingly convinced that the nation's economy will continue its modest recovery, with companies' increasing capital spending and consumer confidence's holding up despite the sales tax increase.
Sluggish exports remain a soft spot for the economy, however, although central bank officials see overseas impediments receding as China's exports rebound and as the United States economy rebuilds after a severe winter.
"Overseas economies, mainly advanced economies, are recovering, although lackluster performances are seen in some areas," the central bank said in a statement issued before Mr. Kuroda spoke. That was a slightly brighter view than last month, when it said that global growth was "starting to recover."
As widely expected, the central bank maintained its monetary policy framework, under which it has pledged to increase the base money supply each year by 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen, or $588 billion to $686 billion, through aggressive asset purchases.
Mr. Kuroda also pushed back at the European Central Bank's efforts to keep euro gains in check. "I don't think there is a reason for the yen to strengthen against the euro from the E.C.B.'s stimulus package, including negative interest rates," he said, offering the most direct remark to date on the exchange-rate effects of the European Central Bank's moves, announced this month.
Also on Friday, Mr. Abe, the Japanese prime minister, unveiled a plan to cut the corporate tax rate below 30 percent to help pull the economy out of two decades of sluggish growth and deflation.
Japan's corporate tax rate is among the highest in the world, but Mr. Abe needs to strike a balance between stimulating growth and reining in snowballing public debt, which is twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.
The corporate tax cut, which would come in stages starting in the fiscal year that begins in April, is seen as a major issue to be included in the government's key fiscal and economic policy outline, which will be completed around the end of the month along with a detailed "growth strategy" of structural overhauls.
"Japan's corporate tax rate will change into one that promotes" economic growth, Mr. Abe told reporters, adding that he hoped the lower burden on companies would lead to job creation and other improvements for private citizens.
He also said that the government would make sure that alternative revenue sources were secured to offset a decline in corporate tax revenue, but did not elaborate on what those might be.
The government said that it would decide on a concrete plan by the end of the year to secure a "permanent revenue source" needed for corporate tax cuts, like a broadened tax base. The government also reiterated that it would decide by the end of the year whether to go ahead with its plan to raise the sales tax to 10 percent in October 2015. The national sales tax rose to 8 percent from 5 percent on April 1 to help reduce the public debt.
Japan's corporate tax rate is nearly 36 percent for large companies operating in Tokyo, among the highest in the industrialized world. At the same time, only 30 percent of all Japanese companies pay corporate income tax, so bringing more companies onto the tax rolls could help offset a cut in the tax rate. Most money-losing companies are exempted from paying corporate tax, and companies can defer losses over several years, making it easier for them to avoid paying taxes.
Private-sector members of the government's top economic and fiscal council have proposed cutting the rate to 25 percent eventually to put it in line with international standards. Each percentage point of tax cut would reduce government revenue by about ¥470 billion a year, according to the Finance Ministry.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Retail sales in the United States rose less than expected in May and first-time applications for jobless benefits increased last week, according to data released on Thursday.
The Commerce Department said that retail sales gained 0.3 percent. While that was below the 0.6 percent rise expected on Wall Street, April sales were revised higher to show a 0.5 percent increase, helping to keep growth forecasts intact.
"The continued gains during the first two months of the second quarter suggest that consumers are continuing to hold their side of the bargain, building on the strong momentum at the end of the last quarter," said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Separately, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 317,000 for the week ended June 7.
Despite the rise, claims are not too far from their prerecession lows, and job growth continues at a steady clip.
The government said last week that the economy added 217,000 jobs in May, a fourth month of gains above 200,000, and has recouped all the 8.7 million jobs lost during the recession.
Along with signs of a strong expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors, the jobs data bolstered expectations for a big return to growth after a dismal first quarter in which the economy contracted at a 1.0 percent annual rate.
While a few economists trimmed their second-quarter gross domestic product estimates slightly on the retail sales data, most continue to expect a strong rebound, with growth estimates from 3 to 4 percent.
The lofty forecasts were supported by another Commerce Department report showing business inventories in April rose 0.6 percent after a 0.4 percent March gain. It was the 11th consecutive increase in stockpiles and the biggest advance since October.
For April, inventories at the wholesale level climbed 1.1 percent, while inventories held by retailers rose 0.5 percent. Stockpiles at the manufacturing level were up 0.4 percent.
Total business sales were up a solid 0.7 percent in April after a 1.1 percent rise in March, which had been the biggest monthly sales increase in 10 months.
So-called core retail sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were unchanged last month.
However, they were revised to show a 0.2 percent rise in April, instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent dip. Economists said retail sales were up at a 9.2 percent annualized pace over the last three months.
The encouraging gains are expected to prompt businesses to keep ordering more goods to restock their shelves. That rising demand should help bolster factory production and fuel the overall economy.
"This points to ongoing solid momentum in personal spending in the second quarter, which we currently peg at a rate around 3.25 percent," said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak Asset Management in New York.
In May, consumers bought automobiles, building materials and garden equipment, as well as furniture. They also shopped online. However, there were modest declines in sales at sporting goods shops, electronics and appliances stores, as well as at clothing retailers and restaurants and bars.
Another report from the Labor Department showed little signs of imported inflation, with import prices edging up 0.1 percent last month. In the 12 months through May, import prices increased 0.4 percent, advancing for the first time since July.

Full text:   KABUL, Afghanistan -- When dealing with Western officials, Ashraf Ghani presents himself as the rare technocrat who possesses both the cultural savvy and practical expertise needed to put Afghanistan back on track if he is elected president in the runoff vote on Saturday.
After all, as Mr. Ghani readily reminds people, he has written a book titled "Fixing Failed States."
But Afghan voters are less impressed by a doctorate from Columbia University, a 15-year stint at the World Bank and a penchant for conducting small talk in a vernacular best described as technocratese (think phrases like "consultative processes" and "cooperative frameworks"). The winners here are populists who cut deals with their enemies, win support from their rivals and appeal to Afghan national pride -- a reality that Mr. Ghani appears to have finally embraced after years of inhabiting the role of pro-Western intellectual.
Especially when addressing his fellow ethnic Pashtuns, Mr. Ghani, a former finance minister, has leavened his usual talk of detailed economic plans with statements about Afghans' will to resist all who seek to oppress them, from Pakistan to the Taliban to the United States.
At one rally in Kandahar, the heart of the Pashtun south and the city where the Taliban group was founded, he boasted about his role in securing the release of hundreds of insurgent suspects from what had been the main American prison in Afghanistan. The move infuriated American officials, but Mr. Ghani promised that it was just the beginning.
"We will release more prisoners," he said. "We will not allow prisoners to be used as a business commodity," he added, in an apparent reference to negotiations with the United States over their fate.
The transformation of Mr. Ghani into something akin to an Afghan populist is perhaps the most surprising story line in the Afghan presidential campaign, and he is heading into the runoff this weekend in what some observers believe is a dead heat with his rival, Abdullah Abdullah.
"He's thought deeply about what kind of presidency he would like to create," said Clare Lockhart, a former colleague of Mr. Ghani's who helped him write the book on failed states. "In general, his commitment is to have a much more shared sense of governance."
A year ago, it was hard to imagine that Mr. Ghani would make it this far. He won a mere 2.9 percent of the vote during his first run at the presidency, in 2009, and before the recent campaign, many here gave him long odds of doing much better this year.
Common themes emerged in interviews with Afghans at the time: Mr. Ghani was widely described as being too focused on policy problems and lacking a natural constituency or a common touch. Many described his temper as both short and hot, and his outbursts had alienated many powerful people during his stints as finance minister and, more recently, as President Hamid Karzai's lead adviser on the transition of security responsibility to Afghan forces from the Americans.
Even his supporters acknowledge that he can be difficult, though some try to spin his off-putting side as a positive. "He can be disempowering because he can be so smart," said one close associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid angering Mr. Ghani.
Foreign diplomats joked that Mr. Ghani would win if the only voters were foreign diplomats. And yet they, too, complained about what they described as his curt manner and unwillingness to compromise on issues that he believes he knows better than others.
"He's been more than willing to give us the back of his hand," was how one American diplomat recently put it.
To that, Mr. Ghani said he did so only when he had good reason. He knows the West too well to let American and European officials dictate how Afghanistan should be run, he said in an interview.
The son of an official in the government of Afghanistan's last king, Zahir Shah, Mr. Ghani, 65, was first introduced to the United States as a high school exchange student in Oregon. There, he also got his first taste of democracy. "There was a student council, and it had money and decision-making power!" he recalled.
He later attended the American University of Beirut, where he met his future wife, Rula, a Lebanese Christian, before earning a doctorate in anthropology and international studies from Columbia.
He eventually took a senior role at the World Bank, settling in the Washington area and becoming an American citizen in 1990. (He gave up his United States passport in 2009 to run for president.)
He returned to Afghanistan in December 2001 and soon became the finance minister in Mr. Karzai's new government. In the next years, he managed a huge influx of aid, winning praise from Western officials for doing so without bringing on high inflation. He also devised a large-scale antipoverty program and helped restore a single currency in Afghanistan, where warlords had printed their own bills during the civil war and the Taliban era.
One of those warlords was Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek and a man whom Mr. Ghani described during the 2009 campaign as being a "known killer." Now, Mr. Dostum is his chief running mate, and the Uzbek voters attracted to the ticket by Mr. Dostum's role give Mr. Ghani an important well of supporters.
Afghan officials have said that it was Mr. Karzai who arranged what may well be the oddest of Afghan political marriages. No one would confuse Mr. Dostum for a reformer, and Mr. Ghani had in the past held up the Uzbek strongman as an example of the kind of power broker Afghanistan needed to be rid of to flourish.
But that was before Mr. Ghani learned the harsh lessons of his 2009 presidential run. Asked about Mr. Dostum in a recent interview, he called him "a charismatic leader" before launching into what many here would recognize as a classic Ghani lecture, incorporating stray facts and imparting a lesson to his listener.
It began with him correcting what he saw as the misuse of the term "warlord," which he said referred to a specifically Chinese historical phenomenon.
The correct word in Afghanistan was "strongman," he said. Then he mentioned how governments in the United States and Europe had co-opted criminal elements in their formative years, and how that approach differed from the paths taken more recently by South Africa after apartheid and Rwanda after its genocide.
In Afghanistan, he concluded, "we need to find our distinctive formula."
Ethnic and factional appeals have long been a deadly force in Afghan power politics, and many Afghans have apprehensively watched the campaign this year for any sign that the candidates might prove more divisive than unifying.
One Western diplomat played down concerns about the presence of Mr. Dostum and his Uzbek power base in Mr. Ghani's campaign. More worrying, the diplomat said, are Pashtun nationalists who have flocked to Mr. Ghani, such as Muhammad Ismail Yoon, who owns a television station known for airing controversial views, and Juma Khan Hamdard, the governor of Paktia Province in eastern Afghanistan, who has called on all Pashtuns to vote for Mr. Ghani because he is one of their own.
Mr. Ghani himself has shied away from such direct appeals, though, as has Mr. Abdullah, who is part Pashtun but is strongly identified with the ethnic Tajiks of northern Afghanistan. Both have emphasized the need for national unity, even while aggressively courting their respective ethnic bases.
Still, Mr. Ghani said that he would create a third vice-presidential slot to ensure some share of power for all four of Afghanistan's main ethnic groups: Pashtuns, Hazaras, Tajiks and Uzbeks.
The Taliban, too, will have to be accommodated with an "inclusive approach," Mr. Ghani said. "But Taliban are not the only issue," he added.
A security deal needs to be signed with the United States, and "the economy is imploding," Mr. Ghani said. "The cost of corruption for the public has been estimated to be at least twice that of national revenue."
It is "not a moment for modest aims," he said, adding, "I have the experience, I have the vision and I have the credibility."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- Recessions are always painful, but the Great Recession that ran from late 2007 to the middle of 2009 may have inflicted a new kind of pain: an era of slower growth.
It has been five years since the official end of that severe economic downturn. The nation's total annual output has moved substantially above the prerecession peak, but economic growth has averaged only about 2 percent a year, well below its historical average. Household incomes continue to stagnate, and millions of Americans still can't find jobs. And a growing number of experts see evidence that the economy will never rebound completely.
For more than a century, the pace of growth was reliably resilient, bouncing back after recessions like a car returning to its cruising speed after a roadblock. Even after the prolonged Great Depression of the 1930s, growth eventually returned to an average pace of more than 3 percent a year. But Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, citing the Congressional Budget Office, said on Wednesday that the government now expected annual growth to average just 2.1 percent, about two-thirds of the previous pace.
"Many today wonder whether something that has always been true in our past will be true in our future," Mr. Lew told members of the Economic Club of New York. "There are questions about whether America can maintain strong rates of growth and doubts about whether the benefits of technology, innovation and prosperity will be shared broadly."
The most recent recession and the slow recovery have "left lasting scars on the economy," the Labor Department concluded late last year in a report that declared slower growth "the new normal" for the American economy. The Federal Reserve, persistently optimistic in its previous forecasts, said in March that it no longer expected a full recovery in the foreseeable future.
Lawrence H. Summers, formerly President Obama's chief economic adviser and now a leading member of this Cassandra chorus, has warned that growth may fall short of expectations unless the federal government increases its spending on things like upgrading deteriorating roads and bridges and the development of new technologies. "A soft economy casts a substantial shadow forward onto the economy's future output and potential," he said in a speech in April.
The pessimism is a striking departure from economic orthodoxy. Recessions cause considerable suffering, including permanent disruptions to individual lives, but most economists have long asserted that recessions do not reduce the economy's capacity to supply goods and services.
Some economists still expect a complete recovery. They say it takes a long time to recover from financial crises, and that the healing process has been set back unexpectedly by cuts in government spending, by Europe's woes and, most recently, by a hard winter.
Other economists, also committed to the orthodox view of recessions, argue that the slower growth is here to stay, but say that it is the result of longer-term trends that predate the recession, like fewer Americans entering the work force and less innovation.
"We have recovered" from the recession, said Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University. "We just don't like what that looks like."
The emerging view espoused by an eclectic range of economists -- including Mr. Summers; Paul Krugman of Princeton and an Op-Ed page columnist for The New York Times; and Robert E. Hall of Stanford University's conservative Hoover Institution -- accepts that slower growth is partly the result of long-term trends. It is an unfortunate coincidence, in effect, that just as the floor was giving way, the ceiling was falling, too.
But these analysts also see mounting evidence that recessions, and slow recoveries, can have enduring consequences.
Since 2007, the Congressional Budget Office has cut its estimate of potential economic output in 2017 by a total of about 7 percent, or $2,500 per American. The budget office says the recession is responsible for a quarter of the cuts. It attributes the rest to long-term trends. An analysis published last month by Mr. Hall argued that the recession played an even larger role.
Much of the scrutiny has focused on the labor market. The share of adults with jobs fell sharply during the recession and has rebounded only slightly because many people have simply stopped looking for work. The situation is likely to improve somewhat as the economy gains strength, but part of the decline is tied to factors that are more permanent.
They include the share of Americans claiming federal disability benefits, which rose sharply in recent years. Few of those people will ever return to the work force after receiving benefits. At the same time, fewer immigrants have been arriving. There are almost two million fewer people over the age of 16 than the federal government had projected back in 2007.
The recession also reduced the number of future workers. The birthrate has declined each year from 2007 to 2012, the most recent for which data is available.
Economic prosperity is determined not just by the number of workers but, even more important, by their output per hour of work. There is growing speculation that decisions made in the wake of the recession have weakened that output, too.
Government spending and public investment has fallen by almost 8 percent, the largest decline in more than half a century. Corporate investment has also been lackluster.
As with the labor market, there is a clear short-term problem and also a long-term trend. John G. Fernald, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a leading expert on productivity, argued in a 2012 paper that the growth of productivity had slowed as companies completed a cycle of technological investment.
But in a much-discussed paper last year, three senior Fed economists argued that productivity growth could take a long-term hit because fewer businesses were being created and existing ones were spending less on research and development.
This view remains controversial. "Productivity forecasts have had no success historically," Mr. Hall wrote in his recent analysis. "Whether the return to a normal economy will result in a catch-up in productivity growth in the longer term is an unsettled question."
Another unsettled question is whether the federal government can help.
Gauti Eggertsson and Neil Mehrotra, economics professors at Brown University, argued in a recent paper that the combination of the financial crisis, fewer workers and rising income inequality could leave the economy in a state of "permanent recession."
The paper, which sought to formalize recent conceptualizing about so-called secular stagnation, argued that in a normal cycle, falling interest rates would eventually generate sufficient demand to restore the economy to its historical growth rate.
But the Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 and there has been no such rebound. The researchers concluded that the economy might experience "a permanent slump in output" without bold new measures to spur investment, like a large increase in government spending or higher inflation.
Mr. Lew, the Treasury secretary, argued on Wednesday that smaller steps, like increased immigration and improved education, could help too.
"The choices we make over the years to come can alter this projection" of slower growth, he said.
There is little prospect a divided Congress will embrace either approach, but there are still some reasons for optimism. For all his doubt about the current outlook, Mr. Cowen, author of "Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation" (Dutton, 2013), expects that some existing innovations, and some as yet undreamed, will eventually drive faster growth.
Just not very soon. "If you're 40 now," Mr. Cowen said, "I don't see why you ever see it, or enjoy it as a worker."
While worried about a slowdown, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, sees even odds over the next five years that the economy will grow more quickly.
"I don't believe the U.S. economy can remain for a long time in secular stagnation," Mr. El-Erian, who correctly predicted the current malaise in 2009, said in an interview. "It's like a car that has to be either in fourth gear or in neutral. There's too much leverage in the system. If we don't get growth, the leverage becomes an issue. If we don't grow out of our debts, the debt is going to discourage economic activity and we're going to have trouble growing 2 percent a year."
Finally, while it is human nature to assume trends will persist, they often don't.
During the 1930s, many economists predicted that growth would not resume its earlier pace. Alvin Hansen, a Harvard University professor, coined the term "secular stagnation" to describe his view that changed circumstances, including a lower birthrate, would prevent a full recovery.
Mr. Hansen was spectacularly wrong. After World War II, the number of babies boomed -- and so did the economy.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDLONDON -- When the global bank HSBC sold its London headquarters tower to a Spanish buyer in spring 2007, at the height of the credit and property boom, the deal was the single largest real estate transaction in British history.
Then the boom went bust, prompting a fire-sale handover of the building back to HSBC. Next came the nadir. A new owner, this time from South Korea, bought the tower in hopes of a rebound.
Now the 44-story building, still serving as HSBC's headquarters, is for sale yet again.
Because the market is teeming with international money, some analysts predict the price this time will surpass that 2007 record of 1.1 billion pounds, or $1.8 billion -- a forecast that might say everything you need to know about the boom-bust-boom of London commercial real estate.
Except that there is actually much more of a story to tell about the HSBC tower. As goes this building, so goes the London market.
"It traded right at the top, and then again at the bottom and now it's right back up at the top," said Simon Mallinson, managing director of Real Capital Analytics, a company that tracks global real estate transactions. "The tower is reflective of where the city is."
Prices for London office buildings, not adjusted for inflation, have surpassed their previous high point reached in 2007 by 10 percent, according to Real Capital.
Last year, £19 billion worth of commercial real estate was sold, compared with the previous record of £17.9 billion in 2007, according to another firm, CBRE Global Research and Consulting.
"2013 was a storming year, the best year we have ever had," said Neil Blake, a CBRE executive.
In recent months, the American investment company Blackstone, which scooped up London property during the depths of the crisis, has sold its stakes in two major building groups, posting giant profits on each. In a separate deal, St. Martins, the property division of the Kuwait Investment Authority, paid £1.7 billion -- in cash -- for another group of London buildings.
Residential real estate in London and southeast England generally, propelled by foreign money, is also on a tear, with prices running at an annual growth rate of 17 percent -- which has politicians and central bankers wondering how to subdue the frenzy.
For international investors in commercial real estate, London has some important advantages over the United States. Sales proceeds on buildings do not incur capital gains taxes, and leases are much more favorable to owners than to renters.
The standard London lease terms, in real estate lingo, are "full repair, insure, upwards only with five-year review." In other words, the tenant is responsible for any repairs, must insure the building and understands that typically the rent can only rise, not fall, after five years.
But as commercial real estate soars once again, banking is not driving the market as it did in the previous London cycle.
"The banks have been very much reduced in terms of occupancy needs, and what we see is the growth of other sectors," said Peter Bennett, city surveyor for the City of London.
Nonbanking parts of London have drawn new interest, like the King's Cross neighborhood in the north where Google is building its headquarters.
Driving this boom are business services and technology companies that are setting up or expanding their London bases. There is also considerable outside money, seeking the perceived security of hard assets in the British capital -- whether pension funds from Norway, Canada and elsewhere or sovereign wealth funds from Asia and the Middle East.
Worldwide, sovereign wealth funds increased their direct investments in real estate to $21.6 billion last year, from $2.8 billion in 2010, according to Institutional Investor's Sovereign Wealth Center. Britain received $9.4 billion of last year's total -- double the amount of the runner-up, the United States.
The money, Mr. Bennett said, used to come in national waves: the Americans, the Germans, the Japanese. "Now," he said, "we have a tsunami of investors from all of the world all at the same time."
As a result, the City of London, which generally refers to the square mile built by the Romans nearly 2,000 years ago, and which for centuries has been a center of banking and commerce, is now festooned with construction cranes.
New buildings, many with quirky, descriptive nicknames, have sprung up in the City in the last decade and others are still under construction. One of the newest is 122 Leadenhall Street, better known as the Cheesegrater for the distinctive wedge shape the architect, Richard Rogers, designed to avoid blocking the view of St. Paul's Cathedral for neighboring buildings.
London's other business "city," where the HSBC tower sits, is Canary Wharf, the skyscraper park three and a half miles east of the more pedigreed City. It, too, is a magnet for foreign money.
Development of Canary Wharf, built on the site of former cargo docks, was begun in the late 1980s by a Canadian company, Olympia & York, which had the bad timing to be caught by one of London's periodic real estate busts. Yet even though the initial development project went bankrupt in 1992, the next economic rebound, particularly in the financial industry, rekindled demand for office space.
HSBC was among the banking giants drawn to Canary Wharf for its modern, open space, which contrasted with the higgledy-piggledy layout of the centuries-old City.
HSBC commissioned Norman Foster to design its headquarters tower, on which it spent £500 million, and took up residence in 2002. Although architecturally nondescript compared with some of the nicknamed City icons, the tower is one of the largest single headquarters buildings in Europe, with 1.1 million square feet.
But five years after HSBC moved in, with the credit-fueled finance industry at a fever pitch and commercial real estate starting to look very much like a bubble, bankers close to the company say HSBC decided it was "not in the property business."
The bank decided to conduct a sale-leaseback, selling the building but taking out a lease as the tower's main occupant -- a setup that can be alluring to buyers, if the tenant is a reliable one.
In May 2007, HSBC found a ready buyer in an affiliate of Metrovacesa, a Spanish conglomerate with a big appetite for real estate even as some of the smarter money was growing wary.
The record £1.1 billion transaction involved HSBC's leasing the building while also providing Metrovacesa with an £810 million loan to finance the purchase. When the debt-fueled real estate market began its tailspin a short time later, in a local version of the global vortex, Metrovacesa could not syndicate the loan.
By late 2008, with banks paralyzed and developers scrambling to clean up their own portfolios, the best prospective buyer looked to be the building's anchor tenant and the Spanish company's creditor, HSBC.
Negotiations went right up to midnight on a Tuesday in early December, a deadline the bank had set after Metrovacesa was unable to make a crucial loan payment. Having the upper hand, HSBC canceled the loan and took the building back, making £250 million.
But HSBC, under as much pressure as most other big banks during the depths of the financial crisis, was no more eager than it had been in 2007 to be in the real estate business. In late 2009, South Korea's National Pension Service took the building off HSBC's hands for even less than the bank had paid a year earlier: £773 million.
Nearly five years later, with London real estate red hot once more, the South Korean pension fund is eager to diversify its assets and realize some profits.
The tower could be alluring to a new owner because that same anchor tenant, HSBC, has 13 years remaining on its lease, and the rent will increase every year by 2.5 to 6 percent, depending on where the retail price index falls.
"The lease is completely unique and the building is attracting interest from billionaires, national pension funds and sovereign wealth funds," said Andrew Hawkins, a director at JLL, one of the two brokers working on the sale.
Still, some analysts are skeptical that the price will break the £1.1 billion mark set in 2007, noting that Canary Wharf is well east of central London.
For all that, though, Mr. Blake of CBRE Global Research does not see a top yet to the current market.
"We are not at the end here," he said. "We are only at the beginning."
That could mean the HSBC tower, the litmus test of London real estate, might change hands yet again. At a price that will be a sign of the times.

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- With federal highway funds just weeks from depletion, the struggle to replenish the Highway Trust Fund has linked Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader, with one of the Republicans' brightest stars, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky -- and pushed against the bipartisan leadership of the Finance Committee -- with the clock ticking.
Mr. Reid and Mr. Paul are quietly pressing for a one-time tax "holiday" -- a special and lucrative tax deduction -- to lure multinational corporations to bring profits home from overseas, producing a sudden windfall. Companies would be allowed to deduct 85 percent of the money their parent corporations in the United States receive from foreign subsidiaries, a move that would bring the Treasury between $20 billion and $30 billion in the next two years, while flooding the domestic economy with hundreds of billions of dollars otherwise trapped abroad.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the Finance Committee chairman, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican, want that money to help smooth passage of a broad rewrite of the tax code.
Last week, they issued a schedule of hearings for June and July that was supposed to build support for a tax overhaul. That schedule included a shot at Mr. Reid. "We will also continue to look for innovative ways to fix the depleted Highway Trust Fund and keep hard-working Americans on the job without diverting revenues from repatriation needed for tax reform," wording in the schedule said.
The showdown is the first test for Mr. Wyden, as he and other committee leaders try to assert more power against the strong arm of Mr. Reid. And there is wide skepticism of the proposal.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, Mr. Reid's right-hand man in the Democratic leadership but also a Finance Committee member, "is dubious of simply tying repatriation to a temporary highway funding package because he's concerned it's too short term," said Matt House, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer.
Aides for Mr. Reid said the leader was only drawing up an option before Mr. Wyden drafted his part of a highway and infrastructure bill. "This decision is up to Chairman Wyden," said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Mr. Reid.
But the needs of the Highway Trust Fund may be more pressing than a rewrite of the entire tax code. And what Mr. Reid wants, he often gets.
For years now, gasoline and diesel tax receipts have fallen as cars and trucks have become more fuel-efficient, even as infrastructure needs have risen. For the fiscal year that began in October, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that trust fund revenues would total $33 billion, while spending would total $45 billion.
And by the week of July 18, the trust fund's nest egg would dip below $4 billion, the "prudent balance" trigger that would force the Department of Transportation to tell states to begin slowing construction projects. By next year, every cent of fuel tax receipts would have to go to projects already underway, blocking any new repair or construction projects, and possibly slowing an already incremental economic recovery.
"Just the threat of Congress delaying funding has forced states to cut back already," said Jeff Shoaf, senior executive director for government affairs at the Associated General Contractors of America, which lobbies for the firms that do those projects.
There are both philosophical and structural problems with the Reid-Paul proposal.
In 2004, when Congress approved a similar holiday, lawmakers vowed never to do it again. If it became a habit, they reasoned, companies would keep their profits overseas waiting for the next tax holiday. That, the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation explained, is the idea's "moral hazard problem."
The structural problem is no less prickly. If it is structured simply, the tax holiday would draw about $20 billion through 2015, as companies rush to bring money home to take advantage of the one-time tax deal, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But by the end of 2017, it would have cost the government money, by taxing at an ultralow rate profits that would have come home anyway. Through 2024, a simple tax holiday, like the one tried in 2004, would cost nearly $96 billion.
Reid aides said they had found a solution. With interest rates so low, companies like Apple are borrowing money to finance projects and investment instead of bringing cash home from abroad. Even at a low "holiday" rate, interest is less than taxes.
Policy makers need to raise the cost of borrowing, a Reid aide said. The solution: Any corporate borrowing made to avoid repatriating profits would not be tax deductible. With that change, Reid aides said, the two-year windfall of a tax holiday would jump to $30 billion, and over 10 years, the government would still make $3 billion. In the meantime, $400 billion would have come back to the United States from overseas, they said.
In January, Mr. Paul said on NBC News's "Meet the Press" that he had brought up the idea with President Obama, adding that bipartisan ideas should not be sacrificed on the grand ambitions of goals like tax overhaul.
"I think we could agree to that tomorrow," he said on the program nearly six months ago.
That is the problem with the idea, said highway advocates, who are anxiously eyeing the clock. At this stage, any proposal this complex and contentious does not have the time necessary to generate support, and infrastructure advocates said the trust fund needs $100 billion over the next six years just to keep up the current road and transit system.
Contractors and unions are pressing a broader mix of taxes -- perhaps on tires and drivers' licenses -- and indexing gasoline and diesel taxes to inflation to try to keep up with lower fuel demand.
"If it was that easy and could have been done quickly, it probably would have been done," Sean O'Neill, the general contractor lobby's director of congressional relations, said of the tax holiday.

Full text:   SHINSHIRO, Japan -- Toshie Yamada's "kei," with its pint-size engine and tiny wheels, looks more like a Fisher-Price toy car than a regular truck. But don't underestimate her Nissan NT 100 Clipper microtruck. At a recent farmers' market, where she sells orchids from her flower farm here in central Japan, she loaded up a mountain of crates, buckets and a folding table before hopping in and zipping away.
"In these parts, keis are definitely the No. 1 car," Ms. Yamada said. "Big cars are too much of a hassle."
As farmers' trucks, family cars, delivery vans and even tiny cafes-on-wheels, keis are everywhere in Japan. They are more popular than ever, thanks to the country's high gasoline prices, a preferential tax system and an uneven economic recovery that have made the wee cars enticing value propositions.
Keis have terrific fuel economies that rival the Prius, but they sell for half the price. Last year, a record 40 percent of all new cars sold in Japan were keis.
But industry and government officials are increasingly worried that these microvehicles have become a distraction for the nation's automakers -- still bastions of the Japanese economy -- and are moving to wean drivers off them. In April the government took what its critics charged was a hard-line route. Kei drivers were hit with a triple whammy of a higher sales tax, higher gasoline tax and higher kei car tax, the last of which the government raised by 50 percent, sharply narrowing their tax difference with regular-size vehicles.
"We need to rebalance our priorities," Yoshitaka Shindo, the minister for internal affairs, said ahead of the tax increase.
Though made by some of Japan's biggest automakers, including Nissan, Honda, Suzuki and the Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu, the kei -- pronounced like the letter K -- is not manufactured for export, largely because of its small size and lack of sufficient safety equipment. The engines are limited by law to just 0.66 liter, similar to an engine of a midsize motorcycle. Even Ford's smallest car, the Fiesta subcompact, has a substantially larger engine.
That means much of the research and development that go into kei models is wasted, officials warn. Producing kei cars just for domestic drivers also hurts automakers' efforts to achieve economies of scale, which has become increasingly important in an era of cutthroat global competition.
As with other big automakers, Japanese car manufacturers are using the same basic components to build a wide range of models. Servicing a niche, Japan-only market is a luxury that Japanese automakers increasingly cannot afford, some government officials argue.
Generous tax breaks on kei vehicles, a vestige of postwar policies that encouraged Japanese to ditch their scooters and hand-drawn carts for cars, are also becoming a drain on government coffers. And kei cars have become a perennial thorn in trade talks between Japan and other car-producing countries, like the United States and Germany, which say Japan's unique tax breaks and restrictions for keis protect domestic automakers from foreign competition. More than 90 percent of cars sold in Japan are Japanese.
"For years, the kei was the people's car in Japan. But now its role is over," said Mitsuhisa Yokoyama, an analyst at SC-ABeam Automotive Consulting, an advisory firm based in Tokyo. "The distinction no longer makes sense."
But the push to move beyond kei cars, which the government used to promote a car culture in Japan's lean postwar years, is being hurt by the success of that policy. Simply put, the Japanese love their keis.
That's especially the case in rural regions, like Shinshiro, where lower incomes and sparse public transportation systems have made the tiny cars a necessity. Here in Shinshiro, an estimated three-quarters of households own a kei car; that proportion is close to 100 percent in some parts of the country, according to the Japan Light Motor Vehicle and Motorcycle Association, an industry trade group.
Raising taxes on kei cars "resorts to bullying the weak," Osamu Suzuki, chairman of Suzuki Motor, a major manufacturer of kei vehicles, said at the introduction of a new kei truck last year.
The popularity of keis is also increasing among young city dwellers, who have been hit hardest by Japan's decades of slow income growth. About 26 percent of kei drivers last year said they had downsized from a standard car, according to a survey published in April by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, a trade organization.
Keis have also become an important mode of transport for Japanese women, who make up an estimated 65 percent of kei car drivers, according to the manufacturers association. Women in Shinshiro said that their husbands drove standard-size cars, but that their households would struggle to buy and maintain a second standard car.
"I don't know what I'd do without my kei," said Yui Shirai, who relies on her Tanto, made by Daihatsu, to drive to her job at her parents' tea farm. Her husband, Takuya, drives a standard-size Suzuki. Ms. Shirai said that they might not be able to own a second car -- and she might not be able to work -- if not for the low cost, low taxes and low fuel needs.
The new kei taxes are feeding into a debate over what some Japanese see as a growing gap between haves and have-nots under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic reforms. Critics charge that the big measures Mr. Abe has pushed so far -- raising taxes, stoking higher oil prices and nudging up inflation -- have hit poorer Japanese the hardest.
Almost 20 percent of kei owners surveyed by the automobile manufacturers' association said they would consider giving up their cars altogether because of higher taxes, while 10 percent would upgrade to standard cars. "The burden appears to be heaviest for families with children, and for young people with low incomes," the survey said.
Pain from the higher kei taxes is also being felt unevenly across the auto industry. Japan's smaller carmakers, which rely more on kei car sales, have complained bitterly that raising kei taxes hits their own bottom lines, endangering jobs. Suzuki, for example, has said that it expects kei sales to slump this year because of the higher taxes. It was one of only two carmakers that did not give raises to its employees this year.
Suzuki also argues that manufacturing keis offers insights into other parts of its business. It applies some of the kei technology, for example, to small cars that it sells in India, a market where it has a sizable share.
And Suzuki has been aggressively upgrading its keis, transforming them from cut-rate cars with minimal trappings. Now, Suzuki's best-selling Wagon R microcar features slick seats, a small lithium-ion battery that can capture energy when the car slows down, and an advanced, radar-supported braking system. These are technologies that are applicable across all its models, Suzuki says.
"In the past, people used to say they'd settle for a kei. Now they say they desire a kei," said Aritaka Okajima, a Suzuki spokesman.
Still, the future is tough for Japan's microcars. Daihatsu's president, Masanori Mitsui, warned on April 28 that the automaker expected overall kei sales in Japan to shrink by some 500,000 vehicles over the next two years, from 2.23 million vehicles last fiscal year to 1.7 million in 2015.
Takeshi Suzuki, a Shinshiro retiree who sells coffee from the back of his Mitsubishi Minicab microvan, said raising taxes on keis would quash Japanese entrepreneurism. In a space just over 11 feet long, under five feet wide and about five feet high, Mr. Suzuki has squeezed in an industrial coffee grinder, electric generator, ice box, paper cups and a Cimbali espresso machine.
"Keis are the working man's friend," he said. "How could they do this to us?"

Full text:   Morris A. Adelman, an energy economist who marshaled free-market principles and hard data in arguing that the world's oil supply was not running out, died May 8 at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 96. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught and researched for 65 years, announced the death on May 15.
Dr. Adelman emerged at the center of national energy debates when petroleum prices shot up after the Arab oil embargo of 1973. In 1974, the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised the price of a barrel of oil to $7 from $2. (Adjusted for inflation, $7 in 1974 would be more than $30 today. On Friday, crude oil was selling for $102 a barrel in the commodities market.)
To diminish OPEC's power, Dr. Adelman advocated that the United States sow a little confusion. He proposed establishing a system of secret competitive bidding for licenses to import oil into the United States. On the basis of economic theory and experience with oligopolies, he argued that there was a good chance OPEC members would cheat on the public prices they had collaborated to set. As a result, he suggested in articles and interviews, the price of crude might drop and OPEC might unravel.
Dr. Adelman acknowledged the possibility that OPEC would retaliate against the auction system by establishing one overall selling agency. But in an interview with The New York Times in 1975, he said that in itself would be counterproductive because governments would "have the constant divisive job of haggling over market shares."
The Mobil Corporation, now part of Exxon Mobil, ran an ad on the Op-Ed page of The Times responding to a letter he had written the newspaper. It criticized Dr. Adelman for not acknowledging the crucial role that only oil companies play in the complicated task of getting fuel to the consumer -- a function it said they would no longer play in an anonymous auction system. The ad, signed by Mobil's president, William P. Tavoulareas, called Dr. Adelman naïve for thinking that OPEC members would participate in their own destruction.
Also in response to Dr. Adelman's secret-bidding idea, some senators and representatives suggested that the United States set up a single purchasing agency to negotiate directly with OPEC. Dr. Adelman dismissed this idea as "absurd" because it would not necessarily diminish OPEC's power.
The United States policy of not jeopardizing the world's large oil suppliers -- particularly Saudi Arabia, the largest -- worked against Dr. Adelman's idea. "Nobody has the stomach for any resistance," he told The Christian Science Monitor in 1983.
Dr. Adelman contributed to a debate that has raged almost since Edwin Drake discovered oil in Pennsylvania in 1859. Geologists and others have long insisted that oil is running out, but economists have countered that oil will continue to be found as long as extraction technology advances and the price is sufficient.
Dr. Adelman used the Kern River field in the San Joaquin Valley of California to prove the economists' point. In 1942, he said, the United States Geological Survey estimated that the field had 54 million barrels of reserves. In 1986, the agency raised its estimate to 970 million barrels, based on what could be recovered by modern technology. (The oil had been there all along but had been unrecoverable at prevailing prices and technology.) Between 1942 and 1986, the field produced 736 million barrels as increasingly better technology made it possible to squeeze more oil from the ground.
His point was that reserve estimates are based on current technology and prices, not just underlying geology. The original geologists were not incompetent, he said, rather, the technology to extract oil vastly improved.
"When will the world's supply of oil be exhausted?" Dr. Adelman asked. "The basic answer is never." His point has been proved many times in oil industry history, most recently by widespread use of new drilling techniques that include hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to force more oil from the earth. The federal government estimated that domestic crude oil production this year will average 9.24 million barrels a day, the highest since 1972. As a result of increasing production, oil imports last year fell to 36 percent of United States' consumption from 60 percent in 2006.
This increased production -- and the knowledge gained from it -- pushed estimates of domestic crude reserves recoverable at current prices and technology to more than 33.4 billion barrels for the first time since 1976. The increase in natural gas reserves has been even greater: They rose to 2.3 trillion cubic feet in 2013 from 1.3 trillion cubic feet in 2000.
Morris Albert Adelman was born in New York City on May 31, 1917, and graduated from the City College of New York in 1938 with the intention of becoming a science teacher. He served as a Navy ensign in the Pacific during World War II, commanding a landing ship. After the war, he earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard.
His early research was on industrial organization. In 1959, he examined the A.&P. supermarket chain and concluded that it had achieved lower prices because of its size, not because of anticompetitive pricing.
In 1962, he published an influential article on petroleum costs and a book on natural gas supplies, "The Supply and Price of Natural Gas." His other books included "The World Petroleum Market" (1972) and "The Genie Out of the Bottle: World Oil Since 1970" (1995).
He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Adelman. Dr. Adelman's wife, the former Millicent Linsen, and his son, Larry, died before him.
In the 1970s, when many Americans were angered by what they saw as OPEC's greed, Dr. Adelman viewed the organization purely in business terms. "Those fellows are not considerate and they're not malicious," he said. "They're just trying to do the best for themselves, squeezing the goose without killing it."

Abstract: Equally worrisome, 44 percent of young college graduates in 2012 were working in jobs that didn't require a college degree (versus 38 percent before the recession in 2007), according to data from researchers at the Federal Reserve.

Full text:   Today's young people, ages 18 to 24, should have been the lucky ones. They were preteens or teenagers when the recession hit in late 2007, with high school and college still ahead. Unlike those who had to enter the work force in the depths of the downturn, they had time, or so it seemed, to wait out the weak economy.
But that's not how things have worked out. While the worst is over, economic conditions are still subpar, damaging the immediate job prospects and long-term living standards of young adults starting out now.
In recent years, the economy has grown annually at 2 percent or so. That's too slow to make up the current shortfall of nearly seven million jobs, let alone to absorb new graduates or push up wages in jobs that do exist.
To make matters worse, the economy contracted at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter of 2014. A rebound is expected, but there is little in the economic data or current policy to suggest that an upsurge will be sustained; over all, economic growth is likely to settle at 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
For young people, these conditions will only deepen a long trend of increasing economic hardship. Census data that compares today's 18-to-24-year-olds with the same age group in 1970 and in 1990 show more poverty among young adults over time, as well as lower income and less independence. But young people today are appreciably worse off than those in previous generations.
In 1970, for example, 13.9 percent of people ages 18 to 24 were in poverty. In 1990, 15.9 percent were poor; in 2012, the last year of available data, 20.4 percent were poor, or 6.1 million people. That data excludes students living in dorms, as well as most students who live with their parents or receive cash support from them. For young people who are on their own, either living alone or with housemates or spouses, median household income, recently $30,604, is nearly $4,600 less than in 1970 and virtually unchanged since 1990, adjusted for inflation.
Lack of opportunity and lack of resources mean a smaller share of young high school and college graduates are relocating, traditionally a way up a career ladder. In 1970, nearly 40 percent of young people had moved in the prior year; in 1990, it was nearly 32 percent; in 2013, it was only 21.6 percent. Not surprisingly, the share of young adults living with their parents is 55.3 percent, compared with 47.3 percent in 1970 and 52.8 percent in 1990.
Young people are clearly banking on a college education to improve their prospects -- 41 percent of 18-to-24-year-olds were recently enrolled in college, a higher share than in previous generations. But the unemployment rate of college graduates ages 21 to 24 remains high at an average of 8.5 percent over the past year. Underemployment -- which includes those who are officially unemployed, those who want to work but haven't looked recently for a job and those stuck in part-time jobs -- is 16.8 percent.
Equally worrisome, 44 percent of young college graduates in 2012 were working in jobs that didn't require a college degree (versus 38 percent before the recession in 2007), according to data from researchers at the Federal Reserve. In 2000, half of college-educated workers in jobs that didn't require a degree were in generally well-paid professions, working as electricians, for example, or dental hygienists. Now they are more likely to be waiters, bartenders or cashiers.
College-educated workers still earn much more than less-educated ones, but landing a good job at rising pay is made even more difficult as each new group of graduates joins a backlog of unemployed and underemployed college and high school graduates, dating back to the class of 2008.
Over the last six years, one of the economy's biggest problems has been faulty fiscal policy, with the federal government underestimating the need for economic aid or withholding and reducing help prematurely. Another drag has been lack of business investment, even as financial markets have prospered with the help of loose monetary policy.
The result has been an economy where young people starting out are at risk of prolonged underachievement. It is possible to defuse that risk, but not without responsive policy and robust investment.

Full text:   After a series of peaks and valleys that confounded optimists and pessimists alike this year, the American economy seems to have settled into a healthy, if not spectacular, pace of job creation.
Employers hired 217,000 workers in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, enough to finally lift total payrolls above where they were before the financial collapse nearly six years ago.
"This is a solid report," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. For the fourth consecutive month, he noted, employers added more than 200,000 positions, the first time that has happened in 14 years.
As good as that might sound, surpassing the previous high-water mark in terms of payroll employment is cold comfort for recent graduates and other new entrants into the work force, as well as for the legions of Americans who lost their jobs in the Great Recession. While payrolls may be back to where they were before the downturn, the working age population has risen by roughly 15 million over the same period.
That seeming paradox -- a steadily improving economy with faster job growth even as millions of potential workers remain stuck on the sidelines -- is among the biggest challenges now facing politicians in Washington and policy makers at the Federal Reserve.
The latest numbers highlight the problem. The unemployment rate remained flat last month at 6.3 percent, the lowest since September of 2008. But the portion of the population in the work force did not budge either, remaining stuck at 62.8 percent, a depressed level last seen in the late 1970s. Although retiring baby boomers are responsible for some of the decline in participation in recent years, most experts say they believe a substantial amount is because people are giving up the search for a job entirely and dropping out of the work force.
"We've gotten the unemployment rate down," said Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners and a Wall Street strategist for decades. "But are we really creating enough jobs to bring people back into the work force? We're not and we need to create more. We're still a long way from where we need to be."
The varying fates of workers in the recovery was also evident from the data on joblessness by educational level. While unemployment among college graduates dropped by 0.1 percent, to 3.2 percent in May, it increased by 0.2 percent, to 9.1 percent for high school dropouts, and by 0.2 percent, to 6.5 percent for workers with only a high school diploma.
Still, experts said that the report was strong enough to keep the Fed on its current trajectory of gradually reducing monthly bond purchases aimed at stimulating the economy, while avoiding the danger that an improving labor market will create upward pressure on inflation, always a worry for central bankers. For example, average hourly earnings rose by 5 cents, to $24.38, in May, the Labor Department said, and are up 2.1 percent in the last 12 months, not much more than underlying rate of inflation.
"This is a Goldilocks report," said Scott G. Clemons, chief investment strategist for private banking at Brown Brothers Harriman, referring to the not-too-hot, not-too-cold balance between faster growth on the one hand, and the risk of inflation on the other. "There's been some latent concern about whether we are seeing real strength or just a recovery from the winter, but I think this is for real."
Wall Street was also enthusiastic Friday. Investors were pleased by the uptick in hiring and the lack of the kind of wage inflation that might prompt the Fed to raise short-term interest rates sooner than the current expectation of mid-2015.
As has been the recent pattern, stocks surged again on Friday, lifting both the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average to new nominal highs. The S.&P. 500 has gained 5.5 percent so far in 2014, and is up just over 20 percent from where it was a year ago.
Despite a boom in corporate profit and the surging stock market, many big companies are only now beginning to gingerly increase the size of their work force; generally, they had preferred to pay existing staff for more hours if demand materialized rather than add new positions. That is one reason the length of the workweek for nonsupervisory manufacturing workers hit 42.1 hours in May, the longest since World War II, even as the typical workweek for all workers was unchanged.
"We would rather have employees work an extra half-day or a few more hours than incur the costs of adding a new worker," said James S. Metcalf, chief executive of USG, which makes building materials like the Sheetrock brand of drywall. "Demand is increasing, but it is still very choppy."
The pace of hiring at USG's 39 plants in the United States is beginning to tick up, though. The company hired 25 workers in May, and plans to add several hundred more to its domestic work force of approximately 7,400 by the end of the year. Three out of four of the new hires this year have been for hourly production positions, with the rest in salaried jobs in engineering, logistics and research.
Some parts of the country are much busier than others, Mr. Metcalf added, with Texas and the Southwest doing the best, while the Midwest grows much more slowly. Nationally, he said, "it's nothing you'd strike up the band for but this is a slow, steady recovery. We still have to be convinced that the higher demand we're seeing is sustainable."
Even as private employers have gradually increased hiring in the recovery, the work force at government agencies and the Postal Service has shrunk considerably. Total government employment is still down by more than one million from where it was four years ago.
That pattern largely continued in May, with the public sector adding just 1,000 positions, while private employers hired 216,000 new employees. Sectors with the most robust hiring included professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, and education and health care.
Despite the drop in the overall jobless rate in the last year, the broadest measure of unemployment including discouraged workers and those forced to work part time because full-time positions are not available stands at 12.2 percent.
As Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, noted, that is down from a peak of 17.2 percent but still high by historical standards. Similarly, while the median duration of unemployment dipped to 14.6 weeks in May from 16 weeks in April, that is more than double the prerecession average of 7.1 weeks.
"The decline in the unemployment rate this year has exceeded our expectations," Ms. Meyer explained. "That said, there is still a great deal of underutilization in the labor market."

Full text:   The cries of protest have been fierce, warning that President Obama's plan to cut greenhouse gases from power plants will bring soaring electricity bills and even plunge the nation into blackouts. By the time the administration is finished, one prominent critic said, "millions of Americans will be freezing in the dark."
Yet cuts on the scale Mr. Obama is calling for -- a 30 percent reduction in emissions from the nation's electricity industry by 2030 -- have already been accomplished in parts of the country.
At least 10 states cut their emissions by that amount or more between 2005 and 2012, and several other states were well on their way, almost two decades before Mr. Obama's clock for the nation runs out.
That does not mean these states are off the hook under the Obama plan unveiled this week -- they will probably be expected to cut more to help achieve the overall national goal -- but their strides so far have not brought economic ruin. In New England, a region that has made some of the biggest cuts in emissions, residential electricity bills fell 7 percent from 2005 to 2012, adjusted for inflation. And economic growth in the region ran slightly ahead of the national average.
"This is not going to be the Armageddon that some people think," said Teresa Marks, director of the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality.
In fact, with years left to reach Mr. Obama's goal, and many states already heading in that direction, some of the loudest attacks on the plan are coming from those who contend it is not ambitious enough.
"I think it's properly ambitious -- for the first term of the Bill Clinton administration," said Bill McKibben, the president and co-founder of 350.org, a group pushing for climate action. "Given the melting Antarctic, we obviously should be doing far, far more, but at least we're finally started, and that's to Obama's credit."
Europe, by contrast, is considering a 43 percent cut in emissions from power plants and other energy-intensive industries by 2030.
The Obama administration's plan is not expected to become final until next year. Once it does, intense political and legal opposition is likely to follow, especially from the coal industry and from states run by Republican governors and legislators.
But even in states that have made big cuts, the Obama plan is provoking some wariness, with officials there pointing out that the plan would saddle them with stringent targets requiring them to go further.
Yet many of the states that are most dependent on coal -- and have made the least effort to cut greenhouse gases -- were given only moderate targets.
"Just because we've led in this effort doesn't mean we should have to do as much or even more than states that haven't even started," said Larry Wolk, executive director of the Department of Public Health and Environment in Colorado.
The administration argues that some of the most coal-dependent states have fewer options, especially a shortage of power plants that use natural gas and can help displace coal.
As for the states that have already made headway, "we were asking states to continue doing what they were already doing," said Joseph Goffman, senior counsel in the Office of Air and Radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Willingness aside, some states are simply unsure how they will meet Mr. Obama's targets.
South Carolina, for instance, was assigned a steep carbon-reduction goal. But officials of Santee Cooper, the state-owned utility that is South Carolina's largest power supplier, say the options to meet it are limited. Natural gas supplies are constrained by a dearth of pipelines, and the wind turbines that are rapidly sprouting elsewhere are not practical because of the state's placid weather, said Mollie Gore, the utility's spokeswoman.
"This will hurt South Carolina because it will drive up power costs and send industries packing -- it'll cost jobs," she said.
Opponents attacked Mr. Obama's plan in vociferous terms this week, with the claim about Americans "freezing in the dark" coming from Joseph Bast, president of the Heartland Institute, a Chicago organization that is skeptical of climate change.
But more optimistic assessments of the plan came from utility executives and many state officers who would have to carry it out. Some independent energy experts said that electricity prices may rise by a few percentage points in some states, but even that is not a foregone conclusion.
"I predict this will be far easier and far faster and far cheaper than most people realize," said Hal Harvey, chief executive of Energy Innovation, a research group.
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York cut their power-sector emissions more than 40 percent from 2005 to 2012, according to the Georgetown Climate Center, with Maryland close behind at 39 percent. The states are part of a nine-state project called the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and, like much of the country, have benefited from the recent abundance of cheap natural gas.
That has allowed them to dial down coal-burning power plants and dial up gas-fired plants, which emit roughly half as much carbon dioxide as coal plants, per unit of electricity produced.
Through a program called cap and trade, the Northeastern states also impose a small price on emissions of carbon dioxide from power generation, and plow the proceeds back into energy-efficiency programs, such as retrofitting homes and businesses, lowering electricity bills. And the states have encouraged the growth of emissions-free renewable power and more judicious use of energy.
David W. Cash, the Massachusetts commissioner of environmental protection, said he saw a direct link between the state's above-average economic performance in recent years and lower energy bills for businesses and consumers.
"Every dollar they're not spending on coal that comes from Colombia or natural gas that comes from Pennsylvania is a dollar that stays here in Massachusetts," Mr. Cash said.
Beyond the complaints about fairness, experts said the Obama plan posed both economic and environmental risks.
It is likely to lock in a growing dependence on natural gas to generate electricity. In the past, gas prices have been more volatile than coal prices, and in theory, a supply shortage in the future could send prices of gas and of electricity soaring.
But some people in the natural gas industry are skeptical about major price increases for gas in the future, because of the recent spread of hydraulic fracturing technology, or fracking, which has made vast new supplies of gas accessible across the country.
"We have supply waiting in the wings for any kind of incremental demand," said Chris Faulkner, chief executive of Breitling Energy Corporation, a Texas oil and gas company.
Because it depends on a continued abundance of gas, the Obama plan effectively puts the administration on the side of increased fracking, which has provoked intense debate in many communities affected by the stepped-up drilling. But the larger environmental risk with the Obama plan, some argue, is that it simply will not do much to slow global warming.
Climate scientists say that emissions in the developed countries need to fall 80 percent or more by 2050 if global warming is to be held to tolerable levels. Mr. Obama's draft plan does not put the United States on a trajectory that would make such a huge cut likely to be achieved.
"I'm glad the president is sending a signal that climate action is important," said Craig S. Altemose, executive director of the Better Future Project, a climate advocacy group in Cambridge, Mass. "But if you measure his plan against what the science says we need to do, then we are failing."

Full text:   IF a lot of your portfolio is still sitting in cash after a five-year bull market in equities, you're not alone. Investors at all wealth levels around the world are holding substantial amounts of cash that have increased since 2012. What this means for investors and the markets that depend on their money is intriguing.
According to new research on investors in 16 countries by State Street's Center for Applied Research, retail investors globally were holding an average of 40 percent of their assets in cash, up from 31 percent two years ago. That's a compounded annual growth rate of a whopping 13 percent.
The lowest levels of cash holdings were in India, at 26 percent, and China, at 30 percent; the highest was 57 percent in Japan. The United States was in the middle at 36 percent, but that was an increase of 10 percentage points in just two years. The survey, done by State Street, one of the world's largest asset managers and custodians, was conducted in the first quarter of this year. It considered cash to be money held in savings and checking accounts as well as cash equivalents like money market funds.
Despite the run-up in equity markets, people have resisted rushing into stocks and have instead added to cash. They've done this regardless of their age or amount of wealth. The study found that millennials who are under 33 and have the longest time to invest their money were increasing their cash positions at the same rate as baby boomers, who will need to draw on their investments soon.
Why is this happening? Suzanne Duncan, global head of research at State Street's Center for Applied Research, chalked it all up to fear -- even though it has been more than five years since the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index hit its low.
"If it wasn't fear, there'd be a much different variation by age," Ms. Duncan said. "Certain cohorts need more liquidity than others. When you find consensus across age cohorts, you realize it's not for liquidity needs but lack of trust across all age and wealth levels."
She said her own client meetings confirmed this deep-seated worry about the markets, like the one with the 90-year-old woman who had most of her money in cash. "She said she was afraid of high-frequency trading and dark pools," Ms. Duncan said. "Then she said, 'I don't know what those are, but I don't want to put my money with them.' "
That meeting, she said, was before Michael Lewis's "Flash Boys" came out about the rigging of the stock market by big financial firms and the impact of high-speed trading.
While fear is propelling people to hoard cash on one end of the spectrum, overconfidence is driving the investments people are making on the other end, the State Street study found. Two-thirds of the investors polled said their best investment was "entirely" their decision, and the investment that topped the list was "buying land or property."
Yet 45 percent of investors didn't know what the annual returns on their investments were and 64 percent said they didn't know what fees they paid.
"They're disenchanted with what the markets returned, and they're comparing a physical property to this abstract market return," she said. "They remember significant pain going through the downturn. But they don't even know what their returns are on their investments."
With results like these, the study's least surprising finding may be just how poor financial literacy is around the world. It asked 13 fairly specific questions about how compound interest, fees and active or passive management affect returns. Singapore came in first, with a C-minus. Citizens of five countries, including Germany, Japan and France, failed. Americans barely passed, with a score of 60 percent.
So what does this mean for investors? It depends on whom you ask. Ms. Duncan noted that cash hoarding decreased at higher wealth levels. Investors with less than $250,000 have 50 percent of their wealth in cash, while those with $250,000 to $1 million have 38 percent. People with more than $1 million have 32 percent. (This was the one data point where the study did not have a comparative figure from 2012.)
The money not held in cash, the State Street study found, generally went into equities and alternatives, like real estate and hedge funds.
This phenomenon has led some analysts to argue that high cash positions will buoy the stock market. Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said he had been doing his own cash calculations, comparing the average level of cash investors had to invest with the market capitalization -- the value of the outstanding stock -- of the companies in the broad Standard & Poor's Composite 1500-stock index.
Right now, he said, that cash available for investment relative to market capitalization is just about average. In December 1999, on the eve of the technology bubble's bursting, that level hit a low, he said. It hit a high in February 2009, but that, he said, was a function of the market capitalization being so low.
"What I was trying to get to was to decide if there was firepower out there," Mr. Stone said. "Some function of the stock market still going up is the next guy to buy. Valuation is in there, of course. But if the last person has just bought, you have a problem."
He said he believed that there was still money to drive stocks higher but that investors were only slowly becoming less hesitant. "People saw the value of having some cash," he said. "It was the only thing that could save you if you've gotten out over your skis too far."
Jose A. Rasco, head of investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank, took a different view in support of the same thesis that the stock market was not overvalued and that investors would continue to support it. He said that while the S.&P. 500 was up 30 percent last year, economic growth in the United States and the developed world was still below historical averages.
If that growth picks up and company earnings begin to improve, Mr. Rasco said, the bank's clients, who are extremely wealthy but still have large cash positions, would see that as a signal to invest more of their cash.
Of course, there is no guarantee that those large pots of cash will flow into equities and support a continued rally. "I'm not as compelled or convinced that cash will propel the market," G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, said. "Behaviorally, it makes sense, but empirically it doesn't. Large cash positions are not necessarily dry powder waiting to be deployed."
He suggested cash could be a safety net for some. For others it could be money held in reserve for a future market decline.
Still, Mr. Clemons sees continued value in holding cash, even though it neither grows nor offers a return like other assets. "If you believe future volatility will increase, the option value of cash increases and outpaces the return on a money market fund," he said. "It's a little theoretical, but it represents potential buying power."
Yet he drew a line at 50 percent of a portfolio in cash because of the impact that even moderate inflation would have on that money. At 2 percent inflation, for example, $1 million would be the equivalent of $615,000 in 25 years.
Whatever the outcome, for Ms. Duncan, investors clinging to cash around the world confirmed her belief about the magnitude of the psychological effect of the financial crisis.
"We are accustomed to thinking about other crises like the dot-com crash," she said. "In this case investors haven't come back because they were painfully affected by the financial crisis. It's interesting to see if the buy high/sell low pattern comes into play in a couple of years."
Until then, the mattresses may stay stuffed.

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Banks typically make money on the cash they park at a central bank. Now the European Central Bank wants them to pay for the privilege.
The move, a so-called negative interest rate, is part of a wide-ranging set of measures aimed at combating the crippling combination of slow growth and superlow inflation.
The initiatives, announced on Thursday by the European Central Bank, include the usual fare -- interest rate cuts and cheap bank loans. But the bank also showed a willingness to test new tools like the negative interest rate, in a nod to just how worrisome the economic situation has become in Europe.
Taken collectively, the measures send a strong message to investors, businesses, and citizens that the central bank is determined to put Europe on a path to stronger growth.
The bank president, Mario Draghi, also signaled that he was prepared to go further if necessary. In doing so, he left the door open to employ the same powerful, albeit controversial, bond-buying program that was used to restart growth in the United States.
"We think this is a significant package," Mr. Draghi said on Thursday at a news conference. "Are we finished? The answer is no."
With European political leaders struggling to address the region's economic woes, the central bank is aggressively moving to prevent the region from lapsing into the same sort of stagnation that has long afflicted Japan. Just this week, there was news that inflation in the euro zone had fallen to a mere 0.5 percent for the year ended in May, well below the bank's target of around 2 percent.
Even without outright deflation, it is a perilous trend that can cause people to delay purchases and can undercut corporate profit and job creation. The central bank's staff expects inflation to return to 1.1 percent in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2016.
The bank is taking a broad tack in its efforts.
The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate on Thursday to 0.15 percent, a record low, and said it would offer banks cheap four-year loans -- with strings attached to make sure they lend the money to businesses.
In addition, the central bank said it was moving closer to making purchases of packages of business loans, another way of funneling credit to companies in troubled countries like Greece that desperately need it.
The negative interest rate, which the central bank will impose beginning June 11, is meant to encourage banks to put their money to work to rebuild the battered euro zone. It is also aimed at weakening the euro, by making exports more competitive.
The markets welcomed the measures. European stocks rose broadly, with the German DAX index reaching a record high.
But it is unclear whether such efforts will have the desired long-term effects. The negative interest rate has never been tried on such a large scale, so its real-world effects are hard to predict.
And many economists wonder whether the central bank is doing enough, given the current economic picture. The central bank stopped short of using its metaphorical bazooka, the large-scale purchases of bonds and other financial assets known as quantitative easing.
"The conventional measures are all done," said Guntram B. Wolff, director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "What remains is quantitative easing."
But quantitative easing is a tricky proposition in Europe. The bank would have to make the politically delicate decision of what assets to buy from among the euro zone's 18 members. The Federal Reserve in the United States had much more power to pursue its bond buying several years ago in a program that it is only now winding down.
Mr. Wolff and other Bruegel analysts have said the European Central Bank could probably buy bonds issued by European government agencies, as well as corporate bonds and bank debt. It would be more problematic, they said, to buy the bonds of individual countries.
To embark on any quantitative easing program, Mr. Draghi will have to build consensus among the members of the bank's 24-member Governing Council. He moved judiciously in the bank's latest measures, gaining unanimous support for the policies on Thursday.
In the summer of 2012 as the crisis flared anew, Mr. Draghi similarly built internal support for a sweeping promise to backstop the countries' governments financially and "do whatever it takes" to preserve European unity.
The backing of Germany, the euro zone's largest country, will be particularly important. In the past, dissent from the influential German Bundesbank has undercut support for the European Central Bank.
Despite the challenges, Mr. Draghi laid out on Thursday the most explicit road map to date of what an asset-buying program could look like. The bank, he said, would "intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases." He indicated that it would buy private sector asset-backed securities.
The effect could be limited because the number of securities that qualify is relatively small. But the plan could bring the central bank closer to a broader asset-buying program.
The European Central Bank will also begin offering four-year loans to banks at the benchmark interest rates, under conditions meant to ensure that lenders use the money to issue loans to businesses. Banks will be required to show that their net lending to firms increased as a result of the central-bank cash. If not, banks would be forced to repay the money early.
It is unclear whether euro zone banks will respond to the central bank's action. Many banks are already struggling with large portfolios of problem loans.
"The rate cut, assuming it filters to the market, will assist, but not enough," said Petros Haidemenos, the general manager of Kalamea Foods, a midsize importer that distributes brands like Kettle Chips, Fiji water and Dippin' Dots ice cream snacks in Greece.
Like many Greek businesses, Kalamea Foods has struggled for the last several years, partly because banks lowered or closed credit lines after a wrenching recession. But given the high level of nonperforming loans at Greek banks, Mr. Haidemenos said he doubted that the measures taken on Thursday would unleash the liquidity needed to help jump-start business activity.
"The reason banks are not lending is because they know they will lose the money," he said.

Abstract: Investment banks typically hold tens of billions of dollars of Treasury bonds on their balance sheets, enormous positions that can create trading profits if the prices of the bonds rise. United States Treasuries have benefited partly because government bonds in Europe have had much lower yields, a situation that is likely to continue even as the European Central Bank announces new measures.

Full text:   Wall Street's biggest firms this year made an extraordinary wager that they probably now regret.
Investment banks typically hold tens of billions of dollars of Treasury bonds on their balance sheets, enormous positions that can create trading profits if the prices of the bonds rise. But this year, the banks slashed those holdings, so much so that they actually had a negative position in government bonds in March, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The banks and their clients apparently grew so bearish about the price of Treasuries that they wanted no part of them.
But it was the wrong trade.
Confounding many on Wall Street, prices of government bonds have risen solidly this year, reaping profits for those who continue to hold them. This, in turn, has helped push down interest rates across the economy, providing an unexpected boon to companies and individuals taking out loans. The interest rate on a fixed 30-year mortgage, for instance, started 2014 at 4.53 percent, but it is now down to 4.14 percent, according to data from Freddie Mac.
The big bond-trading firms on Wall Street are now bracing for a bruising to their results.
In early May, a little more than a month into its second quarter, JPMorgan Chase warned that its trading revenue for the period was going to be down about 20 percent from the previous year. Then Citigroup said it expected trading revenue to decline by a similar amount in the second quarter. "The environment for all of the firms is quite difficult right now," Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs's president, said last month.
United States Treasuries have benefited partly because government bonds in Europe have had much lower yields, a situation that is likely to continue even as the European Central Bank announces new measures.
For Wall Street banks, the problems with bond trading go far beyond one quarter's performance or one cut in interest rates.
Fixed-income operations -- the name for the segment that includes trading in bonds, currencies and commodities -- have long dominated and defined Wall Street. Before the financial crisis, swing-for-the-fences bond traders, amplifying their bets with cheap borrowed money, often earned billions for themselves and their firms. Fixed-income operations were the source of big losses in 2008, prompting Congress to pass many new regulations to rein them in.
Despite the new rules, Wall Street banks for some years after the crisis continued to make immense sums from fixed income -- and they were upbeat about the business's prospects. The good results were in part due to the Fed's huge bond-buying programs aimed at stimulating the economy. But in the last couple of years, even as the world's big central banks have continued their stimulus plans, the revenue from Wall Street's fixed-income desks has dwindled. In the first quarter of 2010, the five top American bond-trading banks posted $24.8 billion of combined fixed-income revenue, according to Moody's Investors Service. In the first quarter of this year, the five generated only $14.6 billion of fixed-income revenue.
The drop-off has prompted much speculation.
New regulations are in part to blame, analysts say. A new bank capital rule, for instance, has made it less attractive for Wall Street firms to make loans to clients to buy bonds. "There is structurally less leverage to go around," Richard Ramsden, a bank analyst at Goldman Sachs, said, using the Wall Street term for borrowing. At the same time, he said, Wall Street's big clients simply might not want to borrow as much they did.
Indeed, some large investors have been caught off guard in recent months. They positioned themselves at the start of the year for a fall in bond prices, analysts say. But as that decline failed to materialize, the investors had to offset their negative bets by buying bonds, pushing their prices up even more.
At the same time, bankers say, trading volumes have fallen because clients are struggling to come up with big new trading ideas in markets that they perceive to be predictable. Volumes might pick up, for instance, if investors chose to bet heavily against bonds as they rose. But, for now at least, investors apparently lack the confidence to make contrarian wagers. "You need the volume that comes with the conviction that someone else is wrong," Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial, said.
The malaise in bond trading does not appear to be serious enough to destabilize Wall Street, which, with higher levels of capital than before the crisis, is on a firmer footing. Also, banks are relying on the performance of staple businesses like mergers and acquisitions and wealth management, which is profiting from a strong stock market.
The weakness at bond-trading desks also does not appear to have affected the wider economy. Wall Street firms, for instance, continue to arrange the issuance of new bonds for companies and municipal governments. Corporations use the bond market to raise money for investments, and so far this year, American nonfinancial companies have issued $281 billion in bonds, according to Thomson Reuters. The lower interest rates have also contributed to a $100 billion increase in bank loans to companies this year, according to Fed data.
The strong growth in credit, along with the Fed's stimulus, has convinced some investors and economists that the bond rally could soon end. The economy, they said, looks set to grow more strongly, which would most likely lead to somewhat higher expectations of inflation. "I think the U.S. economy is going to be very strong in the second and third quarters, and I don't see the inflation creep reversing," said Paul Kasriel, an economic adviser at Legacy Private Trust Company.
If inflation expectations increased, investors would start to adjust their portfolios. They would sell bonds, pushing down their prices and increasing their yields. This might in turn lead to a rush of trading that would lift Wall Street volumes. And the banks that have negative positions in Treasuries would profit.
But there have been several false dawns since the crisis, which has convinced some big investors that the economy is stuck in a rut, and they are betting that bond yields will stay at historically low levels.
That is the stance of Lacy H. Hunt of Hoisington Investment Management, based far away from Wall Street in Austin, Tex. One big mistake people have made, he asserts, is believing that the Fed's extraordinary monetary policies would lead to strong economic growth.
"The general overwhelming consensus is that central banks are powerful -- and they are not," Mr. Hunt said. "They are out of the game."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full text:   First there was ZIRP. Now get ready for NIRP.
The first is "zero interest-rate policy," the strategy for trying to stimulate economic growth that the United States has undertaken for the last five and a half years (and the Bank of Japan much longer than that). The second is "negative interest rate policy." And that's what the European Central Bank put in place on Thursday for the 18 nations that use the euro currency.
That makes this a good moment for the curious mental exercise of pondering what a negative interest rate even means, and why it's something that monetary policy mavens have been talking about more than they would like over the last half-decade.
What is a negative interest rate?
When a bank pays a 1 percent interest rate, it's clear what happens: If you deposit your money at the bank, it will pay you a penny each year for every dollar you deposited. When the interest rate is negative, the money goes the other direction.
We're talking about central banks here, but the same notion applies. Commercial banks maintain their reserves electronically at a central bank, like the Federal Reserve in the United States or an arm of the European Central Bank in Europe. In normal times, they are paid an interest rate set by the central bank for reserves they keep on deposit beyond what is needed to meet regulatory requirements. If the E.C.B. moves to a negative interest rate, they will instead have to pay the central bank to park money there.
Put bluntly: Normally the banks pay you to keep your money there. Under negative rates, you pay them for the privilege.
Why would the E.C.B. do that?
Inflation in Europe has fallen far below the 2 percent or so that the central bank aims for, unemployment remains high in much of the continent, and growth sluggish. The central banker's usual answer to that set of problems is simple: Cut interest rates. But with the E.C.B. already paying zero percent on deposits that banks park with it, the only way to cut rates further is to go into negative territory.
The theory is that when it becomes more costly for European banks to keep money in the E.C.B., they will have incentive to do something else with it: Lend it out to consumers or businesses, for example. Or if negative rates make it less attractive for global investors to park money in Europe, it could cause the euro to fall on currency markets, helping reverse a rise in its value that has made European exporters less competitive.
How will banks react to negative rates?
Banks will most likely pass these negative interest rates on to consumers, or at least try to. They may try to do so not by explicitly charging a negative interest rate, but by paying no interest and charging a fee for account maintenance.
(For example, if you have 10,000 euros in an account and the bank starts levying a 25-euro maintenance fee, you've just effectively received an -0.25 percent interest rate.)
On the other hand, if the interest rate is only slightly negative, banks may just eat the loss in order to avoid alienating customers. If they do that, however, it will cut into bank profitability.
But, if you make interest rates negative, won't people just withdraw their money?
Maybe! This is one of the big reasons that the E.C.B. has moved so reluctantly toward a negative interest rate and the Fed, Bank of Japan and Bank of England haven't gone that direction.
It is possible that, assuming banks pass along the negative rates through either fees or explicitly charging negative interest, people will withdraw their money as cash rather than keeping it on deposit at banks. As the Harvard economist N. Greg Mankiw put it wryly at a 2010 Boston Fed conference: "What a depositor is going to do is say, 'Well, if they're going to charge me money to keep my money at the bank, I'm just going to keep my money at home,' and the only thing you'll generate is a demand for safe assets -- and by that I mean . . . they're going to be buying a bunch of safes so people can put their money in their safes rather than in the bank."
That is one big reason that the E.C.B. and other central banks are going to be reluctant to make rates highly negative; it could result in people pulling cash out of the banking system.
Indeed, the economist Miles Kimball of the University of Michigan has argued that if cash were eliminated and only electronic money existed, the so-called zero lower bound on interest rates would no longer exist, and central banks could easily set negative interest rates in a depressed economy to encourage more spending and investment.
Has anybody done this before? What happened?
Denmark did it, imposing a -0.2 percent rate on bank deposits in 2012. As Jack Ewing of The International New York Times reports, there was no drastic effect one way or another -- neither a remarkable boom in lending and economic activity, nor wholesale withdrawals of deposits from the Danish banking system. "Was this a silver bullet for the Danish economy? No, it was not," said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, told Mr. Ewing.
Aren't there other ways the E.C.B. could try to get Europe out of its low-inflation trap?
There are, but Mario Draghi, the bank's president, has resisted the preferred tool of the American, British, and Japanese central banks, which is "quantitative easing," or buying longer-term securities to pump money into the financial system.
It would be politically risky for the E.C.B. to buy bonds issued by European governments, a no-no in the founding mission of the common central bank. And private European debt markets are not as developed in the United States, so it would be hard for the E.C.B. to emulate, for example, the Fed's strategy of buying mortgage-backed securities that fund home loans in the United States.
That brings us back to NIRP. Now central bank watchers will get to watch yet another monetary policy experiment in an era that has been filled with them.

Full text:   SECAUCUS, N.J. -- In 1991, the Yankees selected Brien Taylor, a high school left-hander, with the first overall pick in baseball's amateur draft. His failure to make the majors scared teams away from showing similar faith in a prep pitcher in the 22 drafts that followed.
That streak ended Thursday when the Houston Astros took Brady Aiken, a left-hander from Cathedral Catholic High School in San Diego, with the first pick in the 2014 draft.
To blame Taylor for the aversion to high school pitchers may seem unfair, but he stands out as perhaps the worst No. 1 pick since the draft was introduced in 1965. He not only never reached the major leagues but also never played above Class AA, with an off-the-field fight in 1993 resulting in a badly injured rotator cuff. Taylor, Matt Bush (San Diego Padres, 2004) and Steve Chilcott (Mets, 1966) are the only No. 1 picks -- aside from the last two, Mark Appel and Carlos Correa -- to never play in the majors.
Aiken, 17, put together a prep career that was nothing short of dominant. In three seasons, he pitched 1602/3 innings and struck out 260 batters while compiling a 1.09 earned run average, according to MaxPreps.com.
With a mid-90s fastball, a strong curveball and a developing changeup, the 6-foot-4 Aiken is more major league ready than the typical high school pitcher, and he said he was looking forward to soon being a part of a World Series-winning Astros team.
In a conference call after his selection, Aiken described himself as a hard-throwing left-hander in the mold of David Price and Clayton Kershaw.
"Those are the two people who I model my game after," Aiken said. "I try to do everything they do."
Becoming the first high school pitcher since Taylor to be picked first was humbling for Aiken, he said, but he believes he earned the distinction, having sharpened his focus after a trip to Taiwan with the United States' 18-and-under team.
"It's a big honor," he said. "I've worked hard enough, and I've done everything I could to put myself in that position."
The Astros, in a first, were picking at the top of the draft for the third consecutive year. Houston has been rebuilding aggressively for the last few seasons and had the luxury of drafting a long-term project like the young Aiken because its minor league system is stocked with major-league-ready prospects. Correa, the first pick in 2012, was also 17 when he was drafted, and he has rewarded the Astros' faith with a strong start to his minor league career.
Now the Astros will try to persuade Aiken to sign rather than honor his commitment to pitch for U.C.L.A. next season. Major League Baseball has allotted $7.9 million for Aiken's signing bonus, which is a far cry from the $1.55 million ($2.7 million when adjusted for inflation) that the Yankees gave Taylor in 1991.
Things continued to look up for high school pitchers Thursday when the Miami Marlins picked Tyler Kolek, a right-hander from Shepherd High School in Shepherd, Tex., at No. 2.
A 6-5 18-year-old with a 100-mile-per-hour fastball, Kolek was considered among the best pitchers in the draft, but the selection came as a surprise because the Marlins passed on Carlos Rodon, a polished college left-hander who was born in Miami and has Cuban roots. Many thought the Marlins would love to pair Rodon with Jose Fernandez, a Cuban and the 2013 National League rookie of the year.
Rodon ended up going to the Chicago White Sox at No. 3.
The Mets used the No. 10 pick on Mike Conforto, a power-hitting outfielder from Oregon State. Conforto, whose father was a linebacker at Penn State, was the 2013 Pacific-12 player of the year.
Because they signed Jacoby Ellsbury as a free agent, the Yankees had to surrender their first-round pick to the Boston Red Sox, leaving the Yankees with only the No. 55 pick on Day 1. They used the pick on Jacob Lindgren, a left-handed reliever from Mississippi State who is considered nearly ready for big-league action.
The draft is in its sixth year in a prime-time format, with the first two rounds televised on MLB Network. It will continue with Rounds 3 through 10 on Friday and Rounds 11 through 40 on Saturday.

Full text:   The surest way to fight poverty is to achieve stronger economic growth. That, anyway, is a view embedded in the thinking of a lot of politicians and economists.
"The federal government," Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, wrote in The Wall Street Journal, "needs to remember that the best anti-poverty program is economic growth," which is not so different from the argument put forth by John F. Kennedy (in a somewhat different context) that "a rising tide lifts all boats."
In Kennedy's era, that had the benefit of being true. From 1959 to 1973, the nation's economy per person grew 82 percent, and that was enough to drive the proportion of the poor population from 22 percent to 11 percent.
But over the last generation in the United States, that simply hasn't happened. Growth has been pretty good, up 147 percent per capita. But rather than decline further, the poverty rate has bounced around in the 12 to 15 percent range -- higher than it was even in the early 1970s. The mystery of why -- and how to change that -- is one of the most fundamental challenges in the nation's fight against poverty.
The disconnect between growth and poverty reduction is a key finding of a sweeping new study of wages from the Economic Policy Institute. The liberal-leaning group's policy prescriptions are open to debate, but this piece of data the researchers find is hard to dispute: From 1959 to 1973, a more robust United States economy and fewer people living below the poverty line went hand-in-hand. That relationship broke apart in the mid-1970s. If the old relationship between growth and poverty had held up, the E.P.I. researchers find, the poverty rate in the United States would have fallen to zero by 1986 and stayed there ever since.
"It used to be that as G.D.P. per capita grew, poverty declined in lock step," said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at E.P.I. and an author of the study. "There was a very tight relationship between overall growth and fewer and fewer Americans living in poverty. Starting in the â[euro]²70s, that link broke."
Now, one shouldn't interpret that too literally. The 1959 to 1973 period might be an unfair benchmark. The Great Society social safety net programs were being put in place, and they may have had a poverty-lowering effect separate from that of the overall economic trends. In other words, it may be simply that during that time, strong growth and a falling poverty rate happened to take place simultaneously for unrelated reasons. And there presumably is some level of poverty below which the official poverty rate will never fall, driven by people whose problems run much deeper than economics.
But the facts still cast doubt on the notion that growth alone will solve America's poverty problem.
If you are committed to the idea that poor families need to work to earn a living, this has been a great three decades. For households in the bottom 20 percent of earnings in the United States -- in 2012, that meant less than $14,687 a year -- the share of income from wages, benefits and tax credits has risen from 57.5 percent of their total income in 1979 to 69.7 percent in 2010.
The percentage of their income from public benefits, including Medicaid, food stamps, Social Security and unemployment insurance, has fallen in that time.
The fact that more of poor families' income is coming from wages doesn't necessarily mean that they're getting paid more, though. In fact, based on the E.P.I.'s analysis of data from the Census Bureau, it appears that what income gains they are seeing are coming from working more hours, not from higher hourly pay.
Indeed, if you adjust for the higher number of hours worked, over the 1979 to 2007 period (selected to avoid the effects of the steep recession that began in 2008), hourly pay for the bottom 20 percent of households rose only 3.2 percent. Total, not per year. In other words, in nearly three decades, these lower-income workers saw no meaningful gain in what they were paid for an hour of labor. Their overall inflation-adjusted income rose a bit, but mainly because they put in more hours of work.
The researchers at E.P.I. also looked at demographic factors that contribute to poverty, including race, education levels and changes in family structure (such as the number of one-parent versus two-parent households). This look at the data also shows rising inequality as the biggest factor in contributing to the poverty rate, dwarfing those other shifts.
Debates over what kind of social welfare system the United States ought to have are always polarizing, from the creation of the Great Society in the 1960s to the Clinton welfare reforms of the 1990s to the Paul Ryan budgets of this era. Conservatives tend to attribute the persistence of poverty, even amid economic growth, to the perverse incentives that a welfare state creates against working.
But the reality is that low-income workers are putting in more hours on the job than they did a generation ago -- and the financial rewards for doing so just haven't increased.
That's the real lesson of the data: If you want to address poverty in the United States, it's not enough to say that you need to create better incentives for lower-income people to work. You also have to devise strategies that make the benefits of a stronger economy show up in the wages of the people on the edge of poverty, who need it most desperately.

Full text:   BRASÍLIA -- The year was 1970. Agents of Brazil's military dictatorship had arrested Dilma Rousseff, then a member of a fledgling urban guerrilla group, the Palmares Armed Revolutionary Vanguard. Inside the prison where she was being held in São Paulo, a debate raged among the inmates: Should they support Brazil in that year's World Cup?
"At that time, many people opposed to the government initially questioned whether we would be strengthening the dictatorship by rooting for Brazil's team," Ms. Rousseff, 66, who is now Brazil's president, said in an interview here on Tuesday. "I had no such dilemma."
She said resistance dissipated among the jailed guerrillas in the period leading up to Brazil's victory over Italy in the championship match, which took place in Mexico City.
With Brazil's government facing widespread discontent over its preparations for the World Cup, Ms. Rousseff made the rare public reference to her imprisonment decades ago, when interrogators tortured her during three years in jail. Sipping orange juice and nibbling on cashews at a spacious circular table in her office, she defended loans from state banks for new stadiums for the soccer tournament and insisted that Brazilians planning to shun the event were a "small minority."
As the start of this year's World Cup on June 12 approaches, Ms. Rousseff is grappling with a wave of strikes, a sluggish economy and a presidential race pitting her against rivals who have climbed in public opinion polls. While she is still viewed as a favorite in the October elections, her government has come under criticism over delays in finishing World Cup construction and an array of other stalled public works projects.
A survey released on Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that 72 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the way things were going in Brazil, up from 55 percent just weeks before huge street protests in June 2013 shook Brazilian cities.
The survey, based on 1,003 face-to-face interviews with Brazilian adults in April, also found that two-thirds said Brazil's economy was in bad shape, and that 61 percent thought hosting the World Cup was a bad idea because it took resources away from public services, including health care and education.
The glum mood, which follows an economic boom that culminated in 7.5 percent growth in 2010, has been compounded by scandals at Brazil's national oil company, Petrobras, and a multiyear slowdown in economic growth. The economy grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2014, slower than the 0.4 percent expansion reported in the previous three months.
Still, Ms. Rousseff, a member of the leftist Workers Party that has governed Brazil since 2003, vigorously defended her economic record in an hourlong interview at the presidential palace in the modernist capital, Brasília. She insisted that various measures showed that life had generally improved in Brazil.
Citing antipoverty projects that have pulled millions of people into the middle class over the last decade, she said incomes for poorer Brazilians had risen well above the rate of inflation, making Brazil's progress in reducing poverty comparable to Spain's experience after the death in 1975 of the dictator Francisco Franco, which ushered in a transition to democratic government.
Emphasizing that inequality had fallen in Brazil while growing in the United States and parts of Europe, Ms. Rousseff, an economist by training, spoke glowingly of the work of Thomas Piketty, the professor at the Paris School of Economics whose sweeping studies of inequality have gained widespread attention.
"I think he's done a fantastic job," Ms. Rousseff said of Mr. Piketty, who has stood by his conclusions about the evolution of wealth inequality after The Financial Times attacked his data.
Ms. Rousseff said that rising incomes in Brazil had created new challenges, reflected in the large demonstrations that have given way to smaller protests, often led by housing activists or anti-establishment groups. She said that many of the protesters' complaints about the poor quality of services, whether from governments or private companies, were understandable.
"Services grew less than income," she said, noting as an example the surging access to air travel in Brazil, which has left many travelers fatigued at the mere thought of dealing with the country's swamped airport infrastructure. Brazil's larger middle class, she said, has "more desire, more longings, more demands."
"This forms an intrinsic part of the human being in the society in which we live," she said. "He obtains something, but he wants more, which is very good."
Beyond the challenges her government faces before the World Cup, with security forces bracing for a possible return of large-scale protests against spending on the tournament, Ms. Rousseff said the event offered an opportunity to strengthen Brazil's position on the global stage.
She also said she was prepared for a thaw in relations with the United States, after a souring last year over revelations that the National Security Agency had spied on Ms. Rousseff and her inner circle of senior aides. She noted her plans to meet with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when he visits Brazil this month to watch the United States soccer team play Ghana.
"I'm certain we can pick up our relations where we left off," Ms. Rousseff said. She said she was prepared to consider rescheduling a state visit to Washington, which she had postponed in September in response to the N.S.A. revelations.
In other matters, Ms. Rousseff said she expected Brazil to continue raising its diplomatic and economic profile in Latin America and the Caribbean. She singled out Cuba as a country where Brazilian companies were making inroads. "We're betting much more on a policy of investment than a blockade," she said, referring to the United States' trade embargo against Cuba, which began in 1960.
In one example of Brazil's strengthening ties with Cuba, the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has carried out a $900 million upgrade of Cuba's Mariel port. Ms. Rousseff said that overhauling Cuba's economy required the application of "more market forces, not less."
Helping Cuba to open its economy also reflects on Brazil's, and Ms. Rousseff's, political evolution since military rule ended here in 1985. While Brazil now has a president who was a Marxist guerrilla in her youth, it stands out among its neighbors for a law under which perpetrators of rights abuses during the dictatorship are shielded from prosecution.
Brazil's highest court has upheld the amnesty law, meaning that Ms. Rousseff's torturers remain free even as commissions examine the politically motivated crimes of that era.
Ms. Rousseff said that as president, she respected the law, despite her personal views. "I don't believe in vindictiveness, but I also don't believe in forgiving," she said.
"It's a question of the truth," she added. "It's extremely important for Brazil to know what happened, because that will mean it won't happen again."

Full text:   FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi might feel like a doctor trying to treat a chronically ill patient with unproven medicines.
Consider one of the remedies that Mr. Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is widely expected to announce on Thursday as part of an increasingly urgent effort to prevent the euro zone from falling into deflation.
As one of its prescriptions, the E.C.B. is expected to start charging banks interest to keep money at the institution, a so-called negative deposit rate meant to weaken the euro and discourage investors from hoarding cash. Such action, meant to stimulate the economy, is almost certain after inflation in the euro zone fell to a 0.5 percent rate in May, far below the target of 2 percent.
The risk of applying a negative deposit rate, though, is that it has rarely been tried before. The most recent test case is Denmark, which has 5.6 million people.
That country, which is not a member of the euro zone but pegs its currency closely to the euro, employed a negative deposit rate from July 2012 until this past April to discourage foreign investors from piling into the country as a hedge against global turmoil.
Overwhelming demand for the kroner threatened to push up its value against the euro and undercut exports. But with Danish interest rates in negative territory, foreign speculators soon turned their gazes elsewhere. The kroner came back to earth and the export economy kept chugging along.
But what effect a negative deposit rate would have in the euro zone -- with 18 member countries, 330 million people and many banks struggling to make a profit -- is largely a matter of conjecture. The same uncertainties are true of other options that Mr. Draghi may have.
Like any central bank, the E.C.B. can theoretically print as much money as it wants to head off the threat of deflation, a destructive downward spiral of prices, profits and wages that could send tremors through the global economy. But injecting money into circulation is not as it easy as it might seem, especially in the euro zone.
In the United States, Japan and Britain, central banks have purchased large quantities of bonds of their own governments or bought private assets -- a way of pumping stimulus money into the economy even when official interest rates were already very low.
For the E.C.B. to do the same thing, it would have to buy a mix of government bonds and other assets in the 18 members of the euro zone. Any mix is sure to provoke controversy, political infighting and perhaps even legal challenges.
"Who should decide what kind of debt the E.C.B. should buy?" said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. "I think it's possible to do. But it's much more complicated in Europe than in the U.S. or U.K. or Japan."
Mr. Darvas and other analysts say this strategy, known as quantitative easing, is the only way to rescue the euro zone from deflation, which is already a reality in Greece and several other countries.
Perhaps fearful of the controversy, though, the E.C.B. is not expected to initiate quantitative easing on Thursday despite the continued, worrisome downward drift of inflation.
Instead, the 24 members of the E.C.B.'s Governing Council are expected to cut the benchmark interest rate to 0.1 percent, from 0.25 percent, which is already a record low.
More significant would be the negative interest rate: The E.C.B. is expected to cut the deposit rate, the interest paid on bank deposits held at the central bank, to below zero, probably to minus 0.1 percent.
In other words, banks would have to pay for the safety offered by central bank vaults. The measure would be intended to weaken the euro by imposing a de facto penalty on investors who hold the currency, and perhaps to encourage banks to deploy more of their money rather than hoarding it.
That's the theory. But there is not much precedent to go on. Switzerland imposed a negative rate on bank deposits owned by nonresidents in the 1970s to try to weaken the Swiss franc, according to research by the Danish central bank. Sweden had a negative rate in 2009 and 2010, but it applied to only a small number of deposits.
For Denmark to be cast as a role model for the euro zone is something of a paradox, considering that the country does not use the euro and is notably hostile to the European Union, even though it is a member.
The far-right, anti-European Union Danish People's Party won 27 percent of the votes in elections to the European Parliament last month, more than any other party in Denmark.
The Danish experience suggests that a negative rate in the euro zone would help cap the exchange rate of the euro, which would be good for European exporters. But the minus rate is not likely to ease the credit crunch that afflicts much of Southern Europe. On the contrary, the negative rate could weaken struggling banks further by imposing additional costs.
"Was this a silver bullet for the Danish economy? No, it was not," said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
In July 2012, the National Bank of Denmark imposed a negative rate of minus 0.2 percent on bank deposits stored at the central bank.
Contrary to some fears, the move did not create chaos in financial markets or cause bank computers to crash as they struggled to process data for which they were never programmed. The Danish central bank issued plenty of warnings that a negative rate was on the way, giving banks time to prepare. The E.C.B. has sent its own signals that it intends to make such move.
"Zero is just a number," Mr. Rasmussen said. "The world goes on."
Denmark did face a downside, though. The negative rate cost Danish banks the equivalent of 50 million euros, or $68 million, in interest paid to the central bank and other costs, according to the Danish Bankers Association. The burden was not catastrophic, but it was unwelcome at a time when banks -- like many banks in the euro zone today -- were struggling to recover from the financial crisis.
The policy did prompt some investors to withdraw money from the central bank and invest it in assets, like mortgage bonds, that paid interest. But the stimulus effect on the Danish economy was modest, analysts say.
"I don't think the ordinary Danish citizen was aware we had negative interest rates," said Niels Storm Stenbaek, chief economist of the Danish Bankers Association.
The biggest lesson from Denmark may be that the negative rate was not that big a deal. So Mr. Draghi and his colleagues may need to use much more potent medicines to prevent deflation.
For example, the E.C.B. could offer another round of cheap loans to banks, with strings attached so they lend the money to small and midsize businesses, which are starved for credit in many countries. Such a program could be announced on Thursday, as could a modest program to buy bundles of business loans.
But many analysts and economists say even these measures would be inadequate, and they are calling for a program of asset purchases -- despite the complications and political controversy such a move would engender.
"The only thing that remains and would have a potential impact," Mr. Darvas of Bruegel said, "is quantitative easing."

Abstract: Medicare beneficiaries and those covered by commercial insurance pay significantly less through negotiated payments for treatments -- others say the list prices are meaningful to the uninsured, to private insurers that have to negotiate reimbursements with hospitals or to consumers with high-deductible plans.

Full text:   CORRECTION APPENDEDCharges for some of the most common inpatient procedures surged at hospitals across the country in 2012 from a year earlier, some at more than four times the national rate of inflation, according to data released by Medicare officials on Monday.
While it has long been known that hospitals bill Medicare widely varying amounts -- sometimes many multiples of what Medicare typically reimburses -- for the same procedure, an analysis of the data by The New York Times shows how much the price of some procedures rose in just one year's time.
Experts in the health care world differ over the meaning of hospital charges.
While hospitals say they are unimportant -- Medicare beneficiaries and those covered by commercial insurance pay significantly less through negotiated payments for treatments -- others say the list prices are meaningful to the uninsured, to private insurers that have to negotiate reimbursements with hospitals or to consumers with high-deductible plans.
"You're seeing a lot more benefit packages out there with co-insurance amounts that require the holders to pay 20 percent of a lab test or 20 percent of an X-ray. Well, 20 percent of which price?" asked Glenn Melnick, a professor who holds a Blue Cross of California endowed chair at the University of Southern California. "Some hospitals will charge 20 percent of what Blue Cross Blue Shield will pay; others will play games."
Charges for chest pain, for instance, rose 10 percent to an average of $18,505 in 2012, from $16,815 in 2011. Average hospital charges for digestive disorders climbed 8.5 percent to nearly $22,000, from $20,278 in 2011.
In 2012, hospitals charged more for every one of 98 common ailments that could be compared to the previous year. For all but seven, the increase in charges exceeded the nation's 2 percent inflation rate for that year, according to The Times's analysis.
Experts say the increase in the price of some of the most common procedures may be offsetting rising technology or drug costs, declines in the number of patients being admitted to hospitals and a leveling out of reimbursements from Medicare. Between 2011 and 2012, Medicare increased payment rates by only 1 percent for most inpatient stays.
The number of patients admitted for chest pain under Medicare's fee-for-service plans plummeted more than 28,000, to 107,224 in 2012, and inpatients with digestive disorders decreased more than 29,000, to 217,514.
Over all, the number of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals for the comparable 98 most common diagnoses dropped from 7.5 million to 7.2 million. The total amount Medicare paid for their care also declined somewhat between 2011 and 2012, from $62.8 billion to $61.9 billion.
In an effort to reduce overall health care costs, hospitals have been encouraged to admit fewer patients for conditions like asthma, for example, in favor of less expensive outpatient care.
Still, hospital charges make up nearly a third of the nation's $2.7 trillion health care bill.
The data for 3,317 hospitals, released for the first time last year by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, again shows broad variations in what hospitals charge for the same procedure. While experts debate why one hospital charges significantly more than another for the same procedure, Medicare does pay slightly higher treatment rates to certain hospitals -- like teaching facilities and hospitals in areas with high labor costs.
Reasons for other discrepancies are less clear.
In 2011, the Wuesthoff Medical Center in Rockledge, Fla., a hospital with 300 beds near Cape Canaveral, charged patients admitted for a severe irregular heartbeat an average of $25,361. A year later, the average charge more than doubled to $53,597.
In Muncie, Ind., the price of treating a kidney or urinary tract infection at Indiana University Health Ball Memorial Hospital jumped 70 percent to $38,873 in a year. And at Baptist Medical Center in San Antonio, the charge for esophagitis and other digestive disorders rose 34 percent to more than $46,000. A call and emails to Ball Memorial were not returned, and a spokeswoman for Baptist said the hospital didn't have the time to analyze the data itself.
The new hospital charge data follows the release in April of Medicare's physician billing records for 2012. To some, the data is bringing increased transparency and fueling the ongoing national dialogue about financially debilitating health care bills faced all too often by consumers.
"We think this is a big deal. We think it's very important that people can have conversations about prevailing charges and variation in charges among hospitals," said Niall Brennan, acting director of the Offices of Enterprise Management at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Mr. Brennan made his comments in Washington at Health Datapalooza, a conference focused on digital innovation in health care. The administration also announced a platform called openFDA, which includes data on millions of drug-related adverse events and errors reported to the Food and Drug Administration by doctors and members of the public from 2004 to 2013.
But the charge data may also, in part, reflect a huge shift among hospitals.
The industry has been caught up the biggest wave of mergers since the 1990s, a reaction, in part, to President Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. That law, experts say, is transforming the economics of health care and pushing a growing number of hospitals into mergers.
On top of that, hospitals are spending enormous amounts of money buying up physicians' practices and groups while investing billions of dollars to upgrade to digital health records.
While those and other moves have caused hospital spending on administrative costs to soar, they still do not explain the continued surge in charges, experts say.
"It just isn't clear what has gone into the increase in hospital charges for the past decade," said Dr. Hamilton Moses III, chairman of the consulting firm Alerion Advisors and an adjunct professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University. "But if you look at the Veterans Administration and the amount of administrative costs that are eating up the moneys that should go to direct health care, that's a pattern that is repeated everywhere."
And while there is still broad debate over whether the investment that hospitals are making in information technology will ultimately lower costs by, for instance, reducing unnecessary tests, there are growing concerns that the wave of consolidation may be increasing prices. Bigger hospital systems are viewed by some as having increased leverage in negotiating prices with commercial insurers.
Nowhere may the impact of hospital mergers be more visible than with Wuesthoff Medical Center. A nonprofit system that traces its roots back to 1941 when it opened a 10-bed community hospital, Wuesthoff was acquired in 2010 by the for-profit hospital giant Health Management Associates, recently bought by Community Health Systems.
Over all, the prices charged at Wuesthoff went from 12 percent below the national average to 32 percent above it, based on its case mix.
Between 2011 and 2012, prices for 77 out of the 98 most common ailments for which patients were admitted to the hospital increased. Treatment for a simple case of pneumonia rose by about 25 percent from $39,217 to $49,284. The average hospital charged $38,384 in 2012.
But Wuesthoff's charges for a major a small- or large-intestine procedure rocketed 168 percent to $152,047 in 2012 from $56,704 in 2011. The average hospital charged $68,982 in 2012.
In an email, Sara Virgin, a spokeswoman for Wuesthoff Health System, said, "Although the hospital's charges increased, the amount the hospital is actually reimbursed for these services has not significantly changed." She added that Medicare determines what it will pay for services, commercial payers negotiate rates, and the hospital offers discounts to the uninsured.
"When considering the cost of health care, what matters most to consumers is the actual amount paid for their care, not the hospital's charges," she said.
Correction: June 5, 2014, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about soaring hospital charges for some common inpatient procedures misstated the number of Medicare patients discharged from hospitals in 2011 for the comparable 98 most common diagnoses seen in The Times's review of data for 2011 and 2012. There were 7.5 million, not 7.45 million, discharged.

Abstract: "In past rounds of minimum wage increases, proposals sought chiefly to restore the value of the minimum wage lost to inflation over the decades," said Paul Sonn, the general counsel and program director at the National Employment Law Project, a New York-based group that supports raising the minimum wage.

Full text:   SEATTLE -- The City Council here went where no big-city lawmakers have gone before on Monday, raising the local minimum wage to $15 an hour, more than double the federal minimum, and pushing Seattle to the forefront of urban efforts to address income inequality.
The unanimous vote of the nine-member Council, after months of discussion by a committee of business and labor leaders convened by Mayor Ed Murray, will give low-wage workers here -- in incremental stages, with different tracks for different sizes of business -- the highest big-city minimum in the nation.
"Even before the Great Recession a lot of us have started to have doubt and concern about the basic economic promise that underpins economic life in the United States," said Sally J. Clark, a Council member. "Today Seattle answers that challenge," she added. "We go into uncharted, unevaluated territory."
But some business owners who have questioned the proposal say that the city's booming economy is creating an illusion of permanence. The fat times and the ability to pay higher wages, they warn, will not go on forever.
"We're living in this bubble of Amazon, but that's not going to go on," said Tom Douglas, a prominent restaurateur in Seattle, referring to the local boom in jobs and economic growth from hiring at Amazon, the online retailer, which has its headquarters here. Mr. Douglas said the new law will inevitably result in costs being passed on to consumers. "There's going to be some terrific price inflation," he said.
The measure has the support of Mr. Murray, who ran last year on a pledge to raise the wage to $15 and made it one of his first priorities in office.
Cheers and jeers repeatedly erupted in the City Hall meeting room, which was packed with supporters of the plan, who often interrupted speakers in the 90-minute debate before the vote with chants.
"We did it -- workers did this," said Kshama Sawant, a socialist who campaigned for a $15 minimum wage when she was elected to the Council last year. Ms. Sawant sought to accelerate the carrying out of the measure and to strip out a lower youth wage training rate, but the council rejected her proposals.
The vote, economists and labor experts said, accentuates the patchwork in wages around the country, with places like Seattle -- and other cities considering sharply higher minimum pay, including San Diego, Chicago and San Francisco -- having economic outlooks increasingly distinct from those in other parts of the nation. Through much of the South, especially, the federal minimum of $7.25 holds fast.
Eight states plus the District of Columbia have already increased their minimum wages this year, the most to have done so in a single year since 2006, and at least eight other states and municipalities could put minimum wage ballot measures before voters by November. But it is the scale of ambition that is catching the attention of economists, labor leaders and business owners.
"In past rounds of minimum wage increases, proposals sought chiefly to restore the value of the minimum wage lost to inflation over the decades," said Paul Sonn, the general counsel and program director at the National Employment Law Project, a New York-based group that supports raising the minimum wage. The increases in places like Seattle, Mr. Sonn said, go beyond playing catch-up. "The $15 proposals make real gains," he said.
Economists who study the minimum wage are not sure of the effect of having sharply different levels -- in some places, it is twice that of others. Though records are a bit uncertain, people who track minimum wage law say the range of mandated minimums, lowest to highest, is the largest it has been since a national minimum was established by Congress in 1938.
"Nobody has studied a doubling of the minimum wage -- that's outside our experience," said Dale Belman, a professor of labor and industrial relations at Michigan State University and co-author of a coming book about the minimum wage.
Individual workers and business owners in and around Seattle are unsure of the implications. Washington State already has the highest state minimum wage in the nation, $9.32, but more than 24 percent of Seattle residents earn hourly wages of $15 or less, according to the city, and approximately 13.6 percent of Seattle residents live below the federal poverty level.
Under the plan approved on Monday, the hourly wage will rise to $15 by 2017 for employers with more than 500 workers that do not provide health insurance, and by 2018 for those large employers who do. The minimum will be phased in through 2021 for smaller employers.
In its early years, the law allows employers to include tips as part of a workers' compensation in reaching the minimum, but that provision is phased out over time.
"The short-term side of it says it's attractive," said Mickey Adame, a bartender who works in Bellevue, Washington's fifth-largest city, which is just outside Seattle, and the new $15 wage boundary. "But I think people in Seattle aren't going to tip as much, knowing the servers are getting paid $15," added Mr. Adame, who lives in Seattle and is trying to start a music record label called Sounder Music, for which his tip jar, he said, is crucial. "If I had to pick an answer, I would say I think I'll make more in Bellevue."
Ms. Sawant, in her comments to the Council and the crowd, did not take the tone of someone who was savoring a victory. The fight for workers' rights and economic fairness, she said, is not over.
"We have fought to the last day, the last hour, against all the loopholes demanded by business," she said. "The attempts of business to undermine $15 will continue," she said, as would the battle to "turn the tide against corporate politics."
She added: "$15 in Seattle is just a beginning. We have an entire world to win."

Full text:   WASHINGTON -- IF you think your commute is getting worse, it's probably not your imagination. And no, it's not because there are more cars on the road. The potholes, the stalled construction projects, the congestion -- it's because the highway trust fund is almost empty and, without a fix, could run out of money this summer.
Federal transportation funding relies heavily on user-based fees, in the form of gas taxes. While that worked for decades, it began to break down after Congress stopped raising the tax, which has been stuck at 18.4 cents a gallon for over 20 years. Since then, people have begun driving less and using more fuel-efficient cars, which means less tax is paid. Even worse, the tax is not indexed to inflation.
In the past Congress has adopted a series of stopgaps to shore up the fund. But unless we reform the way we pay for transportation improvements, we will keep lurching from funding crisis to funding crisis, with our roads getting worse by the year. The only solution is to supplement the tax with dedicated federal funding -- which would not only solve the money problem, but open the door to long-dreamed-of innovations in our transportation system.
The obvious solution, raising the gas tax, is a political nonstarter. And even if it could pass, Congress would be tempted to direct some or all of that revenue to other purposes, like deficit reduction -- it did just that in 1990 and 1993.
In any case, raising the gas tax wouldn't help in the long run. When America planned the Interstate System in the 1950s, only half the country was urbanized and the number of cars was growing rapidly. Now more than 80 percent of Americans live in metropolitan regions, and total driving has stagnated. Even if we could raise the tax, it would only reinforce an outdated program.
While the idea of a user fee for our highways has its appeal, it fails to capture the full role of transportation in our economy. A better transportation system can keep the costs of goods down, provide access to jobs and labor, reduce emissions and prevent fatalities and injuries. Why should users bear the cost alone when everyone enjoys the benefits?
And the gas tax has all sorts of limitations -- most notably a mandate that 80 percent of national transportation funds be returned directly to users, and therefore spent on highways. This inhibits expansion of other transportation modes and prevents systematic planning. And funding decisions are largely based on where gas-tax revenues are generated, rather than where we might find the greatest return on our investment.
No other developed nation relies so heavily on user fees like the gas tax. While other countries typically have much higher gas taxes, they do not dedicate these revenues to transportation. Instead, they use general revenues.
So should America. One option is to dedicate part of the income tax revenue that corresponds to transportation's contribution to gross domestic product, or about 10 percent (around $160 billion). Dedicating even half of that to transportation would cover America's needs and effectively align transportation with economic growth.
Programs funded by general revenues have already been used to spur innovation across many modes and jurisdictions. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery program, part of the 2009 stimulus package, has funded over $1 billion in investments in freight, transit, highways and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.
Similarly, the Urban Partnership Agreement, a program initiated under President George W. Bush, helped move the politically challenging but economically beneficial concept of congestion pricing forward in several cities.
Because they were not focused on returning money to users, both of these programs were somewhat insulated from the political forces that surround transportation funding, and were more focused on getting the federal government the maximum return on its investments.
In a haphazard way, switching to a system paid for by general funds is already happening by default: We have infused the trust fund with over $55 billion in general fund revenues since 2008 (not including stimulus funding), and proposals from the president and the House of Representatives have called for $150 billion and $125 billion more, respectively, both funded through corporate tax reform.
The problem with these actions and proposals is that they are one-time, short-term fixes, while transportation projects take years to complete. Effective modern transportation is less about building more highways, and more about operating our existing systems more effectively while harnessing the benefits of technology. Your commute is unlikely to improve until we pay for and invest in transportation as if it's the 21st century.

Full text:   EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO RULE ON STATE BUDGETS
The European Commission, the top policy-making body in the European Union, is expected to give verdicts on Monday on whether budgets for the 28 member states pass muster -- an annual procedure aimed at preventing future economic crises. Much of the attention is likely to be on whether France has done enough to reform an economy plagued by weak growth and high unemployment, and on whether Italy will be able to take adequate steps to prune its towering national debt. The so-called country specific recommendations represent the first major announcement by the European authority since a raft of anti-E.U. parties made big gains in legislative elections last month, including in France. JAMES KANTER
WALL STREET ANTICIPATES GROWTH IN MANUFACTURING
On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will announce the reading of its manufacturing index for May. The factory sector has been a bit more robust recently, buoyed by industries like automobiles and aircraft, and Wall Street is expecting the I.S.M. index to rise to 55.5, from 54.9 in April, which would make the May figure the latest in a series of steady gains this year.

CARMAKERS TO REPORT SALES OF NEW VEHICLES
Automakers on Tuesday will report new-vehicle sales in the United States for May. Industry analysts expect strong results, as consumer demand for new cars and trucks continues to grow after sluggish sales earlier in the year. General Motors will be watched closely for signs that car buyers are avoiding its brands because of safety recalls. BILL VLASIC
EUROPE'S BANK TO DECIDE ON STIMULUS MEASURES
The European Central Bank is expected to offer a package of measures to stimulate lending in the euro zone economy, including an interest-rate cut and a penalty rate for banks to park money in central bank vaults. But the central bank is not expected to introduce major asset purchases, which many economists say are needed to prevent deflation. Bank officials will make their decision after official inflation data for May and the unemployment figures for April come out on Tuesday. JACK EWING
DATA ON HIRING AND UNEMPLOYMENT
On Friday, the Labor Department will report on job creation and the unemployment rate in May. Economists polled ahead of the release are expecting to see a reasonably healthy gain of 218,000 in payrolls, with the unemployment rate rising by 0.1 percentage point, to 6.4 percent, as more people look for work. But these numbers have been volatile of late. A surprisingly weak showing at the beginning of 2014 was followed by a strong pickup, so Wall Street will be watching the labor market. NELSON D.

Full text:   STANFORD, Calif. -- The combination of a persistently weak labor market and evidence of a little more inflation is prompting an increasingly vigorous debate among Federal Reserve officials about the future of the central bank's stimulus campaign.
The debate reflects both the stability of current Fed policy, which is essentially on autopilot until autumn as the central bank winds down its bond-buying campaign, and the considerable uncertainty about what the Fed should do next -- and how.
The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies have emphasized the need to remain focused on job creation. But other officials and economists, many of whom gathered this week at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University to discuss their concerns, want the central bank to start raising interest rates more quickly.
"I would like to see short-term interest rates move higher in response to improving economic conditions shortly after completion of the taper," Esther L. George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in a speech Thursday night.
Investors are watching as officials hammer out the critical details of those plans, and are nervously awaiting the continuation of a retreat unfolding on a scale just as grand as the construction of the stimulus campaign over the last half-decade -- and with a similar potential to create significant disruptions in global financial markets.
"When looking ahead to the exit plan, the Fed will need to remember the wisdom of Mike Tyson," Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."
Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, but it has increased in recent months, in line with the forecasts of Fed officials.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that prices rose 1.6 percent during the 12 months ending in April. A version of the same measure regarded as more predictive because it excludes volatile food and energy prices rose 1.4 percent. Both measures had hovered closer to annual rates of 1 percent during the previous year.
After months of fretting publicly that prices were rising too slowly, the authors of the Fed's campaign have shifted to insisting that prices are not rising too quickly.
"I see little prospect of inflation climbing sharply over the next year or two," William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a recent speech. "There still are considerable margins of excess capacity available in the economy, especially in the labor market, that should moderate price pressures."
Mr. Dudley said wages, in particular, were rising much more slowly than the historical average, about 2 percent a year rather than about 3.5 percent a year.
Other Fed officials appear more apprehensive. Loretta J. Mester, who will become president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland on Sunday, said in an inaugural speech on Friday that standard measures may underestimate inflation. Ms. Mester will be one of nine voting members of the Fed's policy-making committee this year.
An alternate measure, she said, "paints a more benign view of recent inflation, one that could have implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy."
The combination of low inflation and high unemployment has simplified Fed policy debates in recent years. Easy money is the answer to both problems. If inflation strengthens, however, the Fed could find itself on the horns of a dilemma.
Millions of Americans remain unable to find full-time work, a crisis only partly reflected by the unemployment rate, which fell to 6.3 percent in April. The number of people working part-time jobs, or who have stopped looking for work because they cannot find full time-jobs, may now be nearly twice as large as the excess in the Americans actively looking for work and therefore counted as unemployed.
Inflation is generally restrained by unemployment, because workers demanding pay increases are easily replaced. But some researchers see evidence that long-term unemployment may not exert the same pressure on wages. That could force a choice between dialing back stimulus prematurely and accepting higher inflation.
In a paper published on Tuesday, John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said that under those conditions, the Fed should err on the side of encouraging job creation. "Optimal policy should trade off a transitory period of excessive inflation in order to bring the broader measure of underemployment to normal levels more quickly," Mr. Williams and a co-author wrote.
Ms. Yellen pushed for a similar approach in a much-discussed speech in 2012.
But Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and another participant at the Hoover conference, cautioned that a temporary increase could loosen the Fed's control. "That places a lot of weight on the credibility of your communications," Mr. Lacker said. "I'm not sure our communications are up to that."
Ms. George urged the Fed not to be deterred by volatility in financial markets as it raised interest rates. "Such pressures will need to be resisted," she said, warning that keeping rates low would encourage excessive risk-taking, while raising rates in a "stop and go" manner would cause unnecessary volatility.
Alongside the debate about what to do is a debate about how to do it. The Fed finds itself in need of new tools to influence economic conditions.
Before the crisis, the Fed raised and lowered borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by adjusting the "federal funds rate" banks must pay to obtain short-term loans. But demand for those loans has dwindled as the Fed has credited banks with trillions of dollars in reserves in payment for its bond purchases.
Officials see benefits in preserving the federal funds rate, because of its familiarity and its ubiquity in financial contracts. To raise borrowing costs as economic conditions improve, however, the Fed must also raise the cost of using the excess reserves.
The Fed is not planning to rely on selling bonds to reverse the buildup; it could take a long time to sell that many bonds without disrupting financial markets. Instead, the Fed is discussing raising the interest rate banks are paid on the reserves, and to tie up reserves with contracts called reverse repurchase agreements.

Full text:   SINTRA, Portugal -- The European Central Bank was basically intended to do one thing: keep inflation in a cage. But its mission has turned out to be a lot more complicated than that.
That was the challenge facing an elite group of policy makers and economists gathered this week at a golf resort here outside Lisbon to brainstorm about how the central bank can combat the euro zone's continuing economic problems with only a limited arsenal and a dwindling supply of ammunition.
The question has become more urgent in light of a growing recognition -- acknowledged on Monday in perhaps the frankest terms yet by Mario Draghi, the bank's president -- that the euro zone is at risk of sliding into deflation, a downward price spiral that can ultimately destroy corporate profits and the ability of businesses to hire.
The deflation danger comes amid a credit crisis, a persistent banking problem and a citizenry angry at the slow pace of recovery, as gains by anti-euro political parties in elections to the European Parliament have vividly demonstrated.
Expectations run high that the central bank will take some sort of action when its governing council meets on June 5. The annual inflation rate, at 0.7 percent, remains well below the central bank's target of close to 2 percent. But what the officials will do next week is still something of a mystery, and many economists question whether new measures would have any meaningful impact, given that the bank has already cut its benchmark interest rate close to zero.
Mr. Draghi said in unusually direct terms on Monday that there was a risk the euro zone could become caught in the trap of falling prices, a "classic deflationary cycle" that would require large-scale purchases of bonds or other assets to reverse. The statement may have been part of an attempt by Mr. Draghi to prepare the ground for controversial and exceptional measures.
"What we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries," Mr. Draghi said in a speech that opened the two-day conference.
But Mr. Draghi also said there was still doubt about whether deflation was on the horizon. And he indicated that members of the bank's governing council, many of whom are also at the conference, were still debating what would be the right response to a combination of falling prices, tight bank credit and uneven growth.
The conference, a first-time event modeled on a similar gathering organized annually in Jackson Hole, Wyo., by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is partly an attempt to tap the collective wisdom of leading economists. The conference has been in the works for months, so the timing just before what now looms as a crucial meeting for the bank is a coincidence. But as a result, it has turned out to be a less-relaxed exchange of views than organizers had imagined.
"Our ability to detach from the pressures of the moment has been less than we thought," Mr. Draghi said somewhat ruefully.
The specter of deflation threatens to undermine the weak economic recovery in the euro zone. Although some crisis-plagued countries, like Spain, are growing again, unemployment remains at 11.8 percent in the euro zone, just below a record high. Many other countries, most notably Italy, are still in recession and have only just begun the work of making their economies more competitive.
Despite its limitations, the central bank has the advantage of being the one euro zone institution able to move quickly.
"We always look at central bankers and say, 'Can you fix it?"' Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup organization of finance ministers, said during a panel discussion on Monday. " 'Put some cheap money out there.' But when you look at the situation, there is no quick fix."
Speakers at the conference offered no immediate solutions. On the contrary, some fretted that additional powers already granted to the central bank are flawed. For example, they raised questions about its new role as a bank supervisor in the euro zone's so-called banking union, which gives it more tools to clean up the banking system.
Yet Martin Hellwig, director of the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn and an influential economist, said the central bank still did not have all the tools it needed to deal with failed commercial banks. "That is the elephant in the room," Mr. Hellwig said. "We need a viable resolution regime and we don't have it."
Expectations that the bank will take some form of action on June 5 have been raised by a flurry of statements in recent weeks by Mr. Draghi and by other members of the governing council indicating that they were prepared to take further steps to stimulate the euro zone economy.
Deflation, which has afflicted Japan for years, is considered particularly pernicious because once it sets in, it is difficult for policy makers to reverse. Expectations of falling prices cause people to delay big purchases, which in turn undercuts corporate profits and makes businesses reluctant to hire.
A "too prolonged" period of inflation below current expectations, Mr. Draghi said, "would call for a more expansionary stance, which would be the context for a broad-based asset purchase program."
Many economists have urged the central bank to emulate the United States Federal Reserve and buy large quantities of government bonds and other assets to pump money into the economy.
But most analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to announce asset purchases when the council meets next week. More likely, analysts say, would be a cut of the benchmark interest rate to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent, coupled with a so-called negative deposit rate that would charge lenders for parking money at the central bank.
A negative deposit rate would tend to push down the value of the euro against the dollar and other currencies, because investors would earn little or no return on euros. In his speech on Monday, Mr. Draghi said the increase in the euro's value against the dollar since 2011 had driven down the price of commodities like fuel in euro terms, contributing to low inflation.
Mr. Draghi also hinted that the central bank might take steps to encourage banks to lend more. He cited data showing that even profitable companies in Spain and Portugal have trouble getting bank loans. A quarter of Spanish firms and one-third of Portuguese firms face credit constraints, Mr. Draghi said, compared with only 1 percent in Germany and Austria.
There has been speculation that the European Central Bank might issue cheap loans to euro zone banks, with strings attached to ensure they lend the money to businesses rather than invest in government bonds, as has happened in the past.
The governing council is still debating what action to take, Mr. Draghi indicated. But all the members -- the central bank governors of the 18 countries in the euro zone and the six members of the central bank's executive board -- agree that inflation is too low, he said.
"There is no debate about our goal," Mr. Draghi said, "which is to return inflation toward 2 percent in the medium term."

Abstract: Even the markets that have experienced huge price increases are far from the clear-cut bubble conditions of the mid-2000s, but they're inching closer with every bidding war. Since the start of 2011, prices have risen 33 percent in the San Francisco area, 30 percent in Miami, 24 percent in Los Angeles -- and even more in some of the most desirable neighborhoods within those areas.

Full text:   Billy Gasparino and Jenna Dillon-Gasparino were savvy enough to wait out the housing boom of a decade ago as renters. Not until 2010, well into the bust, did they buy a house in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, less than a mile from the beach, for $810,000.
Only four years later, the couple see new signs of excess in the housing market and have decided to go back to renting. They are close to a deal to sell their house -- for $1.35 million, a cool 67 percent gain.
"It just seems like the housing market came back so strongly, so fast, that maybe there's a little bit of a bubble there," said Mr. Gasparino, 37, an executive with the San Diego Padres.
Their decision reflects a new reality in many of the nation's largest metropolitan areas. An analysis by The New York Times finds that in the country's most expensive places, including New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, buying a home again looks like a perilous investment, based on the relationship between their prices and rents or incomes. And in a longer list of areas, including Boston, Miami and Washington, prices have risen enough that buying is no longer the bargain it looked to be a few years ago.
The Times also created an online calculator that enables prospective buyers and renters to analyze their own decision. For example, for a typical person considering the purchase of a $500,000 house who expects to live there seven years, it might make more sense to rent if a similar place is available for $1,956 a month or less.
"A lot of these coastal markets look overvalued compared to rents," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "In these markets, it seems generally more attractive to rent than to buy, even as the national market is broadly well balanced."
For example, Venice, where the Gasparinos are selling their house, has benefited from an influx of tech industry, including from the opening of Google's Los Angeles office there in 2011. "You have engineers, visual effects artists, people making 2, 3, 400 thousand dollars a year coming in," said Tami Pardee, principal of Pardee Properties real estate brokerage in Venice. "The problem I'm having is inventory. There isn't enough of it."
Thanks to low interest rates and home prices that remain 13 percent below their 2006 peak nationally, buying continues to look like a good deal in much of the country. In the once-frothy markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., for example, the typical home price is still 30 to 40 percent below 2006 levels, even more if one accounts for inflation.
But across much of California and the Northeast, prices are now high enough that the costs of owning a home -- property taxes, repairs, fees to real-estate agents and mortgage interest -- may outweigh the financial benefits, including the tax break.
It is the latest change in a yo-yo pattern over the past decade. From 2004 to 2006, the math overwhelmingly favored renting rather than buying across most of the country, even as many Americans mistakenly decided that home prices could never fall. From 2009 to 2011, buying was an extraordinary deal in most of the country. Even the markets that have experienced huge price increases are far from the clear-cut bubble conditions of the mid-2000s, but they're inching closer with every bidding war.
Since the start of 2011, prices have risen 33 percent in the San Francisco area, 30 percent in Miami, 24 percent in Los Angeles -- and even more in some of the most desirable neighborhoods within those areas.
In the San Francisco Bay Area, home of the sharpest recent price increases, the sale price of a home is about 20 times what it would cost to rent a home of the same size for a year. That ratio, based on an analysis of data from Zillow, is the same as in 2003, when the San Francisco real estate market had yet to become an out-of-control bubble but was well on its way there.
When low mortgage rates are taken into account, buying a home in San Francisco looks somewhat more attractive -- but with a 10 percent down payment and prevailing interest rates, buying a home is 6 percent more expensive than renting a place of the same size, the same premium for buying as there was during the dot-com boom in 1999. Just two years ago, buying in the San Francisco area was 24 percent cheaper than renting an equivalent place.
The potentially overvalued markets are the result of three forces. They are taking place in local economies that suffered only minimally during the recession that began in 2008 and have experienced strong job growth since then.
They are fueled further by the low-interest rate policies that are aimed at bolstering the overall national economy but don't discriminate based on geography. Even as San Francisco's housing market is at risk of overheating, buyers there get the same ultralow mortgage rates engineered by the Federal Reserve as home buyers in depressed Detroit or Cleveland do.
And the new booms are taking place in markets where restrictions on building hinder developers from responding to rising demand by constructing more housing. That distinguishes the major California markets from the strong local economies in Texas and elsewhere. The Dallas area and the San Francisco area added similar numbers of jobs last year, but local governments in Dallas issued permits for nearly four times as many new housing units.
There are important caveats, of course. The wisdom of buying versus renting depends heavily on each person's financial situation, plans and preferences. And the cliché about all real estate being local holds; each neighborhood can have its own unique dynamics in the for-sale and for-rent housing sectors that must be considered.
Home buyers in even the highest-price markets can take some solace in the fact that prices aren't as outlandishly high relative to rents as they were in 2006. But they should also know that homes are also priced richly enough to leave no room for error.
It's a bit like the current consensus opinion of economists on the value of the stock market: not in a bubble, necessarily, but certainly expensive enough to make a buyer wary. While home prices may stay high for months or years to come, buyers are leaving themselves vulnerable to a decline toward more normal historical valuations. Renters avoid that risk, even if they also don't get some of the upside if the bull market for houses in places like Santa Monica, Nob Hill and TriBeCa has longer to run.
"If you thought home values in the Bay Area or Southern California were such that we might see another housing correction, that radically starts to advantage rental housing," said Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, who argues that current prices are reasonably well justified, while acknowledging that prices are high enough to leave buyers exposed.
The real estate market in Venice, where the Gasparinos are selling their house to lock in the gains, shows the forces shaping the new boom markets. Besides the tech employment there on Silicon Beach, as the local boosters put it, the supply of housing can't expand to meet that rising demand. The area is filled with block after block of low-slung houses and apartments, and density restrictions stand in the way of constructing tall buildings.
That combination has been enough to send the median price per square foot of homes that are sold up 49 percent since late 2010 in the 90291 ZIP code, according to Zillow, and the median rent per square foot up 23 percent in the same span.
"When we bought four years ago after the crash, the market was dead, and it felt like everybody learned their lesson," Mr. Gasparino said. "It just went back so fast."

Full text:   SÃO PAULO, Brazil -- JBS, the world's biggest meat processor and owner of international brands like Pilgrim's Pride and Swift, has filed for an initial public offering of its Brazilian pork, poultry and food-processing operations.
The operations, to be spun off under the name JBS Foods, were responsible for about 10 percent of the parent company's more than $40 billion in revenue last year.
A person briefed on the matter said the company intended to raise about 4 billion reais, or $1.8 billion, all of which would be used to finance the company's growth.
The company's filing with Brazil's securities regulator, the C.V.M., did not give a date for the offering, but the person briefed on the matter said the company planned for it to take place between July and the end of September, depending on market conditions.
The filing said JBS Foods would be listed on the São Paulo stock market's highest corporate governance tier, the Novo Mercado, which requires a company to list at least 25 percent of its shares.
If the offering takes place, it would be only the second big equity offering in Brazil this year. The telecommunications company Oi raised $3.7 billion in April as part of its merger with Portugal Telecom, though the price per share was at the bottom of its target range.
Brazil's equity markets have suffered from a general loss of confidence in emerging markets and more specific concerns about sluggish growth, high inflation and government policy seen as excessively interventionist.
For JBS, the I.P.O. appears to be part of a larger restructuring. The company acquired the pork and poultry operations of its Brazilian rival Seara for $2.7 billion last year. These operations are now part of the unit to be spun off in the I.P.O.
Also last year, JBS bought the United States operations and some Canadian assets of the Canadian beef processor XL Foods for $100 million and the Brazilian food processor Massa Leve for about $118 million.
Future acquisitions appear likely.
"We have conditions to expand our processed food business," the chief executive of JBS, Wesley Batista, said last week. "We have the balance sheet to do it and we are actively looking for opportunities."
Itaú BBA will be the I.P.O.'s lead underwriter, with Bradesco BBI, BTG Pactual, Banco do Brasil, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and HSBC also serving as underwriters.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Abstract: At the April meeting, policy makers reviewed staff presentations that "outlined several approaches to raising short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so," the minutes said. "Because the Federal Reserve has not previously tightened the stance of policy while holding a large balance sheet, most participants judged that the committee should consider a range of options and be prepared to adjust the mix of its policy tools as warranted," the minutes said.

Full text:   Federal Reserve officials have gingerly begun to take on what will be their most difficult task over the next 12 to 24 months: determining how and when to gradually raise interest rates and return monetary policy to a more traditional path, even as they keep trillions in assets accumulated during the huge stimulus efforts of the last five years.
Officials at the central bank are not anywhere near a final decision on tactics and strategy, nor do they have a definite date in mind, although most experts expect them to take their first step in raising short-term interest rates in mid- to late 2015.
But the minutes of their meeting late last month, released on Wednesday, detail how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of representatives of the Fed's regional banks and the Washington-based Board of Governors, have begun grappling with lifting the interest rate that the Fed uses as its major policy tool from a current level close to zero.
"Obviously, it is still a work in progress," said Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "The market anticipated more detail."
Nonetheless, the minutes suggested that the process is well underway. "This discussion marks the beginning of the post-crisis era," he said. Mr. Hanson said that holding all those assets on the Fed balance sheet means huge reserves are sitting idle in the banking sector, which in turn makes it much more difficult to raise short-term rates using traditional tools when the Fed finally does decide the time is right to tighten monetary policy.
At the April meeting, policy makers reviewed staff presentations that "outlined several approaches to raising short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so," the minutes said.
"Because the Federal Reserve has not previously tightened the stance of policy while holding a large balance sheet, most participants judged that the committee should consider a range of options and be prepared to adjust the mix of its policy tools as warranted," the minutes said.
The central bank is keeping its options open on how to go about what is one of the most delicate tasks facing Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Fed.
"I think the minutes revealed that they don't know their game plan yet," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago and a longtime Fed watcher. "There are still a lot more questions than answers."
Even as signs are emerging this spring that economic growth is beginning to pick up after a very slow first quarter, the recovery remains fragile. And if rates rise more quickly than expected, there are fears inside and outside the Fed that the already-slowing housing sector could weaken further.
At the meeting on April 29 and 30, Fed officials were guardedly optimistic about an economic rebound, but remained concerned about weakness in the housing market and persistently low inflation, according to the record of their meeting.
They continued to unanimously support the gradual scaling back of monthly bond purchases aimed at stimulating the economy, in part because most officials said they believed economic growth "picked up recently, following a sharp slowdown during the winter due in part to unusually severe weather conditions."
At the same time, the minutes of the April meeting showed that the committee members were concerned that "inflation was running below the committee's longer-run objective and was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance."
Figures released last week indicated inflation might have increased in April to healthier levels not far from the Fed's 2 percent, but that data was not yet available when the policy makers met.
At the meeting, "most participants commented on the continued weakness in housing activity," citing factors like higher home prices, construction bottlenecks from a shortage of labor and harsh winter weather, as well as tight credit. The housing sector, which imploded in the years before the financial crisis and recession, has rebounded strongly in recent years, but those gains have been fading as borrowing rates for home buyers rose in the second half of 2013.
Over all, the minutes did not reveal any sharp change in strategy.
In a separate development, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Stanley Fischer, a longtime central banker, as a Fed board member. Mr. Fischer is to become Fed vice chairman after a second formal vote, expected soon, allowing him to take the job Ms. Yellen held before she became chairwoman.
The Fed has been operating short-handed as departures and the slow confirmation process left three vacancies on the seven-member board. Another governor, Jeremy C. Stein, is to step down next week. Lael Brainard, a former Treasury official, is also expected to win confirmation, but it is not clear when that vote will occur.
The next meeting of Fed policy makers is set for June 17 and 18.
